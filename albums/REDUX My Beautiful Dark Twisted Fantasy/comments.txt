He gave this album a 6 twice, so really he‚Äôs saying that this album is a 12. Thank you melon man
bro came back 10 years later to pull the same shit as last time üò≠
This review caused covid
redux review to give it the same score is still so beast
most of the comments haven&#39;t even watched the video, lol.<br><br>i don&#39;t give a shit if you like this album or not, i like it too and have a lot of great memories with it, but y&#39;all are acting like critics are supposed to support your opinion in order to not being mocked and joked about. why are y&#39;all so sensitive about what others think of your favourite things, that&#39;s childish as hell<br><br>i feel so sick of people trying to call Fantano &quot;biased&quot; while also being biased as fuck.<br><br>a bunch of fucking whiners that can&#39;t accept that a person can have an opinion that is different from yours while being just as valid and respectable without saying he just &quot;tries to be different&quot;, this is such a toxic way to think and yet people can&#39;t recognise it because they&#39;re so eager to tell you you&#39;re wrong.<br>Fantano understood the album better than most of it&#39;s fan base, told you about it&#39;s weak points and you just can&#39;t stop, this is ridiculous.
I am 4 years too late but I would argue that Runaway was never meant to be relatable. This album isn&#39;t supposed to be relatable. A lot of this album is Kanye admitting to all of the things people say he is but unapologetically admitting that he knows it&#39;s not really a good thing for everyone around him, but it&#39;s him and that&#39;s what he&#39;s going to be. The opening lines &quot;She found pictures in my emails, I sent this bitch a picture of my dick, I don&#39;t know what it is with females, but I&#39;m not too good at that shit.&quot; are so simple and stupid on purpose imo. He doesn&#39;t recognise these things as problems other than because of the fact  it causes an issue with his partner when he&#39;s caught and becomes an issue that affects his life directly. He thinks I just sent a picture of my dick why is it such a big deal, he doesn&#39;t understand women but also admits that he knows it is clearly hurtful. He doesn&#39;t have anything clever or introspective to say, he just sent a picture of his dick and got caught. So that&#39;s exactly how he describes it.<br><br>I&#39;m just talking out of my ass for an argument.
I disagree.
If this Album was called &quot;Hood&#39;s Hottest Dark Twisted Fantasy&quot; it would have atleast got an 8.
If Kanye called this album To Pimp A Dark Twisted Fantasy or Kids See My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy Fantano would give this an 11/10
I don&#39;t agree that it&#39;s a 6. Though, I do agree with some points. The vocoded voice thing does kinda suck, and a few of the tracks could be better. But this album is still a masterpiece and deserves around an 8
THIS A TEN üò§üò§üò§
It&#39;s not very easy to take the words of someone who called &quot;All of the Lights&quot; badly produced seriously
If it was called To Pimp a Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy this would be a 10
Typa shit where when you bring me the food bring me the fuckin check
I don&#39;t like how people aren&#39;t actually looking at these points critically instead taking the number alone into consideration--that being said fantano how are you going to hate on the nicki verse on Monster? That is a fucking crime.
YK its a Fantano review when the latest lackluster, short, calm Gorillaz album is higher than one of the best Kanye albums with very iconic songs
strong 5 to a light 6...
I do think this album is a little overrated like it‚Äôs my 3rd or 4th fav album personally but saying it‚Äôs a 6 is still outrageous üíÄüíÄüíÄ
10 - Dark Fantasy<br>9 - Gorgeous<br>10 - POWER<br>9 - All Of The Lights Interlude<br>10 - All Of The Lights<br>10 - Monster<br>8 - So Appalled<br>10 - Devil In A New Dress<br>10 - Runaway<br>8 - Hell Of A Life<br>6 - Blame Game<br>8 - Lost In The World<br>4 - Who Will Survive In America<br><br>for me, it‚Äôs a light to decent 9 because of the weaker tracks towards the end and the final track which i personally find to be a really dumb way to end the album
This means that the new Yeat album is better than this
Krubi??
wack
this was worse than the holocaust
My beautiful dark twisted fantasy is that Melon gives this a 10 in 2030. üòä
just came back here to see that you still gave it a score below 9
Dude is wasting 75% of his time crying about the artist lifestyle and not talking about the MUSIC
I&#39;m not even mad at this rating, because I genuinely don&#39;t understand how an album like could be in the &quot;5&quot; range. I can&#39;t even comprehend someone listening to the many heavy hitters of this album, and saying it&#39;s all mid.<br>I guessing this is some kind of bias/hate, or he only listened to blame game.
Im glad someone had the same impression of Runaway as me. After finishing the album and reading all the praise people had for that track I absolutely could not believe it. Goofy ahh chorus and horrid singing in general, and the THREE MINUTES of farting through a walkie talkie at the end did absolutely nothing for me. Though it did give me a good unintentional laugh
you are not a fantano you are fantasma üëª
If this was a Kendrick album melon would have wanked the shit out of it
So its as good as music to be murdered by? As a stan we take those
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=1310">21:50</a> Fuckery right here. No need to watch the full video.
To be a 8/10 or above Kanye needed just one word from Kendrick in any songsüíÄ(The life of pablo had one so it got good rating)
Melon showcases how human he is by being blatantly wrong not just once, twice.
I can never trust this guys Kanye reviews
Literally the best album ever bro
He‚Äôs so right on this album, past runaway are mid songs
Graduation is a better listen tbh
inside of me are two wolves: Cole from dissect and Anthony
Runaway is amazing and you can&#39;t convince me otherwise melon
This is why your wife left you
Bro, you are my hero for this.
If it was titled ‚ÄúMy Beautiful Hood Hottest Fantasies‚Äù you would‚Äôve given it an 8
If Sexyy Red made this album it would be a 10
kanye fans discover opinions
No I get it. I get it now. I listened to the album for the first time and I‚Äôd give it an 8. But I completely understand his reasonings for not liking it as much. He just cares about some things more than me.
I too give this album a 6 . Great in the first half, falls apart in the second half
If it was called &quot;to pimp a beautiful dark twisted fantasy&quot; you&#39;d give it a 10
12/10 is a weird album number
I think dude a virtue signaler and can‚Äôt handle Kanye being good to everybody but him
Cy-Hi has the best feature on So Appalled üíÄWhat drugs are you on?????
This guy is an absolute clownü§°ü§°
i can agree on his opinion on gorgeous but i still like the song
You shouldn&#39;t have an opion on music if you actually think My beautiful Dark fantasy is a 6
Worst take of the decade
6 on mbdtf and 8 on yeat, amazing!!
This is kanyes best work. Not always my favorite but its his masterpiece. And Nikki&#39;s verse was probably the best on the album but not because the album was below par but because she absolutely killed it.
Accounting for inflation, this is now a light 11. I‚Äôm glad Melon is not letting us down in these trying times.
I did not like this review, melon.
Listen to the way this mans speaks his opinion can‚Äôt be even taken seriously L take seek a therapist cuz clearly u r delusional
worst rating, or worst rating
fantano sometimes like he hates things that make no sense, I mean, why is the arpeggio bad in hell of a life? Furthermore, it is not a sex song, it is a satire of the romanticization of the lives of celebrities compared to the lives of porn actors, in runaway in the bars that you mentioned, Kanye&#39;s idea is to be ashamed, to admit that it is a Disgusting guy who is shit, and he says it with that unpleasant bar of sending photos of his penis, the verse that comes after Pusha T&#39;s is pretty good, the verse from Lost in the World is a poem that he dedicated to Kim, interpreted as Kim, is his &quot;salvation&quot; from this void he was in after everything that happened in his life but he knows how toxic this relationship can become since he knows what a disgusting person he is.
nice video
Delete your account brodi
Bro you need to open up your mind a lil bit this a perfect album an easy 10+ no skips either, your trippin
i disagree but i think this redux review is great honestly, the original review was when he was just starting out and he didnt really articulate his feelings all too well, this review helps him explain it much better and it&#39;s understandable even if i entirely disagree
This is the most delusional comment section ever, if he didn&#39;t said a rate it wouldn&#39;t be full of kid-spirited white spoiled hip-hop fans and RYM users
L rating
Gorgeous is my favourite song on the album
6/10 is a bit above average. Giving MBDTF a bit above average is wildüòÇ
One day he will understand good music, maybe next time in 2030
I‚Äôm finally listening to this album for the first time, not even finished with it yet and I still would already give it above a 6
A strong 5 to light 6 vs a light to decent 6 looooool. I agree I kind of like it less too
honestly gotta agree here
Thanks Melon for wasting my time
The funny thing is, all my life I ignorantly slept on Yeezy, only knowing and liking a few songs. Once Fantano sparked my curiosity, I ended up enjoying Dark Fantasy way more than I thought I would, and Yeezy is one of my favorite artists now. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt die, we multiple.‚Äù
sexy red vs mbdtf
IT IS A 10 YOU ARE CRAZY Y HJFGUYSAGFBYHSFHBYUFDGYSGYUTFSDGUYK
I hate you
This is a very thoughtful review, Anthony. Despite what the comments overwhelmingly say, I think your points were put much more admirably this time- and I still don‚Äôt agree with you on a lot of points! But what a boring world this would be if every big critic mindlessly fellated every single beloved album in existence.
I think its great that ,somehow, we live in a timeline where the only person in the entire world who dosent give mbdtf at least a 9/10 managed to start a successful review channel, you&#39;re the worlds most marginalized minority.
erguu lalar uulzhu gichii mn
it‚Äôs a light 8
Wish the dislike button still existed
is it just me or does he say good t hings about most of the songs then give it a 5?
Power might be my personal favorite kanye song but you are smoking something if you think the last 1/3rd of runaway shouldn&#39;t  have been cut. Who honestly enjoys 3 minutes of a couple piano notes with overly distorted vocals?
Fantano has only grown 800k in the 4 years since... I attribute this to the idea that for every 3 subscribers he receives, 2 find his original MBDTF review, one unsubs then, the other, after this video.
If it was called Kids see dark fantasies you would have given it a ten
white af
This take is horrible. Worst take I&#39;ve seen from you or from anyone. I might hang myself in my room and just write the link of this horrible, deplorable ranking of the greatest rap album of all time as my entire suicide note. Im not suicidal in the slightest, but watching this horrible, disgusting, repulsing, garbage review has made me closer to that than when my own relatives die. As the biggest music nerd to walk the planet, you give raps magnum opus a mere 6/10. This can&#39;t be healthy behavior, you should attend hours and hours of therapy forr this take. You should be chained up in a bunker, forced to only listen to this album on repeat, with that being the only sound you hear. And when you get out of the bunker, the songs never escape your mind and they forever replay over and over again and everything just sounds like MBDTF to you for the rest of your life for this deplorable take. I hope when you sleep, your pillow is warm, you get crabs overnight, you&#39;ll feel so appalled when you wake up and see you have crabs you pass out and wake up in a dystopian world where you never get to hear the peep or sound of music again. I thought i could trust you fantano, you know more about music than i do and you&#39;re too blind to realize you found gold. Your brain should be experimented on for this idea in your mind that this album is anything less than a 10/10. You&#39;re a lab experiment with one mission that is to have the worst MBDTF take of all time. Even bone marrow babies can realize this album is beautiful, hense the album name. And not even youd can realize that, you must&#39;ve been forced into deep monkey sex unwillingly and full of unenjoyment when you listened to this so you have so much PTSD when you listen to this that you dont like it that much. To explain everything said in this essay of a comment: I don&#39;t really like that take
ur worst review so far
If this is a 6 then i have to see whats a 7 because frankly i think he&#39;s just tring to be different. Honestly I made 6 different accounts just to dislike this video.
How do you praise Jay-Z&#39;s awful verse on Monster while bashing Nicki&#39;s greatest verse? And putting it below Donda, you&#39;ve gotta be kidding me. This review is a huge L
his whole career is based on being a contrarian le redditor . lol grow some hair fantanamo
Damn bro you are to harsh on this album
To me this review feels more like a classic review than a typical Fantano review, which is what I think the album deserves as supposed to a numeral rating. The impact this album left on pop culture, the future of music, and the careers that were made because of it need to be acknowledged
imagine the alternate universe where fantano still gives MBDTF a 6, but his ranking is out of 5 instead 10‚Ä¶
never review again üî•
<b>BUZZER SOUND</b> WRONG
genuinely cannot fathom that an album with dark fantasy, runaway, power, all of the lights, devil in a new dress and lost in the world gets a 6, its impossible
6 out of 5 stars! Turley an amazing album
So let me get this straight, he gave for all the dogs and freaking my beautiful dark twisted fantasy the same rating?
Melon hurts my soul, bro gives my personal fav album of all time a 6 twice
8-9 more 9
9/10 at the very very least
Every song except Lost in the world is amazing imo
Fantano completely missed the point of the chris rock sketch lol. I listened to a podcast talking all about MBDTF once and what it said about that sketch was really interesting and gives it very new meaning
Honestly I agree with almost all the points on this.  Always found this album to be extremely dissapointing for how much hype it has.  It feels like he had a really good idea but just executed it poorly, definitely not bad though
Shut up geek
you will never reach heaven
To be fair, he is giving some really good points as to why he is giving it a 6
Some of the songs on it are insanely good. But as an album it‚Äôs definitely below an 8. But not as low as a 6.
The vocoder solo on runaway is one of the most beautiful things I&#39;ve ever heard
Lyricism isn‚Äôt just talking about oppression terrible review
This video just isnt the same without the dislike button
If Sexxy Red made this you would&#39;ve given a 10
Reliatened to it for the first time in 4 years today and man, it‚Äôs an 8.  This is only my 3rd time listening to this album all the way through and I didn‚Äôt really get into Kanye until TLOP when I was in High School so make that what you will
i agree with literally 90% of all the criticisms you have, still love it though, (not that you were saying people shouldnt love it), 8/10 from me
ngl id give this a high 8 or a low 9, its pretty good but overrated. this album has quite a bit of obvious flaws, yet people STILL have the nerve to say that its a 10/10 and that its kanyes best lmao
brooo I love hell of a life also ur wrong
thank you fantano, your review represents the deaf comunnity and its love for musicüëèüëè‚ù§Ô∏è
Fantano clearly has never had a Blame Game relationship. And I wish I didnt either. I give his review a 3/10 (mbdtf obvi gets a 10)
Cant wait for 2030 and another 6
This album isn&#39;t over-rated. You&#39;re over-rated.
idk why people hype this album up is nothing special just overatted üíÄ
Its realy overated
You still have time to right your wrongs, starting with this one
Common Fantano L, music reviewers are a dumb idea as art is subjective
I love how bareback georgous is and that the focus is on Kanye just rapping. And he spits fire
hatin on nikis verse is crazy
Video is not loading, but I really hope that he gave this Album who some consider one of Hip-Hops greatest Albums a good rating!
How does this man hate all of the lights? This nigga is crazy.
IMO Gorgeous isn&#39;t too long and Hell of a Life isn&#39;t that bad, but other than that this review is 1000% correct. Giving this anything above a 7 is an insult to Dropout and Late Registration.
sinful
IMO this is a 7/8 album, i mean its sound great, have the best samples of kanye and best song in his career in this record but its not like Best Album Of All Time and its not best Kanye Album, i think lyrics are kinda weird and not so good but the sound and production is too god and runaway had me in another planet man, a great innovation in sound on music history
This guy doesn&#39;t get it.
RICK ROSS NOT MINDBLOWNING??!!?!?!!!?
I think if the album was finished after Runaway, the album would be a near-perfect
My man really said I don&#39;t care for runaway
This is 100/10 albuns
This is like when the second plane hit the south tower.
Half of his critiques are the whole point of the songs. The runaway outro is supposed to sound too long. The Chris Rock sketch on blame game is supposed to make you feel uncomfortable. He critiques these as if they aren&#39;t entirely intentional
mbdtf &gt;&gt; any kendrick album<br><br>runaway &gt; any kendrick song<br><br>kanye &gt; kendrick
Ngl if you follow this guy for music recomendation. Your wrong tbh. Mans got no taste in music in general. Idc he can talk bout the doors pink floyd cudi Ye outkast biggie venom metallica whatever. You cant expect that much from this melon head that looks like my left nut when i shave it
a 10 for kids seeghost but a 6 fo mbdtf
Saw a 6 then figured my phone must be upside down so I fixed it,thanks for the 9 melon.üéâ
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=989">16:29</a> FINALLY, SOMEONE AGREES WITH MY TAKE ON RUNAWAY, I love the song in all respect but some of the lines in the song just feel like they take you out of the emotion of the song, like you&#39;ll be depressed listening to the song and get the value of the song and then you&#39;ll have some cheesy &quot;Kanye Charm&quot; shoved in there and it just doesn&#39;t work
but this album is a 10
I don‚Äôt criticize many people for having an opinion, but to purposely troll your fans and re-review your most controversial video, to just conclude with the same exact stance is a bit of a punch in the face. There was no reason to make another review if your opinion didn‚Äôt change.
I‚Äôm just wondering how 66k ppl liked this
get a life geek!
So this alboum is tge same level as music to be murderd by? Cool to know lmao
i have still never forgiven this
ü§ì
L video, L guy
Runaway not being relatable is actually bonkers bro. It is FOR sure a relatable song
calling rick ross‚Äô feature not mindblowing is actually insane bro, my favorite rap verse ever
Never forgive the man who sold the world<br><br><br>and the man who said that All of the lights is shitty
You should be banned from expressing an opinion ever again
Actually agree this album is mid af and idk why people think it‚Äôs so great. Power Is mid. Run away is mid. It‚Äôs all painfully mid. 5/10
this review started strong but ended weak as fuck, you were doing good till you got to runaway melon boy
Fantano talks about how critics ‚ÄújUsT dIdNt UnDeRsTaNd KaNyEs GeNiUs aT tHe TiMe oF rElEaSe‚Äù  but neither has he, until recently.
Am I the only one that agrees with this man? üò≠
It‚Äôs the most overrated album ever, and I like this album.
A 6/1
I only started watching this channel yesterday... and people, 6 isn&#39;t even a bad score
People act like he hates the album, he likes the tracks that everyone loves, he just points out the ones everyone ignores
Worst opinion ever
drake said it, &quot;you scared of the six, six, six, six&quot;
One of the only times I will agree with Melon head on any music takes. This album is solid but not generational
Dude Chris is the epic part of blame game .. for fuck sake
Jesus Christ Nikki had one of the best versus on that song.. dude I would love to debate with this dude bc he‚Äôs saying some wild things ..
All of the lights is a masterpiece..
If you‚Äôre gonna say all of the lights isn‚Äôt an incredible song I‚Äôm going to have to ask you to reconsider your career brother ..
Anthony brother the headless horseman decapitated people in the town of sleepy hollow.. and kept the beads for himself.. Jesus watch the movie..
he hates this album
That&#39;s why i hate this man he has trash ears
Finishes super weak üòÖ Runaway, Hell of a Life, Blame Game, Lost in the world are all great.
Worst opinion I‚Äôve heard üò≠üò≠
Bruh how could anyone not like the instrumental on gorgeous
good rating, naver rate again
Am I the only one who agrees with many of his points but I just can NOT get behind the score?
Nicki&#39;s verse is one of the best features of the decade in my opinion and I don&#39;t even mess with her music too much
No es un mal momento para recordaros que MBDTF&gt;TPAB
Strongly agreable... Overated with annoying singing performances from Ye.
I love watching people hating on MBDTF in the comments. You guys must live some boring life to hate the greatest album of the last 20 years.
He should make an album and let‚Äôs see if it‚Äôs better than My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy
Keep in mind, this is the same guy that gave the barbie album a decent 6
Spent like 80% of the video talking about how bad of a person Kanye west is and 20% actually reviewing the songs .
Wtf melon??!!
Bro really said utopia is better than this üíÄ
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=380">6:20</a> Thank god, I&#39;m not alone in this world
I want you to think about one thing. How many of the viewers of this channel listen to music more than Melon?„ÄÄSince one of the most music-listening men in the world gave the rating, I don&#39;t think it matters much how passionate the others are about it. Music cannot be quantitatively evaluated.
Hes still completely right about this, this album is overrated as fuck

The Runaway distorted outro is beautiful men.
HE CANT KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH THIS
Cabeza de poronga, hace la review del disco de Charly Kill Gil.
MAGA Red üòÆ cover
nuh uh
I didn‚Äôt remember this being so terrible
barbie album not better than this
No way he said power was the best on the track listüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ
This is more painful than a high school presentation
For creativity and boldness it‚Äôs a ten. I love it when an artist is making something without worrying about how it will be received I think an authenticity shines through.
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a 6, but I do agree that it&#39;s a heavily overrated album. I personally gave it a 9, but barely. I think people who give it a &quot;10/10! Best hip-hop album of all times&quot; are kinda trippin. A 10/10 shouldn&#39;t have some mid songs like mbdtf does.
He gave Yeat‚Äôs Afterlyfe a 7 and this a 6, I always knew Yeat was better than Kanye!
I agree and that is it
Runaway is a flawless song. The &quot;cringe&quot; lyrics make the song feel so authentic and the singing is good.
Fantano doesn&#39;t understand the point of the songs and the album as a whole
Fantano lore pt 2
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=990">16:30</a> so yeah you complitely didnt understand runaway
Try not to sound like a douchebag (impossible)
the vocal mixes on a lot of songs are straight up bad
did he say all of the lights is ass?
ok but like, whats your beautiful dark twisted fantasy like?
I agreed with some of the initial criticisms (All of The Lights  = overrated) , but eventually it just got lazy. &quot;When you read these lyrics without listening to the music they don&#39;t make a lot of sense&quot; yeah you can apply that to virtually any musical piece composed ever. The &quot;cringe&quot; in Runaway is a key part of its authenticity. Nicki Minaj verse in monster is meant to be aggressive and not entirely sensical, and it works.  Lost in the World is a beautiful, haunting song that can transport you to another world. I&#39;m not entirely sure why Kanye picked the outro that he did but sonically speaking, it fits well into the album, and keeps you engaged. Fontano going &quot;I don&#39;t get it it&#39;s not about race&quot; just reeks of a teenage Redditor trying to take everything at face value and not enjoying the sound of the music or looking into it on a deeper level.
Am I the only one who likes everysong on this album except runaway? I try to like it and i listened to it over 20 times but I still dont like it
how did you give this album the same score as you did 10 years ago
Me ‚ÄúI like an album, Anthony must at least think it‚Äôs okay‚Äù<br><br>This mf ‚Äúon tracks 3,4,6,11, and 12 you can hear that the drums in the instrumental are a little more dull than the rest‚Äù üò≠
I honestly don&#39;t know what people see in kanye. He&#39;s not a genius, he&#39;s has mildly clever word play and VERY plebian social commentary. His similes are so basic and childish, he&#39;s a nutcase and an uneducated idiot who thinks he has a hot take on things. Dudes in middle school, while the real geniuses like jedi mind tricks, immortal technique, mf doom, Ghostface, Del... these mfs graduated and got their doctorate, it&#39;s so painfully obvious man. Let this bitch fizzle out like the embarrassment he is
Mbdtf  = 6<br>Lil Pump= 7 <br>Anthony factsüë¥üèª
do it again
Damn I do not agree but bro valid
One day you will be able to appreciate this masterpiece.
And a villain was born.
I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that melon might need to take some shrooms (like 8 grams or so)  and then give this album a listen
im with ya melon. not exactly my fav kanye album. or second favorite. or third favorite. maybe fourth maybe  possibly
I know everyone has already said this, but I appreciate how much more detailed he is with his thoughts in this review compared to the original where his criticisms were ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like the hooks‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not interested in Kanye‚Äôs personal life.‚Äù It really shows his growth as a reviewer.
Some people shouldn‚Äôt have rights to their own opinion
Huuhhh
Why don‚Äôt you make music Anthony
Kanye west is corny, overrated, and a terrible writer. 3/10
He is not reviewin this like other albums. He usually goes &quot;and the young thug verse goes hard&quot; now he is picking every verse and finding something he doesnt love. I kinda get it, Kanye has set his bar so high. But you talking about things that dont really add anything to the track or one rhyme that isnt that clever. Never seen you do that to kendrick for example, i know for a fact that every bar from everyone on every kenny album isnt perfection. I just think he needs to defend his 6 very hard and picks pointless things to criticize.
as someone who thinks mbdtf is one of kanye‚Äôs best albums, y‚Äôall need to chill tf out and stop hating on someone for having an opinion that goes against the grain. anthony‚Äôs criticisms, especially the criticisms on a moral basis such as his criticisms of all of the lights, were extremely valid even if you disagree with them. the point of music is that we all have different opinions and there‚Äôs nothing unanimously praised or hated so just chill lmfao
Fantano... ya buggin
i turn the 6 upside down its a 9 now
Fuck u Fantano‚ù§<br>Gorgeous  is top 5 kanye <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=397">6:37</a>
The sleepy hollow bar was a reference to the movie, which has a tree full of heads
Nah i just listened to the album for the 1st time and I feel him. It was disappointing.
nah man youre just being a hater
I&#39;ve always just been creeped out by Kanye through his music.  He is a maniac.  He would kill a person for fun.  His mind is frightening.  His misogyny is insistent, omnipresent, and earnest in almost every verse.  That he became what he became validates how I&#39;ve felt since I met Kanye&#39;s art thru Gold Digger.  The whole Taylor Swift thing, strategic abuse of a 19 yr old girl, everything.  <br><br>This man is made of envy-- racial envy, status envy-- and he&#39;s a serial killer in spirit, if not in fact.  His surface level competency belies the fact that he&#39;s a borderline-illiterate creepy dude who is so without empathy he could never make great art.  His impact has been to help make very obviously creepy people seem &quot;cool&quot; in mass culture.  Culture&#39;s blindness to what a toenail-eating freak this man is, is the same thing that has allowed piss-jar-saving characters like Elon Musk to fly under the radar while living their best eugenics life and breeding dozens of children.  <br><br>I wish we had more empathy in culture.  Kanye has never in his career passed the smell test.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=718">11:58</a> just do it
ur crazy
your just wrong
Okay, but at least you didn‚Äôt give MBDTF a 6
Rapping sucks but the entire album sounds amazing
It&#39;s great to see a thoughtful well rounded reviewer giving an honest opinion about an album.
roh t9wd
the fact that this video has 2 million visits but only 64k likes
The problem here is he listens to it one or twice for me I had to listen to it 4 times to really love it and appreciate it as much as I do now
So glad Fantano is making another review catering towards the deaf community! Someday I would like to see him make a review of this album for people who can hear though.
Honestly melon is right. It‚Äôs a bit overrated, still <br>The first 4 tracks are phenomenal, devil in a new dress and runaway are cool but honestly that‚Äôs it<br>When u compare this album with Tpab it ain‚Äôt even close
Terrible review. But great willpower to not just fold under pressure‚Ä¶ still a shit review.
10/10 no doubt. zero misses
Easily the part that pisses me of most from the review is Hell of a Life. It isn‚Äôt supposed to be sexy. If it was supposed to be sexy it would‚Äôve sounded like folding clothes. The way I see it Hell of a life is supposed to be appalling and make you feel dirty inside. Kanye‚Äôs need for sex and the things he does with others are not supposed to be sexy. It‚Äôs disgusting and perhaps even shameful. If the track is getting anyone going it‚Äôs in a very dirty, ‚Äúwrong but I like it‚Äù way, like having drunk sex with your ex in a bar restroom. The only way I feel this song falls flat is that it doesn‚Äôt go hard enough with the filthy depictions of sex and desires.
I still think this album is a 10/10, but I completely understand your complaints, even though I disagree with most of them. This album makes me feel like fame is the best and worst thing that could ever happen to a person.
I&#39;d say 7, High highs, pretty low lows
its one of the best albums ever made
Might get hate for this, but this is actually one of few Fantano reviews I actually agree with
imo is a 6, he‚Äôs right
how he rated that dogshit album damn more than this masterpiece is crazy to me, its like bro&#39;s stirring controversy for the sake of it and to get more attention
Ok but I feel like his points on AOTL are kinda valid, the way he raps abt domestic abuse shit is problematic to say the least
Fantano really thinks Life of Pablo, Ye, and Donda are all better than this album.
What he said about ALL OF THE LIGHTS should have him locked up in Azkaban
you&#39;re gonna give Jay Z a pass for that monster verse?<br><br>and so appalled was your front runner?!<br><br>melon, baby...
That Nicki accent is horrible is like somebody told her it was funny but we all know it‚Äôs shit üòÇ
This album is definitely a 5 or 6
This guy definitely has not seen the all of the lights music video with Kanye stomping around on a cop car
THE <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=1234">20:34</a> ! THE <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=1234">20:34</a> IS REAL!
Overall, in my opinion, to put this review in a word: &quot;ass&quot;. I&#39;m feeling a strong 5 to a light 6 on this one.
Depending on the whitebalance, his shirt color is white and gold, not black and blue üòâ
100/10
10*
I have watched this video 233 times and have came to the conclusion that Anthony is straight up lying
Melon‚Äôs too young to understand this album
This album is terrible 0/10
9/11 of music reviews
Your critique of LITW is laughable‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs simple because it‚Äôs a poem he wrote to Kim. It‚Äôs not supposed to be super deep. The deep parts is in the chorus singing. Those lyrics give the story. The poem is simply an addendum to that and emphasizes it. It‚Äôs simple but beautiful. <br><br>You‚Äôre an idiot like usual.
Dude likes boring trash like TPAB but gives this a 6‚Ä¶ the greatest hip hop album a 6ü§£<br><br>Whoever takes this dude seriously, I pity you man.
Cl ive always agreed w this
The sheep calling this album a 10.. Even if every single song aside from Hell Of A Life was a masterpiece, this song alone would knock the rating down. Jesus, what pile of hot garbage.
Now he‚Äôs one of the most hated people in hip hop
MBDTF is a light 8/10<br>Edit: decent 7/10
The features on this album are great and were the top at the rap game at the time. This album shut down the streets when it released and is really influential.
Bro found the single good line in the Jay Z feature and then said that Nicki went too far..... nah
this album will forever be a light 6.
I totally agree with the gorgeous take. Gorgeous‚Äô beat just wasn‚Äôt enough for how deep cudis verse is. The lyrics are great, but I can‚Äôt let go and enjoy it. Monster is by far my favorite track tho
yeah at this point mr fantano you can have this one
nigga pls
This is peak Fantano here<br><br>That being said, he is still dead wrong on &#39;Hell of a Life&#39;... Couldn&#39;t give any less of a shit that it is his opinion üòÇ
This is album is bojack horseman‚Äôs soundtrack
The Waffle House has found it‚Äôs new host
does anyone else lowkey agree
Honestly pretty valid points overall<br><br>Dark Fantasy is flawless<br>Gorgeous is great but way too long<br>POWER is heavily overplayed<br>All of the Lights is a mess<br>Monster&#39;s alright<br><br>So Appalled is the only bit I really disagree with. &quot;If God had an Ipod, I&#39;d be up on his playlist,&quot; and &quot;The New Commandment: Thou shall not hate kid,&quot; are imo some of the best bars on So Appalled. I think it&#39;s one of the best songs on the album from front to back, even if you hate his feature.<br><br>Devil in a new dress is arguably a top 3 Kanye song<br><br>Runaway has me torn. On one hand, the iconic piano instrumental and the concept of the track. On the other, the 4 minutes of straight vocoded Kanye going &quot;OAWOOOooooooOoo&quot; for 3 minutes straight. If always stop it at 6 minutes regardless.<br><br>Hell of a Life is a song I get why people hate it, but I actually enjoy it. The sheer rawness of the track and the beat sounds off in a good way imo. You can also notice how Kanye never says &quot;Hell of a life&quot; he never pronounces the F in life, making the hook sound like &quot;Hell of a lie.&quot; Meaning that all these sexual fantasies are just distractions. It&#39;s not the deepest track, but I like that touch.<br><br>Blame Game has me skip the skit every time<br><br>And Lost in the World and who will survive in America are not in my rotation<br><br>Still I feel MBDTF is an album with HIGH high points and pretty low points. Off the strength of the highs though [DIAND, So Appalled, Runaway, DARK Fantasy, Gorgeous, and POWER], imo the album&#39;s an 8.
hes right
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=250">4:10</a>
√Ålbum of the century. Plain and simple
My beatiful dark twisted fantasy
Step 1 on how to get dislikes on a comment under a fantano video:<br><br>I agree
Mentioning reviewing this year 10 years from now has made me realise how much Kanye has fucked up his legacy.<br><br>What a waste
Strong 8
unbelievable how you decided to raise the score to a 9 due to recent comments by kanye mr. melon
This full album is perfect for a morning run. It‚Äôs a journey, loud and empowering.
Anthony it appears you accidentally uploaded the review from 2010 - if you could please upload the actual redux that would be much appreciated. Thank you
The size of this L is immeasurable
This review makes me want to say racial slurs üò°
Thank me later melon.<br><br>In this video, I&#39;m going to be giving my thoughts on Kanye West&#39;s 2010 album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. I&#39;ve been a fan of Kanye&#39;s for a long time, and I have to say, this album is simply incredible. It&#39;s one of those rare albums that just grabs hold of you from the first note and doesn&#39;t let go until the very end.<br><br>The production on this album is absolutely stunning, with Kanye bringing in a wide range of collaborators to help create the lush, layered soundscapes that make up the majority of the tracks on the album. From the soulful, gospel-infused opener &quot;Dark Fantasy&quot; to the hauntingly beautiful &quot;Lost in the World,&quot; the production on this album is top-notch. It&#39;s clear that Kanye put a lot of time and effort into crafting the sound of this album, and it really pays off.<br><br>But the production is only half of the story on this album. Kanye&#39;s lyrics on MBDTF are some of his most introspective and personal, as he grapples with his own ego and the trappings of fame. From the self-loathing on &quot;Runaway&quot; to the vulnerability on &quot;Blame Game,&quot; Kanye&#39;s lyrics on this album are powerful and deeply moving. He manages to strike the perfect balance between braggadocio and introspection, and the result is some of the most emotionally resonant music he&#39;s ever created.<br><br>Overall, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is an absolute masterpiece. It&#39;s the kind of album that comes around once in a generation, and it solidifies Kanye&#39;s place as one of the greatest artists of our time. It&#39;s an album that I know I&#39;ll be coming back to for years to come, and I can&#39;t recommend it enough. That&#39;s why I&#39;m giving it a strong 10. Thanks for watching, and be sure to leave a comment with your own thoughts on the album.
His biggest L
Is it still good or did you have a pang of consciousness now that Kanye is a big H fan? Because some of us who know a bit about music too, have known this was a bunch of infantile, mentally unwell musings on cheap bits of sythn drum and samples from people who actually are much closer to musical genius than Kanye ever was. IF you think or thought this was good, may I suggest trying literally any other genera than pop/rap for even a day? It sucked, it still sucks and screw the groupthink the ever made this guy famous.
Kanye always sucked. He did nothing for music in the grand scheme of things, and all his choices are corny
I am still in awe that someone can listen to an album with Runaway, Power, and Devil in a New Dress and think &quot;Yeah, this is a 6&quot;.
Waiting for the 0/10 redux redux review, melon.
Wtf is this
Literally facts bro it‚Äôs production is epic. It‚Äôs vocals and stuff is good. It had FLAWLESS MOMENTS, but to say it‚Äôs the best rap album ever or even Kanye best is kind of laughable. It feels empty and just too poppy. Not that classic Kanye feel and that‚Äôs okay, but it isn‚Äôt back to back to back greatness like ‚ÄúLate Registration‚Äù or some others.
To many Urkels line is actually a line Kanye got from tpain and Kanu actually clowned it
Why why fantano
Bro is allergic to good music üíÄ
Greatest album ever‚ÄºÔ∏è
How do you like so many things from the album but only bthink its a 6
I hate this review
he gave mudson mohawk&#39;s satin panthers a better score than MBDTF. he gave the album with cbat in it a higher rating than this album. think about that for a second.
I want to preface this by saying fuck Kanye (for his recent‚Ä¶ uhhh‚Ä¶ shenanigans)<br><br>Look, I get art is subjective and anyone can have whatever opinion on anything they like‚Ä¶ with that said there is no universe in which a respectable critic can give this ANYTHING below an 8, let alone a fucking 6. Some of the grandest tracks not just in Kanye‚Äôs discography but of all time, some of the deepest messages any album has ever put out, arguably the best production of all time, like there is no way you can rate this below an 8 without deciding beforehand you don‚Äôt want to like it, which I think is the case here. Fantano has a history of unfairly rating certain artists based almost purely on his opinions of them outside of music (which is made plainly obvious by him praising certain albums for certain things but when another artist does it he says it‚Äôs bad), and this is no different. I mean for crying out loud he said that All Of The Lights was a lowlight of the album despite it being arguably the best produced track in music history. He does the same thing with Eminem, and even though he rates his albums pretty high, he does the exact same thing with Denzel Curry. Anthony Fantano might be the worst music critic of all time, not because of his ratings themselves, but because of his insistence that he‚Äôs ranking things ‚Äúobjectively‚Äù when he is very clearly basing a large portion of his review on his preconceived notions of the artist. A true disgrace to music analysis.
Hell of a life is great
you‚Äôre different.
While watching this review my girlfriend says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like him. He looks like he‚Äôs made of poo poo.‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt defend you fantano...
I heard him say the vocoder vocals at the end of runaway were bad and my eye started twitching
On par with drake&#39;s new album&quot;her loss&quot; üòÇ
Just relistened to it yesterday, and I have to say that MBDTF is not even in my top 3 kanye albums. Not saying it&#39;s bad, but I don&#39;t get why this album is hailed as one of the best ever.
You know the Headless Horseman collects heads in Sleepy Hollow. Just sayin&#39;, that line is awesome
i agree with it being a 6, mid album
After runaway the quality dips slightly, but until runaway each track is up there with the greatest songs ever made üòÖ
you are still bald
One of your worst takes of all time
boooo
You should review MBDTF!
Can your score for this album get much higher?
THE ONE PIECE IS REAL
He can‚Äôt keep getting away with this
I really don&#39;t get why people tend to take Fantano&#39;s ratings so seriously. I mean the guy always says it:  &quot;he&#39;s a music nerd&quot;, not a musician or a rapper to be more specific. It means that his reviews do not come from a technical/expert point of view, but rather his own taste which is 100 percent subjective. For me, and I mean no disrespect to Fantano whatsoever, his opinion is as good as showing a friend of yours a Tupac album and it doesn&#39;t click with him, so he gives it a 3. Having said that, I gotta give him props for his consistency and the fact that he introduced me to new artists I did not know about.
fun fact; this review has more likes than the original has dislikes
Yeezy taught me
This review is such bullshit lmao who did that to you
Also the 30 rocks/Alec Baldwin is a reference to the programme 30 rock, featuring Alec Baldwin.
You&#39;re either actively ignoring the thematic significance of the choices or you&#39;re just plain stupid, and while I understand if a reviewer decides to focus entirely on the form rather than the content, you&#39;re not doing that either, you&#39;re just giving a bad review because you missed the point.
Oh boy I can&#39;t wait to see Anthony&#39;s updated thoughts on this album
The album not being relatable is the point of the whole album
The one pieaaceee ‚Ä¶ the one piece is real
The worst All of the Lights review I&#39;ve ever heard
Runaway vocal at the end, Kanye literally says ‚Äúthis shit is way too long‚Äù lol.
Ok now you gotta listen to it 4 more times
This is like doing 9/11 twice
Bro your bald
bruh
I agree to disagree, MBDTF is top 5 albums ever along with collage dropout,to pimp a butterfly
So glad it‚Äôs a 9 now üéâüéâüéâ
I want to puke everytime I hear Swizz Beatz‚Äô part on So Appalled. ‚ÄúLiFe CaN bE sOmEtImEs RiDiCuLoUs‚Äù
Pitchfork gave it a 10 you know that
Wow, I eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast
You would‚Äôve give this a 10 if you believe the one piece is real
nah bruh ur silly
Did anyone actually need those lyrics explained to them like they are some deep poetry - it&#39;s painfully obvious what he was talking about, and they are well worn subjects.  <br><br>(That part around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=410">6:50</a> I mean)
This is one piece of music Anthony will just never get
Fantano gets to join the ever-popular crowd of Charlamagne and Stephen A Smith. &quot;Let&#39;s just have the craziest takes and get famous from it.&quot; It works obviously, but why would you even get mad at these guys? They CAN&#39;T actually believe the shit they spew....
Just found this channel, and I&#39;m confused. Are we all here to make fun of his terrible opions or do people actually believe this shit? Why would Em even respond to a guy that gives a 6 to MBDTF....TWICE!
the one piece
Think you wrong
I love this album especially all of the lights. Can‚Äôt wait to hear the praise for my favorite song from Anthony! üòçüòçüòç
definitely in top 3 of kanyes discography, i think one or two of the dropout trilogy beat it tho

Even before I watched this review I thought that the drums on All of the Lights were pretty ugly.
THE ONE PIECE..... IS REAL!!!
THE ONE PIECE IS REAL
kanye dickriders are the worst so i respect this and the previous review
He&#39;d give Runaway an 11 post divorce no cap.
bro really doesnt like runaway because it &quot;isnt cute&quot;, i dont think its supposed to be lil man
Not every bar has to be a line from Shakespeare himself, if it sounds good does it even matter
Do you get Runaway now?
I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get it right next decade melon!! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Fantano will soon listen to runaway and realise that this is 10/10.
how are people still mad at this to this day holy crap get a life
Not thinking Nickis verse was fire is the biggest indictment on these reviews
Respectfully the worst review in the channels history
Melon is like a puzzle, he wants so much out of an album yet he wants so little. Nicki poured her heart out on Monster just for Melon to say that it was too much. Maybe one day he‚Äôll revisit MBDTF again and give it a possible light 7!
BRO WHAT?
And 11 or 10 Years Later He Gave The Album A 6 Thanks A lot Goofy Melon But You Forgot Your Rating It Was A 10/10
His take on All of the Lights is a crime
this is just racism
damn
One of the greatest albums ever made.
L, maybe in 2030 youll have a good opinion
This is one of the few albums that has a perfect 10 on pitchfork.
My Beautiful Dark Side of the Moon
Ain‚Äôt no way, all of the lights is one of my favourites on this album
He rated lulu and this the same ranking
please, we need a 10/10 in 2030 or 2040
Runaway is criminally overrated
10/10 I‚Äôm my opinion, I think your just misunderstanding the ending of the album, but who cares
The criticisms are valid but Fantano does not establish that this albums floor is still insanely high. You can critique while also recognising the highs are some of the best we&#39;ve ever seen in hip hop which he doesn&#39;t stress nearly enough. Feels very very harsh.
MY BEAUTIFUL DARK TWISTED FANTASY IS KANYES BEST ALBUM THOUGH LMAOOO
The only thing I really agree with is Hell of a Life being ass. And I guess I see the gripes with All of the Lights lyrics even though I actually like that track. Overall this is an 8-9/10 for me. Those first 3 tracks especially are unbeaten.
i love how melon man gives mbdtf a 6 but gives money store a 10
tcugghione ca si
i think it‚Äôs hilarious that as a massive kanye fan i actually agree with this review and it‚Äôs one of your most hated. while at the same time i think you miss the allure on a ton of other albums that people don‚Äôt tend to contest.
I like how no one in the comments is even talking about his criticisms, just how he gave it a 6
This man really said &quot;Runaway&quot; is embarrassing and cringe.
FIND GOD<br><br>COME BACK AFTER YOU FOUND GOD
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=784">13:04</a> yeat reference
Pretty sure they removed the dislike button on youtube solely for this man
My friends told me that if I watched this video it would make me stop watching you. But lowkey you never really lied. Only thing I disagree with is you&#39;re liking of Jigga&#39;s Monster verse,  you&#39;re (Or what I interpreted as) you&#39;re dislike of so appalled, and you not liking runaway. It starts strong with a few weak points and has nothing okay after runaway. It shoulda been a light 7 but light 6 isnt that egregious. Sorry for the short essay but people are really overrating this album
If we are being real this is a personal opinion ie subjective and shouldn&#39;t be sold as anything objective..you don&#39;t like it,cool....hate when people try to find relevance in &quot;strong opinions&quot;..this album is excellent and Chris Rock&#39;s skit was not overdone..
Jay-z&#39;s verse on monster is disgusting it&#39;s one of the lowest points of mbdtf
You need new ears Sir
good drake album, i think that deserves a 8/10 but there isnt a melon so i fiound it fair
You are AGAIN wrong
ü§ì
All the lights is better than your life
Whats your problem dude
Just 8 years away to hear the third 6
MBDTF is the perfect rap album for people who don‚Äôt like rap music
im feeling a Strong 9 to a 10 on this one
Tracks 1-9 were amazing. Everything after runaway is skips for me. 7/10
How do you listen to this album and give it a rating fit for a ‚Äúgood‚Äù Drake album.
Honestly nevermind is a superior album and I ain‚Äôt trolling
this review is a 10/10 just for the comments
fun fact: original MBDTF name was &quot;My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantanosy&quot;
All you Kanye stans bitching about the 6, at least its still a good score. Us Deftones fans have to put up with a 3 for Ohms
Few people dislike ‚ÄúAll of the Lights‚Äù. Surprising
Too bad he didn‚Äôt write Jesus Walks his most lyrical song
Melon is so gifted at finding what he don‚Äôt like the most.
MBDTF stands for Music Being Dissapointing To Fantano.
I don‚Äôt get it, Can someone tell logic to stop being racist to Kanye?
I believe this album is a 9 out of 10
I honestly can&#39;t see how someone can listen to this album and give it less than an 8. I&#39;m not a whiny &#39;my opinion is the only opinion&#39; wanker, I just literally can&#39;t see how you can&#39;t see the overwhelming merit for MBDTF
Absolute wanker. This album is a 12/10 and I won‚Äôt hear anything else. You can tell this guy is a virgin. No finesse whatsoever from this incel. Sad guy.
Clearly this is not your kinda music. . . . Bruh dissed Nikki&#39;s verse in monster  üôÑüôÑ Am so appalled i don&#39;t know where to begin. Wouldn&#39;t be surprised to see him giving country music tens. . .
Who is this even? üôÑüôÑ
Dude has 20 writers on one song lmao
So good you had to review twice
I disagree, Nikki Monster verse was &amp; is still Nikki best verse of all time. And you know its good when people still sing it 11 years later.
This guy just doesn‚Äôt like popular things he tries to have the most unpopular opinion to look cool
Ten years later and his still wrong
For whatever reason, even though i‚Äôm a kanye fan and had heard the songs in the album (or at least the huge majority), i had never heard the lp from start to finish til yesterday.<br><br>Overall, my first impression on this record is: The first half overshadows the second by a mile. This thing is seriously front-loaded, but i don‚Äôt think the second half is bad either.<br><br>Runaway is a fantastic track and has been one of my favourites for a long time. The way Kanye did so much with so little, just a few keyboard notes, speaks volumes about his vision as an artist.<br><br>One thing i do agree here is that some tracks do overstay their welcome or could have worked better without some features. The Chris Rock sketch did feel longer than it was.<br><br>Still, the general production of the album is fantastic and i can‚Äôt say i was bored at all, but the second half will need to grow on me a bit more.<br><br>Best tracks: Gorgeous (i get his complaints, but Cudi‚Äôs hook is just iconic), Dark Fantasy, POWER, Runaway, Devil in a New Dress, All the Lights (both the interlude and track), Lost in the World,  Monster and So Appalled.<br><br>Worst Tracks: Blame Game (kinda boring ngl) and Who Will Survive in America?
How is this a 6 when CLB is a 3‚Ä¶ should be the other way around lmao
What do u expect from a white dude.
My Ugly Dukey Bad Review <br><br>nah jk it‚Äôs your opinion but I‚Äôm still bout to get mad
a 6/10 is insane
A lot of people are hating on his takes here, I think this is still a good review (even if I strongly disagree). Runaway and Hell of a Life are definitely overrated and I‚Äôm glad someone‚Äôs actually said that. The criticism he made were backed up by decent points and definitely addressed some of the albums often overlooked issues. The main thing I disagree with here is making it out like the lows on the album are worse than they really are.(I think this album is 8.5/10 if anyone cares)
I just don‚Äôt get it.

I thought you had good takes but this is terrible. Goodbye
The year is 2099. Anthony Fantano has since long passed away, YouTube is no longer a thing, all music in the world has been monopolized by Kanye&#39;s descendants since the STEM Player became the biggest technology product of all time and everyone listens and makes music there at the same time. <br><br>In a decrepit manor, a bunch of children go at midnight with an ouija board and some red candles. They don&#39;t believe in that, but they have to prove themselves brave. <br><br>The first letter is &quot;M&quot; and the kids don&#39;t understand what&#39;s going on, but it&#39;s too late to back now.<br><br>The second letter is &quot;Y&quot; and they get more and more anxious.<br><br>The kids can&#39;t do nothing but stare in absolute horror as the deadly sentence is formed. It says &quot;My Beautiful Dark Twisted fantasy is a strong 3 to a light 4, final review. Goodbye&quot;<br><br>Kids will be haunted forever since that day, because the evil Fantano ghost will always force them to listen to Death Grips.
Strong 7, light 8 for me, I don&#39;t love it as much as everyone else but don&#39;t dislike it as much as fantano
Melon HOW
I completely agree with how bad the All of the Lights mix sounds. The drums sound like popcorn if u transposed it 2 octaves
this review really was spot on. another great review from fantano.<br><br><br><br>unsubscribed, reported, blocked.
For me the album would have been a 10 if it had only 10 tracks but the last 4 tracks just suck so I give it a 9
Re-Re-Review this album anthony
How the fuck do you enjoy hip hop<br>Anthony Fantano has an album go completely over his head for ten years
Hey Fanta, big new fan here. I respectfully disagree with your take on All Of The Lights. It&#39;s actually about how whether or not the wrongdoer deserves his punishment, he feels he can positively contribute to the situation in a way he&#39;s needed to and that he&#39;s capable of. So he should, and he will. And all of us are going to watch him do just that.
I&#39;m glad Melon saw his mistakes and gave this 12
Lost in the World was actually gonna be an interlude for Gorgeous at one point
I mean your wrong, but. Never mind, your just wrong
The sending a picture of his d line was meant to be bad on purpose because it is about his struggle with women
This Rick Ross verse on devil is 10/10
Bru the Alec baldwin bar in gorgeous is a 30 rock joke. It&#39;s really not that deep
Not the nicki slander she ate
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=591">9:51</a> sakupen circles
Fantano is absolutely wierd<br>He just gave PUSHA Ts album a 7<br>So he mean to say that it&#39;s almost dry&gt;mbdtfüíÄ
I love this guy&#39;s comment section it&#39;s so fucking funny
I agree with you thinking this album is overrated but i still think this albums a 7 atleast
This is my third time watching it and although I came to accept your criticism of the music it self, which I highly disagree with. But whenever you talk about Kanye personally, I just can&#39;t help myself but question where you get what you say from. Mf said Kanye grew in popularity because of Kim wtf
Wow 0 dislikes! Looks like everyone agrees with this uncontroversial review.
melon: the word association on all of the lights is bad<br><br>also melon: gives swans a 10
You had a point until you dissed Nikki‚Äôs monster  verse
Wrong again
Bro ranked this around the same as more life by drake bruh
Shittest reviewer ever ye better
Imagine if Anthony is an old man, lying on  his deathbed on the hospital with his family crying, hearing last words from his loved ones... and then some random dude recognizes him as the &quot;guy who rated MBDTF a 6&quot; and unplug his monitor.
i have to agree with his points. i would go even further, however. this is just a 5.
Ain‚Äôt no way he slandered runaway
Fantano&#39;s better for finding new vocabulary words, than watching good reviews üóø
How dare you talk about hell of a life that way
all of the lights will always be one of my favorite ye songs (mainly due to nostalgia) but this shit still slaps to this day. the mixing is waaay worse than i remember though.
&lt;3
Fun fact: most people trashing this review didn&#39;t even watch the video.
Bro how‚Äôd I know he wouldn‚Äôt be crazy about the Rick Ross feature
This album is garbage lmao.
i honestly get a lot of the criticism you have given but the rating still doesnt really make sense, like you have given records with just as many low points but a lot less highs better ratings. honestly feels like you are trying to come of as you are trying to justify a problematic review you did 10+ years ago and telling people &quot;haha you couldnt change my mind, im immune to outside influence &quot;
&quot;Your wild sex fantasy is just basically every college-age straight dudes porn search history&quot;
I only listened to the beginning of the album when i first wathced this video so i would have gave it a strong 6 to light 7 but when i listened to the whole thing i agree with you
Just can‚Äôt respect this
I&#39;d like to remind humanity that Anthony Fantano described a baseline &quot;farty&quot;
You make being wrong sound pretty good
i feel the same honestly
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=961">16:01</a> - My therapist‚Äôs assessment of me
6‚Ä¶bro wtf
Crest - Bladee and Ecco2k better than MBDTF
Every time we insist on MBDTF getting revisited, he&#39;s just gonna lower the score üò≠
&quot;Would have been a 9/10 if Kanye was white.&quot;<br>Bruh this is the internet; you can&#39;t say that.
I know it&#39;s a meme, but I cannot STAND the &quot;Anthony gave MBDTF a 6&quot; nonsense. He didn&#39;t love an album you all love. Big woop.
bro really just gave mbdtf a light 6
Thanks to YT removing the Dislike Button, he&#39;ll think people will agree with him all the time. Thank goodness for the comments
If it was named &quot;My Drunk Rapper Yelling in the Microphone&quot; he would gave it a 10
Agreed. It‚Äôs trash.
This caused Covid
if only this album wasn&#39;t my beautiful dark twisted fantasy and was actually death grips
OK OK! So I just listened to MBDTF <b>*for the first time*</b> and knowing about your review of the album for a very long time, I was expecting the record to be just OK. People kept calling it one of the best albums ever and yadda yadda but, thanks to your reviews and finding hella good music, I was really expecting this album to not hit as much as people have said, but, man...this album is damn near flawless to me. MBDTF is amazing, it sounds like all the best sounds of that era in music in which I grew up.
Revisiting all of Kanye‚Äôs discography after the release of Jeen-yuhs. Love or hate Kanye, you gotta admit he has changed the game numerous times like no one ever has. For that, you have to consider him to be one of the greats, if not the greatest.
I recently got into Kanye and love this album, Hell of a Life is my personal favorite Kanye song of all time. Can&#39;t wait to see what Anthony thinks of it!
Common Fantano W
unfortunately I think Runaway Lyrics are Relatable...

@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=1073">17:53</a> ü¶Ü
if this album was good i wouldve picked it back up after whatever the track after DIAND
Clown review
It‚Äôs a very inconsistent album
only 36k dislikes?
I‚Äôve always loved Fantano even if I don‚Äôt agree with his opinions or rankings I respect them since every one interprets music differently<br>MBDTF is a Staple point/highlight of Kanye‚Äôs career. So it is 100 percent understandable when people get defensive about it and get upset when some one like fantano gives it a 6/10 <br>Or any sort of negative ranking <br>Me on the other hand I don‚Äôt hold it against him it‚Äôs a fair review he made very good points and pointed out big flaws some of which I agree with. <br>So let‚Äôs take a second to realize how generous he is being to re review an album he has so clearly stated his feelings about. Fantano your a great guy don‚Äôt let these hate watchers get to you like they have the last ten years ly<br><br>Unsubscribed !
Imagine valuing being a contrarian more than enjoying music. There‚Äôs no way he enjoys this album less or listens to this album less than lil pump. What a hack
Just listened to it. Bro you are kidding right. This album is Greatest of all time. Zenith of the medium. Hallmark of media. Gold standard of storytelling. Apogee of creativity. Vertex of invention. Crest of ingenuity. Acme of imagination. Pinnacle of innovation. Epic of epics. Legend among legends. Peak art.
How has he given it a lower score than before? He‚Äôs gonna do another review in 2030 and give it a decent to strong 5 at this rate
All of The Lights is pretty good
I agree, it‚Äôs a pretty boring album in my opinion but not bad by any stretch. High to mid 6
You&#39;re still out of your mind, All of the Lights is fucking beautiful.
Good grief. üò´
He does this purely to be the guy that says he doesn‚Äôt think MBDTF is that good
Bro just an exceptional hater
Melon might be the only person alive who doesn‚Äôt like Nicki‚Äôs verse on Monster
Just to let yall know, KSI&#39;s AOTP has gotten almost the same score as MBDTF  <br><br><br><br><br><br>yeah
runaway to me is brillant and the epic film clip. i never bought the album but in 2022 i am.    critts dont allways get it right . put people still. love it<br>music is art
Hates the nicki verse but likes the jay verse ?????????
My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is the greatest album ever.
I don‚Äôt want you to ever rate my album higher than this
EH EH WRONG ANSWER MELON!
Kanye has always sucked
Nope. Try again.
you being a negative nancy
Late Registration &gt; MBDTF
So this is 6 and kendricks black panther album is a 6..<br><br>Drilling a hole in my head would have been less painful than watching you fumble the bag on this<br><br>ALL HAIL YEEZUS
I lost it once he praised Jay‚Äôs verse on Monster and talked down on Nicki‚Äôs. Nicki‚Äôs verse was so hot Kanye almost didn‚Äôt put it on the album bc he was afraid of getting overshadowed
this is the worst video i‚Äôve ever seen
this is the first video of his i am watching and Im just assuming/hoping this is the highest score he has ever given an album
Solid review. Great job. üëç
He‚Äôs 100% right, this album sucks
this guy doesn&#39;t know wtf he&#39;s talking about
Nostalgia critic&#39;s the wall is better
Soy boy
L
I remember listening to this album the first time and thinking ‚Äúholy shit. this is special‚Äù which had never happened before to me and has never happened since.
Crazy how everyone‚Äôs so mad over the correct opinion
Review it again melon
You dumb bitch Alec Baldwin was on the show 30 rock!! That‚Äôs why the bar is fire
He really said jays verse was better than nickis...
Can&#39;t wait for Anthony to give this album a 6 again in 2030
The Chris Rock sketch is supposed to feel like that, the women&#39;s voice is supposed to sound like a sex robot cause Kanye obviously has a fucked up view on this matter and that&#39;s how he imagined it to be at worst in his beautiful dark twisted fantasy. He coul&#39;ve outsourced it to a seperate skit song tho
Hell of a life is supposed to question the portrayed take on kanye&#39;s sex life. That&#39;s why he&#39;s actually singing &quot;Hell of a lie&quot; at the end of the chorus
I hate your take on runaway cause you obviously missed the point of the singing. It&#39;s supposed to be raw and the lines aren&#39;t supposed to be cute, Sending dick pics to random hoes is fucked up and you shouldn&#39;t try to make it sound good. The outro is just Kanye tearing up in the booth expressing his feeling that he can only convert through vocals cause he can&#39;t play the guitar properly. And all of the lights is a fucking banger, you don&#39;t need drums at all on a Kanye track with horns, Rihanna and Cudi. Loved the review anyway, good video
nah dude you really messed this one up.
Mbdtf is probably one of the best produced albums of all time. Up there with the Doggystyle and the Chronics
How did he manage to review MBDTF without mentioning Anne frank once
If he had called it ‚ÄúKids See Ghosts‚Äù, you would‚Äôve given it a 10.
Mames 6
Nah you tweakin hell of a life is fire man
Ima say it right now and I won&#39;t take it back. Power is clear of runaway and runaway isn&#39;t in kanyes best 3 songs
Kanye&#39;s music has been trash for decades now lol
total xanarchy is better imo
I don‚Äôt think this album has no skips and every song is great, but as a whole project it‚Äôs amazing, it all just works as an album and showcases everything Kanye has been about up until that point, silly lyrics with a thought provoking line thrown in every now and then, grandiose and well produced beats, great features and a vague, underlying sonical and overall theme.<br><br>If I ever want to get someone into Kanye I tell them to start here because it‚Äôs a good place to understand his sound
I completely disagree with your opinion of all of the songs and don‚Äôt understand why you hate this album. Subscribed
Tbh he‚Äôs not wrong there‚Äôs like 6 good songs on it
Runaway-9/10
Mbdtf -8/10
Am I the only one who can&#39;t help but agree with all of Anthony&#39;s criticisms of the album, yet still think the final score is way too low?<br><br>Like, even agreeing with everything he said, I still think it&#39;s at least an 8.
No way you think Lil Pumps albums is better than MBDTF
oh my goodness. Melon is hating on nicki‚Äôs verse. We must wage war !
Keep in mind, a 60 isn&#39;t an f, it means it&#39;s above average (a 5) don&#39;t let school grading Sway you. I think of it as a 3.5/5
It is heavily overrated, however, I think you heavily underrated it. Just simply instrumentally I think it‚Äôs an 8. I‚Äôd give it 8-9.
Dang, he even hated in Nickis verse
I don‚Äôt even want to imagine Anthony hearing the music when he goes to parties
‚ÄúOne of my least favorites is all of the lights.‚Äù<br><b>Thomas has never seen such bullshit before</b>
new vid, same mistake, what a joke
All memes aside, it‚Äôs a pretty solid 8.
Everyone has different opinions:)
6 is a positive review
If Kanye was black he would have given it a 10
This video made me think differently of Fantano. . . I&#39;m not sure that he understands the art, but he certainly knows the mechanics of hip-hop. No disrespect. I just don&#39;t think he has the soul for it. <br><br>-t random white dude
i rate this review a strong 5 to light 6
Damn no dislike button IT MUST BE GOOD REVIEW
You piece of shit, i will never forgive you for this
Some of his reasoning makes sense but also some of the reasons he didn&#39;t like it is part of the story of MBDTF. I can&#39;t see how anyone could put this below an 8.
Let‚Äôs be honest we all just here to get mad
I&#39;m here to give this channel a strong 5 to a light 6 out of a big ass melon head
I subbed just so I could unsub
I&#39;m actually surprised he felt this way üòÇ
I‚Äôve realized that every moment that Fantano believes is a low point in this album, is every moment that is supposed to be felt and not heard. It‚Äôs clear fantano lacks feeling, aka ‚Äúsoul‚Äù. Unfortunately he‚Äôll never know what that is. We all know the The jay z line ‚Äúdo you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it?‚Äù Fantano is doing the equivalent of this, no feeling just technical jargon.
8.5-9 for me.
Everytime i rewatch this review i expect the score to change every time
Runaway up to the first chorus is the highlight of the album and honestly it&#39;s the only song i find myself returning to. I guess it was just hard for Kanye to match the glory of the chorus in his verses. Seeing how much unnecessary featurings are in this album, that&#39;s one song that could actually use more of them. Kanye simply being in chorus or short verse with guests rapping out the rest would work out really well in my opinion. But hey. It&#39;&#39;s still amazing and timeless nonetheless! Outro just adds on top of the already heavy athmosphere Kanye created, but yeah it would sit better if it was shorter.<br>Overall, while i don&#39;t agree with few things in this review i believe it&#39;s fair. <br><br>808 has far better replay value, that&#39;s for sure.
You‚Äôre a bad person objectively
anthony fantano more like anthony fatano
bro like just stfu, ur wrong
The greatest review of all time purely for the fact it pissed off so many people after waiting 10 long years hoping for Melon to appease them
This dude sucks
La influencia de este √°lbum es incre√≠ble, pero quitando eso, no es el √°lbum que m√°s me guste de Kenye, eso s√≠, este √°lbum es mejor que toda la discografia de muchos raperos actuales
While I love this album I actually agree with a lot of Fantano‚Äôs opinions, but they just don‚Äôt bother me as much as him. I have never liked the lyrical content on ‚ÄúAll of the Lights‚Äù but i do feel like Fantano is really reaching with his complaint on the mastering. Not only is it often impossible to tell whether it‚Äôs the ‚Äúmaster‚Äù or the ‚Äúmix‚Äù that the ‚Äúovercompression‚Äù is coming from, but the track is clearly more of a stadium anthem so I think the compression is appropriate and serves to make it more powerful. The bongos (or congas, or something similar) are definitely too loud tho lol
I honestly agree I think this album is really overhyped. Kind of his first four records were better than this one there are some good songs on this and I think the visuals make the songs better than they actually are but this really is an overhyped album but music is fundamentally subjective so maybe before its time. But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s aged well
and at this moment, Anthony Fantano indefinitely discredited his reputation as a reputable, respectable, and legitimate voice for music accreditation
you&#39;re gay fatano
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=249">4:09</a> sounds like bee gees
wow 50k likes everyone must have agreed with you fantano
Wait. What? This guy has 2.5 million subs? How? Actually, I know why. Same reason why people are attracted to car crashes and train wrecks. We just can‚Äôt look away. It‚Äôs human nature. We can‚Äôt help ourselves. We‚Äôre basically all waiting in anticipation to see what brilliant album @needledrop will trash next. I guess his strategy is that any publicity is good publicity. Trash a brilliant Kanye album, gain more subs. Me personally? I‚Äôm a bit of a music purist, so to me that strategy stinks.
dont care + you‚Äôre white
less dislikes than the last one
If u rate each song as you reviewed them you‚Äôd give less than 6!<br>Album is still a 9 for me anyway
This album was good. Perhaps great. It was maybe exceptional. Not one of the top 100 albums of all time though. Not by a long shot.
Fantano slandering runaway made me want to listen to it again
thirty rocks
it deserved a 7.
L bozo
review so popular it has no dislikes
bruh
Remaking this review is unnecessary üëé
What a shity review... Go review indie music. It&#39;s like a none HipHop person reviewing our culture. FOH
Hey this album is a 9 if you look at it from a certain point of view
Wow! Look at all of the likes on this video! This must be an objectively correct and inoffensive opinion!
SMH I‚Äôm unsubbing
Wow this review got ZERO dislikes that&#39;s nuts! he must be spot on with this review~!
You&#39;re so damn right man I used to be such a Fan back in the days, my 16s<br>Goddd I had quite some luck to evolve and look for noisier more independant shit<br>Thank you too for your recommandations
I still can‚Äôt get how anyone can see it as less then an 8.<br>Like, how
Damn I wanted to see the dislikes üò≠
this the same dude that gave death grips a 10üíÄ
Melon&#39;s just mad his parents never bought him a tonka the color of willy Wonka
0 dislikes damn
Runaway is my fav song of all time, but i am aware of its flaws. I respect melons observations and now i will only hear his critiques when i hear this album now lol
bruh
Glad to see everyone has come to their senses and removed their dislikes! Definitely a great review!
we get it. You hate Kanye because he doesn&#39;t have your opinions, carefully curated for you by the Establishment. The fact you have to give it a 6 in spite of that shows how great the album is.
L
no one <br>literally no one <br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=716">11:56</a>
Wow no dislikes people must really agree with this review
Factos üëÄüí™üèº
Wow! Over a million views and 57k likes? This video must be loved by the audience!
honestly, no joke, this just goes to show how important you are as a reviewer. i mean this sincerely... who would want to watch a reviewer who changed their mind based on backlash or something like that? like, the fact that you havent been swayed, but still had a lot to say about how your view of the album has grown over the years, is a testament to how you dont say stuff in reviews that you dont actually believe. and whether people disagree or not... it&#39;s kind of irrelevent. i would rather disagree with someone&#39;s honest opinion than agree with an opinion that the person doesnt actually even believe and is just saying for clout. i can respect when someone is sticking to their guns with an opinion, even if (and perhaps especially if) it loses them clout. you know what i mean? regardless of whether i agree or not with the opinion
This video is why the update to YouTube‚Äôs dislike system is an incredibly bad idea.
While I do think this is a 10/10 I think that you give legitimate reasons for your opinions and this is a very well put together review!<br><br><br><br>But you still gave mbdtf a 6/10 unsubscribed
bull shit bullshit bullshit bull shit bullshit bullshit bull shit bullshit bullshit bull shit bullshit bullshit
wow this review has 50k likes it must have been very well received!
Youtube removed dislikes because of this video can‚Äôt convince me otherwise
entered in the video, looked in the description the vote, left.
Just checked whether I had already disliked this video or not
listen to it again you‚Äôre not gonna get it the first few times üò≠
Wow, 56k likes! People must really like this video and agree with it
Every now and then I come back to this to remind myself just how wrong someone can be.<br><br>All of the lights is incredible, it actually sounds like a hiphop fanfare.<br>Nicki had the best verse just ask her fans.<br>Cyhi‚Äôs verse was the most memorable on the track.<br>So appalled is amazing.
Wow a review with 56k likes! Surely people love and agree with his opinion!
some basic shit
wrong! That it doesn‚Äôt work lol
he‚Äôs right that it‚Äôs compressed
so off with that kanye dig with the compression on all of the lights
yo no dislikes!
Wow im so glad everybody agrees with this review now. Absolutely no dislikes whatsoever :D
Wow 50k likes, people must agree with this opinion
RATIO
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=980">16:20</a> is the moment this review turns to absolute shit
Your wrong lol
Wow 56k likes, this must be a very well liked review!
Lol loser
Nice opinion, one small problem. I&#39;m inside your house.
I think you‚Äôre that you grew up in a sheltered environment. The blame game is much more about a toxic relationship, and this music was much more than just an album. I‚Äôm sorry you can‚Äôt understand the album/the art. Maybe another life time.
this video is the reason the pandemic started
WHAT????? DONT EVER SAY ANYTHING ABOUT NICKIS VERSE BALDIE
Don&#39;t worry guys, he&#39;s gonna give it a 10 in his REDUX REDUX REVIEW
Dislike
üëéüèΩ since youtube disabled dislikes
This review is so popular and uncontroversial! I can‚Äôt believe it has over 50k likes!
You‚Äôre a melon
Crazy how a viewerbase can be so consistently and overwhelmingly wrong
Dislike
This review cursed 2020 single handidly
Runaway is goated and one of my favorite songs ever, but that line of sending his bitch a pick and that shi is just cringe
As much as I like this album I can agree on the Chris rock skit, could have done with just two repeats on the joke, kinda makes the song suck when I‚Äôm listing to my playlist on shuffel
This was one of his best works, how could you have given this a 6?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=1211">20:11</a> that verse was the love letter he sent to Kim K over email
You‚Äôre lucky YouTube disabled dislikes melon

WE CAN‚ÄôT SEE THE DISLIKES ANYMORE !!!
i really think he missed the point on the lyrical themes on all of the lights. the protagonist here is not the good guy. the song is not about how this poor guy is being inconvenienced and we should all feel bad for him. it‚Äôs a story told from the point of view of a person whose morals have been corrupted, a person whose capacity for introspection is stunted. he doesn‚Äôt take time to think critically or sensitively about these things, he just drowns that out with drugs, alcohol, glitz, and glamor. it‚Äôs about shallowness and the inner-conflict of a protagonist who is not portrayed to be an upstanding person at all.<br><br>i also personally really like the blown-out drums as a stylistic thing. one of my favorite things about the instrumental is the mixing. that‚Äôs just me though
Everything you just said was.... wrong
The year is 2042. The white house announces that the president, Ye North-West has died.  The funeral, held in the politician/musician&#39;s hometown, is attended only by those close to him. His wife, Vinetria, his husband, Kanye West. As well as all close friends and family members. As well, Anthony fantano comes. He is the world&#39;s biggest Ye fan, and a respected critic of his work. He has remained that way even through backlash and controversy. He loved Ye&#39;s works, and prepared a speech going through the life of pab- Ye. Some other people come up to the podium at the funeral, and go through their own speeches. Anthony remains stoic and serious, despite some of the world&#39;s most beloved music playing, Ye&#39;s entire discography. Finally, it&#39;s his turn. He walks up to the microphone, glancing down at his flashcards, right as the final song of Donda ends. Anthony takes a deep breath, when suddenly, he hears a familiar tune. MBDTF begins playing, and immediately, melon&#39;s flight or fight instinct kick in, but he freezes. Having nearly died after the Threedux review received immense hate, he buried this album from his memory.  As the true reality of the situation sinks in, he thinks back to his reviews of the album. All three were 6/10s, and that&#39;s all he can muster. After a long silence, he begins yelling uncontrollably; &quot;SIX OUT OF TEN, SIX OF TEN&quot; shortly afterwards being escorted out by secret service agents. Melon loses all credibility after a video of his incident is published online. Melon spirals into despair, doing anything he can to remain relevant. He published redux reviews of every album he reviewed. He gives A2TC a 10 and TPAB a NOT GOOD. But, ultimately it fails, and pitchfork buys his channel for 10$ and 5¬¢. Melon eventually locks himself inside his home, listening to Nostalgia critic&#39;s &quot;The Wall&quot; on repeat, never to be seen again.
He&#39;s just mad because he&#39;s never fucked with the lights on
im not huge on kanye but it&#39;s amazing how fantano/any big reviewer is so sure he will be reviewing kanye another 10 years from now             ( <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=94">01:34</a> ) , 30 years after him going big. legend
So, I really like All of the Lights (I think the track sounding compressed owes mostly to the drums, and I like the drums being so forward and concussive in a track about exposure putting a person‚Äôs failures under scrutiny called ‚Äúall of the lights‚Äù) and Hell of a Life (the Iron Man interpolation just doesn‚Äôt bother me and really like the synth, to me it‚Äôs less goofy and more playfully sinister, which fits the edgy-but-not-too-edgy sex lyrics), and I also take less issue with So Appalled than he does, but pretty much every other take is on point. The album would‚Äôve been an easy 9 if it was like, 45 minutes, because pretty much every song longer than 5 minutes has enough runtime bogged down by dumb ideas that you could just cut all that out and have a lot more cohesive an experience without sacrificing any of the album‚Äôs highlights.
The slander of all of the lights hurt man
Deserved, because he stoles the sample from blame game from Richard without asking.
If this dont confirm this mans taste in music is backwards idk what does. This album to this date is front to back a work of art. Wild
Now you&#39;re just trolling us haha
im balck
i was told to hear it and i didn&#39;t like it much too üòÅ i gave it a 7 tho
My favorite moment of the entire albums when Kanye goes<br>MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM<br>for 3 minutes on Runaway
Just needed to come back and remind myself this really happened and wasn‚Äôt a horrible fever dream I had
Anothny I found this rapper named Kenn Igbi and I think his album Stray Types, Vol 1 is very good. On Spotify he only has 15k monthly listeners and I think a review from you could really help him out.
Donda to me seems like a follow up to this mbdtf in a weird way
why fantani
If nav made this album you would&#39;ve given it a 10
My guy gave this a same rating at the new KSI album
GOT MARRIED IN THE  BATHROOM..... HONEY MOON ON THE DANCEFLOOR.... GOD DIVORCED BY THE END OF THE NIIIIIGHT........ THAT&#39;S ONE HELL OF A LIFE!!!!!!!
pov wrong
Good luck explaining this to God.
I start laughing every time I get to the point Melon says All Of The Lights is bad lmaoo
I appreciate you doing this review, even if you still feel the same about the album. I think I can understand your gripes with this album a lot better now that you&#39;ve gone in more depth on this album, and that was pretty cathartic. 6/10
Can we get much higher?
i like this album maybe but i do not like monster and blame game
I think this album could be a ten without the last 4 tracks
Melon you would‚Äôve liked it if it was a Kanye album
I&#39;m going through all your video to just dissslike
I had no previous exposure to Kanye fans before listening to this album and I can confidently say that this is probably just a big joke and there&#39;s no way they are still this mad about this guy giving such a mid album a 6
clear<br>clc<br>close all <br>MBDTF = 6/10;<br>for i = 1:4<br>      MBDTF = MBDTF + 1;<br>end<br>fprintf(‚ÄòMy Beautiful Dark Fantasy =‚Äò,  MBDTF, ‚Äò/10‚Äô)
You had one job
‚ÄúThe Ross feature we get at the end is not mind blowing‚Äù <br>Sorry Fantano but yes it is
‚ÄúAt the mall, there was a s√©ance<br>Just kids, no parents<br>Then the sky filled with herons<br>(I saw the devil) in a Chrysler LeBaron<br>And the hell, it wouldn&#39;t spare us<br>And the fires did declare us<br>But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress<br>And woke up back in Paris<br><br>Can we get much higher?‚Äù<br><br><br>Thoughts ?!
Play it on repeat until you like it
Mr Anthony is feelin a light 5 to decent 6 rn
Wtf
Your mom is overrated üòè
This is like if you went back in time to save MLK but last minute you decide to shoot him yourself.
Such great content.  So many videos.  I don&#39;t know how you do it.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=282">4:42</a>
Anthony: gives MBDTF a 6 YEARS after his previous review <br>Fans: you are bad guy, <b>but you&#39;re a dedicated bad guy</b>
So I gave MBDTF a listen and I only liked 4 songs. I really don&#39;t get the hype.
What‚Äôs the yellow album behind melon?
This is why Fantano has no credibility as a music critic
So let me get this straight‚Ä¶.<br><br>‚ÄòMy Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy‚Äô (2010)<br><br>An artistic masterpiece of an album about the beauty and dangers of fame and love presented in amazing ways with extremely realistic musical elements and orchestral sounds, and amazing usage of sampling small elements of old school songs to make something completely original. Also extraordinary mature subject matter used very well lyrically throughout the album gets a 6/10.<br><br>While: ‚ÄòLil Pump debut mixtape‚Äô (2017)<br><br>An album about nothing, just getting stoned and high, talking and mumbling about flexing and making love to girls and repeating dumb words that mean nothing for most of the songs. While mixing generic, boring trap beats that have the same generic feel over and over again with distorted bass that overpowers the record gets a 7/10?<br><br><br>What The Actual Fuck?!
We know it&#39;s just your opinion, but your opinion is objectively wrong in this case.
Man has mastered the art of making perfections sound BASIC! Lol
Call me immature but the Chris Rock sketch at the end of blame game is fucking hilarious.
Can someone explain to me how &quot;Ugly is Beautiful&quot; received a higher score than this? Thanks.
Respectfully disagree melon. You won‚Äôt change my opinion this time
Fantano is deaf confirmed
I thank you Melon for being honest with your opinion, even if it means highlighting how much you hate my favorite songs (Lost in the world, Hell of a Life, etc.).
One year ago I didn&#39;t care much for Kanye at all. I thought he was just some crazy dude<br>For context, I&#39;m 25 and I&#39;ve listened mostly to rock and metal my entire life<br>Then my brother showed me Family Business about half a year ago<br><br>A few weeks ago I listened to MBDTF for the first time and it&#39;s now one of my favorite albums of all time, I think it&#39;s a masterpiece<br>Guess I&#39;m a Kanye fanboy
Fantano that old melon head that liked Outkast, Beatles, and Radiohead ‚Äúuntil they got weird‚Äù ‚Ä¶
I still disagree with him, but he articulates his points really well.
You dropped 4 points here bro i gotchu 4Ô∏è‚É£
You can‚Äôt just take off 4 points because you are a Taylor swift super fan üòí
I recently watched his top lps and songs of the decade. Most of the list was pure crap with little to 0 streams or success and this guy is telling me that those songs and lps were better than this. Mkay üôÑ
You guys are still going. You really can&#39;t handle different opinions can you?
He gave a 6/5 to MBDTF such an overwhelming IQ
bro donda got a 7
people are only disliking because he didn&#39;t give it a zero
The only thing i really dislike about this album is the line on Runaway where Kanye says ‚Äúshe found pictures on my email. I sent this bitch a picture of my dickkkkkk.‚Äù<br><br>Cmon it‚Äôs just bad
Anthony, no Nicki love? :(
My friends thought I was crazy when I said the interlude to All of the Lights was better than the actual song.
Based melon
Anthony  this video is easily a 6/10
This came out January 2020, this is the cause of covid
I still come back to his mbdtf and damn reviews every so often
Very overrated album 5/10 at max
that ‚Äúy‚Äôall know this is just my opinion, right?‚Äù has never carried more weight
Im sorry but I cant agree with melon, even if this album was complete shit and the only two good songs were diand and runaway, it would still be higher than a 8 and thats just a fact.
Everyone has an opinion.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>This one is wrong.
The rank of this song can‚Äôt get much higher
In my opinion 8/10
6/6
I don‚Äôt think the Chris Rock skit was meant to be funny. Sure they are talking in a pretty funny manner, but it‚Äôs honestly just Chris enjoying himself in this moment while Kanye is listening over the phone while his girl is getting dicked down by another guy.
Still such a bad take
I respect everything in this review except for your take on all of the lights. I get the domestic abuse part but the sheer tenacity to put fergie, Rihanna, kid Cudi, and Elton John on the same single and make it work shows ultimate creativity.
we do not appreciate your opinion
Every time I hear the &quot;runaway from me babyyy&quot; in runaway I get goosebumps. I&#39;ve never heard Kanye sing with so much feeling.
Melon: Fantastic production, excellent lyricism. Some of the best of Kanye&#39;s entire career.<br>Also Melon: it&#39;s worse than I remember  ü§î
hey its cool man, you&#39;re entitled to your stupid opinion, that&#39;s fine
Tbh I kinda agree with a some of the points but I feel like it&#39;s an 8 at least
this guy&#39;s reviews are a strong 3 light 4
Fantano, imma let you finish, but this is the worst review of all time.
i know this is a cliche thing to say and people are gonna roll their eyes, but i really dont think melon gets this album. the biggest giveaway for me is him pointing out that Hell of a Life isnt a sexy song... like yea, the song literally ends with Kanye masturbating alone in his room. its not supposed to be sexy lol
And i wonder Melon, if you know what it means to find your dreams come trueeeee
Melthony Ontano you can&#39;t just give MBDTF a 6 because you don&#39;t like black people being the ones chosen :(
This is literally 22 minutes of a 35 year old man trying to be controversial, screams edgelord energy.
This album is definitely ahead of its time
your review is probably a light 6
I never knew kanye stans were as bad as twitter minecraft stans üò¨
People take this guy seriously?.... Okay...
Doesn&#39;t like runaway...get the fuck outta here.
Hell of a life is a hell of a track
gorgeous reminds me of a pre battle speech type build up, with an internal rap style almost like hes talking to himself at times, then addressing us with what he comes up with. i think its placed well on the album, and the production is almost necessary‚Ä¶ considering he writes cinematically.
I call bullshit. Let me explain: you rate this album the same as Nicki Minaj‚Äôs Queen. You take offense and points off of Ye being ‚Äútoxic‚Äù but turn a blind eye to other artists. Perhaps it‚Äôs too aggressive for you to hear it from a guy but musically this album is way better than anything Minaj is even capable of.
Run away from the melon. Run away.<br>Run away from the melon.<br><br>Look at-<br>Look at-<br>Look at-<br>Look at-<br>Look at-<br><br>Run away.
this guy is almost always wrong, why does anybody care what he says, a 6 is retarded
The hate for all of the lights lol. Its a masterpiece
guys it&#39;s fine if you round to the nearest 10, then mbdtf is a 10!
no one melon should have all that power
Most of his critcism I get and partly agree with - except for Nicki&#39;s verse on Monster. Her obnoxious and loud delivery makes it the part worth waiting for. It&#39;s not a lyrical masterpiece but that&#39;s not why people love it. It&#39;s crazy and fun. Simple lines that you can easily follow and a energetic delievery that feels empowering honestly.<br>Overall I dislike how some songs seem &quot;stretched out&quot; unnecessarily. I always judge a song by its &quot;relistenable&quot; value. Can I listen to it everyday and still enjoy it? Of course that&#39;s not the only point I judge by. Runaway may stand as a musical art piece. But I cannot sit through 9 minutes with the first 30 seconds being just the same sound in a different pitch over and over again.<br>For me MBDTF is a solid 8/10. Calling it the best album of all time seems a bit oblivious and disrespectful to all the other rappers that came before Kanye..
shorten the end of runaway and shorten the skit on blame game and boom perfect album
This dude really just reaching at every chance he gets just so he could give the same rating. How tf you complaining about Nicki‚Äôs verse on Monster???
turn the 6 upside down it&#39;s a 9 now
Fantano gave this a 6/10 AKA a 3/5... 3/5ths....? Kanye....? Care to explain melon
the greatest album every created gets a lower rating than ksi okay
Lmfao
It&#39;s blatantly obvious that back in 2010 he gave it a 6/10 because he didn&#39;t like Kanye, the person. He spent the majority of the review talking about Kanye&#39;s delusional confidence. <br><br>He won&#39;t publicly change his score because its a meme at this point. That&#39;s the only reason.
The moral high ground in this video is cringe af
Fantano lost his rocker on this one‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs ok buddy. We all have a bad game
No one critic should have all that power
Sometimes I have to come back to this video just to make sure he really gave MBDTF a 6
Brow your take on this album is horrible
dont care
you should do a redux review of &quot;I dont like shit, i dont go outside&quot; by Earl Sweatshirt. every opinion youve made of that album after that review makes it sound like you enjoy the album more than you do now than when you reviewed it.
youtube glitched on april 1st i think, this review was posted on April 1st but it says January 9th
&quot;I didn&#39;t know they allowed retards into Shaffer.&quot; - Terrence Fletcher<br><br>He didn&#39;t say it lightly.
Ratio
KSI and MDBF have the same score. Can I just blow my brain out now?
Lost in the World and Who Will Survive in America are a &quot;weak ending&quot; to the album????   clown show
Worst opinion on the internet
just a point about the bar on Hell of a life, he brought up the other sexual acts because he was comparing them to being with a black guy in the females mind, which he is jokingly assuming they are equal and therefore slightly racist/prejudice. I felt like it was a really clever way to paint some of the deeper subconscious sides of racism, and I feel it went over a lot of peoples heads for that reason.
An thorn i
Bro your ratings are wack. You ranked donda higher?
this is the most positive 6 i have ever heard, fantano def was trolling us
Almost forgot to dislike this today
this video is such a power move
Wow. You really don&#39;t know wtf you&#39;re talking about haha. I stopped when you started trashing &quot;Runaway&quot; üòÇ

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=250">4:10</a> it doesn&#39;t get better than this
8-9/10
The yellow flannel is for good albums. The red flannel is for bad albums. The blue flannel is for albums that have scores we completely disagree with.
I think the way he listens to music is too critical for him to ever love this album. That‚Äôs just my opinion though.
does melon not get the 30 rock bar?
MBDTF: 6/10<br>Donda: 7/10<br><br>According to Anthony Fantano:<br>Donda &gt; MBDTF
In what crazy world is Donda better than this
Stop reviewing<br><br>Find God<br><br>Come back after you found God
I hate you
Imma let you finish Fantano, but &#39;[...] Twisted Fantasy&#39; is one of the best albums of all time.
He rated the album &quot;Ye&quot; 8.5 haha
The lil pump reviews, the goblin, Wolf, cherrybomb, and the MBDTF original review and the redux are some of the only videos ive ever disliked
He just dismantled Runaway, how dare you
I can‚Äôt imagine saying I‚Äôm a music lover if u rate this album under an 8 üòÇ not gonna care about this clowns review
This is the first time in life I‚Äôve ever seen a album age for the worst overtime in melons opinion of course üòÇ
album a strong 10, no songs are skips, i listen to it at least 4 times per week
fuck off man.. come on
Yk it‚Äôs a bad review when he says Rick Ross wasn‚Äôt going off on devil in a new dress and then he says run away is ok
You would‚Äôve loved this album if it was ‚ÄúMy Beautiful White Straight Reality‚Äù
So you just gave Donda a 7 while you gave this album a 6 twice. Does must mean you rate Donda higher.
FETCH THE BOLT CUTTERS REDUX REVIEW- I DEMAND IT!
I also don&#39;t care for this album. I&#39;ve never got it. I don&#39;t care for lyrics mostly so I appreciate the energy of Power less than you, but appreciate the last verse of Lost in the World more.<br><br>It wasn&#39;t until yeezus after Graduation that I was able to jump back on the Ye train
I finally bothered to check it out, after all the years of controversy. I agree broadly with the review. I think the album is alright, but not that good overall
Hi everyone. Anthony Fantano here, the internet&#39;s busiest music nerd, it&#39;s time for an album review, an album that everyone has been begging for. Begging for, begging. Kanye West&#39;s &quot;My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy&quot;. Before listening to this album, I had all of this stuff just running through my head, things I would say to kind of preface this review, stuff like &quot;Hey, you know, the stuff like the VMA&#39;s, the Today Show interview, the Katrina/George Bush debacle, all the media gaffes, all that stuff, that&#39;s just context, man. It&#39;s not important. This is music. Pay attention to the music. Leave your hate at the door&quot;. It&#39;s a very similar argument I made when I reviewed MIA&#39;s last album. But the more I listened to Twisted Fantasy, the more I kind of came to realize that that position is total and utter bullsh*t. Not because Kanye&#39;s gaffes are so unforgivable that we need to scrutinize this album using everything he says. That&#39;s not the case. The reason it&#39;s hard to ignore context on this LP is because Kanye&#39;s favorite thing to rap about is himself. On here he puts both his strengths and his flaws on display. And it kind of makes me wonder what his &quot;beautiful dark twisted fantasy&quot; is. Is it himself? Is it his life? Is it an album about his life? Basically the music here and Kanye West&#39;s personal life are pretty inseparable on this album. The lyrics here reference everything to the fish sticks joke on South Park to the dude&#39;s very emotionally damaged love life. Rhyme wise, flow wise, I feel like Kanye is really creative here, very much on the ball, like the opener Dark Fantasy, there&#39;s a point where I laughed my ass off, when he said &quot;you got too many Urkels on your team, thats why you Winslow&quot;. DAAAAAAAMN! I&#39;m loving a lot of the rhymes here, and even when I don&#39;t like a certain track, they are a little bit of a saving grace for me. And I think that track is a particularly awesome start to the album, just kind of paints Kanye&#39;s rise to the top, and it&#39;s a little exciting. But Kanye does not just think of himself as a rapper, he also feels he is a singer. And I will say, singing is not the strongest tool in Kanye&#39;s toolbox, sometimes his singing is a little off. But it basically gets the job done. But the best thing this LP has going for it for me is the beats, the production. Just great sounds, interesting samples. I remember when watching live performances of the song POWER I didn&#39;t exactly know how to feel about the King Crimson sample in that track but I&#39;m really loving the studio version. The song clips flow together really well in that song and make something that&#39;s really really cinematic. It&#39;s just kind of a brave new world for sampling in my opinion. I&#39;ve always been a fan of sampling, always been an advocate, always felt like there&#39;s so much more potential for it but copyright is kind of standing in the way of that. I would say the song POWER is a great example of the artistry that sampling music can offer if the artist is freely allowed to do so. And there are other tracks that surprisingly enough do a lot with a little, like the song Monster just has, not really lush sounds, but very kind of stripped down and simple, primal drums, minimal synthesizers, but still sounds very dramatic and kind of eerie. The track Blame Game kind of fits that bill too, very dramatic but not overdoing it. There&#39;s soul samples on here, a very fiery and classic spoken word piece delivered by Gil Scott-Heron, crowd sounds, just a lot of clips flying by every moment on this album. Whether you like Kanye or not, this thing is ambitious as hell, especially from a sonic perspective. All the tracks flow together really well, it&#39;s very cohesive, Kanye takes most of his guest MC spots and relegates them to a few posse tracks that come together really well. And even though I&#39;m not the biggest Nicki Minaj fan, the biggest Rick Ross fan, they contribute some pretty good stuff to the album. But, gripes gripes gripes, because there are gripes that I have, and sort of the first one, maybe an appetizer, are the hooks. A lot of the hooks on this thing, either to me, anyway, just an opinion, kind of come off a little corny or a little generic. I&#39;m thinking of tracks like Hell of a Life, So Appalled, All of the Lights, maybe something that I could just kind of come across on any new rap song in the mainstream on the radio. And that kind of lets me down because most of this album doesn&#39;t really strike me as being that type of music. I&#39;m gonna say something that may spark a lot of angry comments, but at least half of what I&#39;m hearing here feels very artful to me for a mainstream hip hop album. But my biggest gripe with this LP is something I mentioned earlier in the review, and that&#39;s how essential it is, to me, to be a fan, or at least be interested in Kanye on a personal level to enjoy this. I think even someone who hates Kanye can get into some of the storylines on this album at least a little. The position I&#39;m in is that I don&#39;t care. There&#39;s fantastic production here, there&#39;s great rhymes, but I&#39;m not so interested in hearing about Kanye&#39;s f**ked up social life so much that that I&#39;ll just be sitting on the edge of my seat through 8 minutes of the Blame Game or 9 minutes of Runaway. I get kind of bored! What do you want me to do? But people love the sick little details. People love dirty laundry and I can see this album appealing in a big way because of that, especially because of how expensive and impressive the music sounds. I enjoyed a lot of what I heard here, I just didn&#39;t like a lot of the drama that this thing served up because it just doesn&#39;t sound all that relevant. I&#39;m feeling a light to decent 6 on this thing, but that&#39;s just my opinion. You guys, you were asking for this, let me know what you think of this album. Is it Kanye&#39;s greatest work yet? Should we even be taking context into consideration when enjoying this album? And what should I review next? Anthony Fantano, Kanye West, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, forever.
I hope somebody plays venom at your funeral
w t f ?
if the first one was the 9/11 of music reviews, this is the moment the second plane hit
If you feel compelled to revisit an album a decade later, and suggest that you&#39;ll likely have to revisit the same album ANOTHER 10 years later...isn&#39;t that saying something melon?
Melon really sounds purposefully contrarian here, there are so many beautiful moments on it
this review is the equivalent to blue balls
Donda: 8<br>MBDTF: 6<br><br>It makes no sense
10/10 This album is Art ;)
Gave this album a light 6 and DONDA a decent 7 üíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ
I always thought that the little skit at the end of blame game was fucking awful too, the whole &quot;Kanye taught me&quot; thing got so fucking old so fast it made me fucking cringe the first time I heard it Lmfao
id end this album at runaway, make it 9 tracks like thriller, another classic
Melon I respect you but your opinion is wrong because of the that MBDTF is one of the most stand out albums in hip hop culture
I&#39;d give it at least a 7, definitely far better than the albums he&#39;s released since including the disaster that is Donda but not as good as Late Registration, objectively Kanye&#39;s best record.
The more I listen to this review, i‚Äôm sorry to say, the more i agree with it
This guy is a troll
The only criticism I genuinely don‚Äôt get is runaway üòê
You&#39;re not a real fantano fan if you didn&#39;t dislike this video
I agree with him on all of the lights lol this song is horrendous
I have listened to this album and I don‚Äôt like it
If the album had ended after runaway it would have been a 10 for me. But overall it is an 8
bruh the amount of hate you are getting from these idiots haha
He had to rate it the same if he wanted to keep any &quot;credibility&quot;<br>But giving 6/10 to an album that is 90% bangers is really questionable.
Waiting for the 6/10 donda review
lol kanye stans are insane
Now Melon should delay the Donda album review by a month and a week
I mean I respect it but you‚Äôre wrong
For real though, I agree with most of what he says in this review. The low points are honestly pretty low, but the high points IMO make up for it.
This just proves you‚Äôre a racist üçâ shame on you
Whats up with the amount of dislikes?
Why do people feel like they&#39;ve been personally attacked when someone disagrees with their opinion üíÄ<br><br><br>I disagree with his take but god damn why tf everyone so mad.
Ngl this is a way fairer review than the original and he makes many great points
18/10 good job Anthony
Okay so this is better then life of Pablo and that got a 8, then you give this a 6?
Melon goes out of his way to justify his original wrong evaluation. a textbook case of resolving a cognitive disonnance by doubling down on the nonsense that brought you here. it&#39;s OK to shoot and miss, but air-balling the same review TWICE is kinda pathetic at this point.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=457">7:37</a> ‚Äî wash us in the blood? Respect but u üåΩ
This narcissistic hipster bald loser gave a 20 minute single chord song a 10/10 but absolutely trashes on Kanye. This guy is the type of dude to remind the teacher about the homework.
I don‚Äôt even feel like I‚Äôm being insensitive when I say this could be the worst thing that went viral in 2020
bro u a menace
giant L
Petty af but not necessarily wrong<br><br>Unsubbed.
Damn anthony, I know you hate this album but you didnt have to say all that shit about wanting to be in the cop car with alec baldwin arresting black people..
It‚Äôs funny how many times people viewed this video over and over again just to see a change in the score
Fantano kind looks like white Kanye West if you think about it
This album is on everyone‚Äôs top 5 albums of the decade list and you give it a 6 I watched some of his videos I swear he has a weird ass taste of music he‚Äôs given Future‚Äôs High Off Life a 3 he didn‚Äôt put Rodeo on the top 10 albums of the decade a lot of questionable shit going on
People when you give their favorite album a good review:<br>THIS IS WHY ANTHONY IS THE BEST REVIEWER ON THIS SITE, HIS TAKES ARE 100% SPOT ON!!!!<br>People when you give their favorite album a negative review:<br>THIS IS WHY NOBODY TAKES YOU SERIOUSLY, YOUR CHANNEL IS A JOKE, AND I&#39;M NEVER TAKING YOU SERIOUSLY AGAIN! YOU GIVE LITTLE CUMSTAIN 7 AND NOT YEEZUS 11 BILLION OUT OF 10!?!?!? UNSUBSCRIBE!!!!
I agree with everything said here. It&#39;s not that great of an album.
Worst take in human history
L opinion
Every single legitimate publication gives this album a 9-10/10.<br><br>This wanna feel special music critic gives it a 6 because he wants people to think his opinion is legitimate and valid. What a fucking joke. Let‚Äôs see what kind of music you can make Anthony since you clearly have such a high bar for expectations of quality.
This is why you‚Äôre bald and cringe
There&#39;s more denial in this comment section than an anti-vax protest
Bruhhhhh, he really liked Jay Z‚Äôs verse on monster where he just lists a bunch of monster names for half of it
Hell of a life is actually my favorite.
Your only famous cuz you gave this album a 6
Everyone hates this review but he actually makes valid points about the music
I&#39;m a huge fan. I&#39;ve watched most of your album reviews and have a pretty decent grasp on how you review albums, and I appreciate your work.<br><br>That being said, how you review albums are inconsistent as fuck, and you try so hard to be a contrarian sometimes.
this gotta be racist
Don‚Äôt worry guys, if you invert colors it looks like he‚Äôs wearing a yellow flannel.
Giving MBDTF a 6 was the right call. I listened to it myself yesterday and there&#39;s a light half and a dark half. The light half being the first half of the album is all bangers. All Of The LIghts, Monster, POWER, even Gorgeous is a good song. All these songs have good hooks and great rhymes to them. Then there&#39;s the dark half where each song is way too long and only has a decent hook at best. Runaway, Hell of a LIfe, Blame Game, all should&#39;ve been at least 3 minutes shorter than they are. Also, who tf paid Chris Rock to make such a cringy af outro for Blame Game? I don&#39;t need to hear Chris Rock talking about how his girl&#39;s side dick is teaching her more things than the bf is, and he LOVES it. Is this what cucking feels like? I don&#39;t know and I don&#39;t want to know. Also, the albums ends with some spoken word shit that me as a non-black did not get whatsoever.
To this day I don‚Äôt understand how All of the Lights wasn‚Äôt mixed and mastered well. I‚Äôve heard it so many times and just don‚Äôt understand‚Ä¶
Another trash review this guy is unbelievable
how dare you disrespect the legendary Chris Rock skit
Racially motivated
Atleast he admits the album has aged well and doesn‚Äôt lose its value
after 10 years, he still gave it a 6/6 rating. respect!!
Has this guy ever made a song?
<b>Plot twist ; he&#39;s in australia</b>
this is possibly the worst video graced on the internet
wanna see me give MBDTF a 6?<br>wanna see me do it again?
review it again.
he gave this a 6 twice and he gave lil pump a 7... im sorry wut... this melon too wrapped up in the lyrics...
Am I the only one who agrees with this review?? Overrated as hell. Especially runaway
This is the reason why YouTube has a dislike button.
I have to agree‚Ä¶ Runaway isn‚Äôt even a top 10 Kanye song. Never understood the hype.
White
Probably the worst review I‚Äôve ever watched. With due respect.
LITERALLY DIGGING FOR REASONS TO NOT LIKE THE ALBUM INSTEAD OF GIVING A GOOD NON-BIAS REVIEW <br><br><br>HORRIBLE CRITICISM
THIS MAN DOESNT LIKE GORGEOUS <br><br><br>BLASPHEMY
Dude...
I really hope this becomes a recurring holiday on this channel, where every 10 years Melon re-reviews this album, only changes the script of the review itself and continues to give it a 6
About 10 years late to the album, but damn... I see why y&#39;all hate this review now.
this guy is total trash. Always gives wrong review always talks bullshiy ... do you have any idea how genuine and talented  kanye is? there is a reason that there are no album available like MBDTF.
this guy is total trash. Always gives wrong review always talks bullshiy ... do you have any idea how genuine and talented  kanye is? there is a reason that there are no album available like MBDTF. <br>Man quite youtube rather than thinking you are a good critique
ive never watched one of his reviews where he seems to have any taste . shame.
Overrated Album
&gt;Says Runaway isn‚Äôt relatable<br>He literally admitted he gets no pussy
still wrong.
Dude this video still gives me Nightmares
this man insane
This guy is so divisive that I hate and love him. I thought this album was a solid 9 when I got it. I consider it a 9.5 now.
I agree with almost every opinion you had in the past but this is just nuts man, you sure you listened to the right album?
He doesn‚Äôt understand the context and the sarcasm in some of the lines.
Fantano stfu challenge
Runaway is a masterpiece.
It‚Äôs still a 6 why do you keep coming back
The truculent interactive characteristically bare because starter relatedly frame opposite a tidy adult. witty, married governor
Stfu lemon head you‚Äôre just being stubborn
I enjoyed the deep dive on this redux review. A lot of things I never even noticed from the lyrics that you pointed out here and I think I always liked the album. Never was my favorite like many Kanye fans but I see the art in it. That whole part of penitentiary chances, the devil dances, and autumn falls low key blew my mind when I really looked at the layers of it. Never thought very much about those lyrics for some reason. I just always just focused on some image of the devil rubbing his hands together over locking people up and teasing them with freedom only to be locked up again. But the multiple layer multiple use of &#39;&#39;autumn&#39; is really clever and very symbolic in many ways. Especially looking back from now where Kanye is living as a Christian and how maybe he would interpret this line today with the whole Fall of man in the bible, or perhaps he intentionally meant that line to be interpreted. So many meanings spring out of those opening lines that I always glossed over them and tried catching up on the meaning in later verses.
average youngboy fan
IMO, a song that has a dick pic reference cannot be one of the best song of all time
We need a reredux review
If he was white you would have given it a 10
6/6 album
Respect<br><br><br>Fuck you
I disagree with your take on All of the Lights meaning.<br>The way I understand all of the lights is that it is mocking the way the media portrays celebrity abuse cases. Where the celerity pretty much gets off scot free while the victims are demonized. Monica Lewinsky is the best example I can think of. Also, how the media often fuels these celebrity&#39;s into doing these heinous things so that they can profit from both sides misery. The main reference of &#39;the lights&#39; being the news outlets camera flashes:<br><br>&quot;Extra bright, ùóú ùòÑùóÆùóªùòÅ ùòÜ&#39;ùóÆùóπùóπ ùòÅùóº ùòÄùó≤ùó≤ ùòÅùóµùó∂ùòÄ<br>Turn up the lights in here, baby<br>You know what I need, ùòÑùóÆùóªùòÅ ùòÜùóºùòÇ ùòÅùóº ùòÄùó≤ùó≤ ùó≤ùòÉùó≤ùóøùòÜùòÅùóµùó∂ùóªùó¥<br>Want you to see all of the lights&quot;<br><br>It reminds me of that episode of South Park where the media makes Lindsay Lohan try to kill herself. It is later found out that America as a whole selects these people to be celebritys so that they can sacrifice them to maintain a prosperous country.
Anthony, just saying ‚ÄúAnd I always find, and I always find something wrong‚Äù about the album for 22 minutes and 19 seconds was.. to say the least.. a bit much.
i dont understand u melon man
Still an 8 for me
Don‚Äôt get me wrong I love ksi, but how can he give ksi a 5 and then one of the most iconic albums of all time a 6
I strongly disagree with you
Dude gtfoh
holy gorgeous disrespect
L take
If Scott Macdonald made this you would have gave it a 10
Average album with terrible mixing.
DONT DO MY GIRL MONSTER LIKE THAT
What‚Äôs better than watching this while waiting for Donda
I like this album but some people say this is his best album which i REALLY cant agree with
Great first leg to the review, but slowly went downhill. The Nicki Minaj feature hate was a low point, and quite frankly the review should have ended before that. The runaway hate was also pretty horrid, considering he hates on Kanye being an asshole when the theme of the track is clearly him being a prick.<br><br>I give this review a light to decent 3. Missing the point at many points, but at least appreciates some of the high points.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=250">4:10</a> your welcome
You missed the point of runaway &amp; the fact you found some of the lyrics repulsive kinda ties into the whole point of the song‚Ä¶ runaway
never make videos again
Bias against Ye... Won&#39;t Subscribe üíÄ
He did this for the clout because he knew it would piss people off and get him more views
I don‚Äôt fully understand how he gave it a six compared to other albums he has given a six. I would have expected more of a light 7
Bro nicki had one of the best features ever, her voice inflections show a monster, it‚Äôs all over the place because it monsterous
I personally don‚Äôt come to Kanye for lyrics, so this album being so wonderful sonically makes it incredibly enjoyable to my ears. 9/10
You are an idiot
Sigma mentality grindset fantano
Saw this review in Australia, and I don&#39;t know why everyone is mad that he gave this album a 9...
just an early april fools
‚Äúcan we get much hiiigherrr?‚Äù
I personally interpreted the Gil Scott-Heron ending as Kanye using America as a metaphor for his own fame and narcissism.
Great review Anthony! But &quot;Blame Game&quot; isn&#39;t about the Jews being to blame for Jesus&#39; death, that seems like your own shit man.
Did this guy just trash runaway?

This is the best video ever<br>-nobody
I am glad that you kept your opinion regardless or pressure from others. Good job melon.<br><br><br>With that being said, unsubbed.
Fuck you
So angry
This album shouldn‚Äôt be Lower than an 8. For me personally, it‚Äôs a 8.5-9/10 album. But music is subjective I guess‚Ä¶
All of the Lights is one of your least faves? <br><br><br><br><br><br><b>wut?</b>
a single man is wrong for 22 minutes and 19 seconds
Insert the song: &quot;Out of Touch&quot; <br>By Daryl Hall and John Oates.
Fuck you Anthony or whatever your phony name is
In My Opinion: My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy: 10/10 <br><br>Fav Tracks: Dark Fantasy, Gorgeous, POWER, All Of The Lights (Interlude/Song), Monster, So Appalled, Devil In A New Dress, Runaway, Hell Of A Life, Blame Game, Lost In The World, Who Will Survive In America
First time hearing of this guy but he loses all credibility with his low rating of this masterpiece
Melon only gave this a 6 becase he couldnt handle the whookie sack lines
You should review Born This Way ü•∫ it is a great record
Mad props for sticking to your guns tbh, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d be able to take all the 6 jokes over the years (I say as I contributed to that pile recently x_x)
Just listened to it, very meh. Has great instrumentals for sure but some songs are just bland, repetitive or have pretty weird lyrics
&quot;Fantano, can We get 9/10?&quot; <br>Melon:&quot;We have 9/10 at home&quot;<br><br>9/10 at home:
I love you bro, honestly, best music reviewer. I love Kanye too quite a lot. I hope you also love this album too soon.
God you are awful
youre fucking crazy for rating a 6 dumbass
This man really missed the whole meaning of runaway. It‚Äôs on Ye‚Äôs relationship with not only a love interest, but also the media
I sincerely don‚Äôt get why people have slewed him for this review. I agree wholeheartedly.
god Kanye is a shit artist
I simply have to disagree
How this vid has more likes than dislikes, I will never understand
the only man who believes Nicki didn&#39;t body her verse
I don‚Äôt trust white people rating hip hop albums ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
i‚Äôm feeling a strong 0 to a light 1 on this review melonboy
Gonna be honest he‚Äôs right, Kanye is trash and so is this album
Boney bear ü•∫‚òùÔ∏è
Anthony, I don&#39;t think you calling a BLM hotline and screaming racial slurs for 22 minutes justifies your 6/10.
i respect your opinion but this is still the best album ever made
hi
You are totally wrong about this album.
I really like how you don‚Äôt let people influence your opinion. Unsubscribed!
cant argue with stupid
Runaway review was based af. Mad respects melon
I‚Äôm so glad that skits in rap albums are no longer a thing. They are so cheesy and most of the time not funny
I&#39;m subbed because the comments are much more interesting than the videos lmao. <br><br><br>Unsubscribed.
You only gave 6/10, because there is color on the cover
Gracioso como despu√©s de 11 a√±os y 2 rese√±as a√∫n puedes errar y errar despu√©s de errar m√°s. üíÖ
Well in maths we always round to the nearest 10 and seems he says this is a 6, so realistically this is a 10/10 album.
Delete this white man
Nickis monster verse is the definition of iconic!
Just a 6?!!!!!
Damn, lost in the world is one of my favorite song.üëÄ
The forever at the end took a whole different meaning huh?
SALTY HATER
i wonder how much more effective the album could have been if it had been edited down to run closer to 45 minutes<br><br>Some ideas:<br><br>Cut out the weaker features<br>Shorten All of the Lights<br>Remove So Appalled<br>No Runaway Outro<br>No Blame Game Outro<br><br>Idk if there&#39;s a fan made edit of that already
nice review, but saying the album isn&#39;t 10 because it has the word &quot;dark&quot; in the title was kinda strange
Racist
This....proves this dude wouldn&#39;t know good rap if it slapped him in the face....
i dont think that a song about sex addiction has to, or even should, sound sexy
haven‚Äôt finished this yet but i know he‚Äôs gonna hate on the robot voice at the end of runaway
Eminem is beteter then kanye this album :!
baD VREVIEW<br>dIDNT LIKE
I hate you
Couldn‚Äôt disagree more with Hell Of A Life. The lyrics can definitely be silly but the musicality and flow/mix of things is pretty hard in my opinion.
the word for this album is &quot;overrated&quot; and I think this album deserves to be or can we get much higher?
delete this video
dude literally sat back right here in 2020, thought about it, and decided &quot;yeah Lil Pump is still better than this&quot;
He‚Äôs right
F you melon man, runaway its better than the swans shit you heard
Melons a fucking virgin confirmed
Honestly, most of the points he said are valid.
Tbh he was just buying into the Kanye hate at the time and simply cannot overcome his ego to admit he had an unfair bias.<br>You can pull from nearly every other album that he reviewed of Kanye&#39;s material and apply what he says here.<br>At the end of the day, underrating MBDTF is what made him big and he&#39;s not going to ever double back on that unless he unironically retires and<br>gives it a 10 as his final piece of art.
Raes verse on gorgeous is sick
Tf you mean 6/10, even critics gave better reviews than you dude. You&#39;re sad THIS ALBUM WAS BEAUTIFUL
Dude. Wtf is wrong with you?
if lil pump made this album you&#39;d give it a 7/10
Mans must‚Äôve never played NBA 2k14 üò§üò© <br><br>that All Of The Lights song hit different. üíØ
10 years later and Runaway still woooooshed over Melon&#39;s head
the second the video started i already knew he wasn‚Äôt gonna say some dumb shit
How could you call this a 6 and then say that it&#39;s a 10 on your instagram reels?ü§®
How dare you
.
You might be the only person I‚Äôve seen who hates Nikki‚Äôs verse on Monster. That shit was amazing. Plus Kanye‚Äôs verse is underrated. I fucking love his flow around the ‚Äútriple double no assists‚Äù line
Interesting tidbit, which is kind of indicative of the quality of this review, Sleepyhollow is a place in Chicago. Around the corner from where Ye grew up. He was saying she had such great head game that he thought he was dreaming. One of the best bars of the album...he made fun of it. Woops.
Ratio
dude the amount of dislikes over a opinion is crazy
Turn The 6 Upside Down it‚Äôs a 9 Now
See y&#39;all in another 10 years.
To this day I still don&#39;t understand why the focus of the review is on lyrics and message. Kanye never was a talented and conscious writer. I&#39;d say the lyrics are the less polished aspect of his music. He&#39;s basically a 9 year old in a grown man&#39;s body, we&#39;ve known it since Dropout. Why expect thoughtful writing and coherence where you know you won&#39;t find it. Why does this review feel like a review of Kanye&#39;s personnality instead of his music?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=1073">17:53</a> Quack
kanye should&#39;ve ended the album at runaway. everything after it is dry in my opinion.
Dear Anthony, runaway as fast as you can.
It&#39;s been a while but I realize why he&#39;s wearing a blue flannel<br><br>blue is the opposite of yellow, the color of the flannel that Anthony wears when he talks about good albums. The type of flannel people want to see him wear when talking about this album. But he refuses to do so and instead wears the opposite of yellow, blue
why does nobody ever mention the weird fucking jay z rape line
As all the Kanye west discography this is trash, but he don&#39;t liking Nicki minajs verse on monster is something that shocked me. Homophobic
He&#39;s fucking crazy. He&#39;s a literal crazy person. This is one of Kanye&#39;s best albums
Terrible take on the CyHi verse
Bruh Gorgeous a top 5 Kanye song
Looking forward to Melon finally realizing this is a 10 in 2030.
you smell melon man
Trash review. Album is absolutely fire.
I still respect the fuck out of this review. He could‚Äôve easily just succumb to pressure and gave it a higher score but he kept his stance and articulated his grievances well.
This video officially has more views than the original review.
Hot take: the beat alone carries runaway. Everything else is meh
GIMME THAT VAN WEEZER!!!
I could do without the review but man. Those comments.
HE CAN&#39;T KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH IT
I‚Äôm convinced this man just does not like lights
Reminder that Melon gave Mouth Moods a better score
Atleast give it an 8.5.
This man gave this master piece the same score as Eminems last album that was literally trash
To be honest when this came out and I was 19 every track was amazing. 10 years later I maybe still revisit 2 or 3 tracks. 6 is a fair overall score.
I don&#39;t care what anybody says, Fantano got it right the first time and he got it right this time too.
Cool review but why did you talk about kanyes dick size for 22 mins
Agreed
6 out of 10 slang for 10 out of 10 these days
a 6 doesnt mean he hates it. he just kinda likes it
I mean, I agree that Kanye has better albums (College Dropout, Late Registration, The Life of Pablo). But a light 6? Nah. It‚Äôs a light 8 in my book.
Lil boat is better than mbdtf hah no
Pls stop
Still an L
I have a lot of dark twisted fantasies about you baldie x
I respectfully disagree.<br>Especially on Runaway.<br>At least it didn‚Äôt land as a 5 or 4.
Man I NEVER got what&#39;s so cool about All of the Lights other than that violin bit
Keep in mind, this is the same guy who gave MBDTF a 6
So die lit&gt; dark fantasy?
Duck you Anthony
te odio
fuck u
I still can&#39;t see how Anthony doesn&#39;t like All of the lights
I will never forgive u for this fantano
2030 <br><br>Strong 6 to a strong 6
Sorry, dont have a witty comment<br><br><br><br><br><br>Unsubscribed
I missed your original review and this update when it came out, but finally someone who shares my opinion! People have given me shit for years for saying that this album was at least 20-25 minutes too long. There are definitely some tracks I really enjoy, but I&#39;ve always thought that some pretty crude editing (like fading out before that stupid goddamned Chris Rock bit from Blame Game) would bring this up to a solid 8.
Jay Z&#39;s verse in monster is great until he says &quot;my achilles heel is looooooove&quot; is cringes me out so bad
Just listened to it for the first time the other day.<br><br>I thought it was good, but I&#39;d probably give it a decent 8.
Holy smokes this dude doesn‚Äôt like all of the lights
You‚Äôre laughing? He gave MBDTF a 6 and you‚Äôre laughing?
Kanye&#39;s been REAL QUIET ever since this review dropped.<br>...<br>Seriously, he hasn&#39;t tweeted since like January and I&#39;m starting to get worried.
nickis lyricism is off???? im not even a fan but holy shit man. ‚Äúmy money so tall that my barbies gotta climb it, hotter than the middle eastern climate, violent‚Äù or ‚Äúpink wig thick ass give em whiplash, i think big get cash make em blink fast‚Äù, like come on fantano
Am I seriously the only one who likes So Appalled because I hear no one talk about that track.
You gotta admit tho, however much you disagree, this is one fantano‚Äôs best reviews to date
This review is great. I don&#39;t agree with a lot of the opinions you hit at, but this is a very well structured and gives the opinions you had 10 years more fleshed out and to the point. <br>I love this record but I respect you a lot for this review. Unsubscribe.
i honestly agree since most of the second half of the album felt less organized and inspired as the first half. but u cant hate on all of the lights
Amazing to see how little of this album this man understands
Trash
Everything below 9 is unacceptable
Excellent review fantano,probably your best,really love how you stuck to your own opinion,despite all the backlash.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>ANYWAYS I&#39;M COMING TO YOUR HOUSE TO ANALY PROBE YOU  WITH THIS PICKLED DAIKON RADDISH.</b>
sleep with one eye open tonight
still aint forgiving you for this
I STRONGLY DISAGREE.
That 30 rocks line though....
Felon, imma let you finish but Runaway is one of the best songs of all time!!!
In 1930 he gave it a strong 10
Adding this to the list of: Anthony&#39;s worst reviews (click my pfp to find the others!)
We need melon on a lie detector test and ask him if MBDTF is really a 6
feel free to retire at any time &lt;3 ur imagination has clearly withered or originally failed to bud. this is based on several of your other reviews as well. trash :)
You‚Äôre only mad it wasn‚Äôt named ‚ÄúMy Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantano‚Äù
The more I think about this opinion and rating, the more I think is just a stupid opinion, the way he approaches every lyric and decision made in the album, I really don&#39;t care about this when I&#39;m listening to it, but he influences wannabe critics that say the same
I agree, overrated track, there are some good songs but overall as an album its overrated af i wouldnt give it more than a 5/10
Your best Video! &lt;3
Regardless of the rest of the lp, Chris brown&#39;s sketch on so appalled knocks off a point or two at least
I feel personally attacked from you hating all of the lights
6/5 damn great review
The dislikes lmfao
Isn&#39;t Sleepy Hollow a neighborhood in Chicago?
Gotta be honest. The last third of the album is very boring, it for sure should of been redone
Anthony Fantano&#39;s only good opinion  is realizing the mediocrity of MBDTF for what it is.
melon u suck
BUT HE GAVE POLO G A 7
fuck you
Both Blame Game and Runaway would be masterpieces if you took the last 3 minutes of them off
ü§°
His review on runaway completely triggered me
üòï
Lowkey this review cursed 2020, thanks melon
He really did all of the lights like that
remember, he gave a lil pump album a 7. think about that.
I not even a Kanye fan. But this was disrespectful asf
He has lost 700 thousand subs
Spot-On Review.
melon
Hil-larious.
How dare you disrespect lost in the world
I feel violated
His first L
This is already 1 year old????
Unsubscribed.<br><br>Oh wait I&#39;m already unsubscribed.<br><br>Unsubscribed.
So fantano gave mtbmb a side a strong 5 and he was thinking about giving a strong five to this album so mtbmb top 30 rap albums oat confirmed?
I was kind of following your complaints for the first half but THE SECOND you critisized Jay-Z and Nicki Minaj&#39;s verses on Monster I hit the dislike button<br><br>edit: he also 100% interperated the purposefully asshole lyrics of Runaway as a problem???
People respect this guys opinion just because he uses a lot of music buzzwords and pretty vocab. his music taste is trash af lol
I think this guy with the big head doesn‚Äôt understand music
Just came here to get triggered. Why do I do this to myself ?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=331">5:31</a> is it possible he got so much head he... no longer has a head?
I respect you for not wavering your opinions. Still hate you for it.
I wanna know what this guy is smoking right now must hit so hard
I still can&#39;t see how Anthony doesn&#39;t like &quot;All of the lights&quot;
I can agree that a paragraph in Runaway is bad but the rest of the song is a masterpiece
By far the worst take I have ever heard
fuck you.
fantano not rocking with the nicki ‚ÅâÔ∏è
I can‚Äôt believe this one had a better like ratio lmao
I can‚Äôt be the only one who listens to this album everyday
anothy you are fukin idot kayne make 11/10 album idiot
i understand why you don&#39;t like run away but i think it is one of his best song
ur gay
good luck explaining this to jesus
All of the lights is your least favourite?<br>6/10 Opinion melon
the year is 2030. president west has officially outlawed bald people with miserable takes. life is good.
bigthony<br>asstano here<br>this is the 4th studio album coming from the well reknowned Kanye<br>the bass in most of these songs make my penis droop<br>solid 3/10
All of the lights is one of my favorite songs of all time!
He had to make a video twice to give the same review clearly not a popular opinion 10/10
Lol I‚Äôve always loved this review. Me and my friend always thought this album was good but overrated AF and this review was the first thing I found to actually articulate all the problems I had with the album.
Sup click man
fuck u... no hair = No point
Did this guy say Nicki Minaj didn‚Äôt have good lyricism on her verse...üôÉ
Halfway trough I was 100% sure this review was a joke and just sarcasm. He sounded so wierd and his points were just childish and sounded like he knew nothing about the album.
Melon sounds like he is really searching for things to hate on.. his points sound so wierd like kanye did something bad to him
melon.
L
This video is S tier level trolling holy shit
Kr√∫bi disliked this
pretty awful opinion son
DID THIS MELON CALL RICK ROSSES VERSE ON DEVIL IN A NEW DRESS BAD???
Man I have to go the opposite on Monsters, I think without Jay Zs lyricism and Nikis energy with her flow on that song it wouldn&#39;t have sounded a fraction as good
Boooooo
I respect his opinion but I noticed some inconsistencies in Anthony‚Äôs statements. He implies that he‚Äôs always disliked ‚ÄúLost in the world‚Äù but in his original review, it was in his favorite tracks. In addition, he says ‚ÄúDevil in a new dress still sounds great after all these years‚Äù but he didn‚Äôt mention it in his original review, and he said it wasn‚Äôt one of the high moments of MBDTF in his ‚ÄúKanye madness bracket.‚Äù
Gorgeous is his best song. You can&#39;t change my mind.
Dear Racistony Fantano, <br><br>I remember going to school with you and I vividly  remember you telling me you hate black people that make 10/10 albums. You said you would never give them the praise they deserve as that would boost their self esteem.
Did Fantano just say he didn&#39;t like the Nicki verse?
MBDTF is a 6 ?<br>Bald. Head. Liar
You give MBDTF a 6 but gave MBDTF a 6
The ONLY thing I really agree on in this review is that runaway is not that good overall. Love the beat and hook but the rest of it I really don&#39;t care for. definitely not my favorite from the album...
The album is called ‚ÄúMy Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy‚Äù with a pornographic cover. What does he expect it to be about, Sunshine and Butterflies?
If the racial aspect wasn&#39;t in this album the melon would have gave it a 4.
I disagree
How can a man shit on All of the Lights like this
this was the reason for the track ‚ÄúI thought about killing you‚Äù, thanks melon
Eh, while I wouldn&#39;t go as low on the scoring, I honestly agree with most of Anthony&#39;s criticisms and with the point that MBDTF definitely isn&#39;t a perfect 10/10 masterpiece.<br><br>The beats are easily the best aspect of the record, and there&#39;s plenty of highs where Kanye really did put together mind-blowing, off the charts sounds - POWER, Runaway, So Appalled, Devil in a New Dress, etc. But even on that front the record has its fair share of lacklustre moments, especially on the back end: Hell of a Life and Lost in the World were kind of crude and mediocre (though I still have no idea what he&#39;s on about with the mixing on All of the Lights).<br><br>The worst thing for me are the lyrics. I went into the record with big expectations, because of all the talk about the record&#39;s powerful &quot;themes&quot; of celebrity and opulence and the complexities of navigating such a life. But....... I honestly think talking about this record as having any &quot;themes&quot; is being generous. <br><br>For the most part, I really don&#39;t think Kanye put much self-critical thought into the dramas surrounding MBDTF&#39;s release. A lot of his lyrics &quot;reflecting on celebrity&quot; just seem to consist in him having a temper tantrum about the entirely justifiable criticism he received for his terrible behaviour - see POWER - or just continuing to embrace the exact same attitudes that were under that behaviour to begin with, e.g. Devil, Hell of a Life, All of the Lights, etc. The only real glimmer of self-awareness he ever shows is on the confessional Runaway, which doesn&#39;t really compensate for the rest.<br><br>Whenever I say this, the common response is that Ye <b>is</b> being self-aware when he acts like an asshole on this record - that he&#39;s showing how he understands that he was an asshole. However, given how little his antics seem to have changed since the record&#39;s release, I&#39;m frankly doubtful that&#39;s the case.<br><br>Either way, just speaking in terms of subjective listening experience - the pleasure I get listening to it - I think MBDTF is a solid record. It&#39;s mostly carried by the production, and somewhat spoiled by the grating, manchild personality Kanye offers in his lyrics.<br><br>Decent 7/10.
Ok
He‚Äôs probably just a secret Taylor Swift fan
Lets be honest here if this album had released 10 yrs ago fantano would have done a classis review on this
Melon when he hears MBDTF: eh I‚Äôll give it a 6<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Melon when he hear Lil Pump‚Äôs self titled mixtape:<br>This is an easy 7
Every time I hear all of the lights now I want to say bud light üòÇ
Fantano, on Runaway: The vocal experimentation at the end sounds too abrasive - what im supposed to be impressed by things that sound bad just because theyre experimental?<br>Also Fantano: the best album of the decade? either bish bosch or literally anything by death grips.<br><br>Fantao, still talking about Runaway: &quot;i sent a picture of my diiiiick&quot;? these lyrics are trash. <br>Also Fantano: &quot;she said im in the wrong hole, i said im lost&quot;? man that line was dope! kanyes lyrics are tight here! kids see ghosts is 10/10! <br><br>C&#39;mon man..... we dont rate kanye for his lyrics. thats like complaining about the production on low end theory. I get it, its become an ongoing joke, and you cant cede ground on this, but cmon man..... you know this is a 10/10. For real this album has issues, like.... &quot;all of the lights&quot; does deserve to be called out, and &quot;its ridiculus&quot; is a strong contender for the laziest and worst rap hook of all time... the song might be the worst kanye song of all time its a painful interuption... and it really kind of annoys me how much heavy lifting aphex twin is doing on &quot;blame game&quot;.... like avril 14th is good enough that i can even enjoy the 2 minute chris rock skit at the end.... but does anything on that song add to the aphex twin version? its a throw away song on this album, and all i think when i hear it is &quot;damn aphex twin is good&quot;. its a distraction and shouldn&#39;t be here. but fix the lyrics on &quot;all of the lights&quot;, and delete the songs &quot;blame game&quot; and &quot;so appalled&quot;, and this is the greatest album of the past 20-30 years. even with them its in the top 10, and at <b>least</b> a 9/10. but you know that... you just trolling us. touche.
This dude is saying a whole lotta nothing.... unable to admit your mistakes
Wtf Anthony?!? It clearly is a 2/10 u nerd ;(
Fuck this guy
6/10 my little bro did well, but when i release my album &quot;My Ugly Light Straight Reality&quot; that&#39;s gon&#39; get a 10/10
I&#39;m not American, English is not even my native language, so whatever. This album is a sonic masterpiece and that is all I care about.
Who‚Äôs still watching in 2021
not liking runaway is a shame you shall carry for the rest of your life
Watch alfo media&#39;s review on YT.
R u stupid
ideot
u r dumb idot
ur idiot
MBDTF review is what happens when people don&#39;t understand that 6 is still a positive score
U mega gay
I still dislike this review after  re reviewing IT. Light hatin to strong dislikin
The more i see this guys reviews, the more i realize he likes music that follows a formula that&#39;s been pre-determined as good
Your opinions on runaway and all of the lights are wrong and you  don&#39;t deserve a  opinion
So he loves WAP but Kanye rapping about his dick is a too much? (This can also go the other way around and apply to people who shit on WAP but love that kinda lyricism when its men doing it lol)
The verses on Runaway and the singing are the highlights of the song. So beautiful and just aamazing how can you say it‚Äôs bad.
Y&#39;all know this is just his opinion right?
if we round up 6 he really gave it a 12
My Beatiful Dark Twisted Fantano
No.
This album is filled with moments but other than that, Very overhyped.
Fuck you buddy.
12/10 not bad
damn i like his gold and white shirt
Wow just wow, Same review, same thoughts and rating. but yet Melon managed to flip the Like/DisLike ratio upside down.<br>MELON POWER üçâ
Disagree; but I still love you
If you changed the tracklist, title, and cover to &quot;kids see ghosts&quot;, you would&#39;ve given it a ten, which just proves how biased you are against kanye
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=761">12:41</a> - the Jay-Z lyrics: that&#39;s actually a shot at Beanie Sigel. The former Roc-A-Fella artist wasn&#39;t feeling he got his proper respect/money based on how much Beans felt he gave the label over the years. Jay didn&#39;t like Sigel&#39;s words towards him. Beanie also had a song called &quot;Feel It In The Air,&quot; hence the reference.
he didn&#39;t change his opinion after all the shit we gave him. I applaud you melon. unsubscribed
This is why 2020 was so bad
honestly this review is completely accurate. most overrated album in the last 20 years
So if Kanye just made a bunch of gun sounds with his mouth, would this album be a 10?
To be fair, it&#39;s probably Kanye&#39;s least favorite album of his
Hey. You can&#39;t be wrong about everything. Your opinion on this album is definitely wrong, however.
Stfu 10/10 better than The Money Store
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=330">5:30</a> I think he means that he got so much head he ran out of it
I agree that this album is overrated and definitely not his best album, but it&#39;s at least an 8 for me. I agreed with a lot of the points you made, but a 6 is too low for me.
What the fuck
So Appalled and Devil In A New Dress are easily my two favorites from MBDTF, and honestly Blame Game would have been perfect without the Chris Rock skit, it overstayed it&#39;s welcome far too long and I found it to be so obnoxious it almost ruined the song entirely for me, I think it would have been perfect without it.

fuxk you fantano
it is a 6.
i j dont get how he can talk at length about how poetic and flawless these tracks are, mention a handful of flaws, and sum it all up to a 6. he gives less praise to albums that get 8s in other reviews.
This album is a strong 10
Someone finally said it: the lyrics and singing on Runaway are cringe.
Well that&#39;s just like, your opinion man
No ‚ù§
Reviews Alec Baldwin line in Gorgeous: doesn‚Äôt talk about his Alec baldwin is in a show called 30 rock
wow this video makes me hope i could give more than 1 dislike
Okay the ending is kinda weak but it still a 10 man
i respectfully disagree
wow 1 year later and still waiting for him to say this was just a prank, he is good at keeping a joke going haha
yeah you can just go ahead and delete your channel now
The lyrics arnt supposed to be cute on runaway.
REDUX REVIEW NOW THAT WE KNOW YHE ALBUM IS ABOUT JEFREE STAR.!!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=1098">18:18</a>
Did gave it a 6 again, the balls on this man
Dark Fantasy- Iconic. Gorgeous- Underrated. Power- (NBA All-Star Game LIVE on ESPN). <br>All of the Lights- That day in &#39;09 when your friend told you MJ died. Monster- Going MAGA, B4 it was cool.<br>Rest of album- ...kinda meh. Thnx for the NOT-rose-tinted glasses.
The fact that you‚Äôre the first channel to come up when you search a review for this album actually makes me sad.
I think it was great for revolutionizing the black metal opera EDM coffee house. For real, when we needed the revival, he came though for us. Thank you for giving it a good review.
It&#39;s a year tomorrow! Re-Redux Review please
I see MBDTF as the gorillaz album &quot;Humanz&quot;<br>Clunky as fuck at the end great at the start<br>and &quot;All of the lights&quot; = &quot;we got the power&quot;
Notice how he liked his TLOP redux review (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=43">0:43</a>) but didn&#39;t like his MBDTF review (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=32">0:32</a>). That&#39;s your unconscious mind telling you something, Melon.
ü•≤
Yea it‚Äôs a 6<br>A 6/6
I of course respect his opinion.<br><br><br>But saying that repeated use of the Word &quot;Dark&quot; made him feel uncomfortable so he gave it a 5.
Props to you for sticking to your opinion.<br><br><br>Unsubscribed
melon head.
i do not agree i luh ya tho
Please redux review swimming because that review shows you to be 110% wrong
MTBMB = MBDTF
things ain‚Äôt been right since this re-review was posted
I completely disagree with your opinion.
Nah, you should just admit that you&#39;re a fucking idiot.
this video is the reason coronavirus exists
I can‚Äôt believe what I just heard. You‚Äôre a menace.
Only gave a thumbs up for your effort in reviewing this again. In my opinion this album is a strong 8 to a light 9.
Niki‚Äôs part on ‚ÄúMonster‚Äù is my favorite verse in the song. So outrageous that it‚Äôs fun.
2030: Whole Lotta Red is the best album of all time
Cmon guys he&#39;s not that bald
Fantano, he said Alec Baldwin because he stars on the show &quot;30 rock&quot;
This is the second time this decade i didnt follow the outro rules.
i actually agree with a lot of his points, just not to the extent that it ruins the amazing top tier moments on this album to drop it to a 6, like even tho i don‚Äôt like aotl or hell of a life they don‚Äôt bring the album below a 9.5 for me
This year would have been fine if he gave MBDTF a good score. But no, God had to punish us for this review
<b>NOW THIS WILL BE A BEAUTIFUL DEATH</b>
Did you get death threats over this review? Lmao.(don&#39;t hate me, I am just making a little joke).
I never really thought that this album is a 10, and I agree on some points that you present, like that the lyrics are sometimes shit, but I don&#39;t think that everything you say is a justification for this album to be a 6, I think you only put a 6 to continue with the meme, this album should be at least an 8
I remember the first time a friend showed me him, and I was like &quot;lmao. you lift your opinions from this guy?&quot;
I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever understood what &quot;good&quot; opinions this dude has ever had.
are you being serious here?
so you don&#39;t think Runaway is that good huh?, hmm ok, i respect your opinion. <b>searches after the dislike and unsubscribe buttons</b>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=1312">21:52</a> WHATDIDHEYSAYYYYYY
God gave you a chance to improve on ur worst mistake and you made it worse
Fuck u man
I know music is subjective but this rating is objectively wrong.
As a wise man once said: ‚ÄûThis shit is, fucking ridiculous.‚Äú
To be honest this is what made him famous,  creating controversial videos like this one. But deep down he knows this is a 10. He is just playing (social psychology)  to be known as a tough critic.<br><br>Edit: maybe a 9
Tbh it seems like a lot of his complaints are about lyricism, which is fair, Kanye definitely drops quite a few terrible bars throughout this album and has throughout his career, but if lacking lyricism is THAT big of a dealbreaker for melon, then there&#39;s PLENTY of albums he&#39;s given positive reviews that deserve a <b>lot</b> worse than this album. Even more recent ones, like BB&amp;B, Please Excuse Me For Being Antisocial, Legends Never Die, The Goat (Polo G album), Die Lit, hell Die Lit in particular should be like a 5 if this is the case (not that I think it deserves that score personally, but often what Carti is saying is nearly incomprehensible, and lyrically he is atrocious, so melon should be consistent and dock it severely for that)
The disrespect to runaway is baffling
I said üëéüèº
So lil pumps album is better
9.8/10-10/10
nobody is going to talk about how he technically gave this a lower score.
Honestly blows my mind that 1) he stands by this rating 2) he thinks Life of Pablo is superior
I just don‚Äôt understand how you can say 100 gecs is better than this, it‚Äôs like someone saying splashing a bunch of random paint on a canvas is better than the creation of Adam or the Mona Lisa. It‚Äôs an opinion but it‚Äôs a wrong opinion
Who tf don‚Äôt like runaway
It‚Äôs a top 3 mainstream album ever, especially when ‚Äúthe mainstream‚Äù didn‚Äôt want anything to do with ye at the time, also probably the biggest comeback album ever especially since their was some powerful ppl attempting to blackball him and still won mad Grammys
fuck you
niggas capping like a lawyer
Just admit it you‚Äôre first review was biased and let‚Äôs face it all the hype and demand for the review caused some of the shit you said, like you said some shit about dirty laundry like every album isn‚Äôt that wtf else does a songwriter write about, or want their project to portray, being biased is fine and human nature but for someone who thinks and tries to portray as being objective is definitely gonna rub some ppl the wrong way
Racism
bro what is wrong with you
10 years later still wrong
melon genuinely thought it was a 6 at the time it was released but he just wanted to press us by giving it a 6 again and he‚Äôs fake hating. BC THE END OF RUNAWAY IS AMAZING
Sad to say but he clearly doesnt know shit bout hip hop. He clearly cant appreciate some Max B
This is the 9/11 of hip hop
Don&#39;t you ever get tired of being wrong Melon?
I want a rerrview for 2 mil
Haha imagine if this guy made a video about this album 10 years ago with the exact same review
I am sorry but you are wrong. hope you become right soon &lt;3
The way you analyse All of the Lights is just agregious. You completely and uterly missed the one and ONLY meaning of the track, Kanye&#39;s relationship with FAME. The Taylor Swift incident being the act of abuse. Its not &quot;trivialising abuse victoms,&quot;  it&#39;s portraying his relationship with the limelight up until then. You miss the deeper meaning in almost every track because you&#39;re method of analysing a song&#39;s artistic worth is so damn surface level. All you care about is politics, and that&#39;s why your reviews are completely unreliable even from a subjective perspective. You don&#39;t like the way the message the portrayed, you only like WHAT message is portrayed. Your taste and sense of art is inherently flawed, because you never step out of your political comfort zone. That&#39;s what I find so damn annoying about you.
I just don‚Äôt understand how you can hate a single song on this album. Maybe Lost In The World?? But that‚Äôs literally it. Everything else is pretty groundbreaking...
u talking rubbish sir
My pasty white infamous Melon
Am I the only one who likes Hell Of A Life...
Even though he&#39;s objectively wrong about his rating of this album, the comment section makes up for it.
still can‚Äôt understand why there is people who would base their music preferences with what ‚Äúthe needlefart‚Äù thinks it‚Äôs good music, do y‚Äôall really need this dude to tell you what to listen? his taste is wack af
This was a great review. Held your points and arguments very well and I can agree on just about everything you said. Thanks for always keeping it real and elaborating your points. You are the best on the app for sure! Unsubscribed.
Yeah!! baby!! Woah....
This album is a 10 for me but holy fuck I absolutely love that it&#39;s a 6 for Melon.
Lol u can thank kanye for the Nikki verse,  im pretty sure she did a couple takes with a different voice for each time it was recorded, like she did a whole one with the high pitched and one like the monster, and ye just mashed it up
Man has lil pump a 7 and Ye a 6
The critia just confusing like Meg the station album got a 6 and this got a 5 or a 6? Like I have no problem with Meg but her album wasn‚Äôt even close to this runway itself is better then her whole album.
Its a 9, the 6 just fell upside down
Agree, this album is not that good
not the biggest fan of Trump but Melon doesn&#39;t get to talk about anybody&#39;s hair.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=1051">17:31</a>  <b>f a r t y   a s s   b a s s l i n e s</b>
f ndrew fantano, all my homies hate andrew fantano
He‚Äôs gonna do this again in 10 years
We&#39;ve been putting up with his shit just way too long
<i>Understandable</i> have a great day <br><br><br><br><br>Unsubbed
people telling him to rereview it for a third time is kinda like how trump wants to recount the votes
Just because his opinion doesn&#39;t fit the parameters of your echo chamber, doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s wrong.
this video makes me want to throw mt computer at a wall
Some people don&#39;t like fine dining. It is what it is.
Idk man I love those terrible vocals for some reason
Should&#39;ve saved this video for 10 months then you could&#39;ve reviewed it on its 10th anniversary which was two days ago
never heard it
Jay-Z‚Äôs verse on monster is the dumbest shit I‚Äôve ever heard fight me
Melon is like Beethoven, he&#39;s inclreasily going deaf.
Thinkin about free speech...
Y‚Äôall know that this review and the original one have the same 1.1m views
Wow melon good job at keeping your same opinion and not feeling pressured to change it!<br><br><br><br><br>Shit review, unsubbed
I noticed the aphex twin piano too lmao, also when u gonna do richard d james btw
BOO THIS MAN!!!
Fuck you anthony, Not cool üôÅ
in my opinion the record takes a weird turn in the next leg,
I love you melon but fuck you
finally listened to this album, gotta say he&#39;s being generous
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=249">4:09</a> Can we get much higher
10 years
How you gonna say overrated but you came back to rate it again ? You should have left it alone.
Bruh
You‚Äôre a fucking idiot.
Wow melon! Quite the interesting review! You throughly went through the aspects of the album in which you enjoyed an disliked. Unsubscribed.
I hate this man so much
IDIOT. how do people still take this guy serious? nothing but an arrogant narcissist that likes to hear himself spew verbal diarrhea
10 years later and he‚Äôs still wrong
Here for 10th anniversary
Happy 10 Year Anniversary to the release of the album: ‚ÄòMy Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy!‚Äô by Kanye West (November 22nd 2010 - November 22nd 2020) üòéüêêüî•üî•üî•üî•üêêüòé!!!!
10 years and melon still thinks it‚Äôs 6/10
Happy 10 year anniversary to this 10/10 album !!!
Voted album of the decade and you can‚Äôt give it any higher than a 6 üòÇ
Still sad about this üò¢
Great I‚Äôm still not allowed to like this 10 because Fantano doesn‚Äôt like it.
Looks like nothing has changed. Great.
My dissapointment is imesurable and my day is ruiend :(
LETS ARGUE: You didn&#39;t want to give it a higher score because you liked the memes about it
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=283">4:43</a>
Yall wrong guys, He actually gave it a 9 if you&#39;re watching the video upside down
For a second I thought Kanye West did a redux of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Review
how did he listen to Runaway and give this a 6? Fym??
MBDTF a 6 but savage mode 2 a 7. ok.
HAHAHAH.. you&#39;re quite the ignorant, little guy. Luckily, before going anywhere, incomparably better and more suited critics and entire magazines devoted to analyzing and critiquing music know better. Your minuscule opinion is shit, sorry. Anything below a 10 is laughable and no, I don&#39;t care about your or anyone&#39;s opinion that thinks otherwise because musically objectively this transcended in so many ways that I don&#39;t even need to explain the why&#39;s (and once again, luckily, the greatest critics think so as well). The thing is, you don&#39;t just give it a lower rating than the obvious one but.. a six? Really? That&#39;s the moment when I realized you&#39;re plain stupid. No, you don&#39;t know music and that&#39;s objective as well because your explanations and metrics are undisputed trash. Damn, it&#39;s a little sad to see such a pathetic little guy waste 22 minutes of his life talking about something he has no idea about. <br><br>There&#39;s just artists and works of art across every genre that cannot be disputed their place, period. You could, obviously, but that would just showcase your utter ignorance and make yourself look pathetic. Then some people would talk about opinions, but no: opinions are dismissed when ignorance is present. For example, I could dislike Einstein (I don&#39;t) as much as I want but his greatness cannot, period. Whoever thinks otherwise is simply wrong, ignorant, retarded.. or very likely, all three. You have a lot to learn and please don&#39;t make yourself look this stupid again please.<br><br>PD: Your reasons are pretty shitty and cringeworthy weak by the way haha. Take care man
Great album
How can you like power but not all of the lights? I genuinely don‚Äôt understand you.
This video really set the tone for this year huh
Haha imagine if this guy reviewed this album again 10 years later and gave it the exact same score haha man that would be crazy
God hates your so does everyone else
Honestly who gives a shit what anybody rates an album. What matters is what the person listening to it rates the album and how often then find themsleves listening to said album
I understand why Melon would give it a 6.
This review makes me So Appalled it‚Äôs just fucking ridiculous
What would this guy give a ten
Kanye got such good head it straight up came off, that&#39;s why it&#39;s sleepy hollow, it&#39;s supposed to mean it was the best bj
And both videos have 1.1M views
epic gamer moment
Oof
I m still searching for a positive comment
a great music critic with a great review. hope u don‚Äôt wake up tomorrow.
it doesnt matter it still is the top 1 album of kanye for scaruffi
FUCK YOU MELON CYHI HAD A GREAT VERSE ON SO APPALLED
I agree with the nicky comment she ruined that song
I hate how people don‚Äôt understand the Sleep Hollow bar. The Headless Horseman would chop off people‚Äôs heads which is why ‚ÄúSo much head, I woke up in Sleepy Hollow‚Äù makes since. He‚Äôa referring the the victims heads.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=1051">17:31</a>
Melon being a hipster is not cool anymore grow up!
My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantano
Now where‚Äôs plastic beach redux <br>edit: ITS COMING
did he actually say the Gorgeous instrumental wasn&#39;t enough ???
Damn this reviews longer than the Kanye musical
Imagine reranking an album again just to give it the exact same score
I can&#39;t take anybody who hates on the ending to Runaway seriously. It&#39;s hands down the best part of the song and honestly one of the best parts of the entire album.
Why did he remake a video where he was wrong for 7 minutes into a video where he is wrong for 22 minutes?
Ur fired
Liked it originally but on a rewatch this got a fat dislike. Still love you melon
What does blue shirt mean
he rated 1000 gecs higher üíÄ
Runaway itself brings the album to at least an 8. Just stating facts.
I clicked this video thinking it might be the Doctor&#39;s report on Anthony&#39;s stool sample.
Disliked for the meme Antwon. Never listened to the album and have no opinions on it. Still love ya
Okay fantano. Arguing that you wouldve gave it a 10 if it said &quot;White Fantasy&quot; is not a good argument
Damn bro. I love your shit but I feel like you really didn‚Äôt get it.
I&#39;m proud to say that I disliked this video
I&#39;m not even a fan but nicki ripped that verse up
Just remember that this album was in his year-end list in 2010
I personally disagree but thats fine, I love this album but others don&#39;t have too hell this album isn&#39;t even a 9 to me, it&#39;s probably a 7 if anything.
This review makes me want to give the money store a strong 4 to a light 5 in front of Anthony with his hands and feet tied in my basement .
Okay so if you are going to do a redux of this do one for Yeezus
Melon  when kanye wins the election. ‚ÄúMr. President is was only my opinion.‚Äù
Who give a s*** about MBTDF you gave yeezus 50!!!!!! Review yeezus you peace  melonüëø
Nah
In 2030 the score is gonna be a light 5 and strong 4.
Though I think you made some valid points, Anthony, I do feel that this album is so insanely ambitious and grand that the moments that land, which are like 8 or 9 of the 12 tracks, soar over the majority of rap music, and over time this is just going to become clearer. It&#39;s like Kanye shoots for the moon every time, so every creative choice is high stakes, and that makes it almost miraculous how much of this album actually comes together and works, though the ambition also results in a few creative choices which become duds. So yes, while someone can look at this album and criticize the narrative structure and a few of the songs, the high points are untouchably high, and with no doubt are going to be remembered as all-time classic songs for a very long time.
juice wrld
This video now  has the same amount of views as the original review
HOW THE FUCK CAN YOU SLAG OFF ALL OF THE LIGHTS FUCK ME
This guys has never known what he&#39;s on about
Runaway is my favorite song of all time, but my ex got hit by a car and she played cello so it isn‚Äôt even Kanye‚Äôs fault
I rate your channel a strong 2 light 2.8
This opinion is just so fucking wrong
So this is why God hates us. Since Fantano failed to redeem his past transgressions, we all are now suffering.
Kanye is god, Kanye is life!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=762">12:42</a> eye roll<br><br>Also cmon you really gonna trash nicki&#39;s energy<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=998">16:38</a> you make me cringe with your complaint fantano
this is the biggest mistake mankind has ever made
Melon were you in Australia for this review, because the album sounds like a 9
Every comment here is subjective, except mine, which is objective,
couldn‚Äôt agree any less but atleast you tried again :/
cmon now anthony
You don&#39;t like All Of The Lights, your opinion dosen&#39;t matter
In 2020 we gill give it another 6, 3 6s=666, 666=Devil, Devil? DEVIL IN A NEW DRESS
üìÇDocuments<br>  ‚îîüìÅ Melon<br>      ‚îîüìÅ Bad Reviews<br>           ‚îî  Lmao this one
Still a 6. Haha
I will never have expectations again.
When this came out the music biz bein illuminati and symbolism was at its peak
kanye west suck-offs on suicide watch
Thanks fantano but how about a blonde redux review now eh
One day when fantano grows up he‚Äôll understand this album
There&#39;s a difference between having an opinion and being a fucking idiot
Even a broken clock is right twice a day. You‚Äôre wrong on this though, twice now.
He should also do a re review of the 2014 FHD
I‚Äôm a big Kanye fan, but I fell like is isn‚Äôt Kanye‚Äôs best projects it‚Äôs good but not the best, I feel like kids see ghost or late registration is better than mbdtf
You have proper criticism and i respect your opinion. Unsubbed.
4/Oct/2020 Happy 10 years MBDTF<br>10 years of MBDTF= 10/10
I forgot he made this lol I love fantano
I‚Äôm surprised that this video has more than twice as many likes as dislikes considering how much hate this video gets
<b>ITS NOT TOO LATE TO DELETE THIS</b>
How could Kanye&#39;s best album got a 6 while Kid See Ghost got a 10. I mean that is the band&#39;s only album and you&#39;re trying to say that they are better than Kanye?
You gotta be tripping balls to have all the lights being as the weakest track lol. Is about showing your lover all these experiences and showing the beauty in them despite being flawed. Its really an  outer worldly beautiful track I dont think could be  replicated.
this was literally just in spite of the meme that it was reviewed unfairly lmao
Dont forget that this is rated lower than Lil Pump
do you just like being a hater?
Fantano had to bust out the blue flannel for this one
Putting that 6/10 again at the bottom of the video description was the biggest chad move of 2020
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooo<br>Noooooooooooooooooooooooo<br>Nooooooooooooooooooooooo<br>Noooooooooooooooooooooo<br>Nooooooooooooooooooooo<br>Noooooooooooooooooooo<br>Nooooooooooooooooooo<br>Noooooooooooooooooo<br>Nooooooooooooooooo<br>Noooooooooooooooo<br>Nooooooooooooooo<br>Noooooooooooooo<br>Nooooooooooooo<br>Noooooooooooo<br>Nooooooooooo<br>Noooooooooo<br>Nooooooooo<br>Noooooooo<br>Nooooooo<br>Noooooo<br>Nooooo<br>Noooo<br>Nooo<br>Noo<br>No<br>N<br>No<br>Noo<br>Nooo<br>Noooo<br>Nooooo<br>Noooooo<br>Nooooooo<br>Noooooooo<br>Nooooooooo<br>Noooooooooo<br>Nooooooooooo<br>Noooooooooooo<br>Nooooooooooooo<br>Noooooooooooooo<br>Nooooooooooooooo<br>Noooooooooooooooo<br>Nooooooooooooooooo<br>Noooooooooooooooooo<br>Nooooooooooooooooooo<br>Noooooooooooooooooooo<br>Nooooooooooooooooooooo<br>Noooooooooooooooooooooo<br>Nooooooooooooooooooooooo<br>Noooooooooooooooooooooooo<br>Nooooooooooooooooooooooooo
He‚Äôs right
People only love MBDTF because Most people didn&#39;t fuck wit 808s
Y&#39;ALL KNOW THIS IS MY OPINION RIGHT?
Fucking ecco2k got a 7 while this got a 6... now that is fucked up
got a 9 in australia
Cap Lost in a world is beautiful
If Kanye becomes the president, Melon is getting exiled
this is my favorite album of all time there really isn&#39;t even a bad song on it kinda sad to see a six
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=297">4:57</a> That&#39;s why that song is in the new Kia advert.
This better not kill Kanye or else we‚Äôre going to have some big problems Melon man
<b>my beautiful dark twisted fantano</b>
You gotta re-review Man On The Moon II since you already re-reviewed one of the classics that you only gave a 6
I would&#39;ve watched this, too bad i was listening to My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. I wonder what he said
anyone else notice how after this was uploaded things started falling apart in 2020?
I hate the fact that he sounds reasonable
You&#39;re a 6/19
I get you still don&#39;t like this album but you didn&#39;t have to say that Kanye&#39;s mom should&#39;ve aborted him.
Gives a short album Kids See Ghosts a 10/10 (well deserved) but gives almost half that score to a complex, high production, great feature list, extremely polished, long album that pushed the boundaries of art and music that we still listen to a decade later. WTF? Your opinion is not valid my friend
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=282">4:42</a> (chinese old lady singing)
trollface
Just a complete douchebag
100 gecs beat this...
i think the &quot;abrasivness &quot;i sent this bitch a picture of my dick&quot; was suppose to reflect the fact that it was coming from someone who knows he cant change and is like you said &quot;broken&quot;, like i think it was a stylistic choice personally, kinda like the &quot;power converters&quot; line in new hope
Oh, don‚Äôt worry melon, my opinion about you didn‚Äôt change as well
I like hell of a life
As much as I do love this album I will always respect the way he presents his opinion. Love ya Melon
He gave The Heist a light 7 :|
dumb bitch
Wake up Mr. West
Does this dude Even know what he Talks about lmao
&quot;What would you rate it?&quot;<br>Anything that&#39;s above 6
Talent hits a target no one else can hit; Genius hits a target no one else can see. <br><br>Kanye is a musical genius ....listen to him long enough and you will understand.
i disagree but go off igüôÑ
This is the 9/11 of the music review industry.
NIGGA GAVE IT A 6<br><br><br><br>TWICEEEEEE
i will never never let you live this down
This review caused the pandemic
He really makes some valid points in this video tho
Nicki Minajs verse is considered the best verse of the decade, on the best album of the decade. Dont listen to his man lol
He&#39;s been sitting the whole time......I be seeing all the butt flexes and everything......damn
He reviewed it two times and got it wrong both times
Sick a duck nigga
A 6 is good, why are people mad?
What zero pussy does to a nigga
Makes good points why it‚Äôs overrated but a 6 is just ridiculous I mean even without liking it, you‚Äôve gotta at least give it a 8 or 9
Oh my God! I thought I was the only person in the world who didn&#39;t like All of The Lights
If only we knew that his true dark twisted fantasy was becoming president of the US
You&#39;re tripping. Hell of a life was a dope track.
You&#39;re wrong but you&#39;re rightfully wrong
Do a Blonde redux review, AFTER u listen to the dissect podcast
Look at all of Kanye‚Äôs little sheep being butt-hurt lol
the like to dislike ratio goddamn
Damn Anthony, for your first public comedy set, you‚Äôd really well!
How do you not cry hearing the all of the lights interlude one of the most beautiful pieces of music ever recorded.
Melon the real 6 God
dislikeüòæ
This record was terrible. As is most of Kanye West&#39;s shit.
He switched to 1-5 scale
Lol imagine him giving a lil pump project a 7 and mbdtf a 6.
How are you gonna rate lil pump above this shit
Bro how can someone not like All of the Lights someone help him
i hope he tries making an album so we can shit it on it too
I guess we can&#39;t get much higher
i genuinely cannot begin to explain how wrong you are about nicki&#39;s verse, melon...
I disagree but thank you for your honest opinion
I really like Kanye and this Album. But there is also a lot of things i don like about it. Its really good but not as great as people say. There are some moments on this thing were i think that Kanye might be a good, and other moments were i am actually kinda cringing.
HOW MANY TIMES DO WE HAVE TO TEACH YOU THIS LESSON MELON MAN
This is why 2020 was so trash
2020/August<br>We still haven&#39;t forgot.
At this rate he gon put this one a light 0 by 2200
This is the worst thing that has happened in this year so far.
How
Mbdtf is an 8, just dont listen to anything past runaway.
Respect for keeping your same opinion for 10 years!<br><br>Unsubscribed.
I respect your opinion.  Everyone calm the mcfreak down.
Man this happened on my birthday
if you think his opinion matters then hear me out<br>only 0.012%  people out of the whole earth&#39;s population know about his review.
Still the most outrageous score of all time
DUDE REVIEWED IT AGAIN JUST TO GIVE IT A WORSE SCORE I CAN&#39;T BREATHE2
you just poured salt on the wound and stepped on it
Way too nitpicky to be honest.
Fuming rn
This album is my favorite album of all time so good
Man... This album is a strong 7 to a light 8.
And this is when I knew he had no music credibility
no ‚ô•
Don&#39;t let this make you forget the fact that Anthony Fantano gave My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy a 6
Just imagine that somebody come to your spot and say you &quot;Lil Boat got a 7 and MBDTF a 6&quot;
he has valid points but this is at least an 8
U used the wrong cover.
To be real: Melon does bring up some good points about why he isn&#39;t crazy about this album. I think that&#39;s it&#39;s overall pretty good, but there are some things that annoy me about, such as the completely unnecessary Chris Rock skit in Blame Game. It&#39;s so fucking awkward and cringy and the dialogue between the prostitute and Chris Rock is so one-sided and uncomfortable, especially given the seriousness of the song. I literally just listen to that song up until the skit and then just skip to the next song, and to me, that makes it a terrible artistic choice. It&#39;s a good album, but ultimately it&#39;s also an example of how Kanye&#39;s hubris gets the better of him, as he makes a number of artistic choices on this album that he thinks are great because he&#39;s &quot;Yeezus&quot;, but frankly are not that impressive (like, Rick Ross and Nicki Minaj did not need to be on this album so often, especially if Kanye wanted to come across more sincerely with some of these songs). Not a 6, but also not his best album for sure.
Melon looks so fugging coy in this thumbnail üòë
‚ÄúHi everyone, 6thony /10tano  here‚Äù
your most infamous review its swimming melon
the only person that doesn‚Äôt like nickis best verse she‚Äôs ever made smh
No
I can‚Äôt digest the fact that he still hasn‚Äôt budged on his review. Do it again, once you hit another subscriber milestone.
No
the cyhi verse was prolly the best verse on so appalled bruh tf you mean
Gorgeous is the best song on the whole album! Kanye‚Äôs lyrics are incredible.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=721">12:01</a>
imma just watch that 30 min MBDTF movie instead of spending 20mins on this LOL
I really like this album. But I don‚Äôt really think it accomplishes anything that It seems to want to do. Dark Fantasy, Gorgeous, and Power are all great, bu the theme kinda ends there. The rest are just kinda sonically related and include some of the stupid shit I‚Äôve ever heard. ‚ÄúYeezy taught me‚Äù and the sounds of him fucking make me cringe ever time. I think i would consider it one of my favorites just for what it attempts, but it definitely has not aged well since i first started liking it.
he gave logic&#39;s no pressure a 7/10. no pressure &gt; mbdtf and that&#39;s final
30 rocks Alec Baldwin thing is because Alec Baldwin started in 30 rock
&quot;Anal and Gangbangs, that&#39;s pretty vanilla &quot; - Anthony
Just take a minute to realise that a lil pump album got a better rating than this masterpiece
Don&#39;t worry everyone when kanye passes away, this man will be crying to death over this albumüñ§
this. this review was what made 2020 what it is. thank you fantano.
Hmm never thought of gangbangs as being ‚Äúvanilla‚Äù
So appalled one of my favs but I kinda agree could‚Äôve been done without cyhi verse but rick Ross verse was amazing u can‚Äôt even deny that also the runaway criticisms feel picky af
Nothing good has happened after you gave it a 6 again bro, you doomed 2020 with this.
I searched up Jeffrey Epstein. Why tf did this show up?
In 2030 Fantano gives it a 10.
I just listened to this album for the first time ever all the way through the other day. I&#39;d heard parts of songs and &quot;All of the Lights&quot; because it was such a big single, but this was the first time I heard it all the way through and took everything in. <br>I loved the album, I thought most of the features were at least decent if not among the best I&#39;d ever heard those respective artists at least in the case of Rick Ross and even Nicki to an extent. I love the instrumentals, a lot of them do a great job at conveying a sense of larger than life grandiose opulence that really helps sell Kanye&#39;s delivery and sometimes silly lyrics. All of the issues I really found myself having with the album were very minor, like some of the songs feel slightly drawn out, or the mixing is a little off, etc... <br>I never watched Anthony&#39;s old review, but upon listening through his thought process here, I completely understand where he&#39;s coming from on almost every point he makes. I disagree with a vast majority of them, but it&#39;s not hard to see why someone might feel the way he does. I have tolerance for corny bars and overproduction for the most part, but of course those things are going to be major issues for some people. <br>My personal score for this album based on how much i enjoyed it would be between a 9.5-9.9 <br>Mostly because the problems I have with it don&#39;t really affect my personal enjoyment at all at least in this case, if they did the score would be lower but they don&#39;t.<br>A strong 5 to a 6 feels a bit harsh when just looking at it, but considering how many facets this album has and how different people look for and take issue with different things when listening to music, it&#39;s not hard to see someone not liking the album all that much.
Now that the Record for Hype was released/cracked a third review would not be bad. <br>Just hopping for a better score by the never heard bars and tracks.
Kanye West has talent. <br><b><i>And he is still one of the most idiots and asshole celebrities in history.</i></b>
he‚Äôs so good at making a great album sound like shit
Fuc*in idiot
subbed at the start of the vid and unsubbed at the end, thanks i hate it
Runaway is the greatest song ever!
10 hours ago, melon gave Logic a seven,<br><br><br>but Kanye a 6<br><br>I&#39;ll let that sink in.........
Fuck you Anthony, you don‚Äôt know anything about music you nerd! üò†üò†üò†
Something we can agree on.  All of the lights is annoying.  It&#39;s the synthesized trumpets.  Just use real trumpets.  Please.
This copy is for Hype Williams
How could you do this to me Anthony?

Anthony Fantano for President 2020!!!
2010: Light to Decent 6<br>2020: Strong 5 to Light 6<br><br>I have come to the conclusion that if Kanye released this album in 1870, it&#39;d be a strong 10.
This is just proof that if you word things correctly you can play pretend and confidently lie to yourself and an audience of millions of people lol
spitting about how rich you are over poppy beats is what y&#39;all considering masterpiece?!, y&#39;all have no taste lol
Yooooo this mans subscribers are toxic and a bunch of pompous asses thinking they know music üòÇüòÇ
I like all of Kanye&#39;s vocals/lyrics on this album, even the stupid ones. They make it feel more raw in contrast to how heavily produced the beat is. The overarching thing that I don&#39;t like is how the samples are not subtle, taking the entire best part of a song, and often come from songs I already really like. You might think that would be a good thing, but it feels too familiar and do not make the songs greater than the sum of their parts. It&#39;s like if I took my favourite guitar solo, piano piece, drum fills, sewed them all together (very well) and pasted my favourite verse over it. It&#39;s kind of cool in a novelty way, but I&#39;m just left wanting to hear the original songs the samples are taken from instead. For me, it&#39;s not restrained enough.
Fantano says this is a fun way to celebrate 2 million subs but this looks a lot more like bullying for 20 minutes.
Bro, there‚Äôs basically only primary colors in this videoüòÇ
10
Fantano really cursed 2020 with this review
I really like you usually. It‚Äôs so hard to listen to these two reviews though. I think this is a 10 no question.
I don&#39;t know this guy but I won&#39;t be watching any of his other videos. It seems like he&#39;s trying to convince himself of the album&#39;s mediocrity more so than us.
talked about it like it was a 7 or 8 then gives it a fucking light 6 again
I just came out of a 10 year coma. And this homie had the balls to give this album a 6 twice. I‚Äôm going back under
I know this video came out six months ago but I still have nightmares about Anthony calling runaway kinda cringe
Fuck you melon mbdtf 10/10
This continues to be the worst news of 2020, melon
When kanye becomes president you should do another review, and lower it. You know, to remind him who&#39;s boss.
Even though it&#39;s his opinion its still wrong
10/10<br>Fav tracks: Runaway, Blame Game, Lost In The World, Devil In A New Dress, Dark Fantasy, Georgeous, Power, Hell Of a Life, So Appalled, Monster, All Of The Lights
Yeah the mix on that album is sloppy... and the tone gets a little cringe at time! I get why melon gave it a 6
I can‚Äôt even enjoy kanye anymore melon man has spoken 6 to 5 to 6
Do it again
Captain insano shows no mercy
I honestly hope theneedledrop hits 10 mill√≥n subs
How can he say jay showed good lyricism when one of his lines is ‚Äúrape and pillage a village of women and children‚Äù easily one of the most uncomfortably bad lines I‚Äôve ever heard in a rap song and the rest of the verse is weak too. He opens up by naming a list of monsters. I don‚Äôt know how it could get cheesier. Also Nicki‚Äôs verse was phenomenal, so much energy and emotion and the lines you criticize here are absolutely fine. The verse broke her out into the main stream. I don‚Äôt see how you can praise Jay and then go on to bash nicki, at LEAST you have to acknowledge that jays verse was trash
Listen to the dissect podcast, It‚Äôs hard to argue that it‚Äôs less than a 9 after that
Get ready to call him President West
I dont understand how this album is the 12th highest rated on RYM, I enjoyed the samples, beats and lush guitar solos but I couldn&#39;t get passed the lyrics about dicks and pussies, the chris rock skit turned it from a 2.5/5 to a 2/5 to me.
He didn&#39;t add a least fav and fav tracks because every track would be in fav
you beating a dead horse mate
when hes president, i hope youll be penalised for your crimes
Thank you for your thoughts on Runaway lol. His verses are absolutely horrendous in this song and his effort for singing is really low. I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s a bad track, but it&#39;s not that great either.
Melon is just mad that Kanye didn‚Äôt come to him for some extra credit after the original review üòò
Lol
this man gave lil pump a better rating
Balding melon taking 10/10 from y‚Äôall
This pops up in my recommended alot and I know it&#39;s yt bullying me
The second half is easily the better half haha
Why do people dislike videos just because they disagree.
RIP Fantano bout to face charges for treason for this rating once President Kanye comes into office
Lol literally a top 5 rap album ever. He‚Äôs on crack.
Good luck explaining this to the president West
You must do one of Swimming again please
Dark Fantasy and Power alone make MBDTF a 6/10. What are you on Melon?
Jesus Christ he tore into Runaway :(
22 minutes? Boring, that&#39;s too long, I give this review a 5/10, disliked.
he‚Äôs not a big kanye fan, and i can except that, but in my opinion, this album is above a six, but that is my opinion..
silly melon, the 1 in 10 isnt supposed to connect to the 0
I respect your opinion about the album, not my favorite Kanye album but I still like it. The song hell of a life, I like that song, but I can see why you don&#39;t like, it&#39;s my guilty pleasure song, don&#39;t judge em Joe Brown, lol.
Alright it&#39;s been 6 months please re-review MBDTF
I did not know about this, now I&#39;m really mad.
No need to watch the video he gave it a 10 thank you kanyethony westano
Fuck you dad
His HS crush got fucked to this album that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs so hard on it lol
Best part of the about the whole MBDTF thing is actually this comment section.
Nicki Minaj&#39;s verse in Monster is still fire
Please re-re-review this album melon
The worst review on this channel. No wait, the original was even worse.
You won, Anthony. Enjoy the ad money, I hope it makes you happy. Dear lord, what a sad little life, Anthony. You ruined my night completely so you could have the ad money and I hope now you can spend it on lessons in grace and decorum. Because you have all the grace of a reversing dump truck without any tyres on. So Anthony, take your money and get off my property.
WAR CRIMES
Kanye‚Äôs immature and meaningless lyrics in places are what makes him so great. He doesn‚Äôt cater to the charts or to critics, he does what he wants and what he enjoys, both with his music and his public image. Greatest album of all time by the greatest artist of all time.
I&#39;m pretty sure fantano accidentally gave that 9 upside-down.
Fuck off hell of a life has a really good abd unique hook it sounds magnetic
Thank to the blue shirt he went from theneedledrop to theneedledrip
Review it again in 2023 to celebrate this album 10th birthday melon
Runaway Will forever be an amazing and flawless track
LITW is one of the best songs on the album. the first line you hate so much was a love letter to kim kardashian. the twisted vocals fit with the theme of the album and the sound through out the song changes and evolves well
Why did y‚Äôall even like the video
Idk why yall mad.. he gave this album a 6/6.. it is a great score right?
He took back almost everything he said in the original I‚Äôm so confused so is it worse???
So basically<br><br>FAV TRACKS: DARK FANTASY, GORGEOUS, POWER, DEVIL IN A NEW DRESS<br><br>WORST TRACK: HELL OF A LIFE
Turn 6 upside-down, now it‚Äôs a 9
Review it again
still an 8 or 9
Mbdtf is a 8-9 but yall not ready for that convo
You&#39;re an idiot
This man right here is the biggest troll ever
12/10 (stolen from the top comment)
bro no
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=328">5:28</a> Sleepy Hollow is also a neighborhood in Chicago. Do you even do your research, &quot;Internet&#39;s Busiest Music Nerd?&quot;
Ok if you don‚Äôt like the last two tracks there‚Äôs no hope
A six? I‚Äôm new to this channel but  a six??
The day you gave The Money Store a 10 but The Power That B a 9 you Lost all your respect
ANTI BY RIHANNA DESERVES A REDUX REVIEW
Nah bro, MBDTF is his masterpiece
What the fuck does the blue flannel mean
Fax it‚Äôs a 6
Everyone has their opinions, like personally &#39;All of the lights&#39; is one of my favourites and my man here would give it a weak 4. It&#39;s legit our own taste in music talking.
10
no
bro if kanye made this album you would&#39;ve given it a 6/10
After a cursory listen through this album... I just hate the way it sounds. I think much of the music and vocals are grating to listen to, especially the first three quarters of the album. I‚Äôd personally give it a light to decent 4 if I‚Äôm being honest
I&#39;m scared to say this but I actually kinda agree with his rating of the album. Yeezus is the only solo Kanye album that I enjoy to the fullest. Please don&#39;t hurt me.
So when‚Äôs the redux review coming for Under Pressure where you can take back all the lies about Logic being a copycat of Kendrick Lamar, and using the same samples as him even though he used the samples of someone else?  Or to take back the criticisms about Logic including production details in his songs, like having his producer mention the piano key on the song, which btw is just the dumbest criticism I‚Äôve ever heard.  Or maybe to take back that Metropolis is the worst song on the album because that‚Äôs some of the most cap I‚Äôve ever encountered.  Still love you melon, but sometimes you‚Äôre subjective opinion is just wrong.  Nothing but love melonüòòüçà
I agree with him on Runaway, I never got the hype behind that song and I think there are many songs in Kanye‚Äôs discography that are way better
i‚Äôm glad melon highlighted how overrated runaway is.
I can see the track ‚ÄúWho will survive in America‚Äù fitting on the album TPAB.
I think the album is a 7-8/10 but definitely overrated
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=1304">21:44</a> That&#39;s my favorite part
What I like about this video is that he added very solid and thought-provoking points to a review that he made 10 years ago. The album is great, but it&#39;s far from perfect. Leave the dude alone.
Bro some of the best songs on here he doesn&#39;t like. Fantano ain&#39;t a person that really enjoys great music.
everybody knows this album isnt a 6, including melon. he fucked up bad, and he refuses to give the ppl the score it really deserves lol
This is an album that absolutely has its flaws, for sure, but I feel like the insane high quality of the OTHER material pulls it up, more so than almost any other album I can think of. Runaway, Blame Game and the very end are ass, but everything else is so good it can&#39;t NOT be like an 8/10. I mean Jesus, that opening stretch all the way up thru So Appalled is INSANE
The one thing I have to say about his review is how hes fixated on music/this album being relatable. <br>The album doesn&#39;t have to be relatable and he constantly makes it a downside. The title literally says fantasy it&#39;s a crazy fantasy and it&#39;s kinda dumb to say &quot;it not relatable&quot; constantly at that.<br><br>Idk I believe that if ALL music, movies, and other stuff were relatable it would get boring fast.
The bad songs here are better than the good songs in lil pumps mixtape bruhhhhhh
Nit picking like he‚Äôs a sexual predator
most overrated hip hop album ever. spit the truth melon
Igor redux physical release?
I surprisingly 100% agree with Anthony on this one
Thank you I always hated Nicki Minaj‚Äôs intro. And Nicki Minaj‚Äôs verse on Monster is obnoxious. Guess I don‚Äôt like Nicki Minaj too much<br><br>But man the Rick Ross feature on Devil in a New Dress is great come on Anthony
I imagine that Anthony will rereview this record one last time on his deathbed. He‚Äôll say that his eyes have been opened as to what it is and he gives his final review ever a light 5.
Anyone laugh when he said farty baseline
He doesn&#39;t like Nicki&#39;s classic verse, I&#39;m done
I always skip Gorgeous
Still find the ending of &#39;Lost In The World&#39; is haunting I swear at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=208">3:28</a> of that song to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=224">3:44</a> a heavy vocoid is saying &#39;whole life over&#39; but it&#39;s never mentioned in any lyrics sites help me out am I wigging out?
Lil pump 7/10
I come here to cry every day
In 10 more years, he&#39;s gonna to a Fetch The Bolt Cutters redux review only to give the same score.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=103">1:43</a> wtf is soul chopping? i looked it up and thats not even a word
I love Runaway, hell of a life and blame game
Great review and I completely agree with most of your criticisms, this is one of the most overrated and overblown albums of all time, I actually think your rating is quite generous, I would rate it 4/10 at best (I really don&#39;t get how an album this uneven and full of awful lyrics can be considered a masterpiece, but okay....)
Now redux House of Balloons
Now redux House of Balloons
Some people just don&#39;t like certain albums. Different strokes for different folks.
I think the song monster would be much better if Nicki minajs verse was shorter. I think it goes on for too long.
I love this album but The College Dropout is my favourite Ye album.
LMAOOO IVE BEEN SEEING THESE MBDTF MEMES FOR MONTHS AND DIDNT KNOW HE RE-REVIEWED IT AND GAVE IT THE SAME SCORE LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOO IM FUCKIN DEAD
I am in Australia. Now it‚Äôs a 9/10, which is basically a 10/10. Thank you, Anthony - very cool!
Ur wrong
How dare you @ Nicki like that?
Redo House of Balloons!
Lmao sleepy hollow bar went over ur head bro.
Sees blue flannel: <b>CONFUSED SCREAMING</b>
Seriously how can you not fuck w/ the guitar riff on Gorgeous? I&#39;ll never understand your big brain, Melon.
The more I listen to MBDTF,the more I disagree with Anthony. That album is not a 10/10,but atleast a 8/10. Anthony is just a hipster
If Power is anything to go by, then Kanye would have been counting the hours on his ticking clock, and since there are 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 is 6 times 10, Anthony is really hinting that MBDTF is a 10 out of 10.<br><br>Either way, JIK still the worst thing he‚Äôs dropped.
MBDTF: An Opera by Stanley Kubrick<br>TPAB: A play by Spike lee
If he rates it a 0 he‚Äôs implying there‚Äôs a 1 in front of it. MBDTF 10/10
If MBDTF was named &quot;To Pimp A Butterfly&quot;, you would have given it a 10
Wow the opening is as good as anything from Jan 1 - Jan 20 2020 thats quite a compiment
I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever agreed with this guy on anything in any of his videos, his opinions are always opposite of mine
IMO i think the instrumental on AOTL is near perfect, im just not too keen on the drums
I agree with pretty much every single thing in this review except the the idea that Nicki Minaj‚Äôs verse in Monster was anything less than the single best pop music moment of the 2010s and a moment that nothing in the rest of her career has ever been able to live up to.
Hey Anthony! Your take on all of the lights is still wrong! Who hurt you?
AAAAAAWAA TURN THE LIGHTS OUT
Omg hes finally goint to give it a 10. So happy rn :))
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ<br><br>You see older Kanye as brilliant bc he agreed with your politics<br><br>But you mock and call crazy the modern Kanye bc he doesn‚Äôt.<br><br>This is a YOU problem, not a Kanye problem. And it‚Äôs petty as sh-t.
This is the moment I stopped trusting you. To give this album anything less than a 9 is a crime. In my opinion, 1 of 2 albums to rival TPAB (the other being RAM, even though it is stylistically hard to draw such comparisons)
Lost in the World is a love song written by Kanye to Kim, maybe that will help give some context to it that makes it mean more, feel more personal.
I couldn‚Äôt disagree more about runaway and hell of a lie
The album that changed music forever
He gave this a 6 which is 3/5 which is .60 we would round that to 1, which makes it a 5/5 which is a ten.<br><br>This album is a ten.
Farty ass basslines
went back to this review because i was too happy today and i wanted to get mad at something
Anthony &quot;Farty Ass  Bassline&quot; Fantano
Fukn troll ü§£
Review:Serious<br>Comments:sarcasm and humor
REVIEW IT AGAIN DAMMIT. THIRD TIMES THE CHARM FOR GETTING IT RIGHT
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok if you disagree with me I can‚Äôt force you to be right‚Äù - Kanye
I don‚Äôt really see how it falls apart at the end. Blame game, lost in the world, and who will survive in america are bops
Anthony just runaway, don&#39;t wanna play the blame game but your lost in the world of your own dark fantasy. I&#39;m so appalled, I broke all of the lights in my house, man were they gorgeous. And you just have it all don&#39;t you, the power to make people hate this album, what a hell of a life you must have. You&#39;re a monster Anthony, a devil in the same dress.
He is just fucking with us at this point
fuck you.
What the fuck
This has been a shit year so far and it all started because of this video
For someone that finds Kanye‚Äôs ‚Äúbravado‚Äù and ‚Äúbraggadocious punchlines‚Äù funny, you sure did shit on runaway
The only album in a decade that Pitchfork gave a 10, recently they gave fiona apple&#39;s new album a 10, a DECADE after Fantasy... anthony gives it a SIX, yeah he&#39;s just a compulsively contrarian troll.
If this album was 7 songs like ye is it would be a 10<br>Dark Fantasy, Gorgeous, Power, Monster, So Appalled, Devil in a new dress &amp; Runaway
When did Kanye decide to swallow the red pill?
You got the meaning absolutely wrong on all of the lights. It‚Äôs not about domestic abuse. I lost all respect for you when u didn‚Äôt give this album a 10
All jokes aside I don‚Äôt understand how he can hate this.
kanye: makes a musical masterpiece. Fantano: 6.<br>death grips: takes a dump into the microphone. Fantano: 10.
10/10
It‚Äôs not embarrassing lol. Very similar to a punk rock song by suicide called ‚ÄúFrankie teardrop‚Äù as far as the way he wanted to set the tone with these straight up off setting lyrics... this is hip hop you really need to realize that when reviewing these albums that was done purposely that man knows he was killing it and chose to throw you off.
Heard a lot of people say they don‚Äôt like CyHi verse but tbh it‚Äôs one of my fave features on the album
Hate it here
Mr Melon man <br><br>Your wrong <br><br><br><br><br>Your not coming to my birthday party
i did not understand/remember anything you said but im hearing you say its a good album?
For some reason he‚Äôs overly critical of Kanye... probably because he‚Äôs black
I grew to love Melon after the first MBDTF review. When I was younger and less sure of myself, I was trying to impress a cute girl who loved Kanye. I told her MBDTF was Kanye‚Äôs ‚Äúmasterpiece‚Äù because I saw the reviews and thought it was a safe opinion. Truthfully, I tried to get into the album several times and just didn‚Äôt like it much. Then I heard Melon‚Äôs review and thought, ‚Äúfinally, someone who agrees with me about this.‚Äù
How can you talk so highly about most of this album and still only give it a 6...
Finally, some common sense .
This is why I unsubscribed
Noooo he did it again
I feel like while your reviews are detailed and objective the numerical values you give usually are completely subjective and have nothing to do with what you said about the album, as you have no problem giving relatively mediocre albums which you review more negatively the same score. I think that‚Äôs the main problem people have with this review. Also, please release my sister from your basement, it‚Äôs been three weeks and all she said was that she doesn‚Äôt understand what MC Ride is saying half the time.
Your hairline is a 6/10
If this was a Kanye review you would have given it a 5
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=1096">18:16</a> the alpha melon man has spoken. R.I.P Kanye‚Äôs ego üòî
‚ÄúSo much head I woke up to sleepy hollow ‚Äú he‚Äôs saying that he received so much head that one day he woke up and his head fell off.
Well your not invited to my birthday party.
YOU DID IT AGAIN
Not putting the original cover on the wall? 6/10 review
2 months later i realise this came out on my birthday (and the anniversary of Bowie&#39;s death)
No Cap, I knew 2020 was cancelled the moment he started talking about all of the lights. Smh...This was the first sign of the chain of tragedies to come
wtf
You guys gotta realize that Melon isn‚Äôt always gonna be right, nothing‚Äôs perfect. Except the MMLP of course.
I‚Äôm 15 and was too young when this came out so in a way the fact you made these reviews and got a lot of people talking made me go back and listen to this masterpiece, and know it‚Äôs my fave album of all time.<br><br>What a beautiful dark twisted review.
I‚Äôm actually having a hard time believing that there are people who don‚Äôt like all of the lights
This makes me mad
I like all of the lights :( I think it&#39;s a fun song
So this album is basically a 5 now? That‚Äôs weak.
dude Runaway is the best song off the album :(
thank you for finally giving it a 12 which is what it should be
Petition for Kanye to update album so fantano can give the album a ten
You should do a redux redux at 3 mil, and maybe the album would‚Äôve improved, u never know ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Runaway worst song IMO. I didn&#39;t mind All of The Lights but near half the album warranted a skip for me.
Please review old Eminem
Mans doesn‚Äôt like when Kanye sounds like a guitar. but when he sounds like guns... 10/10 album BABYYYY
It‚Äôs incredibly strange to me that some people don‚Äôt listen to this album at least 4 times a week.
I think it&#39;s a 8/10.
You are very stupid not to appreciate this album Melon. You are knowledgeable about music but have horrible taste.
HELL OF A LIFE IS A BANGER U FUCK
All of the lights does not make light of abuse you sjw. What a clown
HOW THE FUCK IS ALL OF THE LIGHTS BAD???!
This review is still hot garbage, MBDTF is a fucking masterpiece and to call yourself a ‚Äúcritic‚Äù and call this a 6 is bewildering to me
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=282">4:42</a> how could anthony do that so accurately
How the actual FUCK can you dislike runaway
This was easily nickis best verse hands down you crazy
Hope you get under 2 million subs
TE ODIO MELON DE MIERDA
bruh you&#39;re like so removed from the culture its rediculous that Nicki Minaj verse is what most rappers hope to accomplish in their life she is vocally embodying the track and outshined everyone the flow and inflection is the point of that verse. I&#39;m completely shocked. &quot;She overshot it&quot; whaaaaaaat???? lmao anyways these are fun to watch you explain so thuroughly how you don&#39;t understand the point of artistry.
See I love lost in the world and the song that comes on right after that but I guess I am one of the few...
he liked his own video like bruh
He ranked die lit higher than this album haha die lit is tuff tho
The album to me is like a strong 7 to a light 8. But no, it‚Äôs not a 10
melon this aint it
ok I always felt weird when everyone I knew was gushing over this album and I was only playing like the first half of it. Glad melon agrees lol
fucking hate this guy
this review sucks!!!!! thumbs down
Fuck u melon i hate u
How do u not like hell of a life :(
About your Jesus Is King review&#39;s side rant:<br>1. &quot;One unhinged interview after another&quot; No one listens to what he is saying half the time. The other half, people are too afraid to admit that they agree with him. Everyone,  EVERYONE knows what he meant with slavery. His point was that slavery ended, yet Blacks choose the new slavery of one party rule; the one party who think welfare is good enough for Blacks (as long as Blacks repay in votes...)<br>2. &quot;Embrace of Trump&quot;<br>What gives Fantano the nerve to say that Black people can&#39;t support a Republican? Hmmm... What about the 37% to 40% (Pew, Quinnipiac, ABC and other nonpartisan polling firms) of Black people who approve of Trump&#39;s performance? That&#39;s a really high number considering the constant and hypocritical bashing he gets in Black media. (The same Black media who hold viscous and pure racists like Sharpton and Farrakhan to such high esteem.)<br>3. &quot;Candace Owens&quot; - see number 2, then try reading one of her articles or watching a video of hers that isn&#39;t edited by someone opposed to her beliefs. <br>Whatever though, that&#39;s just Fantano&#39;s desperate virtue signaling he&#39;s done ever since the Fader wrote an honest, yet mean spirited article on him.<br>Fantano, get used to it. Black people (myself included) are leaving the DNC plantation. You think endless welfare and project housing gave me a happy childhood? Nah, I was a miserable, petty crack dealer when at 20 years old, I had enough. I finished my GED, then 2 years community college with a part time job and grants. Finally, I transferred and graduated with a Pharm. D. You know who had the best advice to keep working to get out of the system? Ben MF Shapiro.<br>What good do you do for others, Fantano?<br>Oh, btw, prison reform... Obama? Nope. Trump? Yep. Kim and Kanye actually had something to do with that. Meek Mill wanted to work on that with Trump too, but he got shamed out of it. (Apparently, he did work with Trump on it later behind closed doors.)
How is his life dark? What a thing to say. There‚Äôs a reason I won‚Äôt subscribe. You think too highly of your opinion.
Are you perhaps mad, brother?
House of Balloons?
Unsubscribed when he did this the first time around, glad to know I‚Äôm still justified in thinking he has no business reviewing hip hop, at all. Like never again, just stop. Not a true fan or guest of the culture, still making nothing but click bait with idiotic opinions on a culture that is not his to judge.
I don‚Äôt get the critique that the album ends super weak. I mean, Hell of a Life I understand, but Blame Game is solid and Lost in The World is a classic Kanye track.
It‚Äôs good but the songs are too long
Thanks for the re-review Melon. It&#39;s refreshing to see someone sticking to their guns, not succumbing to pressure from their followers and speaking their mind. Unsubscribed
according to Cole from Dissect the domestic violence theme from All of the Lights could be interpreted as his social faux pas of the VMA interruption which basically halted his career for a bit. and tbh I agree with that theory
I respectfully disagree thank you.
He lowered the score from light 6 to strong 5 to light 6
Great review Melon. Even though most would not agree with the rating I feel like you explained the reasoning behind it very well. But I don&#39;t agree with it either. Yes, people do forget about &quot;lows&quot; on this record, but it&#39;s just because the &quot;highs&quot; on it are unmatchable(and yes the beginning of an album is better than the ending). I agree that the album (and certain songs) feel dragged out for no reason, and some parts on it feel kinda &quot;overrated&quot;, but I think Kanye manages to showcase his &quot;dark and twisted fantasy&quot; perfectly. His creativity is off the charts on this album, and even though it has many, many, many features on it, it still remains a Kanye&#39;s album. Definitely a classic in my eyes, and in eyes of many, but your review is reasonable &amp; respectable and can see why it&#39;s rated with ONLY a 6.<br><br><br>Review Rating: He a little confused, but he got the spirit/10<br><br><br>P.S. Fuck your &quot;Runaway&quot; opinion tho<br><br><br>Sincerely, A Guy That Actually Talks About Reviewed Albums On Anthony Fantano&#39;s Videos
Can we just appreciate the fact that he gave one of the highest rated and most critically acclaimed albums a 6? He is individualistic we can give him that.
Fantano is spittin&#39; in this review. Agree 100%
this is the greatest hip hop album of all time Fantano what the fuck?
Is anyone else upset about how he didn‚Äôt put favorites and least favorite in the description?
As a Kanye fan myself MBDTF is a heavy 7 but this album loses me after ‚ÄúHell Of A Life‚Äù not a fan of blame game nor chris rock talking about some girls pussy for a solid 2 minutes I know Kanye fans instantly get offended of judging this album not on is top 3 albums it‚Äôs a 4 for me
no. runaway good. fantano bad.
Someone needs to listen to Dissect
holy crap he doesn&#39;t like &quot;All of the Lights.&quot; Whoa, Melon with his deliberate contrarianism coming all the way out.
i honestly have been agreeing with fantano with this one, it doesnt have the sound id expect from a classic outstanding album, and i do like some of the tracks here.
‚ÄúHave you given this album a listen?‚Äù
Could you review 24kGoldn‚Äôs DROPPED OUTTA COLLEGE pls
Could you review 24kGoldn‚Äôs DROPPED OUTTA COLLEGE pls
The lyrics on Runaway aren‚Äôt supposed to be cute
How was this not posted on April 1st
He&#39;s fucking right though. Kanye Wests music has never been good.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=1093">18:13</a>
Personally, it seems like you don&#39;t truly drive into the music in the right mind set that you should and that because of this, you do not gain a true understanding to what the artist is trying to show.
It just goes to show how much the cult-like fanbase worships Kanye West. He says he&#39;s a god, and the fans agree.<br><br><br><br>Oh and I gave MBDTF a 5/10
Now re-review Born This Way! That album deserves way more of a re-review.
The bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling
6/10 you bellend ???   THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ALBUMS OF THE CENTURY ! NOT EVEN IN RAP ... IN WHOLE MUSIC INDUSTRY  U IDIOT
okay but what about &#39;i don&#39;t need your pussy bitch im on my own dick&#39; <br><br><br>fucking bars dude
This guy&#39;s so good at his job the got the right answer twice in a row.
Review it again melon man
This album is easily an 11/10. I still replay songs off it ten years later. I mean &quot;Hell of a Life,&quot; &quot;So Appalled,&quot; and &quot;Devil in a New Dress&quot; contain some of the best beats and lyrics I&#39;ve ever heard in any hip-hop song.
You gave MBDTF a 6 but MBDTF a <b>SIX?</b>
Melon the type of teacher to not let his students turn in late work
Imagine throwing a tantrum because someone has a different opinion than you
Going by the comment section a lot of you need to learn how to live with opinions that differ from yours<br> The world would be a boring place if we all enjoyed the same things.
I remember when you had like, 50k followers... maybe fewer haha. Congrats Anthony!
I disagree Hell of a Life is a great song!
Album is definitely overrated. Solid review
Yeah, I never really understood why everyone pretends this album is so good. It&#39;s bad rapping over ok beats.
Love the album and the film but I agreed with most your points and Im kind of realizing I don&#39;t like the album as much as I thought and I do skip a couple tracks and tend to  space out during the second half
Why do you have to hurt me twice, melon?
If MDBTF would‚Äôve been just 8 tracks it would‚Äôve be amazing
Never knew about this channel until today when I saw a comment on all of the lights that he gave that album a 6. I guess YouTube algorithm knew not to recommend this nut to me.
Anthony &quot;Lil pump &gt; Kanye West&quot; Fantano
Nicki Minaj&#39;s part in Monster describes herself. I hope you understand why she switches from this tone to that tone because she has two personas. A dark one (the monster) and the barbie one.
youre a sad man melon
&quot;And I always find, yeah I always find somethin&#39; wrong&quot; -fantano critiquing MBDTF
Humming to gorgeous` beat for 20 minutes is not a review anthony
Remember this guy gave DAMN. a 7 let that sink in.
Tbh tbh people we know this is the best album of the decade if he gives it a 6 that‚Äôs fine it‚Äôs fine it‚Äôs his opinion it doesn‚Äôt matter.
Kanye&#39;s celebrity profile hasn&#39;t really grown larger than his profile as a musician. Sure, right now, his profile as a celebrity might be trending more, but in the long run his legacy is going to be as a rapper/producer more than as just a nut on TMZ and in a MAGA hat standing next to Trump.
(Hates the vocoded 3 minute ending of Runaway)<br>(Jizzes over a minute and a half of noise on any Clipping song)<br><br>Jokes aside, I respect and understand your critiques of this album. I still think it&#39;s an 8-9.
The only person I&#39;ve seen with the same issues I had minus power and all of the lights. Power feels a little corny to me and all of the lights trashy drums sounds good to me
Dickhead
Here we go again ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Thanks to God having the lust subscribers doesn‚Äôt mean to be in the truth. 10 years after and you still doesn‚Äôt understand shit about that album... everybody in the game still say this album is a masterpiece with TPAB but you still same with weak argument come from weak ears. Man go to IKEA to buy new ears...
Runaway: is made to be sing in that Way. That‚Äôs song is Kanye be naked, true, and yes put yourself naked is embarrassing and not really beautiful. And all the end with is voice is him speaking the beginning of the song but the perspective of the audience : for them is a noise when he is trully himself
Still doesn‚Äôt understand All of the lights ü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è : the girl in the song is ‚Äòfame‚Äô : ¬´¬†I slap my girl...¬†¬ª the tyler Swift incidents etc... c‚Äômon men you have 2mil subs...
Something wrong, I hold my head, another 6, my dreams are dead
it‚Äôs a pretty good album
Pablo &gt; MBDTW all day
Did he pretty much say Nicki Minaj verse was wack?
Oh no Melon what are you doing?
Did this technically get a 9 in Australia?
now we need a redux review of house of balloons melon
You would&#39;ve given the album a 10/10 if it was called &quot;My Beautiful White Twisted Fantasy&quot;
Reminds me of conor when he said: Id like to apologize... to absolutely fucking no one.
You know this shit is... fucking rediclis
friendly reminder that melon&#39;s reviews are based on his enjoyment of the album and that his preferences and focus may be completely different to your own when evaluating an album even if he highlights certain things he enjoys in his review.<br><br>that being said:<br><br><br>this review is uncorrect.<br>a light six? all i can do is quote your miley cyrus and her dead petz review at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=793">13:13</a>
2029: Well actually To Pimp a Butterfly was trash
Fantano 9 years ago: light to decent 6<br>Fantano now: Strong 5 to light 6<br><br>He lowered it. Respect for not conforming.<br><br><br>Unsubbed
Hahah why do we keep coming back if this wigga doesn‚Äôt understand it is the best album of the last decade, maybe 2 decades
Dawg... Fuck You
Disagree with the score, but I love how well you articulated and explained why you don&#39;t enjoy it as much. Great review melon.
i always thought this album sucked. im glad he didnt change his review. it should be a fucking 0
THIS GUY DISRESPECTS RUNAWAY WITH SUCH IGNORANCE
Kanye is a Christian now, so he himself would strongly disapprove of this ungodly album
Honestly, while I like this album more than Melon and believe it was a super strong return to form for Kanye, I&#39;d rank it lower on a personal scale too.
I agree.
&quot;Farty ass bass lines&quot; HAHAHAHAHA
Please do a review on deltron 3030 thanks!
If you think MBDTF is Ye&#39;s best album, have you ever actually listened to the rest of his discography lol
So many Ye albums are far superior to MBDTF lmao. People are so butthurt
I wish we could see melons favorites and least favorite
Lived rent free so long I woke up in Sleepy Hollow.
The Sleepy Hollow thing makes sense. If you &quot;give SO MUCH head&quot; you would end up headless.
A: I have given this album a listen<br>A: I loved it<br>A: I would rate it a 9 or 10
I genuinely don&#39;t remember this album. I don&#39;t remember a single song off of it.
<b>in Greata Thunberg</b> HOW DARE YOU!
You need to listen to j aubreys version you missed it by a mile
Was about to rant until I read the last line of the description.
But seriously, in my opinion, everything after Devil in a New Dress is either super mediocre or literal trash. Except for Who Will Survive In America.
Best album since the turn of the millennium:<br>6
Wow I can&#39;t believe people are so upset he gave this album one point lower than it should be
he tried guys, he really did
How can you not like the album Fantano? Seriously Fantano MBDTF is one of Kanye&#39;s best albums
Great review as usual, but advocating and defending the use of blackface during early 20th century minstrel shows halfway through was a bit of a head scratcher for me.
You gave it a 6 only because you have an Ugly, Light, Straight Fantasy
I don‚Äôt approve of this !!!!! This is Kanye‚Äôs perfect Album I will communicate him over this review and hell will b raised
N O B O D Y<br>C A R E S
Wow now you&#39;re just boring af üòë
I feel like Melon just don&#39;t understand Ye at all
If you dont relate to runaway then this album isnt for you...
How tf did swimming apparently get a 3 but this buthole got a 6? A fuckin 6? Geeyuunet melon man wtf happened lol
Too late to save face. Your credibility is flawed. üíØ
Although I‚Äôm glad you admitted the true reason you gave the album a 6, I don‚Äôt think you had to call him the n-word quite so many times, and I was a little shocked that you dragged his kids into it.
Respect Antwon Fantwon. After 30k dislikes and only 10k likes and years and years of love and admiration towards MBDTF, you stick with your guns, continue to like what you like and hate what you hate. Wish I could be more like you.
Wow, you unironically don‚Äôt get that Sleepy Hollow line.
You are bitch fantano!
You want me to listen to My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy?<br>No thanks, Anthony Decentano from the needle drops only gave it a 6.
one of my professors told me that we could request for her to redo our grades for our assignments but she reserves the right to make the grade lower and this review is really giving me that vibe.
Album been overrated, this melon nigga did good stickin to his guns
Do a Redux Review of House of Balloons now
Here because of the twitter video.
he really talked down on nicki‚Äôs verse. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I think this album is overrated but it‚Äôs still very good. Minimum 7-8/10. Not a 10 like college dropout or late registration
I agree that Power is the best track on the album, but I disagree about All of the Lights. All of the Lights is a banger, still to this dayüî•
You&#39;re laughing, you gave a long awaited re-review with the same rating as the original and you&#39;re laughing
Fantano: <b>gives album 6 the first time</b><br><br>Fans : turn it up <br><br>Fantano: <b>gives 6 again</b><br><br>Fantano: that‚Äôs the max
1980&#39;s - It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back<br>1990&#39;s - Illmatic<br>2000&#39;s - Madvillainy<br>2010&#39;s - MBDTF<br><br><br>Just understand how good this album is. It&#39;s a generational masterpiece.
lmao all these triggered Kanye fanatics that can&#39;t handle someone not heavenly praising Kanyes most overrated album. Go back to bed, children.
do recovery (Eminem) <br>make a review on that album
Another example of how Kanye is so far ahead of his time. Even a decade later, the world is still not ready for this masterpiece.
Seeing Fantano break down Ye‚Äôs lyrics is just <b>chefs kiss</b> inject this content into my veins
This man stays true to his word. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs up Melon man
That Line about the college porn search history was classic man
You are such a hater Needledrop. It&#39;s no less than a 9. I give it a 10. Its just got everything going for it. Lyrics...Beats. The songs go together etc.
Spot on. Fuck the Kanye fanboys. The album is what is it is.<br>I personally haven‚Äôt heard it, I detest Kanye so much I can never be impartial.
False.
I played this video on my phone while playing MBDTF on Spotify on my Roku switching track when Anthony changed track in his album review. This will now on be the way I watch Fantano&#39;s reviews.
Did this man really just say that Cyhi&#39;s verse was the weakest? nigga wtf?
What is album behind him on bottom?
On Runaway, I always cut out the distorted outer, and edit the intro piano into an incomplete silence as the outro. It sounds a lot better.
This album is better than your top album of the decade, Melon. <br><br><br><br>TPAB is actually my #2 so not by much.
I just downvote for the meme
I love this üí™üí™üí™
Don&#39;t get why everyone is that upset over this review. I don&#39;t care that much for Kanye or Nikki in general. I don&#39;t hate them, I like a few things here and there, but the overall feeling is eh. <br><br>But so? Ain&#39;t that what music is? Don&#39;t we all got different tastes? Like you listen to Zounds or Filmmaker, Burial or Einsturzende Neubauten and tell me how you feel bout it. Yeah they&#39;re niche so a limited amount of people care about those artists and most never heard of them, and just as Kanye is mainstream and well known, for millions of people who love him, there are hundreds of thousands who actively don&#39;t, or heard his work and don&#39;t care
Yikes, how can you prove Lil Xan right, of all people?
We of the white delegation offer to trade Anthony Melon Fantano for a single wine tipped black and mild.
Just popped through to dislike.
Muh trump
Power is still my favorite Kanye Song
Some of the people that disliked the original review they decided to like it now. Melon you did that so you can get less hate.
So what does this rereview prove? A decade later and your opinions are still trash? Ok next
When‚Äôs your video about Eminem‚Äôs new album??
<b>N O T  G O O D</b>
Liked until Runaway, then disliked, unsubscribed, subscribed and unsubscribed thank tou for nothing.
The average age of a person on the internet is 13.
this is annoying but i cant even say anything, i dont really care for yezus and people love that shit. this is the beauty of kanye right here tho. his best is hated and his hated is his best. lay this to rest now melon, don&#39;t speak of it again.
long story short, your morals alone made you drop points on this album.<br><br>when artists take the role of storytellers, by portraying in an accurate manner a character who is not morally justifiable without judging it, leaves us room to empathize and see what do we may have in common with it after all, as human beings. i don&#39;t think kanye west would justify &quot;hitting his girl&quot;, nor he is trivializing about it. he is depicting the mindset of a person twisted by fame and drug abuse (who probably also isn&#39;t the smartest, but why should he be? it makes it more plausible). of course the character is portrayed as a victim in his own mind, but he is the focus of the song, not anyone else, nor his girlfriend (which could also be, but why one viewpoint should be more valid than the other, if it&#39;s an artistic expression and not a moral discussion?).<br><br>on the other hand &quot;let&#39;s have a toast for the douchbags&quot;, in Runaway -- which may be a more personal song -- , sounds like a bitter consolation statement to me. it doesn&#39;t sound proudful nor indulgent. kanye sounds regretful and defiant at the same time a lot of times in this album, and that conflict between knowing -- and feeling -- how wrong you are while still showing your teeth to the world is the biggest beauty of it in my opinion.<br><br>i agree it is overrated though, the feats just waters it down so badly.
I really want to branch out into different artists and different genres other than hip hop and r&amp;b music. Anyone has any suggestions? I mean really good quality music not lil pump or anything like that. Thanks
Dead üíÄ
Aight but monster is one of the best rap songs ever
Can&#39;t wait for the fc
&quot;anal and gangbangs ... That pretty vanilla&quot;
React to eminems new album pls
It seems like he missed the actual point of most of the songs...
I‚Äôm surprised the dislike ratio isn‚Äôt similar to the original, being that it got the same score lol
Hey Anthony! Im enjoying your content and love to listen to the new music. Can you maybe review Easy Life&#39;s LP &quot;Junk Food&quot;? I&#39;d really like to know what you think about it.
Lmao. This guy said Ross feature wasnt mind blowing.
This man gave lil pumps self titled mixtape a 7 .... let that sink in
When I first heard this album back in 2010 I didn&#39;t really like it.  I would have given it a 4/10 back then but as time progresses alot of the songs have grown on me but I&#39;m honestly with melon on this, I think this album is like a 7 mabye an 8 at best but it just doesn&#39;t have too much depth guys. Ok hate me
Take your dislike and get out of my recommended, melon
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=1074">17:54</a> thanks goose fantano
Don&#39;t let Fantano giving MBDTF a 6 distract you from the fact that Fantano gave MBDTF a 6.
Its not racial discrimination but racism.
This mans said he didn&#39;t like the best verse of Nicki&#39;s career and one of the best verses of the decade?
There was no need to end the review by saying this album still sucks because Kanye&#39;s a sped.
Nigga fuck you
YOUR WIFE LOOKS LIKE AUNT JEMIMA
YOU WASTED THE ONE CHANCE TO RIGHT YOUR WRONGS YOU FUCKING TWAT
FUCKING IDIOT
I don&#39;t think lyrics should hold this much weight in musical merit.
I‚Äôm more of a Boom Bap guy but even I hear how historic and groundbreaking this album is, also most importantly, the songs are straight fire üî•
Fantano is just mad that Kanye used the word Fantasy instead of Fantano at the end
Such a hater. No true knowledge of music and any opinion in the future is invalidated.
Hmmmm. Do it again.
he cant keep getting away with iiiit D:<br><br>Subscribed and circumcised
You gave lover higher score than this masterpiece??? That sums up your music taste pretty well.
melon makes this album sound a lot more terrifying than it actually is<br><br>the way he describes Guitar Kanye on runaway (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=1007">16:47</a>) sounds like some sort of sleep paralysis demon
I thought this was the 3rd time he reviewed it lol...
Nope, you&#39;re are nitpicking and biased, I win, bye bye
this was a troll 10 years in the making
Any other strong Christians in the fantano fansbase??
I will firebomb my own house
I fully thought this would be a review of a re-released MBDTF rather than a re-review. Melon surprised me.
Oh Fantano...<br><br>You wouldn‚Äôt get it.
What is that sound you put after the intro of every single album review
I actually agree with him, this album was nothing great, although i would give it a 7
This is definitely one of my favourite albums
h
This nigga shaped like a melon
this gay
Power is really quite boring, Hell of a Life is not that bad.
I think so much head I woke up in sleepy hollow is an easy mess up where he crossed Washington Irving&#39;s stories and thought that was the one with Rip Van Winkle.
Ya&#39;ll be pissed this originally got a 6<br>I&#39;m pissed he gave Aphex Twin&#39;s Syro a 6
Hold my 6.. Thanks can I have my 6 back?
The song has dark in it and it isn&#39;t a 10 so you&#39;re racist and i hate you
can we just acknowledge that this is a wayyyyy better review than the original he went in-depth and really showed us why he didnt like it all the much whereas in the original he kinda just said i didnt like some of the hooks
<b>Melon gives a 6</b><br><br>Subs: Turn it up!<br>Melon: Okay Okay<br><b>Gives it a 6 again</b><br>Melon: Thats the max<br>Subs: Oh thats the max?
Its not a redux if you make the same mistake twice, you silly melon! You flipped upside-down that 9 again!
Thanks Melon, great review and am glad that you kept your consistency I hate it and I hate you and I hate this channel
Damn... I used to really like this album... I guess I can&#39;t anymore
Now you have to go back to man on the moon 2
no way
My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantano if you will<br><br>ill see myself out
When you have multiple songs that are straight up legendary. The album is automatically an 8 or 9. You give higher scores to albums with songs that will be forgotten in the next 5 years
You fucks are pathetic lol,you religiously hate on a genuine,regular guy who loves music just like all of us because what? He reviews music and gave a Kanye West album a 6/10? What kind of fuckery is that? He never even said his opinions are the only right ones or anything egotistic like that,he reviews music and that‚Äôs it.He gives his grading for a piece of music and explains the reasoning behind his score in a pretty articulate way,it‚Äôs all of you losers that get borderline butthurt anytime someone feels like Kanye West isn‚Äôt a literal perfect being.
A 6??????? Wtf
This is one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time.
I mean he gave any Brockhampton track a higher rating than this when Ye is better than anything they‚Äôve made combined. Yeah the have a handful of good songs but in general not that good where as Kanye is a walking musical genius when it comes to creativity and consistency. so I‚Äôm not even gonna listen
melon doubled down in this one
Re-re-review MBDTF
Anthony just ruined me
Whether you hate Kanye or not, this album definitely is not a 6.
Koonye sucks
Tracklist to make it a classic:<br>1. Dark Fantasy<br>2. Gorgeous <br>3. POWER<br>4. Devil in a New Dress<br>5. Runaway<br>6. All of The Lights<br>7. Lost in The World
melon can come off so old guy sometimes :D at the part <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=985">16:25</a>
Why are you like this
Dark Fantasy: 10/10<br>Gorgeous: 6/10<br>POWER: 7/10<br>All of the Lights: 8/10<br>Monster: 9/10<br>So Appalled: 10/10<br>Devil in a New Dress: 10/10<br>Runaway: 10/10<br>Hell of a Life: 7/10<br>Blame Game: 9/10<br>Lost in the World: 4/10<br><br><br>Fantano: meh 6/10 for me
FUCK YOU MELON
Giving this album a 6 is absolutely criminal.
but All of the lights!!! you can hate any song but that. That fucking intro starts and jesus every time im taken away its so gorgeous.
10 years later, STILL wrong.<br><br>Take a lap.
yo melon there&#39;s an unmastered version of this album floating around the internet, if you&#39;re good you can find it.  it&#39;s the digital copy of the vinyl master.  It&#39;s.... much better sounding.
Review watch the throne
this might be the wrongest and most misguided music reviews I‚Äôve ever heard
Please review Kaytranada - Bubba
What is this shit
Trash review
Most overrated album of all time
Completely respect his decision to ignore Kanye stans and give the album an even lower score. The album has some great songs, but as a whole its meh
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=574">9:34</a> think we didn&#39;t notice that melonnn haha we see that dub over lmao
its just not a 6 lol
hey anthony you should redo the review again
liked the video until he started to talk about runaway, I do respect what he said but it&#39;s still one of Kanye&#39;s best and certainly the center of the project in my opinion
the headless horseman takes heads, though.. doesn&#39;t he?
Yeezy taught me...
Melon has to start a tradition of talking higher of mbdtf and giving it a 6/10 every decade
You are wrong. Flat out
F L A T A S S B A S S L I N E
oh fuck off Anthony you just can&#39;t admit you were wrong even after 10 years, literally ... your issue this time is the offensive lyrics! go listen to &quot;Dissect&quot; podcast on Kanyes MDTF it does a great look at the lyrics
Good to see 10 years later your still wrong, never change melon!
I agree, the album has cultural significance but broken down song by song, it has a lot of flaws.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=1051">17:31</a>
He ... HE DID it. I wish I was as brave as fantano. He just does what he wants devil may care.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=542">9:02</a> ... Jojos reference?
Half the reason I watch anofantano is cause the comments
Tbh I&#39;m glad you speak your opinion on this album as it gives another view of something I can&#39;t bring myself to criticize
Power-interlude-All of the lights is the section of the album is where I lose myself to the ether
&quot;even tho he&#39;s a god damn legend&quot;
Everyone should listen to the podcast &quot;Dissect&quot; on podcast cover this album. So much depth here not spoken of before.
It was overrated back in Nov. 2010.
i was the 666.888 view. Am i special yet?
The sleepy hollow bar is in reference to the tree full of heads in the Johnny Depp live action movie
The productions amazing, The lyrics are amazing, the features are amazing <br><br><br>6/10<br><br><br>Melon is smoking
You have failed me
wow melon we know MBDTF isnt your favourite album but you didnt have to shout at a picture of kanye for 15 minutes
Fuck off
You only gave the album a 6 because you didn‚Äôt like it
I don‚Äôt think melon‚Äôs comments warrant it getting a 6, at least 7
This video must be a troll. <b>PLEASE SAY SIKE FANTANO</b>
REVIEW IT AGAIN
‚ú® listen i only came here to hear him say ‚Äúdecent 5 to light 6‚Äù ‚ú®
I think Lost in the World is one of kanyes most underrated songs tbh. It just sends chills down my spine almost like in an ASMR way. Give me the tingles. love it.
Top 10 signs that the World war 3 is upon us
FAV TRACKS: DARK FANTASY, GORGEOUS, POWER, DEVIL IN A NEW DRESS, BLAME GAME<br><br>LEAST FAV TRACK: HELL OF A LIFE
Kanye sucks. This album sucks. Ya&#39;ll need some chill.
Bro Kanye just became smarter and became less of a liberal
It&#39;s funny how he mentions opinions that are overhyped...
this guy is hella gay bro with that bald ass melon head and that fucking pussy cat he calls a mustache
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=40">0:40</a> we see you liking your own videos melon
hes a fucking demon for this, literally pointless to rereview if ur opinion stayed the same, was expecting a 7üò≠
The Uchiha Clan<br>The Hyuga Clan<br>The Kardashian Clan
Fun fact: CyHi wasn‚Äôt supposed to have a verse on So Appalled. He snuck on there recording his verse on his own when it was supposed to be a RZA verse
Exactly !!!<br>But them white boys going to throw hate and say its a goat album
All of the light 6
Mbdtf review as a monthly segment!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=572">9:32</a> he mixed up the lines and had 2 dub them over lmaoooooooo
Haven&#39;t watched yet. Already praying that he gives it 1 point lower than the first review just to piss off literally everybody.
devil in a new dress &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
new king krule!!!! review it now please
Melon basically said ‚Äúeven at 2million  subs I don‚Äôt give a fuck what u say‚Äù
Are you going to review the new Stormzy album?
Bruh forget the 6/10 but this homie even talked trash about Runaway
hey girl<br>If I was Anthony Fantano I&#39;d give you a six out of ten<br><b>boom</b> instant girlfriend
As if we didn‚Äôt know he would give it another 6
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=1090">18:10</a> _ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=1110">18:30</a> funniest moments of the review
Best album of the  2010&#39;s
It‚Äôs weird, I pretty much agree with most of Fantano‚Äôs criticisms (especially regarding Runaway), but this is still an easy 8/10
Fucking idiot
i still disagree, but this is an amazing review. much more comprehensive than the first one, all valid, well explained points. i guess it&#39;s just a matter of perspective
Can u do a review, of a band called boy and with their newest album
after 10 years of thinking MBDTF is a 10, i have suddenly changed my opinion and this album is now a 6 in my humble opinion. Thanks Melon
Where the city morgue review
can you review skin &amp; earth by lights?
Found the best way to watch this review. <br><br>1. Mute it and turn up the actual record. <br><br>2..Enjoy watching melonboy being angry over excellent music.
7 tracks out of the 13 are fantastic, 5 are hot garbage, one is not a song. 6 seems about right. But I seem to be on the opposite side of what Anthony thinks are beautiful instrumentals...
You can‚Äôt just not review Roddy Ricch‚Äôs new album because he didn‚Äôt invite you to the box
house of balloons re review melonnnn
Melon the type of person to skip the runaway outro
still can‚Äôt subscribe to needledrop till he gives it the rating it deserves
Man, I can understand all the criticism but disliking the legendary Chris Rock skit is not acceptable.
Never listened to a Kanye album, gave this a listen. First half was a lot of fun, catchy and I wanted to hear more. Second half however, just dull, boring, and I wanted to stop listening. Lost all that energy from the first half of it. <br><br>TL,DR: He&#39;s correct, light 6. Calm your tits kanyeswifties, it&#39;s not great, but it&#39;s not bad.
i agree 6/10<br>heavily overrated but not bad by any stretch
What I like about this time is you focus on the music. Your first time came off as you critiquing Kanye&#39;s life too much and not as much on the music. So you&#39;ve redeemed your crappiest take.
Why are we still here? Just to suffer?
YAYEET

Oh yeah melon? Well my mom said you can&#39;t come over anymore
now we wait till 2030
Should‚Äôve also included ‚ÄúSee Me Now‚Äù it‚Äôs a bonus track on the album and honestly one of my favorites :)
Returning just to add politics and mention orange man
I respect your opinion melon, but fuck you
I honestly don‚Äôt get it. <br>I adore this album. Like top 5 favourite albums of all time. <br><br>Devil in a new dress just slaps
I just came to dislike and leave
you should do a track review on Denzel&#39;s and Glass Animals track. It&#39;s so God damn fresh
Are you serious? Did this guy really not understand that All of the Lights is about Kanye and his relationship to fame and the rap game? It‚Äôs not an actual domestic abuse relationship.
power move
alright, I‚Äôm unsubscribed now, you don‚Äôt need my subscription anyways Mr. 2 Million lol<br><br>I‚Äôm just beyond annoyed with the amount of nitpicks he has with this album considering that there is so much detail to unfold. This album is the most meticulous Hip Hop record and there are no slouchy moments. I just can‚Äôt see how you can‚Äôt see that production wise and lyrically this is Kanye‚Äôs peak. And you still have the audacity to give it a lower score than Life of Pablo and YE!!?!???

I respect tony for giving it a 6 again
Canalha!!!
Can you do Roddy Richh ?
In my opinion Kanye doesn‚Äôt have a bad Album. I enjoy them all and if he actually chose to Rap like he did in Late Registration for Jesus Is King. Then that album would have been a solid Album all together.
I knew when Anthony was going to review this again, he would find something new to piss people off over. Apparently it&#39;s not liking the Nicki Minaj verse in Monster. Probably one of the most praised verses on a Kanye song.
He gave this a 5 guys.  Not even a 6.
I came here because another gaming YouTube called Datto made a video intro similar to yours and I just had to understand the reference. Thanks to all his comment section for pointing out the proper YouTuber name so I could find myself here with ease.<br><br>In case anyone is wondering, the video i mentioned is called &quot;Destiny 2: How I Feel About Destiny Going Into 2020 &amp; Season Of Dawn&quot;. Just for curiosity&#39;s sake.
I get down that it may get weaker in the last third and I was never that huge on AOTL. But Runaway&#39;s crescendo and Nicki&#39;s Monster verse?? C&#39;mon man, gotta turn off the left-brain a little and hear how damn fine that music is. Pure melody on the former and ridiculous-and-goofy is the MO of the latter.
Hey Anthony could you do a redux review of MBDTF?
Madman
Day 27 of asking Anthony to review Bump This by Danny Gonzalez
Days Before Rodeo redux review
I‚Äôm a bit confused by your rating system.  Can your 1-10 scale coincide with the standard grading system of which we are all familiar? i.e. A = 9, B = 8, C = 7, D = 6.<br><br>If so, how in the name of Music, can you give this album a D grade? You think this album is below average?  I am fine with you saying this album is average or slightly above average perhaps, but how, I mean, how how how, could you say this album, of all the albums that are in existence, could you say this album is below average?<br><br>An album is a sum of its tracks, and the cohesive themes the totality of those tracks express. The tracks of this album are unique, creative, enjoyable, and above all else, raw and soulful. The album‚Äôs themes are not heavy-handed, but powerful and certainly present.<br><br>You‚Äôre letting you‚Äôre personal opinions of Kanye‚Äôs celebrity status get in the way of the music.  Not giving this album at least a 7 (average), truly is a testament to your ignorance as a music critic. Stop being stubborn and listen to the music of this album with an open mind, and most importantly, an open heart.<br><br>Giving this album a below average D score of 6, is extreme to say the least.
This puts into words a lot of the reasons I don&#39;t revisit this album as much as I thought I would. Hell of a life was trash from the jump, though ü§£. If only kanye took the instrumental layering from like here and late registration (plus the mental clarity) and the run time (plus a track or two) of his newer projects... That would be great.
I cannot believe I&#39;ve been blue balled for an actual decade fantano you&#39;re an actual monster. Congrats on the 2 milly.
Rethony Viewtano plz track review the new RICH BRIAN - DRIVE SAFE bruh sounds really nice
Probably the best album of the last 10 years...
I love this album, but I&#39;m not sure if I like it more than College Dropout
I live for the salt of these comments tbh
Commie loves the number 6. Surprising
Anthony Fantano: <b>Doesn‚Äôt personally enjoy popular album</b><br><br><br>People who don‚Äôt understand these reviews are just his opinions and put way too much weight on them affecting their own opinions: ‚ÄúFUCK YOU MELON! YOU ARE BALD DUMB CANTALOUPE MAN WHO DOESN‚ÄôT KNOW SHIT! MBDTF IS A SOLID 30/10 SO STOP LYING AND GIVE IT WHAT YOU TRULY THINK!‚Äù<br><br><br>Me: ‚ÄúI mean, the review was okay, he said what he thought and I can respect that.‚Äù<br><br><br>My conscience: ‚ÄúI mean the review way okay, he said what he thought and... FUCK YOU MELON! YOU ARE BALD DUMB CANTALOUPE MAN WHO DOESN‚ÄôT KNOW SHIT! MBDTF IS A SOLID 30/10 SO STOP LYING AND GIVE IT WHAT YOU TRULY THINK!‚Äù
UHHHHHHH I&#39;M NOT SURE ABOUT THIS, MELON
What is a redux album
idkw but I always comeback to this video. It&#39;s so satisfying
I could be wrong,  but doesnt the headless horseman collect the heads of his victims?
Imo the sleepy hollow line portrays that even if you have all the head in the world, you still can come to a point of dissatisfaction.<br>Like money or other things associated to fame.<br>And Kanye itself realising that hence the waking up moment.<br><br>Is that too far fetched?
This is the real proof that a million subscribers doesn&#39;t change any people&#39;s idea.
This is a troll
Should&#39;ve been just melon watching his own old review without saying a word.
Anthony is that teacher that doesn&#39;t curve your grade.
yo um, anthony fantano can you review 645AR.. I found that squeaky voice rap is thing andd like I can see where it could possibly be good but honestly I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs trying to be satirical orr
i get it, you still don&#39;t like the album, but you really didn&#39;t have to repeatedly call kanye the n-word
It&#39;s funny because he technically gave it a lower score. Old review was light to decent 6. This review is Strong 5 to light 6.
i  guess we&#39;re gonna have to wait NEXT YEAR FOR DISINTEGRATION, HUH<br>or are you just gonna KEEP PULLING AN R&amp;R HALL OF FAME AND WAIT 30 YEARS
Damn thats crazy
this is evidence of how y‚Äôall hold this mans opinion as fact and always think he‚Äôs right, it‚Äôs his opinion but, he gave MBDTF a 6. üòê
Dang rly sucks that‚Äôs I can‚Äôt like this album anymore

I can&#39;t stand that he doesnt like runaway :/

Deam booooa i ticc boaaaa ba ta
It would be awesome if you could check out our new album!

At least he likes it. Remember, ‚Äúanything past a 5 is me liking the record‚Äù
This record is overrated af. A few great songs on it, but overall just not as good as people say it is.
why are you like this
What a snipe
You reviewed watermelon higher than MBDTF.
Hi everyone. Backthony tracktano here
So you think tlop is a better album than mbdtf? What the fuck?
Everybody: you better give MBDTF a better score<br>Anthony: <b>i&#39;ll fuckin do it again</b>
When u doing thw javkboys review melon
CAN WE GET MUCH HIGHER?<br><br><br>‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling a strong five to a light six.‚Äù
Damn I thought the shit I watched was wack but, according to Melon, it&#39;s pretty vanilla.
On a real, this is a very good review, I just think he‚Äôs a little harsh with the score

REVIEW ALLAN RAYMAN ALBUMS !
I‚Äôll give it to Anthony for being upfront about his view off his album. Though I don‚Äôt agree with a 6/10 for the album but it‚Äôs an opinion. He enjoyed the album that‚Äôs worth a 6/10
Big yikes, D tier review, F tier point of views. S tier teeth tho.
thank you for the review it made a lot of sense I disliked your video anyway
When we getting a 2020 most anticipated albums video
isn&#39;t it classic week soooooooo . . .
Can you give us a review of the new Apocalyptica album &#39;Cell-0&#39;? I&#39;d appreciate it
I feel so clickbaited
Nigga u gayyyyyy!!!!!
I hated this album, so much so that I haven&#39;t listened to it in over 8 years and I&#39;ve actively avoided anything Kanye&#39;s released since. I figure if I hated what&#39;s supposed to be his crowning achievement, why would I expect to like the undeniably polarizing albums he&#39;s released after it?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=30">0:30</a><br><br>Your review of Yelawolf‚Äôs ‚ÄúLove Story‚Äù album says otherwise.<br><br>We‚Äôre not forgetting that one, haha. You are yet to do a full review of a project of his since. <br><br>Lastly, you probably won‚Äôt, but it would appreciated if you would review his recent release ‚ÄúGhetto Cowboy‚Äù.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=1312">21:52</a> Strong 5 to a Light 6
This is classic/album <br>Giving it 6/10 2x times does not change that
2020: brink of WW3, environmental crisis, Australia is on fire... could it get any more chaotic?<br><br>Melon: hold my 6
Lmao at melon vanilla shaming Kanye&#39;s sexuality
Anthony is a Libtard so of course he&#39;s gonna hate on Ye.
Melon, we need some more experimental music reviews! Would love to hear your opinion Jim O‚ÄôRourke‚Äôs new release ‚ÄúTo Magnetize Money and Catch a Roving Eye‚Äù or any Skullflower album.
The lyrics on All Of The Lights about domestic abuse and its consequences are a metaphor for Kanye&#39;s struggle with fame and how he is perceived in the public eye
Its weird that he gave this a 6 twice but still however picked it as his 2nd best album in the kanye worst to best
JEIZHDIEVEKDKIDHE
Downvoting because this guy looks really stupid
do it again, melon.
Wheres the anything by bladee you have reviewed redux review @
5 WORDS<br>LMFAO

Hey Kanthony Westano, have you checked out Sakanaction&#39;s 834.194? Let us know what you think &lt;3

&#39;&#39;the craziest shit you say in this track is anal and gangbangs... and that&#39;s it... thats pretty vanilla&#39;&#39;
Wtf
I‚Äôm not gonna lie. I think this was a confusing decision
&quot;I didn&#39;t like Nicki&#39;s verse on Monster.&quot; - literally no one but Fantano.
Honestly nothing angers me more than him not liking NIcki&#39;s verse on monster
I don‚Äôt remember he saying ‚ÄòBud Light‚Äô at that part
When he gonna do a face reveal the
only a 6? re rereview mbdtf
Anthony&#39;s just mad he ain&#39;t in the Kardashian clan.
Fun fact: nicki&#39;s vokce switchups on monster weren&#39;t done by her. She recorded multiple versions to see which one was best and then kanye edited them together without her knowing
22 mins just for a 6!? LOL I‚Äôll pass Melon
Saw that image for the thumbnaiil<br>Melon might change his mind from a siiiix<br>I don&#39;t wanna discuss detaiils<br>But I should&#39;ve never cliiiicked<br>Wish I could have me a good worrlld<br>Where melon likes these traacks<br>But its worse than the first review<br>Now I have to like this album less, daaamn :(
Could you go back and give Lush by Mitski a review.

react to city morgue as good as dead

&quot;can we get much higher?&quot;<br><br><br>no no noooooo<br>no no noooooo
Melon: &quot;This was easily my most infamous review.&quot;<br>Stoney by post malone: &quot;Am I a joke to you?&quot;
Futsal
Your opinion is bad. Still love you.
WTF, MAN, STOP WITH THIS SHIT
I wish you could enjoy music man
try again
Music that can be enjoyed in any state I believe is a true indicator of good music. That being said get high as fuck and listen to runaway then tell me it isn‚Äôt beautiful
Hello Fellow Melon. When will you review the new Kaytranada album?
false
BudLight!!
this is the first video i thought fantano started looking 40. He must be tired while working on the decade lists
it feels like you&#39;re just doubling down on it to double down on it. like you&#39;re talking about a different record, did you hear a demo or some shit? what the fuck
Hey do the moving units album dangerous dreams
Fantano would rather listen to LIZZO and this proves it.
Re:Review: Kodak Black ‚ÄúDying to Live‚Äù
At least he breaks down his reasoning really well. He‚Äôs wrong, but he does being wrong pretty well.
Cancel melon
So when do we get the redux where you explain why it‚Äôs a 6/10?
Hold on while I find my uno +4 card
I feel like melon will never publicly change his stance on this album, even if his opinion changes, because he doesn&#39;t want his viewers to think he&#39;s spineless
HE CANT KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH THIS
Sad. Whatever. It‚Äôs still an 11/10 for me
Polishing the Melon
All of the Lights is amazing.
That&#39;s an old album. Why review it? Twice at that. Why dont you review the chronic 2001? Douche.
I don‚Äôt get how KSG gets a 10 and this gets a 6...
So after we all unsubscribe after watching this video, who&#39;s the new music nerd we&#39;ll all watch?
Review yhandi
Thank you! Most overrated album and artist of all time!
My boi, Toni, the woman at the end of Blame Game is Hip Hop/Music Industry. It&#39;s based on his relationship with Amber Rose, but she said there are details in the song that don&#39;t add up. The entire album is a narrative/backhanded apology about celebrity. Runaway is not supposed to be relatable, because it&#39;s a song to us, the public. The vocoded part is what people hear, like you&#39;ve presented in this review, as many don&#39;t look any further to understand what is being said. Ghost Town is a sequel to Runaway because he no longer cares if anyone understands what he&#39;s trying to say. He&#39;ll say it and have hope we&#39;ll understand someday. &quot;Someday the drama&#39;ll be gone and they&#39;ll play this on and on&quot; The constant misunderstanding of Kanye is one thing that keeps losing my respect.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=598">9:58</a> <b>Anthony &quot;I don&#39;t know what Mastering is, but I&#39;ll confidently pretend I do and make myself look like an idiot to Audio Engineers&quot; Fantano</b>
he fucking did it
actually... rza on so appalled is the only necessary part of this album
It&#39;s one of my favorite albums ever, suck it melon
This was my intro to Kanye... My boss had Runaway playing on the stereo, and you could only barely hear it over the equipment, but the end section caught my attention and I asked who it was. 808&#39;s became my absolute favorite Kanye record, HANDS DOWN, but this record... and the accompanying film are a huge part of how I got into him.
HE CAN‚ÄôT KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH THIS!!!
U good at this breakdown.<br>I can tell u really do your homework üìö üòπüí´
Oh shit.. üòπüòπüòπüòπ<br>I didn‚Äôt know u was about to bust out on that <br>‚ÄúCan we get much higher ‚Äú

<b>mixes personal politics into review</b><br>&quot;You guys know this it just my opinion, right?&quot;<br>Yes we fucking know, Jesus.. thank God you&#39;re not a political pundit, Melon. Lol, I can&#39;t imagine having to listen to you debate people.
I thought I would agree with him given my opinion of this album, but it turns out he practically likes/dislikes the exact opposite things I do. How
new Mick jenkins
Please do a review on The Carnival  1  By Wyclef Jean. üá≠üáπüá≠üáπüá≠üáπ

The sleepy hollow bar was so so soooooo simple lol ... just means he gets so much his dick gone LMAO
do jackboys fant mant
Society: we all conclusively agree Nicki‚Äôs monster verse was the best female rap verse of the decade<br>Melon: it‚Äôs trash
No, Melon, when I said &quot;re-review,&quot; I meant &quot;give it the score I wanted it to have in the first place,&quot; you b-baka!
Runaway is a great song besides that 4 lines of cringy lyrics
Still my fav. Top 5, #1 from Ye for me. Thank you, goodbye.
He did it again..
He has to keep it a 6 to differentiate his brand from Pitchforks
say what you will i upvoted because <br><br><br><br>A) he did the video everyone asked for and...<br><br><br>B) stuck to his principles and didn&#39;t change his opinion to a &quot;LOVE IT&quot; because of the hate he gets for his opinion on this one<br><br><br>my only problem is there&#39;s no appearance of the Cal Chuchesta 5 to slight 6/10
No. Review it again.
Melon you only dislike runaway cuz your wife ran away from you
One of the few albums to make it into my Decade Review. A level handed look back to the album, but nah dawg, it&#39;s a 10 then and a 10 still.
I give this review a 4/10
I can&#39;t tell is melon is saying nikki&#39;s part is good or bad.... it&#39;s easily the best part
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=53">0:53</a> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=58">0:58</a> Biggest foreshadow of what the score was gonna be again. Or reading the description lmao
melon kinda right tho
Good review but I wish you didn&#39;t call Kanye the N word 7 times.
Anthony, this is why Iran pulled out of the Nuclear deal
Yeah but the headless horseman also cuts people‚Äôs heads off...
fantano trashing Runaway shows he has actually been deaf all these years. Wow. What a legend.
thanks for giving this overrated artists overrated album a proper score, again
I swear of all this build up, all the pain over the years for the original review, in was all worth it just to get to listen to melon screams ‚ÄúPut the pussy in a sarcophagus‚Äù
Did you watch j Aubrey‚Äôs kanye video
Where‚Äôs my jack boys review
Sometimes Kanye is just too clever for you/us...Sleepy Hollow is also a small community outside Chicago.  That line is classic.
You emphasize every minimal flaw and downplay all the highs magnificently. Good agenda for clout I guess
I think you‚Äôre trolling
Have you heard of Ritt Momney? He put out his first album last year it‚Äôs been amazing so far!
MY MAN ANTHONY RLY GAVE THIS SHIT A LOWER SCORE THAN THE ORIGINAL REVIEW<br>shit went from a light to decent 6.... to a strong 5 to light 6<br>FUCKING LEGEND
Wheres Poppy review??
I swear if Kendrick made this album Melon would give this a classic/10
Its your opinion but 6?! Fuck off. This album is at least an 8.
Can you review Centerfold by MOTHXR?
What&#39;s funny is that Anthony recorded this video 10 years ago. He knew about the backlash he&#39;d receive for the initial review, so he recorded this &quot;fine, I&#39;ll give it another shot&quot; video to appease his upset audience. Very interesting move from Anthony.
A 6?!! U fucking serious
An album can&#39;t really be bad if it has so much influence you review it twice. Think about it
Please do Denzel Currys 1300D 1N because knowing your vast knowledge of Denzel Currys background I‚Äôd like to know what you‚Äôd have to say on it
Not going to lie it is actually one of my favorite kanye albums in fact late registration and this one are the top two.
You know what I‚Äôm gonna say it, I don‚Äôt care that u gave this album a six.
I&#39;m disappointed in what you said about the Runway outro. The point ov that section was that he was abandoning words in favor ov creating a mood. It doesn&#39;t need words becauz you know what he wants you to feel when you are hearing his voice. As for your other complaint about  the &quot;I sent a picture of my diiiick&quot; line, you were not supposed to take it seriously and he was adding humor by turning something that happened into something that sounds ridiculous in a song. The fact that you remembered it enough to make a comment about it means that it worked and served its function.
You really should have invited someone over for this review. Probably someone from DeadEndHipHop since they reviewed your review last year. It was a missed opportunity.
read video description. saw 6/10. stopped watching video. eediyat.
Why&#39;d ya do it
It&#39;s interesting to see you re-review this album with 10 years retrospect. <br><br>I was actually one of the people who really sympathized with your original review, which was shorter and less detailed than this retrospective. I thought your main criticism, that you didn&#39;t care about the personal dramas of Kanye West, was exactly the main Achilles heel of the album. At many points, I didn&#39;t care either, especially in the second half. <br><br>That being said, I thought the quality of the production was good enough in itself to warrant an 8/10 from me. Kanye West, in my view, is one of the top five producers in the history of hip-hop, and this is among his best works as a producer. His rapping is really hit or miss in my view.<br><br>Hearing more detail, I still largely agree with your take, though it sounds like we actually have a little more to disagree about. The biggest is &quot;All of the Lights,&quot; which I think is one of the catchiest, best produced and most repeatable songs on the album. Yes, it is blown up and compressed, but it&#39;s supposed to be grandiose, and the beautiful horns alone, never mind the Caribbean-inspired percussion (not two things you would necessarily think to merge together) more than justify the grandiosity. <br><br>One thing you ignored completely was the prelude to the song, which I think is a beautiful, understated (one of the few if only moments of understatement on the album) setup that sucks you in to the grandiosity of the main song. <br><br>Reading over the lyrics, I also don&#39;t think it&#39;s a song justifying domestic violence from the perpetrators point of view. I think Kanye West is supposed to be an anti-hero on this album in general, and you&#39;re not supposed to like the guy on this track. He&#39;s talking about the bad things happening to him like they&#39;re things that shouldn&#39;t make you like him. <br><br>On a more minor point, I was actually even more sad once I got to the Chris Rock point of &quot;Blame Game,&quot; because you&#39;re obviously hearing a rather sordid affair where every person involved is obviously broken. It makes me feel dirty, and I think it&#39;s meant to.<br><br>But regardless, I&#39;ve watched your reviews a long time and always look forward to your takes. You didn&#39;t disappoint here, and I&#39;m glad you stuck to your guns and your perceptions.
Melon dispariging the Nicki verse on Monster??
Reeeeeeee ducks!!!!!

MICK JENKINS// THE CIRCUS EP PLS AND THANK YOU MICKTHONY JENKTANO
Grey Area a 9 but this album is a 5, we&#39;re not talking about lyrics, we talking about music and purpose, go and get a book of poems if you want true lyrics.
Hey Anthony. So, you&#39;re able to grow hair &amp; you&#39;re bald by choice?
JACKBOYS WHEN
Fr overrated ?
CYHI SAID ‚ÄúI MET A GIRL ON VALENTINE‚Äôs DAY, FUCKED HER IN MAY, SHE FOUND OUT ABOUT APRIL SO SHE CHOSE TO MARCH!‚Äù EXCUSE ME
Are you gonna review Cell-0 album by apocalyptica?
Same score as Earl‚Äôs IDLS &amp; Doris and Mac Miller‚Äôs Faces &amp; watching movies, my taste in music is a 6/10
Lmao Jesus this made my day. I love this album to death but the fact that he gave it another 6 yet again is killing me for some reason.
Hold up<br>He gave it a light to decent 6 last time<br>This time he gave it a strong 5 to a light 6<br><b>HIS RATING WENT DOWN</b>
Fuck u needle drops!‚ò¢Ô∏è
White man still doesn&#39;t respect black culture. 1/10 review
Am I the only one that actually agrees with this score more than the first one? Yall can come for me.
Wow, Needle Drops followed my Zeitgeist stream this entire video! Smh! But what YouTuber isn‚Äôt these days!
WHY IS IT STILL A 6????????
This is why I stopped watching his reviews.
throughout this entire review i just wondered if anthony would ever push his glasses up
I‚Äôm gonna have to give this review a strong five maybe a light six
Hey melon, there‚Äôs this great album I think you should review, it‚Äôs called my beautiful dark twisted fantasy from kanye west
FUUUCKC MELON YOU CANT KEEP DOIGN THIS TO USüòøü§¨
FUCKINF FINALLY
I‚Äôm surprised you don‚Äôt like the distorted vocals at the end of Runaway, I think it‚Äôs probably my favourite part of the track.
Graduation &gt; mtdf
Damn boy he thicc boy
Is the word cringe getting cringier or just me?
So basically melonhead only liked Dark Fantasy &amp; Power.
absolute mad man compliments jay z&#39;s verse on monster but doesn&#39;t like nicki&#39;s???
all of the lights is awful? HOW?!
It&#39;s like a 7
Isn&#39;t the point of the Sleepy Hollow line that the Headless Horseman collects people&#39;s heads?
Reported for terrorism.
nah, Runaway fye
Why‚Äôs there a positive like ratio? Gtfo
Yup, where is Kanye on a any current moment between the high and low, someday i listen his record..
sleepy hollow is a neighborhood in chicago area thats why that bar makes sense but nit many people would know that i guess
House of Balloons next?
Dude melon please dont do this again, my PTSD is acting up again
Still waiting on the Master Volume and/or Almost free reviews
Damn boi he&#39;s thicc
Cringe
this new MBDTF redux? not feeling it. shame to your bloodline melon, the gods gave you two chances.
This should have more dislikes
Y‚Äôall talking about how he Gave this a 6 but he gave swimming a 3
I completely disagree but I‚Äôll respect it üòí
Rza didn‚Äôt add anything to so appalled? You know that shit is... FUCKIN RUDICULUHS
Fans: Melon pls give your opinion<br>Melon gives opinion<br>Fans: God fuck you Anthony
U clearly don‚Äôt understand that the whole album like he‚Äôs said many times was meant to be the perfect album to play at his concerts that‚Äôs why certain sounds are so boosted
I agree that this album is overrated but it&#39;s at least an 8/10. theres some good ass songs but personally I don&#39;t think there&#39;s enough variation in the sound of the songs. but that&#39;s just my opinion and I can see why some people would give this a 10
how is ross verse on devil in a new dress not mind blowing that&#39;s his best feature ever
Imagine if he moved the score down. That would have been a power move.
This is disgusting how could you say the passing of kayne mom is ok!!! &gt;:(
what&#39;s stark, minimal, or bare about gorgeous lmfao
BRU HOW
You‚Äôre lucky we live in different states
Monster was literally the only good song Nicki Minaj has ever been on a recording for, and its the best performance she ever put out. It&#39;s the reason why she was catapulted so quickly to fame.
This guy is trash he need to drop a album since he know so much about music
unsub to this guy lol
THIS IS HISTORY GUYS, THIS IS THE PEAK OF MY EXISTENCE! I WOULD PROBABLY BE TELLING MY KIDS STORIES ABOUT HOW MELON-MAN KILLED YE-MAN ....TWICE
this albums a 10 my guy
Much of the negative criticism of runaway like the vocals and ‚Äòcringy‚Äô lyrics I always felt were intentional honestly
It‚Äôs 2020 and Melon still doesn‚Äôt understand the point of maximalism. F
too late bro already formed my own opinion
REVIEW BASTARD NEXT
But, wasn&#39;t MBDTF #2 on your &quot;Kanye West: Worst to Best&quot; video?? (Unless I&#39;m too naive to realize this review is satire)
There we go
2010: Light to decent 6<br>2020: Strong 5 to light 6<br>2030: Decent to strong 5<br>2040: Light to decent 5<br>2050: Strong 4 to light 5<br>2060: Decent to strong 4<br>2070: Light to decent 4<br>2080: Strong 3 to light 4<br>2090: Decent to strong 3<br>2100: Light to decent 3<br>2110: Strong 2 to light 3<br>2120: Decent to strong 2<br>2130: Light to decent 2<br>2140: Strong 1 to light 2<br>2150: Decent to strong 1<br>2160: Light to decent 1<br>2170: 10
Out of curiosity, how do you all rate his albums, personally, I‚Äôd say<br>TCD&gt;MBDTF&gt;TLOP&gt;Graduation&gt;LR&gt; WTT&gt;KSG&gt;YZ&gt;Ye&gt;808s&gt;JIK&gt;JIB
People who love this album say he‚Äôs nitpicking the bad parts but the people who love this album also just gloss over them completely
Devil will always be the best  Kayne song of all time, underrated
Anthony &quot;that&#39;s pretty vanilla&quot; Fantano
Kanye I wish you would go back to Africa and a lion would eat your no talent ass
Analthony Gangbangtano
Plz review JACKBOYS new album!!!! I love it, but need a review from melon
You should check out psychedelic porn crumpets, they‚Äôre an amazing psych-rock band from Australia. High visceral part 1 is amazing and I never get tired of listening to them.
Melon the type of melon to wait ten years to double down.
I think u missed the point of runaway you&#39;re really really not supposed to sympathize with him lol
Melon is not wearing a tutu therefore his redux review is irrelevant.
yunoreview Heavy is the Head by Stormzy!
Damn better than MBDTF confirmed<br>Thanks Melon.
Our boy is trending üß°
Review the new Poppy album!
I hate you
Wait. Kanye , generally considered one of the greatest artist alive, released his magnum opus and it‚Äôs reviewed as an ‚Äúaverage‚Äù album. Yet, it still gives content 10 years later and you‚Äôre open to reviewing it again in 20 years. If that‚Äôs not an indicator of something possibly being timeless. My music has no hope üòÇüòÇ
Melon, you have the audacity to give this album a 0, show some respect.
don&#39;t scroll down there is some sad motherfuckers down there
You basically reiterated everything you said before but in a different order and different ways of putting the point across... respect the hustle for views though good on ya üçâ
Wow i didn&#39;t want to know that Melon doesn&#39;t like Nicki&#39;s verse on Monster, the literal anthem for all gays.
<b>presses on video</b><br><b>skips to 20 seconds before end</b><br><b>sees the 6</b><br><b>cries</b>
I rate fantano in general but his opinion on this album is so fucked lol
Fuck you
No one melon should have all that power
I agree on ‚Äúsilly verses in runaway and lost in the world‚Äù, but everything else is false..all of the lights are great...Hell of a life is more dark-romantic than ‚Äúsexy song‚Äù...Chris rock skit is great too imo.
Idk I liked this video automatically ten seconds in.. was I wrong?
13k dislikes... wow...
6+6=12/10
Review Kanye getting harassed by the Paparazzi.
Thought he would‚Äôve brang up the Runaway short film that accompanied the album but it is just an ALBUM review I guess
this nigga deadass asking to be beaten up at this point
I fucking hate this guy
Just ripping up old wounds Fantano! Why&#39;d ya do it!!??
Bro, all of the lights is fire, idk what you talking about
I gave any kanye album a big ZERO, as he is talentless and just crazy.
&quot;Kanye&#39;s putting Jay-Z verses on this thing like they&#39;re goin out of style&quot;<br><br>I mean.........didn&#39;t they?
How many times do we have to teach this lesson, old man?!
I thought i was the only who disliked all of the lights
Aight I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a perfect album like some people say, but cmon, at least a decent 7... You just can&#39;t pretend like the production side on this isn&#39;t fucking golden and way beyond anything and the time (still kinda is)... Lyrics might get cringy from time to time, but at others they&#39;re on point, more than at any other time in Ye&#39;s career.<br>I mean, what else can I say, should&#39;ve expected it from the moment you dissed Runaway&#39;s outro (again). Haters gonna hate.
Can&#39;t wait for 2030 when Melon gives this album another 6 to complete the 666 trifecta. Attack him spiritually as well as analytically, smart move!
farty ass melon.
And btw the end of runaway is nothing short of brilliance. That song is an all time moment in rap history.
Idk I guess you just have to not be a giant liberal pussy to enjoy the album.
all the sheeples who have no taste in music disliking this vid lol. album is a 6/10 at best
Aye g&#39;mornin Kanye <br><br><br><br><br>Fuck you
He should re-review Mac Miller‚Äôs Swimming. That album is beautiful and he gave it a shit review.
ive waited forever for this
Honestly melon is right about most of his criticism, some of  the songs are way too long they bore you
you don‚Äôt want to like it
i always think i love this record and then i realize i only listen to like 4 tracks (which are, don&#39;t get me wrong, really high high points for me) and am annoyed by the rest of the album. i love lost in the woods tho, don&#39;t know what&#39;s wrong with this melonhead.
Wow what an orgasm denial
Channel strike for inciting violence
This is when Kanye started to crack
This is the best album of his in my opinion.
See y&#39;all in 8 years when he does a redux review of DAMN
I can‚Äôt believe you don‚Äôt like all of the lights
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=990">16:30</a><br>I DONT KNOW WHAT IT IS WITH FEMALES <br>BUT IM NOT TOO GOOD WITH THAT SHIT
So blue flannel = no change. K

People giving this man a dislike for disagreeing with his opinion ü§î MBDTF is in my top 3 favorite albums of all time and I still liked the video
30 rock casted alec baldwin
I&#39;ve never clicked on a video so fast, and I&#39;m underwhelmed by the review. I appreciate his well thought out explanation and reasoning. Still one of my favorite kanye albums... definitely lacks at the end though
That&#39;s it, we&#39;ll only be able to fix this by kidnapping his first born.
Please do bussin by devin Morrison!!!
Review it again
Simpthany simptano
i got bleach on my asshole now i feel like an asshole!
Finally some respect for Devil In A New Dress. Rick Ross&#39;s feature IS mindblowing tho but we&#39;ll forgive you Melon
Ha nigga you suk, skerr err errr!
This guy just can&#39;t admit that he&#39;s wrong can he
I see what ur saying, Anthony, I do, but, nah fam
you should re-review watch the throne too
i thought the whole point of this video would be to redeem himself after infamously giving it a 6. now it&#39;s a strong 5 to light 6? how does this video have more likes than dislikes?
youre dead meat for this
Sometimes you a dumb fuck ngl
I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever understand the praise this album gets. Devil In A New Dress is the one great song on here. Power and a couple others are good, and the rest is pretty embarrassing honestly. I&#39;ve seen so many 10/10 and &quot;album of the decade&quot; reviews for this though and I&#39;d just like someone to explain to me how?<br><br>My theory is that people just parrot what others say for this in fear of being labeled as uncool or uninformed.<br><br>Kanye proclaims himself a genius, his fans believe it because he does faux artsy shit like Runaway and follow suit, and eventually perception becomes reality.<br><br>If any other rapper made this album it&#39;d be forgotten immediately. It&#39;s lauded for the same reason his Walmart Dad shoes sell for hundreds of dollars and are considered high fashion. His influence far outweighs his actual art, but it doesn&#39;t matter because his influence creates the narratives that surround him.
Damn the album is 10yrs old
Stop giving bad scores to red album covers.
idc i still love this album n no ONE can STOP ME
Imagine not thinking AOTL is an amazing song üôÉ
This man celebrates a subscribers milestone by telling them he still hates their favorite album.
It&#39;s gonna be the most meme comment section
The fact he&#39;s even needed to review it again just shows how great the album is. Funnily enough, his more &#39;detailed&#39; analysis here has so much nitpicking and the positives he mentions alone elevate it above 6.
&quot;gangbangs are vanilla&quot; Fantano CONFIRMED Sex God
What a money grubbing review did it need to be 20 mins for you to say the same thing
WAIT he called the most ICONIC VERSES OF THE YEAR AN OVERSHOOT IM- ARE YOU TONE DEAF?
&quot;Anal and gangbangs - that&#39;s pretty vanilla&quot; - sexthony godtano
All of the lights is supposed to purposely distract from the story.. it also had a great line up of hip hop artists featured on it to add another layer of contrast to it.. lights/stars u kno. It&#39;s really good maybe Anthony just doesnt understand that the structure of the music itself tells a story.
Your overt racism is getting old melon.
clicked wondering what blue flannel means. still don‚Äôt know.
Anthony ‚Äújangly chimes‚Äù Fantano
To Nickis defense she wanted to take out some of the over animation of her verse but Kanye made her keep it
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=1090">18:10</a>
This man is literally speaking gibberish
Lol Kanye fans not gonna be happy about this
This channel is so shit
I‚Äôm not mad at the 6 in 2020. Power is overrated song I have to skip it every time
Bro you have to do the new City Morgue album
10 years later and you‚Äôre still wrong. Ig time doesn‚Äôt really change people
I really needed that 2020 tree intro Anthony
When MBDTF gets the same score as JIK...
A 6!? Come in melon you should really re-re-review
Why do you hate us
Hey Melon, Fuck you.
I&#39;m commenting this before watching. If he doesn&#39;t give it a 6 again, fuck this review
I hate you
I have to disagree about nicki‚Äôs verse on monster. I‚Äôm not a fan of hers but she outrapped even jay z on that one.
(RUNAWAY WAS WAY DEEPER)
Why did the blueberry flavored candy cane give Kanye a 6 again?
Not very cool
you‚Äôre so edgy omg... not like the other girls at all uWu
I agree with melon on runaway. Not a fan of it. In fact I hated it so much it put me off of Kanye for a long time until recently.
the only part of this record im upset he doesnt like is the nicki minaj verse.... im gonna cry bro
Can you do a redux of this redux?
oh god this review is so terrible
Praise the melon
TBH..... this album has REALLY high points and REALLY low points so this rating is justified ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
All of the Lights is one of my favorite songs of all time!
Whyyyyy whyyy must you blue ball me like this melon fuuuuuck
Some people are actually mad, wth, I thought it was just a meme
Imagine thinking the album isnt at the lowest a 9
Say sike right now ‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó
The second half is actually good bro wth
So you‚Äôre telling me you can make a 22 minute video about an album only to give it a light 6.... again. Bruh
What‚Äôs wrong with this guy
No
Man, I fucking love this album, but the melon really does make some good points here as much as it hurts to say it. I&#39;ve never had the courage to admit it but this album does end super weak in comparison to the rest of the album. Still a pretty solid masterpiece in my opinion though. I&#39;m glad he kept it at a light 6, it&#39;s been fun joking about his review all these years.
when he said he didn‚Äôt like all of the lights i unsubbed
What!? How do you not like that Nicki Verse?! Everyone loves that Nicki Verse!
Spoiler Alert: Melon gives this record a 666
those opposites are what make people lost, lost in this world... should review the video of MBTDF
Fuck u tho.
Please review paris Hilton&#39;s first album : PARIS
THE MAD MAN!
I dont understand brUH<br><br><br>Edit: finished the review. He makes some great points although i dont agree with him entirely
He played us like a damn fiddle.
LMAO ALL OF YOU JUST GOT FUCKED
Why does it look like you&#39;re wearing a red shirt under, melon!
Can we get a redux redux review for this album?
It&#39;s amazing how much of a downward spiral Kanye had after this album. Like we thought he was bad at the time, but he is even worse now
Anthony: üçà(isn‚Äôt christlike)
Ahaha haha haha you gave  in melon head
There&#39;s so many points that I could explain that you misinterpreted from the album but what&#39;s the point...it&#39;s your perception. <i>You just don&#39;t get it.</i>
Third times the charm?
Runaway is NOT relatable?  Bruh, ask your female friends how many dick pics they have received in their lives.  Trust me, it&#39;s a lot.  Runaway is wayyy more relatable than you think.
Dude fuck this new mobile app format. Why did they hide the comment section like that?!
Do dance gavin dance self titled
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen a person who doesn‚Äôt like all of the lights.
Hell of a life is pretty heavy tho
Ehhhhh fuck you
Fuck you man
Hey melon, you should review &quot;CAN - Tago Mago&quot;
First time disliked a melon, not bc of the review or ratin&#39;. But bc Melon tried to bait us got clout. Very disappointed.
You better do a review for ‚ÄúCircles‚Äù
10 years and you&#39;re still a dumbass, good job
fucking chad
I miss the old Kanye :/
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=445">7:25</a> So do you not watch 30 Rock Anthony?
you are terrible at listening to music -dage
12k dislikes jesus christ
j-verse good nicki verse bad... the homophobia weve faced sisters...
It‚Äôs an 8.5/10
I would be more accepting if you said you like molesting children than believing MBDTF is a 6.
Disagree. I loved this album, and almost all of the second half are 10/10s.
I think we can all agree.. &quot;All of the Lights&quot; should have just never happened
I was fine with all criticisms until you shat upon runaway
Tony really went off on this joint
10 years later and we‚Äôre still not on the same page üòÇ but on a side note I‚Äôd like to see a worst to best on Queen or Prince üëç
Finally he said it. This album is overrated indeed.
sorry fantano, gonna unsubscribe now.
Why would you redo it if it‚Äôs the same score. I don‚Äôt get it.
melon tryna compete with youtube for 2nd most disliked video of all time
BRO FUCK YOUü§£
He can‚Äôt keep getting away with this
U full of shit dawg u just want likes all over again and make this popular lol
FUCK YOU BALD GUY
To quote Shawn Cee: &quot; I&#39;ma cyber bully again&quot;
Ya dropped the ball Mr. Mel√≥ni
10 out of 10! Review it again!
Imagine having to hear this dude opinions to decide whether or not you think an album is good.
Fucking based!
What a joke of a reviewer lol
Crazy how so many disliked the video for not agreeing. Cmon
yessir
Of course you realize this means war.
MBDTF: CAN WE GET MUCH HIGHER???<br><br>Fantano: No
HOW THE FUCK U GONNA SAY SHIT ABOUT RUNAWAY
This is the top of the mountain that Kanye will never again reach. Simple
Anthony says ‚ÄúLost in the world lyrics sound like they‚Äôre about nothing‚Äù like how can you say something so dumb, the Album is literally titled ‚ÄúMy beautiful dark twisted fantasy‚Äù what do you think he‚Äôs talking aboutüòÇüòÇ his fantasies, the sex, the thoughts, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs opposites, it‚Äôs LITERALLY describing how it‚Äôs beautiful and dark good-bad, etc, no Anthony?
i respect your decision ma boi
I really fucking despise you
He tripping on CyHi verse
Ah! My melon!!
fuck you
Thank you Ant this needed to be done
you got balls of steel giving it a 6 again
Nicki Minaj: you might think you‚Äôve peeped the scene<br>Me: wait hold up go back
Channel gets slow repost dark twisted fantasy  üòÇ
everyone wanted melonani then jesus christ did the laundry
Fantano sometimes is wrong, he is human and you guys need to accept that
Man....aside from ‚ÄúDark Fantasy‚Äù, ‚ÄúDevil in a New Dress,‚Äù ‚ÄúSo Appalled‚Äù, ‚ÄúGorgeous‚Äù, ‚ÄúPower‚Äù, and parts of ‚ÄúRunaway‚Äù, this album doesn‚Äôt have shit else to say. Sprinkle in some weak features and some underwhelming beats in the album‚Äôs second half and you got an average to slightly above average album. I said it back in the day when it came out when I was in college and I still feel that way. Now you have a bunch of teens and kids in their early 20s claiming that this album is Kanye‚Äôs masterwork because of some outdated memes.
All of the lights is one the most fun Kanye songs
When you think about it. The thumbnail of the video is Anthony looking down and laughing. He‚Äôs clearly laughing at the comments haha
Nice &quot;Ers&quot; voice over at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=575">9:35</a>
LMFAO HE STILL GAVE IT A 6!!
One of his best album
BOO THIS MAN
imagine reviewing music on the internet for you&#39;re whole life
Even if I  not totally agree with all stuff, gotta respect your opinion. You made your points clear. I also was never able to fully enjoy it, for me it&#39;s like a 7 to 8. I always appreciated it as an important and kinda unique album, but I never really loved it. <br><br>One point I must hardly disagree is the thing with Nicki Minaj. Even after ten years she still has the best part on &quot;Monster&quot;. Maybe not lyrically, but the delivery is still fire.
How don‚Äôt you like Cyhis verse? Also put the real cover on here clown
I respect most of your opinions on this but to imply that Nicki&#39;s verse Monster was &quot;too much&quot; when it was one of the best verses of the decade is <b>WILD</b>
6 out of 5! That&#39;s crazy
Oh my god it‚Äôs happening
All who call on the name of the lord will be saved Jesus said I am the resurrection and the life, he who believes in me will live even though they die. We must be willing to turn from sin to receive Jesus forgiveness , And to know and live out his teachings. KJV, NKJV, NASB.üôÇ
The thing you harp on are super minor. Kanye hasn&#39;t released an album this good since. 1) late registration, 2) mdbtf 3) college dropout 4) graduation. The rest are  footnotes
Lil pump is officially better than kanye
Well at least there&#39;s no inflation in your review scores, 10 years later. Genuinely thankful for your thoughtful reviews btw, Anthony
Love that Murder Ballads is often in the background of your videos
my boy sad he&#39;s still got nick cave out wtf
DAAMNNN BOI HE THICC
Wrong again
He always finds something wrong....
Might unsubscribe melo but I can&#39;t let u go
I have never heard one bad word about nikki&#39;s verse on monster until today
Fantano is togh but fair
This isn‚Äôt a LMFAO Classic review
load video<br>check description<br>oh, melon :&#39;)<br>close video
Definitely this project isn&#39;t made for you, with Yeezus they are the best Ye&#39;s albums of the decade ( consequently, in the god tier for all artist) / I totally respect your opinion and your second try on MBDTF, but your reproaches while dealing with Lost in the world, All of the lights, Blame Game and ESPECIALLY Runaway ( I was about to turn my computer off I presume when you giggled about the ending vocals which IMO marks the supreme artistic level Kanye has reached so far at the time) almost made me sick. Still I hugely enjoyed the review  as you were &quot;supposed&quot; to give it a better mark to not piss off your fanbase again, but you did as it pleased you and that is totally professional and, meh, brave I suppose !!
‚ÄúFarty ass baselines‚Äù üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
I will never be able to not love All Of the Lights. Agree to disagree. Also, I&#39;m right.
It‚Äôs now on sight. Melon
THIS NERDS DISSIN THE NICKI MINAJ VERSE IN MONSTER
But what are your favorite songs ?
Thanks Anthony, for reminding me of my opinion on this album.
now way he really did it
When you make an album even a quarter of this you can say something
Redux Review aka<br><br>I don‚Äôt like Kanye for whatever reason but if you all do I must please you
Dang, I can&#39;t believe he hated on the Nikki verse
I&#39;m going to remind you in 2030 you have to re-re-review this. I&#39;ll be there, you bastard.
Melon boi
10 u idiot
legend
This is my favourite album of all time
Still waiting for that swimming relistenüòÅ
Melon, I get you like the album but why did you have to subtract 3 points because of his skin color?
IGN would&#39;ve gave it a 9/10<br> it has a little something for everyone.
ok now review it again
I give it a 5
Fix your hair.<br>You look like a neglected chia pet
I think MBDTF is better than TPAB, fight me
6/10 is a completely fair rating for this album change my mind
Review Mac Miller‚Äôs posthumous track Good News!
Libthony Tardtano
Anthony has now become the most wanted man on /mu/
Now do Swimming
This album is a 10
Bro... absolutely dumbfounded at you ripping on All Of The Lights... What a masterpiece. I can&#39;t believe someone just ripped a masterpiece like that... Don&#39;t even know what to say.
i fuckin love this guy ahahahhahaha
This would&#39;ve been a 10 if you had reviewed it a third time.
finally
u bored
I thought he changed it
You&#39;ve surrendered. Shame on you.
Still disagree. I think this album is absolutely amazing
Man you‚Äôve gotta listen to Rick Ross‚Äôs verse on Devil in a New Dress again. Best Rick Ross verse of all time.
Really nigga?
you look like if michael vsauce was an egg
hahaha the fucking melons on this man
Very cool review, Anthony! I think you‚Äôve done a pretty good analysis on this album, however the part of the video where you were jumping up and down and screaming racial slurs seemed a little out of place.
I totally get not liking the album version of runaway. I sometimes skip it on playthroughs, but the live performance during the year arch the thrones was life changing.
Throw it in rice.
Melon trying to patch up his legacy
Really milking this album for all its worth... Which admittedly is a lot since you got me with your damn clickbait!
Only three things are certain in life. Death, taxes and Anthony giving MBDTF a 6 out of 10
Melon and I literally like all the opposite songs on this album
The real reason melon doesn‚Äôt give this album a 10 is because of his idiotic political beliefs
FUCK y&#39;all
The absolute fucking melons on this lad
6/10? This nigga‚Äôs trippin.
Uh oh.
During my first year in the military (2010), a fellow airman &amp; I rapped Kanye&#39;s &quot;So Appalled&quot; verse.  Classic!
HE DID IT AGAIN THE MADLAD
This man reviewed this album gave it a 6/10 when he had only a good handful of subscribers and now that he has 2 million he was like &quot;JUST SO YOU KNOW I GAVE THIS A 6/10&quot; just to let you know he sticks to his fucking guns
so you gave my beautiful dark twisted fantasy a 6 but my beautiful dark twisted fantasy a 6?
YES! that doubledown was so satisfying!
Me starting the video: &#39;he probably gave it higher now because he realizes it was too low&#39;<br><br>Me after the video: &#39;let&#39;s have a toast to the douchebag&#39;
No one:<br>Absolutely no one:<br>Melon: COP LIGHTS FLASH LIGHTS STREET LIGHTS BUD LIGHT
why are you even giving this a 6 lmao you&#39;re trashing it completely, just give it a 3, which is weirdly what you really think it deserves
How do u have such a niche, specific job, and you still suck at it
Thirsty for that view money, huh?
XDDDD
yes thank you all of the lights really is one of his worst tracks
I would enjoy hearing what you have to say about David Bowie&#39;s Diamond Dogs?  Just a thought.
Nicki has said she didn‚Äôt want the Monster verse to be so crazy with all the inflection changes, that was Kanye pushing her to do it many different ways then he chopped them up together
No    review it again
Idk what y‚Äôall expected melon will be melon. I disagree with him but what did y‚Äôall expect.
So you just not gonna review roddys album?
Kanye‚Äôs new  love for Christ has the devils children riled up
I&#39;ve never been inspired or blown away by a Kanye record. Is there something i&#39;m too stupid to get? Am I missing something? I just don&#39;t get the hype. Not trying to start beef, just want to open up a discussion.
&quot;Turn the 6 upside down, it&#39;s a 9 now&quot;
Finally I&#39;ve been waiting for this review for a long time! Thanks melon for Redux! As complex said this is one of the best albums of decade!!
10 years and he&#39; still wrong.
WHERE IS JON OF ARTV
Can&#39;t relate
Also the sleepy hollow line means she gave so much head that it&#39;s goneü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Why are your lips so far away from your nose?
HOOOLLY SHIIIT
Guys, calm down. He&#39;s entitled to his objectively wrong opinion.
Already? Thought you would have done it later in the year closer to the tenth anniversary of the album.
Anthony &quot;Chopped-up Soul Samples&quot; Fantano
6/10 is generous tbh
this has gotta be bait. when did fantano become such a pretentious fuck that constantly has to pick apart the bars because they don‚Äôt fit his political beliefs. he obviously still doesn‚Äôt understand the concept behind the album. the lyrics reflect how fame has turned kanye into an egotistical, misogynistic,  ‚Äúmonster‚Äù so to speak. the lyrics are <b>meant</b> to offend you. it‚Äôs to emphasize the concept. this review was a shitshow to watch. imagine thinking dark fantasy and power is the best songs on the album, then hating on gorgeous, runaway, so appalled, devil in a new dress, and hell of a life. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=1073">17:53</a>
I recently discovered your channel and it would mean the world to me if you checked out Royal Canoe. They&#39;re a Canadian indie band, they&#39;re not very big at all, but their music to me is incredible. They had an album called Waver that came out earlier in 2019. They also have an album called Today We&#39;re Believers and another album called Something Got Lost Between Here and the Orbit. If you could check any of those out and possibly review one of them that would be awesome! Thanks!
Did he just say what he said about All Of The Lights?! ü§≠
I totally agree that this album is just okay with only a couple of highlights. But it&#39;s nice that people have something to love collectively.
I know it‚Äôs your opinion, but your opinion is wrong
Gorgeous best track
Who&#39;s more delusional, Kanye fanboys or Beyonce fangirls??
After noting the themes of racial inequality on gorgeous, how tf can melon say he doesn&#39;t see how the Gil Scott Heron poem ties things together??? It could be about where kanye goes from here...? The fuck? It&#39;s obviously about who will survive and prosper in america, blacks or whites, and kanye&#39;s success in america as demonstrated throughout the album is black excellence on display. The tides are turning in america, basically. Like... How tf you miss that melon? Fuck I&#39;m finna review this review on god
Hey Anthony do you think you can do a Pink Floyds &quot;The Wall&quot; review. I&#39;m very interested in what you might have to say about this album
<b>Looks at dislike</b> Yeah he still dosent like it
glad i&#39;m not the only one who thinks Lost in the World/Who Will Survive in America is such an anticlimactic closer. overall i&#39;d still give the album a decent 8, but it&#39;s way too flawed of an album to be the 10 many paint it out to be.<br><br>great review as always, really enjoyed finally hearing your opinion on this one in more depth.
I respect and love this album but I think I respect Anthony more cause he‚Äôs willing to let the Internet fuckin clown him all over again
I heavily disagree on a few things: <br><br>How does the Gorgeous beat overstay its welcome? It&#39;s extremely well produced and sounds quite unique in its sonic presentation. The distorted guitars sound beautiful and compliment the filtered vocals well. I completely disagree with your critiques of the production, and I would argue it&#39;s one of the most unique sounding rap songs I&#39;ve ever heard. Rays verse is also fantastic. <br>---<br>How in any way is Nickis Willy Wonka line bad? She&#39;s literally just saying her car is purple like Willy Wonka. I fail to see how this is corny or a display of bad writing.<br>---<br>Ohhhh boy, your opinion on runaway has some pretty weak arguments and I don&#39;t think you understood the overarching point. The entire song is Kanye trying to accept his insecurities and faults. He&#39;s calling himself a douchebag, asshole, and a scumbag on the chorus. I don&#39;t think the &quot;picture of my dick&quot; line is bad within the context of the song, since it&#39;s intended to be sexually immature. I also find it odd how his sex lyrics on 4th Dimension were praised by you, as well as his nonsensical screaming on Feel The Love, but you felt the need to call one line &quot;cringey&quot; on Kanyes arguably best song. As for the outro, again, you blatantly misunderstood the point of it. It&#39;s supposed to be inaudible to represent the preconceived bias that the public has against Kanye i.e. they don&#39;t understand him. Kanye&#39;s positive intentions don&#39;t come across as he wants, and this is very clearly represented in the way that his vocals are heavily distorted in the song. Keep in mind that this was made after the Taylor Swift incident. <br>---<br>Additional complaints: Cyhi had a pretty great verse, the drums on all of the lights are also not badly produced at all, and Hell of a Life goes hard.<br><br>Conclusion: This review is definitely better than your original one, but I still disagree with it.
DEHH For a reaction!
Literally slow-clapped
Runaway is the greatest song ever written full-stop
album of the decade, fuck off.
FUCK
omg this is because of lil nas isn&#39;t it
How does melon hate the CyHi verse? üò∑
Anthony Clowntano
review good news by mac miller before circles comes out please!
So this is how democracy ends, with a melon
anthony: <b>*says he&#39;s gonna review MBDTF again</b>*<br>subs: ok now he&#39;s gonna raise the score<br>also anthony: <b>*gives a light 6*</b><br>subs: WAIT NOT LIKE THAT
10 Lifetime Years Over, The Most Influencial Artist Of The Decade, Broke The Risk.
Good news track listen next please.
anthony fantano is a swiftie: confirmed
His critique on runaway makes me realize some people just don‚Äôt get it. And it‚Äôs ok I‚Äôm actually glad you can‚Äôt relate to such a dark project.
You should be made to go to music jail for this
How dare you skip the runaway outro.........
Anthony Fantwang is rarted
Hey Anthony! Please review Everywhere at the End of Time by the Caretaker. It has a very interesting concept on dementia.
A year ago I hated this review, but now I 100% agree with it. Guess I got converted
Melon, review youtubers albums, some dudes released an album under the name of trace and mello, need to know if its good or trash before i listen to it.
put the po boys down, we gotta talk outside
The absolute madman.
give it a 6 one more time and you&#39;re gonna summon the devil
Whats the poing of re reviewing it if the score isn&#39;t gonna change
i expected him to give it another 6 but i‚Äôm still mad about it
&quot;Anthony fanny&quot; Evan cook 2020
Looolllloll
i never though i would see the day
Why
Real men have cried to Runaway and this man obviously isn&#39;t one of them, clearly doesn&#39;t hit him in the feels
Farty baselines - Melon 2020
Needle, any chance you can review Introducing the Hardline According to Terence Trent D&#39;Arby?
Oh wow, he really did that
kinda funny how you give MBDTF a strong 5 yet gives TLOP an 8 and KSG a 10
Probably one of the most overrated albums of all time. It seems to have meme‚Äôd itself into greatness at this point. Was the roll-out for the album legendary? Hell yeah. I was in college when it was released and I didn‚Äôt come across a single person who preferred it over Late Registration or even College Dropout. Now you have a bunch of Gen Z‚Äôers putting it on some type of pedestal because of a meme from 10 years ago when they were still in elementary school.
I unsubscribed
Runaway is cringe
It&#39;s gonna take weeks for his subscribers to recover after he did Runaway like that
Yall can hate but hes right
Rodeo is a better album, thank you.
I&#39;m bobbing my head through this whole video cause I&#39;m vibing to all the songs he&#39;s describing in my head haha.
Melotron you say?  Sounds like a nickname for someone
Really curious about what you think of roddy rich&#39;s album lol
He only re-reviewed this album because he had to elaborate why he gave it a 6 last time
He did ... he fucking did it
OMG ANTHONY ITS A VOCAL MINORITY<br><br><br>HALF YOUR COMMENTS SECTION AINT EVEN HEARD AN MP3 that wasn&#39;t ON LIMEWIRE
i know you don‚Äôt like kanye and his album but was it necessary to call out and make fun of kanye‚Äôs health problems and the n word 6 times
<b>FARTY ASS BASS LINES</b>
You haven‚Äôt learned to your lesson melon man, your day of reckoning will come
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=717">11:57</a>
shut up baldy.
He actually did, what a mad man
But....are u sure?
A 6? A 6!?!? Your opinion no longer matters on music. Unsubscribed.
While I don‚Äôt agree with a lot he said, the way he described his thoughts really made sense in coming to the rating that he had. I respect it.
Gottem
Y‚Äôall just got hit with a 6 two times looool
You was Wylin in 2010 n u wylin now. 10/10
Me: Yo come get this bread.<br><br>Goose: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=1073">17:53</a>
&quot;I miss the old kanye, I miss Bush didn&#39;t care about black people kanye&quot; -melon<br>Really? You&#39;re really gonna criticize kanye now because he doesn&#39;t go along with your narrative?
he really shouldn‚Äôt have clickbaited so hard by hyping this up so much and still giving it the same rating kind of scummy imo
Rick Ross has the best feature on the album, Melon
I do like this one more than the original review though, all i really remember from the last one was, hooks are basic, and i dont like kanye&#39;s real life antics
Review the new GROUPLOVE single
#31 on trending
I can understand your POV.
Melon really pulled an epic gamer move
‚ÄúHow you say broke in spanish me no hablo‚Äù -Kanye West<br><br>Legend
Also the album had a lot to do with amber rose
Savage
Best album in his discography
dope, I still disagree, good review.
Now i remember why i unsubbed to him. This album is a masterpiece, this guy is literally splitting hairs.
Should have celebrated 2M by doing AOTD list
horrible again
Bruh
I can&#39;t believe he gave MBDTF a six and MBDTF a six smh
After watching i have to agree
Legend.
If you listen to 90‚Äôs rock, listen to my original songs on my channel? I‚Äôd love the support!
He talks about the line about anal and gangbang without acknowledging the real point of the line, which is about how much of our society still views having sex with a black man as a sexually deviant act and how racist that is. &quot;She said her price go down she ever fuck a black guy, or do anal, or a gangbang, kind of funny they&#39;re all considered the same thing.&quot; Great review though, Fantano forever, just wanted to point that out.
So thanks for ruining the score for me fellas, checked the dislikes and knew immediately that the score was still a 6 or lower. Fuck you for having opinions
Wrong cover art buddy
All of the lights is the best stfu
The foreshadowing was real
<b>THE MADMAN</b>
All of the lights should be remastered, it‚Äôs such a beautiful composition that could have so much more potential if redone
&quot;You&#39;re wild sex fantasy is just every college-age straight dude&#39;s porn history.&quot; I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever heard a sentence that 100% pegged me down to a tee quite like that one.
HAHAHAHAHA YOU DID IT AGAIN
He gave a kanye album the same rating as a logic album... damn
tony loves murder ballads a lot eh
Fuck you bitch
Reviews like these are the reason why Fantano is the best music critic at the moment. He is not influenced by hype and the general consensus of an album and always gives his honest opinion.
This is the equivalent of copying and rewording 90 percent of your old college essay and turning it in again at a different class
Could understand everything he was saying up until he got to Monster and So Appalled. Wtf. Nicki&#39;s verse is the goddamn highlight of her career. Also Cyhi&#39;s verse on So Appalled is fucking dope? Goes downhill from here.
U know the dunkey saying about being nit-picking and biased? It‚Äôs true here.
We all waited a decade for this?
Do a review for When the Smoke Clears - Three 6 Mafia
What‚Äôs the point of reviewing it again if ur just gonna give it the same score?? This album is easily one of the best albums of the century and ur just a Kanye hater.
I like Rethony and all, but whatever happened to that Anthony Fantano guy who used do the reviews
I didn‚Äôt know it was still classics week
Thank you very cool but PLEASE REVIEW THE COLLEGE DROPOUT
I was really hoping you‚Äôd realize how amazing this album is but I gotta say I got mad respect for you for sticking to your guns
AAd
Hell of a life is a great song.
I really don‚Äôt understand why people are so upset that one man‚Äôs opinion is vastly different from theirs. Most people love this album. Why can‚Äôt one man just not?
Dam he snap hard üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇstill 6/10
I bet he‚Äôll give Scorpion 9.5/10
If the album came out before Anthony started this channel, this would be a classic review
Never back down, Melon Man.
Pound that dislike button. We shall not stand for this. Libthony Tardtano must be defeated.
You‚Äôre angering me Anthony
As soon as we hit all of the lights my hopes dropped
Devil In A New Dress, best song on the album. Let&#39;s goooo.
Can you review Patrick wolf ‚Äúmagic position album ‚Äú<br>Or ‚Äúthe bachelor ‚Äú<br><br>Curious would be stoked to see what you think

Melon in 2010: 6/10<br>Melon in 2020 6/10 <br>ITS NOT FUNNY ANYMORE TRY DIFFERENT JOKES!
Anthony please the blue flannel doesn‚Äôt let me know what your thoughts on the Iran Crisis are.
Hes just like kanye. He only did the review for the clout ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Really like the contrast of your blue shirt with the red of the album cover. 10/10 shirt.
Melon is the ultimate Chad
Yeah, I agree, and Kanye is annoying and obnoxious. However, Lana&#39;s Ultraviolence should get a strong 7 at least : p
oh shiiddddd
I know everybody has their own opinions and taste, but I truly can‚Äôt understand how he so strongly dislikes the second half of the album.  Devil in a new dress and runaway are widely regarded as 2 of the greatest Kanye songs ever.<br><br>I think Melon is missing the direction Ye took the album on the second half of it.  He‚Äôs not accounting for who Ye is as a person and what this album is all about.  Like he talks about the line ‚ÄúI sent this bitch a picture of my dick‚Äù and how it‚Äôs sung off tune in a lot of parts.  Okay, yes, it‚Äôs not the greatest line to hear on such a raw and emotional song, but guess what, it‚Äôs raw and emotional for Ye.  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs supposed to be sung well.  And in terms of where Kanye was at this point in his life, this point of the album, the line works because it fits the narrative of him struggling with fame and love.<br><br>And the second half of the song with the inaudible vocals representing Ye being misunderstood and not heard by the public eye or whoever he‚Äôs trying to speak to is such an amazing representation of how he feels.  It‚Äôs art man... it surprises me that someone as intelligent and in touch as melon usually is, is missing the ball here.
I had to turn it off when you started talking about Monster. We get it, Melon. You can&#39;t admit you were wrong. Fair, we can&#39;t either.
The album is for black people
He really fuckin gave it to them holy shit.
Probably one of the most overrated albums of the decade. TIL fans of this album DGAF how its mixed or produced. This guy points out some real flaws in the production &amp; composition of this thing &amp; still doesn&#39;t like it. Thumbs up from me to a critic doing some actual work.
I normally would never say this but you literally just don‚Äôt get it

OH WTF CMON MANNNNNN<br>I WAS LEGIT EXPECTING LIKE A classic/10 AND THEN IT&#39;S FUCKING 6 AGAIN<br>melon you wack XD
now let&#39;s wait for the third episode of the review
Anthony says cringe at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=1005">16:45</a>
my beautiful bruh fantasy
Cmon ant how is this 6/10 if it‚Äôs all bangers
The Great Hip Hop Album of all time! I‚Äôve been saying this for years. But Kayne is on some fuck shit lately. So fuck Kanye!
Imagine not liking Nicki Minaj on Monster
Your review is trash.
Once a melon, always a melon
Mans has rated Lil Pump albums higher than Fantasy LMFAOO
Rehashing your same bad takes about this album 10 years later just so you could add that bit about being glad the koalas are dying... idk just seems tacky, my dude.
Hm. I don&#39;t understand melon sometimes. Listen om not a mdbtf Kanye gits fanboy. But it&#39;s like it&#39;s random what he thinks is funny and clever and is dumb and stupid. FX the Minaj feature on monster is Hella epic, no?
Melon is cancelled. Again.
Well....at least this one doesn‚Äôt have as bad of a like/dislike ratio
Listen y‚Äôall, I don‚Äôt necessarily agree with him, but i thought this was a great review. He stood by his opinion from the last video and didn‚Äôt change just because people disagreed with him. Shows that he‚Äôs showing his honest opinion about the track and not just a people pleaser.
6/5. Nice! Thank you, Anthony!
why does he hate the songs i love
that kero kero bonito reference tho üò≥ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=97">1:37</a>
Now its time to get hyped for MBDTF REREDUX review in 2030
Anthony, he means &quot;So much head it was succed off&quot;
Loved the review Anthony.<br>I really like this new format of rating albums. It is a little peculiar rating an album from 0 to 6 instead of 0 to 5 or the more traditional 0 to 10 you&#39;ve been using for a decade. But we&#39;ll get used to it!<br><br><br>As a life long Kanye West fan, I&#39;m glad you revisited this masterpiece and gave it the perfect score it deserved. :)
why must you keep hurting us?
I&#39;m late and the like to dislike ratio is looking spicy as hell
Dude really gave it a 6 again... smh melon
Please go on the 5H1T Show with Hannibal and Monty and review music with them
Would&#39;ve been a 10 if the album was called My Beautiful Light Twisted Fantasy
10 for me baby
nah nicki‚Äôs verse was killer, i don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about rn
2 million of the least funny commenters on youtube. What a time to be alive
time to thumbs it down for the meme.
Lol okay okay no more man. You don‚Äôt like it as much as us that‚Äôs your opinion. No need for us to get triggered. This album was just named album of the decade so it is what it is
Alright I‚Äôm a die hard mbdtf fan but I agree with you about the blame game skit
HE DID IT!!! HE FUCKING DID IT!!!
holy shit 10 years later and i... agree with you? <br><br>some of the songs are 9-10s and some are 2-3s that i always skip on relistens. so...6 is fair? what the fuck am i saying
Could you review snow tha product material? Id like to hear your thoughts on it
This guy is racist
after careful reconsideration of this review, i have come to a conclusion. Despite its importance in the evolution of Fantanos channel, this review still has quite a few faults. This review has not aged well. I will once again have to give this review a strong 5 to a light six.
I.............agree!
I‚Äôm gonna tell my kids this is what started WW3
My personal gripes about this album are very similar... it&#39;s not terrible, but it&#39;s not the classic many claim it to be.  It relies a bit too much on featured performers, some songs are too long and self indulgent, but there is a lot to enjoy as well.  The opening trio is classic, Monster, and about 2/3 of Runaway are amazing, but the rest is average at best.  I also feel All of the Lights is terrible.  I&#39;d give the album a strong 6.
MAC MILLER GOOD NEWS!!!!!!!
You aint got the answers, anthony.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=468">7:48</a> Y&#39;all gotta stop trying to make this some sort of slam dunk on Trump. This song was released in 2010 and the most popular thing to criticize Trump for back then was his demeanor on The Apprentice. The next line is &quot;baby you&#39;re fired, your girlfriend hired&quot; which is a clear reference to the TV show. No chance Ye was referencing Trump&#39;s little discussed real estate practices prior to his campaign and subsequent madness. This is such a popular take (melon, Dissect) but it&#39;s just recency bias.
I don&#39;t know why I expected this to go better than last time
Wouldve been a 10 if there were some rattling high-hats
Fuck me, this was a great review. Why do people care about the score so much.
See what we‚Äôre not gonna do is disrespect the most iconic female rap verse of the decade. I‚Äôll wait for y‚Äôall to name a better and bigger verse than Nicki‚Äôs on Monster.
Maybe this album is overrated due to some believing it is a masterpiece and the best album of hte last 20 years.....but its still not a 6. And I think you vastly underrate Runaway....disregard the &quot;picture of my dick&quot; and the song is  incredible. You should give Yelawolf another shot now also...just sayin. Cheers
Imagine having a different opinion than me
This is an elaborate troll job
2010: light to decent 6<br>2020: strong 5 to a light 6<br>2030: NOT GOOD
While I still disagree with your opinion, this is a really great review and it really shows how much you&#39;ve progressed as a reviewer. Cheers.<br>Hearing Fantano talking about the album for 22 minutes makes me want to talk about my thoughts on MBDTF, track-by-track. Just a precision : I&#39;m French so I don&#39;t really understand lyrics when listening to a song (especially hip-hop) so I can&#39;t judge the album on that aspect.<br><br><br>01. Dark Fantasy : Amazing opener. The introduction is still one of the most epic beginnings to an album I&#39;ve ever heard. The hip-hop section, while not as great, is still really cool, and overall this is a super solid track. 8/10<br><br><br>02. Gorgeous : I agree that it kinda overstays its welcome, but I really love that beat and the hook is mad catchy. 7.5/10<br><br><br>03. Power : HUGE beat. I don&#39;t even need to understand the lyrics to feel the, well, power. The King Crimson sample also helps. 8/10<br><br><br>04. All of the Lights (Interlude) : Well, it&#39;s just an interulde so there&#39;s not much to say about it, but it sure is pretty. (no rating)<br><br><br>05. All of the Lights : I find the instrumental really beautiful, and while I can understand how someone could dislike the mixing, I think it adds to the &quot;grand&quot; feeling of the song. 7.5/10<br><br><br>06. Monster : Typically the kind of song where my inability to understand lyrics prevents me to really enjoy a song. I always felt it was a bit too long, and one of the most uninteresting beats on the album. But it&#39;s still ok, and the hook is catchy. 6/10<br><br><br>07. So Appalled : Often considered as one of the weakest points, if not the weakest point of the album, but I always liked it. I really dig the beat (the chord progression kinda reminds of Queen&#39;s &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot;, and the hook is, again, catchy. 6.5/10<br><br><br>08. Devil in a New Dress : Beautiful sample of Smokey Robinson (and very creative, check out how it is made if you haven&#39;t, it&#39;s basically two different parts of a Smokey song pasted together to create a new melody, it&#39;s pretty neat) and I love the electric guitar on this track. 7.5/10<br><br><br>09. Runaway : Probably my song of the decade. The instrumental is beautiful, the strings are magical, all the hooks are amazing, and I love that ending solo. Is is too long ? Maybe, but still, it reminds me of Robert Fripp&#39;s guitar tone, so it can&#39;t be bad. 9/10 (maybe 9.5, depending on the day)<br><br><br>10. Hell of a Life : I find the main riff pretty bad ass, and the Black Sabbath interpolation doesn&#39;t bother me at all. And the &quot;organ&quot; (I guess) arpeggios that appears throughout the track is super cool. 7/10<br><br><br>11. Blame Game : My least favorite track of the album, not counting the interludes. The Aphex Twin sample is nice, but it goes on for too long, and while I don&#39;t hate the Chris Rock skit, I admit it&#39;s far from great, and it doesn&#39;t really fit with the vibe of the track. 5.5/10<br><br><br>12. Lost in the World : As much as Bon Iver bores me, the build-up in this track is really amazing. Actually, I often skip the track after the beat dropped, but these opening minutes are really good. 6.5/10<br><br><br>13. Who Will Survive in America : Like &quot;All of the Lights (Interlude)&quot;, there&#39;s nothing special to say about this, even if it&#39;s a pretty efficient closer. (no rating).<br><br><br>Average : 7.18/10, but my overall rating would be a 8/10, because I gotta admire the scope and magnitude of this record. <br><br><br>So yeah, that was my two cents about the record, I&#39;d be glad to discuss about it in the comments !
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Review &quot;The Amber Tapes&quot; by Kacevade
He had 2 choices: Not sponsor the minimalist metal wallet or give the album a 6.
Every Kanye is overrated. To celebrate his overrated career I am gonna review all of his album at Rate Your Music with 0.5/5
How do you not give credit for the 30 rocks and Alec Baldwin bars, without mentioning Alec Baldwin is a lead on 30 Rock?
An album with Runaway on it should be an automatic 10/10.
Review The Number 23 by CASISDEAD! Big Up UK
We need to change his name from Melon to Lemon cause he&#39;s sour af, this record is amazing you stinker
Fuck YOU LEMON
This is like the director&#39;s cut of the original review
What about See Me Now? My favorite track by far
The reason this album is so praised is because of the production, not the lyrics
Kanye Fan : ‚ÄúMelon‚Äôs doing a Redux review and he gave TLOP an 8, so he must definitely give MBDTF a higher rating right?‚Äù<br><br><br><br><br>no
I&#39;m on that weird part of YouTube again
Smh my head... Let this man have an opinion y&#39;all
And he says that Runaway is cringe. What about the incoherent glitch of the whole HAQQ of Liturgy? Or the godawful lyrics and singing of Richard Dawson&#39;s 2020? There are worst things rated higher than MBDTF, (a 9 to Charli XCX? Seriously?) saying a lot about the incompetence and tone deafness of Fantano.<br>The album actually deserves at very least an 8. I don&#39;t care about the lyrics, the production and the songwritting are by far, better than any Hobo Johnson or Billie Eillish.
liked your cameo on Young Sheldon S03E11, Nathano.
A very good review as always and I respect your opinion but saying that you wished that Kanye died in that car crash he had in 2002 so he would&#39;ve never released this album was going a bit too far
He gave the album of the decade a 6 twice lollll. OpinionsüòÇ
Trending betch
Waits 10 years to re review his most infamous review, gives it slightly lower rating. <br><b>Complethany Savagtano</b>
Shut the hell up and play the song.... SMH.
but anthony hell of a life is the best song in the album
You&#39;re so wrong
Just..fuck off
So, the  Charli XCX album is a 9 and this is a 6, right?<br>Lol<br>Even if this album isn&#39;t perfect, how the fuck is that shitfest of aesthetics with poor songwriting (Charli) better than MBTDF?
fuck you
6 again!???? Lmaoooo hahaha you are a legendary troll
REVIEW IT AGAIN. <br>AND AGAIN. <br><br><br>AND AGAIN. <br><br><br>UNTIL YOU LOVE IT, <br>UNTIL IT GETS A 10/10.
HE WILL NEVER EVER LIVE THIS DOWN, DOWN, DOWN
Its always been overrated, what do people see in this guy.
Is this an, out of season april fools joke?
&quot;Y&#39;all know this is just my opinion, right?&quot; That may be true but it&#39;s been objectively wrong, twice.
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=575">9:35</a> amen
Real cute, melon. I&#39;m gonna get 2 million of my friends to subscribe to you and then you&#39;ll have to do this again until you do it right. It&#39;s the only way you&#39;ll learn.
HA HA
Dark Fantasy - great song<br>Gorgeous - too long for ‚Äúsonically baseless‚Äù instrumental<br>Power - great song<br>All of the Lights Interlude - great song<br>All of the Lights - NOT GOOD (mixed poorly and bad lyrics????? ü§ï)<br>Monster - THE FEATURES WERENT GOOD LMAOOOO<br>So Appalled - Too long and the FEATURES WERE BAD LMAOOOOOO<br>Devil in a New Dress - great song<br>Runaway - The lyrics weren‚Äôt good???????<br>Hell of a life - ‚Äúfarty‚Äù instrumental and weak lyrics towards concept of song<br>Blame Game - John Legend sounded weird and tbh I have no idea what the problem is with the Chris rock skit<br>Lost in the World - mixed poorly and weak lyrics???<br><br>This is why we ignore his opinion (only for this album) and leave it in the past, bc this was ASS
6/10 <br>Me: &quot;Turn it up!&quot;<br>Melon: &quot;That&#39;s the max&quot;

Yeezus, Kanye stans really need to let go that Melon will never change his review of this album.
I can&#39;t believe you gave this a 6, but you gave MBDTF a 6. What a joke.

TEN OUT OF TEN<br>REVIEW IT AGAIN
wow
Much love and props for the 2 million Anthony.  You&#39;re a god amongst men.  I mean this unironically,  salute!
No one melon should have all that power
You‚Äôve gone downhill this year man, I just can‚Äôt vibe with your opinions anymore, sorry but I‚Äôm unsubscribing.
Try so hard to be controversial
Fantano, you‚Äôre the GOAT for this
The absolute madman!
Anthony did this for clout.
Something&#39;s wrong<br>I turn my head<br>Fantano&#39;s gone<br>It&#39;s still a 6
I thought you would do a second review to only end up scoring it a 5. Or anything lower than the original score.
Power specifically refers to the Greek myth of the Sword of Damocles
The balls to review it again just to give it the same rating, respect
Thanks you covered it fast Melon, I was close to forming my own opinion on it
turned it off when he started bashing runaway
Review the new Mac Miller song Melon Man.
you‚Äôre insane
So are we canceling him for not stanning Nicki‚Äôs ‚ÄòMonster‚Äô verse?
Agree strongly with this redux I like this album it takes me to good time but it is highly overated and placed too high in Kanye discography and I never ever like all of the lights it was way too pop for me the intro for it was nice tho
On both reviews i feel like you say waaaaaaay more positive than negative, and i&#39;m like yeah i can live with these little nitpicks no need for salt BUT THE YOU RATE IT 6. I really don&#39;t understand. From your commentary, it feels like a strong 7, not a light 6
Thanks alot Antknee, you douche,<br><br><br><br>Luv u
Remember kids, you may have some unpopular opinions, but as long as you&#39;re honest, respectful, and articulate, everyone will get pissed off anyways.
why are your eyes so red Satan Santano
2010: 6/10<br>2020: 6/10<br>2030: should be about 10/10 according to my calculations...
I still love it now! Cute...Kanye&#39;s oral sex bars don&#39;t deliver LoL
Review the Marshall Mathers lp
I enjoyed the review up until you said ‚Äúit‚Äôs a ten but I have to take away marks because Kanye is black ‚Äù
LMAO
YES at the trash verses for &quot;run away&quot;! God I love the music and chorus, though!
fuck you melon
This is a 22 minute video that‚Äôs basically the same as the one 10 years ago. We‚Äôve been trolled gang lol

Will not hear any slander towards All of the Lights
Kanye: <b>evolves his worldview over time and develops an opinion that melon doesn&#39;t agree with</b><br>Melon: &quot;Impossible&quot;
Most anticipated review of the year turns into the best review of the year
Not sure why All of the Lights in particular is still revered, I haven&#39;t cared for it since my 3rd listen. That&#39;s essentially the entire album in a nutshell for me: Power, Dark Fantasy, Runaway, and Lost in the World are the tracks I still see the shine in but even still they don&#39;t generally have the replay value that I return to tracks for
The realization of fantasy is always a nightmare -- when a fantasy is made concrete, it can no longer serve its purpose as a fantasy, and becomes merely another link in the signifying chain.  This is the lesson of Lacanian pyschoanalysis.  And just as the realization of Kanye&#39;s fantasies became his nightmare, so too does theneedledrop comment section encounter their desires made manifest, in the form of the object of their most feverish and sweaty fantasies: the MBDTF re review.  But instead of catharsis or redemption, we find only a ghastly repetition of history, a dismal eternal return, and the realization that our disappointments will never be resolved, our fundamental brokenness will go unalleviated, and our suffering will never end.
I know this review is getting a lot of meme comments Anthony but I just want to take a moment to say that we respect and appreciate everything you do. :)
Ok but how you still not review Roddy Ricch album
Honestly, I feel like you initially made the review back when you were some hipster, everything popular is mediocre headass (also why you shit on based on a T.R.U story and since amended it because you matured and ur audience grew and you realized popular =/= mediocre), but the MBDTF review is such a staple in your legacy and you got so much shit for it you feel forced to double down. Even tho you know you trippin. But that&#39;s just my opinion...
Kanye is more woke now than ever before. Just cause he said those things about trump and racial disparities doesnt mean he can‚Äôt change his mind. In fact I would argue he was a victim like many blacks are to the leftist, neo Marxist ideology where minorities and oppressed people can do no wrong (ever) and the white people in power are always ‚Äúevil‚Äù. People, especially black people are never exposed to the other side of politics cause the democrats have them brainwashed and dependent on the government.
6 was too high anyway<br><br>EDIT: So Appalled is still one of Kanye&#39;s worst songs

Bushleague review. Everyone knows sampling Aphex garners a default 7. Get with it, Melon.
Hell of a life has always been my favorite songs in this album. Thanks for praising it with your kind words Melon.
As much as I disagree with a lot of your criticisms, I can say at least this review is objectively better your original. Your thoughts were laid out much better than ten years ago. It goes to show how much you have grown as a reviewer. Thank you, Melon.
&quot;We believe that your assumption is erroneous.&quot;
How does one not at least credit the fucking mixes and production? That makes it at least a 7
review elliot smith pls
Oh no not again
This melon just wants to see the world burn.
Dissing Nicki&#39;s verse in Monster? Lil Nas X is about to end you
‚ÄúKanye‚Äôs putting Jay-Z features on here like they‚Äôre going out of style‚Äù<br>...He‚Äôs only on 2 songs
This guy literally hated Nickies verse, probably a top 3 verse on the album claimed by 99 percent of people. I don‚Äôt get it....
Yeezus&gt;MBDTF
I completely agree with this review. Don&#39;t understand why it&#39;s so critically acclaimed when there are so few good songs. The beats are nice and some of the lyrics and features are good, but many of the lyrics are shallow and cringy. This is seen as one of the best albums of any genre of the 21st century, and I just can&#39;t see how anyone could see it that way even when I try

Finally a comment section that&#39;s actually about the album.
Kanye is just as dumb as drake
This is how many people want the jackboys review ~~~~~
I hadn&#39;t even listened the album, still watched both reviews.
Idk I like graduation way more imo
This review just makes me want to listen to the album again and again
&quot;This channel just hit 2 million subscribers&quot;<br><br>Seriously did not believe you when you said that. I&#39;ve been watching you for years and could have sworn you were way past 2 million considering how long you&#39;ve been at it and how known you are

THIS IS THE SECOND TIME MELON MAN<br><br>WATCH YOUR BACK OUT THERE CUH NO MORE WARNINGS
no I will not accept your opinion. You‚Äôre wrong and therefore I cannot like you. Damn you melon
Okay boomer
fantano not liking nicki&#39;s verse in monster proves he is homophobic...
My favorite Kanye album by far. And I love the crazy mix in All of the Lights. It‚Äôs compressed to shit because that‚Äôs the whole point of the album, excess.
Melon still doesn&#39;t fully get this album
You&#39;re my light, you&#39;re my six
I saw this pop up in my notifications and audibly said ‚ÄúNo. Fucking. Way.‚Äù
&quot;farty-ass baselines&quot;<br>-flanel man
I&#39;m sure most people just click on the video, opened the description immediately, saw the rating and disliked lol
Scumthony gangtano really just said that about nickis verse
I love you antony , respect for not change your opinion
I agree with everything you&#39;re saying, but you&#39;re wrong üòÇ Gorgeous is one of the best tracks ALL TIME. The mastering bugged me initially but I got past that after the 3rd listen and I understood the rawness of the mastering makes it feel even more personal.
this is my fault actually , i cannot get these 22 minutes of my life you wasted for another 6 out of 10
hope she sees this bro
The nerve, the audacity of this melon
Hands down My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is the best album Kanye west has ever made idc what anyone says and it is possibly one of the greatest albums released in hip hop period.
Pusha T‚Äôs verse in Runaway is out of place and the lyrical content is abysmal. Ruins the song imo.
Can you review this again in 2030?
The madman actually did it
Hahahahahahaha
&quot;...aand i still feel like that&quot;<br>bam, there<br>saved you 22 minutes<br><br>just kidding watch the man he good
This is the most overrated album of the decade
We demand redux of the redux.

a 6 is still too low
you gave his worst album ‚ÄúYe‚Äù<br><br>a 8 rating <br><br>and his best album a 6...i don‚Äôt even know why your opinion on this album even matters anymore just move on
I can&#39;t believe that Melon is literally shit talking the best verses that Nicki has ever spit.
Listened to this album for the first time today, 6/10
We really thought
I can&#39;t be the only one that&#39;s listening to the tracks on this album as he&#39;s reviewing them.
Love the review! Please do Dr Dre Chronic 2001 Redux
im gonna get u for this fantano
fantano youre done
LMFAOOOO
I feel like Nicki&#39;s theatrics on Monster are what make her most appropriate for the song&#39;s themes, even if she doesn&#39;t deliver as well lyrically.
review it again.....again
Anthony didn‚Äôt get the Alec Baldwin line on Gorgeous? The racial undertone is a given, the joke of the line is that Alec Baldwin was on the show 30 Rock.
He gave it a 6 , turn that 6 upside down its a 9 <br><br>9/10
GOD DAMN YOU ARE SO WRONG ABOUT ALL OF THE LIGHTS
Melon what happened to you going outside in front of a gigantic tree and yelling the name of the album you‚Äôre reviewing?
Thank you for reviewing  this again because I did not dislike your last review because you gave it a 6 but because  very underdeveloped and it seemed like the main reason you did not like it because of the drama Kanye talks about. While in this review you put much more detail on the individual songs  and why you liked and disliked the songs. Overall this review I don‚Äôt necessarily  agree with   This I would give it a  high 7 to a light 8 but you brought up  points to summarize your though very well thank you for this again.
The problem with middle class white  people reviewing hip hop music is they just don‚Äôt get why people say certain things I think it‚Äôs cringe they just don‚Äôt get it
6/10 + 6/10 = 12/10<br>Thank you for finally coming to your senses melon.
It&#39;s a 10 for me <br>But I respect your opinion
thank GOD you like Devil in A New Dress. top 3 Kanye tracks of all time imo.
this dude doesn&#39;t like the runaway outdo
My favorite rap album of all time, but the almighty melon hath spoken, and very articulately provided examples! Can‚Äôt ask more than that!
Doesn&#39;t the headless horseman go around lopping off people&#39;s heads, so there would be an abundance of severed heads in Sleepy Hollow, so it still makes sense?
Oh no.
Easily Kanye&#39;s last &#39;Classic&quot; record &amp; his best body of work. His first 5 albums are timeless, genre-pushing efforts. He&#39;s easily one of the most celebrated &amp; influential artists of all time. It&#39;s a shame his music isn&#39;t up to par any more &amp; has been put on the back burners ever since he got with Kim &amp; became a family man. Dude should either retire or stick to producing at this point. Cause these last couple of albums.....  Have been tarnishing his legacy. (IMO)
redux review MIA MAYA, 2010 thanks
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=820">13:40</a>? What Is so bad about cyhi`s verse? I mean the lyrics are clever and the flow is great...plus cyhi`s delivery! Anyone can read lyrics slowly and make them sound simple I mean come on! But I appreciate that you give your honest opinion!
He HATES Nicki&#39;s verse???
‚ÄúIt just feels like a whole lot about nothing.‚Äù -Fantano on a song from an album called My Beautiful Dark Twisted FANTASY
Uhh ohh. Buckle up, fellas
MELON TAIGHT ME
&quot;farty ass baselines&quot;
Wish I were subbed just so I could unsub for this weak ass take
How are you gonna criticize CyHi&#39;s verse without mentioning his most iconic line? <br>&quot;I met this girl on Valentine&#39;s Day fucked her in May, <br>She found out about April so she chose to March&quot;
I can&#39;t believe this day has arrived.
So you gave the album the same score as last time? <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Guess I‚Äôm giving you that same dislike I gave on the original, guess some things never do changeü§ß
T for timeout:<br><br>Cyhi‚Äôs verse was hardü§£ ‚ÄúI keep a Trojan in my pocket, Matt Lienart‚Äù ‚ÄúI keep bitches by the two‚Äôs, Noah‚Äôs ark‚Äù ‚ÄúCause you haters got Phd‚Äôs, y‚Äôall just some major haters and math minors, Tiger Woods, don‚Äôt make me grab iron‚Äù ‚ÄúI met this bitch on Valentine‚Äôs Day, fucked her in May, she found out about April so she chose to march‚Äùüò≠ This verse was fire. You not about to downplay it like that
This was worse than watching the Red Wedding.
&quot;There are a lot of ideas that have only gotten better with H.&quot; - Melon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=536">8:56</a>
Son of a bitch
So many pressed mfs lmao
Overrated would actually be a great single word to sum up Kanye West as a human, in general.
I honestly..... Honestly..... I&#39;m gonna get shit for this but, when I first listened to this album other than the standout songs- I honestly would skip over a lot of them. I agree with you Melon. Much prefer TLOP or even ye.
Glad I&#39;m not the only one who thinks Nicki&#39;s verse is overrated
You&#39;re Whack.
YOU
Finally someone else that thinks this album isn&#39;t a even a 9/10
I&#39;d love to hear a review of Moon Hooch&#39;s latest album, Life on Other Planets.  Keep up the great work!
HAHAHAHAHA ITS STILL A 6!!!
this redux review is about to be &quot;infamous&quot; like the first one lol
Go to hell, melon man
The fact his review follows the same progress of the album is insane. Starts off good then gets bad . Overall really thought out review good job melon big pp points for you A++ you passed the class
Now do Born this way
Fantano just doesn‚Äôt get it
He just reviewed it again to make the haters and MBDTF stans angrier
Fantano is the type of kid in your class who hates popular things to make himself more interesting
I have to disagree with you about Nicki Minaj on Monster. For me, her inflection switch ups brings that track to another level of savagery. I see where you‚Äôre coming from for many of your other criticisms, though. Even if I disagree.
Finally a good review from this wallet salesman! Now review it again.
Melon‚Äôs comment section: Thank you for making this review so that I can develop an opinion on this album.<br><br>Melon: gives MBDTF a light 6 <b>again</b><br><br>Melon‚Äôs comment section: Hol up
making a mistake once is fine, making a mistake twice is stupid
Relax guys, he‚Äôs just getting his most disliked video of this decade over with.
12/20
I swear, if this man does a redux review for DAMN., it&#39;s gonna be hell on earth.
John Legend Get Lifted is a classic
This video also highlights your growth as a reviewer massively
incorrect. Appreciated. but nevertheless. Incorrect
Clueless.<br>Dude just doesn&#39;t get it.<br>Startin to think this dude doesn&#39;t know music.<br>Just seems like a Pop head.
Kanye fans once again prove why they are the worst fan base on the planet
LMAO he actually gave it a lower review based
ok boomer
This review is straight up incredible
is this a joke?
BEST DUDE
<b>one 6, two 6, now we just need a third</b>
REVIEW IT AGAIN
Never been trolled so hard in my life
i love this album and i think it‚Äôs a 9 ish
He only gave it a six because it hasn&#39;t changed since the last time he gave it a six
Favorite thing to happen this year already: gave it another 6 LOL
ok i can understand the reasoning for majority of the tracks, but like Runaway has other layers to it, like he‚Äôs talking about/to the media and a loved one and potentially even himself in some lines. and the outro (to me) is what people see him as and they don‚Äôt understand him which is pretty good
Hey Anthony, really enjoy everything you do. I think itd be cool if you review Love Forever Changes, definitely a 10 from me and many others
HAHAHAHAHA
I give it a 9
I disagree with your opinion on this album but I think the redux review is what we needed, like, it&#39;s so much better, more focused than the original review, good job Anthony, I think you&#39;re getting better at reviewing each day
I agree with your review. This album is more of spectacle to me than a full thought out album. Lyrics are kinda hit or miss but when they hit they hit hard so when these poorly written rhymes or poorly written songs come in it‚Äôs fucking jarring. Beats are not basic at all I would say I appreciate the experimentation and the energy but it just falls short sometimes. ‚ÄúSent a picture of a my DIIIIXk.‚Äù I mean I just can‚Äôt defend that lol so all in all I genuinely like this album but it‚Äôs not some grandiose monument or a twin tower, it‚Äôs more like a start to a good sculpture but it‚Äôs kinda unfinished and rushed. 6.5/10 For me. Thx melon üçâ üëåüèª
a great nick cave album in the background
Melon: <b>makes MBDTF redux review</b><br>6: &quot;you couldn&#39;t live with your own failure. Where did that bring you? Back to me.&quot;
this reminds me when he gave DAMN  a 7
forever is quite right cuz nobody will shut the fuck up about this review
Gorgeous &amp; Devil in a new dress alone makes the album a 10 also The Nicki Monster verse is iconic asf.
Waiting on that Poppy album review mr. Cantaloupe man, really looking forward to hearing your thoughts
Unpopular opinion: Life of Pablo is better
I respect you for doing this... but you are still hating.
Great review melon...Now let&#39;s get a Yeezus Redux Review
Maybe if we ask him to review it again again we&#39;ll get that deserved 10
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=894">14:54</a> yeah but you just called his mastering on all of the lights awful
AWHHHH MAHNNN ANTHONY WHY YOU DO THIS TO MEEE
beautiful twisted fantasy is overrated tbh
Should‚Äôve left this one in the Drafts Bro
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=1073">17:53</a> for Quack
Skinny Puppy Last Rites Classic Review at some point in this new decade please.
pablo &gt; fantasy
Now a yeezus re review?
Aahh melon pls review the newest Mac Miller single &lt;3
I can&#39;t believe you&#39;ve done this... again!
Really great review Anthony, but did you have to spend the last 7 minutes justifying the missile strikes in Iraq?
meme of the year.
I&#39;m a part of history now
Mad respect for keeping the score and general opinion, Anthony
Still think this take on it is NUTS but music&#39;s subjective and at least there&#39;s some reasons now
Shawn where you at? We waitin for you to respond
What you did to Runaway and All of the lights, I&#39;ll never forget it Melon.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=1003">16:43</a> <br>Thought I was listening to h3h3 for a second
Thanks for reminding me that I haven&#39;t listened to MBDTF in a while
We are not leaving till we get a 9, wallet man.
Anthony Fantano - &quot;Melon&#39;s Beautiful Light 6 Fantasy&quot; Tracklist:<br>1. Light 6 Fantasy<br>2. 6orgeous <br>3. MELON&#39;S POWER<br>4. Worst Of The 6s (Melonlude)<br>5. Worst Of The 6s<br>6. Melonster<br>7. So Sixthed<br>8. Melon In A New Flannel<br>9. Melonsway<br>10. Hell Of A 6<br>11. Blame Melon<br>12.  Lost In The Blue Flannel <br>13. Who Will Survive In Light 6
what if the album ended with runaway what would you rate it?
That&#39;s a funny way to write a 9
stfu your rickety bitch
I‚Äôll just assume that this album is a big deal in the U.S, because literally NO ONE cares about it over here.
Anthony, we did not need a 22 minute Ridge wallet ad. Baited 0/10
Savage
How dare you..
Thanks Anthony, but I disagree. Please delete.
XDDDDD
6 is actually a good score though.
Fantano: I said what I said.
how do u like 100 gecs but when u hear overly distorted or autotuned vocals , you go apeshit on the song like this and even home with you for example
Reviews like this are they reason  why you don&#39;t write for Pitchfork.
This man just shit on the Runaway outro. You do not deserve opinions.
Word
10 years and you still can&#39;t get this one right. Idk fantano. Idk.
gotta respect the fact that melon waited 10 years just to give it another 6
It&#39;s a 10.<br>Fuck off. ):
Why do the pretty ones make it so hard to love them sometimes...
Wow this has a lot of dislikes
Kanye fans on suicide watch again.
why did you give mbdtf a 6 when you gave mbdtf a 6
Melon, bubby you failed. You didn‚Äôt even get to the Knack feature.
I agree with most of Melon&#39;s points on this record, especially the criticisms. But I would still rate it higher than him. It&#39;s far from perfect, but even the not-so-great, cringey parts of the album add to its charm and the depiction of Kanye&#39;s wild personality.
fk u
√âs um burro vestido. Melhor album do s√©culo XXI. E tu das um 6 pelo clout, PELO CLOUT. Fazes bom conte√∫do, mas as vezes √©s corno. Abra√ßo!
how can people hate runaway
if it got a 6 in the past it aint getting any better
i love melon
I knew this was coming. He was listening to devil in a new dress on his lost in yesterday - tame impala review on fantano
Melon is the real 6 god
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=573">9:33</a> that was a 6/10 redub &#39;powers&#39; melon
Oh Melon you did it again...
10 years later and he still doesn&#39;t get it.
This review is waaaaay better than the original one. You really fleshed out your thoughts and your opinions make sense. Thank you melon
He isnt seeing the music for what it is. He&#39;s breaking it apart like a formula, but its the cohesion of sound that gives us something special.
farty ass bass lines
Do 808‚Äôs next
Melon liking his own videos
He&#39;ll do another redux review and give it a 6 again. That way MBDTF can be renamed &quot;6:66&quot; like Jay-Z&#39;s &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=284">4:44</a>&quot;.
I can&#39;t believe Anthony changed to a 5 point rating system.
NO ONE MELON SHOULD HAVE ALL THAT POWER
the sleepy hollow line means he‚Äôs getting so much head in the same way the horseman collected heads, it‚Äôs a great line and this is the only album I really disagree with you about because it‚Äôs a flawless classic worthy of all the hype but you‚Äôre still the best to ever do it tho stay golden melon boy
F u melon
You&#39;ve been right on this album for 10 years now. Album is incredibly overrated.
Though i hated his original  review  i have come find that i agree with almost everything  he is saying in this  review the nicki verse was to much some of the verses where lack luster  on so apalled and hell of a life being just stupid  and kanyes verses on all of the lights<br>Being lazy , i thought this album was a masterpiece but now i have a whole new perspective. Thank you melon üëç
This album is a 4/10 at best
My man did it again
Cmon Annie. Yeezy reupholstered my pussy is one of the funniest line in music history
Anthony you didn&#39;t! You do a redux of your most controversial review and give it the same score? You beautiful bastard ü§£
yeezy yurt
He played us like a damn fiddle!
Wow melon, you just completely broke the flannel lore...
Mans said BUDLIGHT, im gone üòÇüòÇ
Thank you for saying that the vocal outro of Runaway is horrid, I had this feeling for a long time, but didn&#39;t know how to qualify it! Thank you.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=284">4:44</a>
Nicki Minaj has the best verse on Monster wtf lol
engagement analytics must be hurting cause melon had to drop a disingenuous MBDTF review for the clicks again
I never really liked ithis album, it was all too poppy for myl iking I don&#39;t like rihanna either and I don&#39;t like hearing king crimson but getting hip hop. Oh and nicki minaj ruins any album she appears on
tf.. why would you wanna do this to yourself Melon?
HE DID IT TWICE<br><br>HES A MADMAN
Cal needed to make an appearance in this review
All of the Lights lyrics are a metaphor for the music / hip hop game after the Taylor Swift incident
Review Capital STEEZ - Amerikkkan Korruption Reloaded please
Imagine being salty over an opinion of some fruit-shaped man a whole decade later.
bruh
Life of pablo&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mbdtf
You repeat the score we repeat the dislike Melon
This album is all hype 6/10 seems about right
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=319">5:19</a> it seems like Anthony has been playing too much smash bro‚Äôs
Ichabod Crane literally runs around getting head(s) off the whole town of Sleepy Hollow, come on Fanthony. It‚Äôs not ‚ÄúKeep it 300 like the Trojans‚Äù it makes sense
I openly hated the mix on the snares in &#39;all of the lights&#39; but no one believed me at the time.
I knew it was heading towards a ‚ÄúStrong 5‚Äù when he started talking about ‚ÄòSo Appalled‚Äô lol ‚Äî borderline troll face
You did it! You finally did it you beautiful melon!
What did I wake up to?
YESSSSSSS
Says how much he didnt like Lost in the world when he first reviewed this&gt;Still put it in favorites
Opinions couldn&#39;t get much higher
Kim Kardashian Klan... wtf melon
Diddnt you do a vid like a month ago saying your stance still handnt changed?<br>Why do this<br>I&#39;ll take it tho
I mean he gave the album of the DECADE a 6. Can we really trust him?
I‚Äôll forever hate the blue flannel.
I don&#39;t know how you can diss that nicki verse, it&#39;s still the best i ever heard in her career
This is the definition of PRIDE. No one with ears actually thinks this album is anything less than 8 and Top 10 most ground breaking albums... and I don‚Äôt even like Ye anymore lol
‚ÄúI‚Äôm in that Tonka, color of willy wonka‚Äù<br>Anthony- No üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Melon has introduced me to so much good music since /mu/ 2010, and I don&#39;t care he&#39;s wrong about the same score.
When i was in 7th grade All of the Lights was my favorite song of this album, but damn I never would&#39;ve thought people view it as the worse
As much as I think this album is a ten I still love that you came back and gave a good in depth review on it. The original felt quick and I feel like that‚Äôs why everyone wanted it again. All in all it‚Äôs nice to see your growth over time
Bro. He is cringe on purpose. He‚Äôs fucking with us and I love it
You do realize this album is a classic, right? You realize this album got 5 üé§ üé§üé§üé§üé§ in The Source, right? You realize this album got perfect scores across the entire board, right? Just because you don‚Äôt like that the sky is blue, it doesn‚Äôt change the FACT that the sky is blue. This album is a classic, with or without your opinion. Sorry dude.
Call me MBDTF because I start strong and finish weak too
&quot;For the woman on the other line sounding like an obedient sex robot.&quot; If you played this review for people 20 years ago who&#39;d never heard this album, they&#39;d have no fucking clue.
BASED MELON HOLY SHIT HOLY BASED AHHHHHHH!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!
&quot;Let&#39;s have a toast for the melons<br>Let&#39;s have a toast for Fantano&quot;
at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=469">7:49</a> ish you point out how current day kanye doesn&#39;t really make any commentary on inequity but kanye&#39;s verse on cudi montage is about a very similar topic.
I give this album 1 Lil Pump
Hey Melon, do a REDUX of MBDTF.
Lol he still rates lil boat 2 higher than this
Save your time, he rates this album a light chip without dip again
People love this album way more for the vibe they get from it than what it actually contains. I dont think theres much substance to any claims that it&#39;s a masterpiece, it just turns nerds into confident cool dudes(in their heads at least)
Lmfaoooo
HOly FUCK HE DID IT
It‚Äôs ok Anthony, 3rd time‚Äôs a charm
i dont understand, as a metalhead the lack of talent that appears in this music is astounding. Either im missing something or your all lying to yourselfs
Anttonee!!! How many times do i have to ask for an ABBA review? My mom wont let me out of my room.
To the reviewer what are you top ten hip-hop albums?
I think its a 10/10 and it&#39;s okay if you think it&#39;s a 6/10
Madman did it again
overrated, and so is your hell hath no fury. How can ppl even take themselves seriously consuming the panoply of ‚Äò00‚Äôs, ‚Äò10‚Äôs garbage
I have a question for God.<br>WHY??
What a fuckin terrible album. Complete horseshit. Imagine Dragons fuckin wipes its fat dick all over this piece of wretched crappy stinkhole bitch of itself
Kanye fans commiting mass suicide.
LOLLLLLLL YOU MAD MAN I LOVE YOU
Imagine listening to MBDTF for 10 years and still not understanding it. Thats some melon shit.
Anyone else clap after this or was it just me
Re-Review Yeezus dare I ask üò≥
&quot;Your wild sex fantasy is basically just every college-age straight dude&#39;s porn search history.&quot; <br><br>OOF, can we get an F in the chat for Kanye bois
MBDTF 6/6 confirmed!
Wow, you made me rethink whether that Nicki Minaj verse was really good or not...It could be the nostalgia that makes me love it or the vocal acrobatics she did say though Kanye fought her to use that screech at the end of her verse
im 52 seconds in and yeah fuck you an tony
That&#39;s it you&#39;ve had your second chance to right your wrongs
I give this review a 6. Meaning it is only 6/10 of what it should be.
What the hell man
Sleepy Hollow lyrics was probably in reference to the Tim Burton film where the Horseman hoarded heads he took.
Duhh Trump a scammer cause retards who went to a University that paid Trump for using his name couldn‚Äôt get a job afterward!
This is my least favourite Kanye album. It&#39;s not bad, but its definitely his worst project.
Cringing with Fantano
Your points are perfectly valid, and I understand your score. I don&#39;t agree, but I respect your opinion and I&#39;m not going to harash you for 10 years over this.
Fantano: It‚Äôs pretty vanilla, just a college bros porn history <br>Yeezus: hold my beer
Holy fuck I lol&#39;d at the rating, fantastic
6x2=12 Thank you Melon!!!
Scrolled down like &quot;well if he&#39;s re-reviewing it he must be giving it a higher score&quot; saw the score, laughed real hard.
Fantano you did not just diss the distorted vocals at the end of runaway. That part is like one of my favorite moments in like music history.
I like this album, but I don&#39;t get the wave of dislikes, y&#39;all knew what was gonna happen
thank you anthony for supporting your opinion, even after ten years<br>üêê
why they put the pussy in the sarcophagus?
Me 2010: Fuck Kanye<br>Me 2020: FUCK KANYE
I need you to review All of the Lights every day til you get it right Melon
I think Anthony makes a lot of valid points here.  What gets me is that a lot of the lyrical inconsistencies, nonsensical skits, and the vague overarching concept exist in spades on albums like The Life of Pablo and ye.
so it‚Äôs still classics week?
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOO
The Blue Flannel confuses me.
If this is a 6, why is it ranked second on his Kanye Worst to Best?
House of Balloons?
Sir Melon, Please Excuse Me For Being Antisocial review when?
Trollthany Fantano
sike/10
I agree with Melon. <br>Have never seen the album as groundbreaking musically. I by far enjoy The College Dropout and Yeezy over MBDTF.
üëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèª
Lol way way way too much pride here. It‚Äôs not a 6 lollll
can&#39;t wait to see this as a custom guitar hero track
Lmao I love you anthony
I agree Hell of a Life isn‚Äôt great but damn you were really harsh with the rest of the record. Light 6? Damn melon.
Its a 6 7 at most but yeah its overrated
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=1097">18:17</a> Damn Tony, you didn‚Äôt need to call out your audience like that.
I really appreciate the consistency and thoughts you have on this album. Takes a lot of guts to review an album that you&#39;ve been persecuted for and to give it a similar score. Hats off to you Anthony. Unsubscribed
While I respect your opinion Mr Melon.<br>Duck off...
Fuck you antenna
so he made us wait ten years just to give it yet another 6ü§†
kool kardasian klan
I fucking lol&#39;d
I still disagree with some of it, but he did go into detail this time about why he gave it a 6. Much much better review
My main problem with MBDTF is that the vocal production is, at points (Gorgeous, Monster etc.), horribly distorted and over-compressed. I just feel like the ambition of the instrumental elements is completely ruined by a lack of clarity and cohesion in the mix, to the point were I&#39;ve started thinking the apple music version of the album is a bootleg or something. Just me?
YOURE FUCKING WRONG<br><br><br>YOU CANT GIVE YE AN 8 THAT SHIT WAS ASS
You should re review Tyler The Creator Cherry Bomb album because I thought I did not like it but I relistened to it and I‚Äôve gotten to like it but another note IGOR IS BETTER, IGOR IS BETTER, IGOR IS BETTER, IGOR IS BETTER
always find something wrong
Love how you‚Äôve stuck to your guns and not succumbed to the mass critical appraise this album has garnered!
Thank god, I thought he was gonna be brainwashed by all the Kanye stans. This album is crazy overrated, especially Runaway
Jpegmafia will yell over a fart and he will give it a 9
I actually love that you reduxed this and the score went down.<br><br><br>I don&#39;t really disagree with any single point that you&#39;ve given, I think they&#39;r e all valid criticisms of this album.<br><br><br>My love for it comes more from a place of relatability. Sometimes on the album it feels like he&#39;s just taking his emotions, unfiltered and dorky, and putting them straight into the music.<br><br><br>Blame game shows the two sides of how you might think about a situation. At first you&#39;re reasonable like John Legend&#39;s vocals and then at the end you picture that horrible scenario of hearing your ex and their new partner together. Even though she does act like a robot, it says a lot about how Kanye wants to view himself and how ridiculous the whole situation is just to make himself feel like he&#39;s still got one up on the new partner. To an extent that his ex is way better as a partner as a result of him.
10 years later and your opinion is still bad
as expected, have a good day.
Not sure if I should respect for you having a different opinion and sticking with it... Or just feel disgust <br>(edit: nevermind, I got to the Hell of a Life part)
this dude is just a hater
My melon saw that the MBDTF memes were slowing down so he went and kickstarted the shit out of em again
It‚Äôs 9k damn what have you done?
Years later, this review is a lot more articulate, but it&#39;s still a bad take. Since the first video to this one, I think the score is still a clout chase, rather than an honest review.
Do yeezus
2 Sixes? That&#39;s a 12 baby
Damn it melon where&#39;s the Wall at don&#39;t tell me classics week is over and you didn&#39;t review it.
He really out here lowering the score. What a power move.
üëÄ he did it again
Don‚Äôt think you quite understand the concept melon<br><br>It is in Kanye‚Äôs words, ‚Äúan apology album.‚Äù The record has two meanings; more concretely, an album about his mess up love life and how he‚Äôs an ‚Äúasshole‚Äù, and two the main point of the album is his story of rising to the top of rap and music all together and falling due to his hubris. Dark fantasy sets the stage, ‚Äúcan we get much higher,‚Äù Kanye at this point is the highest he can be. He has 3 unanimously loved albums and is raps biggest guy. He can‚Äôt get higher than that. Gorgeous and Power extend on this idea. Next, All of the Lights is a song basically summarizing the whole idea of album. He‚Äôs famous rich and successful, all of the lights. Then he, ‚Äúslaps his girl,‚Äù (basically being an asshole and slapping his girl or the rap game in the face i.e. The Taylor swift incident the bush thing and all the interviews). He goes the jail (his public exile in Paris, Japan, and Hawaii). Then he comes back and sees his girl (rap) in bed with another man (a new rapper is on top). Then the, ‚Äú going all the way this time‚Äù is like the outro to new slaves, he‚Äôs throwing all caution to the wind and giving his absolute all, and taking all risks to make the perfect album. Now, back into the narrative, we get monster. This song basically is Kanye showing us how much of a monster he is. This is the only song where we find him bragging (besides dark fantasy but that is about how he‚Äôs on top, not how hers a dick). He‚Äôs a monster because of how arrogant he became because of all the lights (fame). The bragging symbolizes his arrogance. Next is Devil in a new dress. Again a girl is used to symbolize the rap game. This is his struggle with keeping his fame and fans. They start to realize he‚Äôs a dick. They fall out. Kanye is hated all of a sudden and he leaves (the silence in the middle of the song. He is scared because he‚Äôs never been in this situation before, so to hide his insecurities, he acts cocky again (Rick Ross&#39; verse). So now that he‚Äôs runaway. He suggests his fans to do the same. Runaway is now his sorry song. He realizes he can‚Äôt change his ways and Hates himself for it. He tells the girl (his fans/rap) to runaway from him. Hate him like he hates himself. Now in hiding, he is going through withdrawal, he‚Äôs having sex with, porn stars, drinking, living in excess because he needs something to keep him from thinking about his pain. All this shallow stuff he expirences during this time is his way of coping with his pain. Then blame game is basically showing us his fight with this girl when he had her (was the biggest rapper). She leaves him (he falls out of fame because of his assholeish nature and the public desires they have enough). But then the skit at the end is saying this girl is better becuse she was with him (rap is better because Kanye raised the bar). ‚ÄúText taught me‚Äù. He‚Äôs now all alone withering in his pain and sorrow and he‚Äôs lost (lost in the world. The, ‚Äúdown for the night, down for good time‚Äù part is him saying no he‚Äôs down to comeback and make this final step to his comeback. He‚Äôs willing to pull it together and make his comeback to rap.<br><br>He rose to the tap, fell because of his arrogance and hubris. But this album is his way back. It‚Äôs a sorry album, but also his ressurection. His perfect piece of art hence the cover being a literal peice of fine art.<br><br>This is a brilliant concept album that on the surface is hidden as an album about his troubles with a girl.<br>It is his masterpiece.
How about House of Balloons redux review on 3 million subs?
The madman
You can&#39;t say that about &quot;Runaway&quot;, Fantano! When I see you, it&#39;s on sight!
Anthony you have to review the new KAYTRANDA album BUBBA!!
it‚Äôs weird that for both this album &amp; even a lot of the songs it‚Äôs typically ‚Äúthe whole is better than some of its parts‚Äù
That was nickis best verse smh
im so happy yes this is way more accurate
808s was fire!!!
&quot;the Rick Ross verse, while not outstanding&quot;<br><br>BITCH U DIDN&#39;T
Booooooooo
Why are you reviewing old albums Melon. You haven&#39;t even reviewed any Moneybagg Yo. I smell racism.
XD
You know what they say 6 is the new 10.
Not kidding I‚Äôm watching this at school isn‚Äôt he library and this kid comes up to me taps and taps me on the shoulder and asks if I am watching logic
Learn to appreciate Nicki&#39;s verse you animal.
push your glasses up
I actually dreamt of this last week. Wtf.
how many times do we need to teach you this lesson old man
Bruh 10 years and you still don&#39;t get the concept of the fucking album
The absolute melons on this man for giving it the same review twice, to celebrate 2 million subscribers nonetheless, despite knowing the backlash he‚Äôll receive... now this is integrity
Nah it&#39;s a 10/10, but nice video still :)
A redux review? DAMN.
Do The Game Born 2 Rap Album. Its the best Hip-hop album of 2019
You know with the last one I felt like there wasnt a lot of justification for the 6/10 but I get it now
damn, you really deconstructed my favourite song as a child. now I don&#39;t know how to feel
Bro you gotta redux review TESTING.
Y&#39;all know it&#39;s just his opinion, right?
You fucking monster
Hahahahaha ha!! It‚Äôs a 6 you fucking sad morons lmaoooooo!
i understand most of ur criticisms here but just the one i don‚Äôt agree w is i love the distorted autotune solo that shit somehow always captivates me
THIS MAD LAD DID IT AGAIN
Ye: Can we get much higher?<br>Melon: NO, NO, NOO
Lil Pump&#39;s album has a higher score smh, Melon.
DONT DO IT ANTH&#39;NY DONT DO IT!
You are not alone in this one, Anthony
Why do people take this guy so serious? This guy is obviously delusional
This album is ridiculously amazing. This made me unsubscribe. You sir don‚Äôt have ears
TURN THAT 6 UPSIDE DOWN ITS A 9 NOW
I bet a lot of people put a dislike just because of the score he gave to the album, but didn&#39;t actually watch the video.
LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
the audacity to give this a 6 while giving Charli a 10, you&#39;re so pathetic
blue flannel, what does it mean
Kanye Kardashian Klan. Ok melon
All of the lights is about fame and his fans, how when he mistreats his fame he will get replaced, not about literally abuse.
Aight coo, now do swimming
Still can believe Melon thinks MBDTF is worst than fucking 7 from Lil Nas X. That EP with two same songs is better by this Mans opinion than this Classic album by YE
Hey melon!! I think you mixed up the score again. how about we try again in 2030?
WRONG<br>AGAIN<br>C&#39;MON
Id give it a 7.5 don&#39;t @ me.
Can we get a fan to make a new MBDTF that is all about these two reviews?
gotta wait another decade for the third review
Dude i dont know how to say thid but youre just wrong
lmao i mean he gave yeezus a 5 and it‚Äôs a much better album than mbdtf
Pussy
Called it!
&quot;He sounds like he&#39;s in a place where he doesn&#39;t have to do too much to prove himself&quot;.
Thank you for this re-review! Being a HUGE Kanye fan I love this. Between MBDTF and late registration I‚Äôm always conflicted between the 2 as his best projects
it has always been Kanye&#39;s worst album. And that&#39;s saying something because he&#39;s the same dude that released Yeezus.<br><br>Edit: forgot about JiK. MBDTF is Kanye&#39;s second worst album now.
Respect melon. Good review.
Review Selena Gomez, we all think she&#39;s hot.
This review ended like an M. Knight Shymalan movie.
.
One of the best rap albums of last decade, strong 5 to a light 6. Okay.
Somebody call DEHH he&#39;s at it again
do yeezus now
Finally, so is the Blue shirt ‚ÄúMy Opinion is cool and somewhere in the middle and/or unchanged‚Äù <br>Would be a great middle ground between the hatred of Red and the golden Award of yellow, a cool disinterested and not pleased enough middle of the road blue
I knew it
Hey needledrop can you do a review of Mormon leader Joseph Smith marrying 14 year old Helen Mar Kimble?
Anthony fantano: light 6 (again)                    Everyone else  : just listen to it again,  your not seeing it üòÇ
:o
i knew was going to re-review this, Anthony just wouldn&#39;t rate a legend album a 6
Review it again
I still hate that you claimed Building 7 had been 100% debunked..... god damnit Melon
Devil in a new dress still song of the decade
The man aint a crowd pleaser , stands by his opinion (his very well explained and detailed opinion) and I RESPECT THAT
Ok, now let&#39;s get The King Of Limbs REDUX Review!
Ah yes, the album melon won‚Äôt give a higher score to keep his dignity
Melon still doesn&#39;t get Runaway.... maybe one day.
&quot;Opinions cant be wrong&quot;<br>Fantano:
Ok, now review it again in 10 years
Melon: ayyyy 6<br>Everyone: YOU&#39;RE A MOTHERFUCKEN MONSTER!!!!!!!
You Won&#39;t Get What You Want
This is absolutely the right opinion tha album wasn‚Äôt a masterpiece
Melon.
3-4 tracks were good... best verses were from jay and push.
What a troll
Why did you give me hope for just 54 seconds you fucking melon
What a troll I love him
Ok maybe in 2030
Best album of the decade!
What‚Äôs the purpose of re reviewing it if literally nothing changed? You just wasted both of our time.
I was really hyped at the beginning of the review when melon was saying all these good things about the tracks and then it started going downhill and then <b>BAM!</b> The ‚Äústrong 5 to a light to 6‚Äù hits me like a truck.
And I still agree with you mostly, melon
Blame game skit&gt;
Mommmmmmm, he did it agaaaaiiinn
What a fuckin SJW. How tf does All of the lights glorify domestic violence?
You know what? I ain‚Äôt even mad.
FUCKKKKKKINNNNN REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Are you actually kidding me??
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=618">10:18</a> huh? I don‚Äôt remember Kanye singing on all of the lights?
Congratulations on 2million subs
You Fuck!
Who cares about the album? Where&#39;s Cal?
The whole part when you said<br>&quot;Fuck you kanye, I don&#39;t like your music cause you are black&quot;<br>Was too unnecessary, but good vid.
I respect your opinions and disagree
Why does he hate Kanye singing so much? I like it
When your channel need more views
You could have just lied and gave it a 10
As a regular viewer I request that you don&#39;t review Kanye West anymore, thanks
You never review Roc Marciano albums, what&#39;s the beef there cause this guy has influenced many styles in HipHop, not a single review
Thumbed up just for re-reviewing it. You&#39;re still wrong tho
Ok boomer
You‚Äôre out of your mind if you think this album is 6/10... smh
Mans didn&#39;t even say &quot;CLASSIC/10&quot;, he just said &quot;6/10&quot; AGAIN.<br>Well, I suppose this is a redux review not a classic review.
Overrated!??
I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one that feels that the Nicki Minaj verse is the most overrated verse of the last decade. I mean, it was alright but it was nothing special and kinda corny
This album&#39;s so overrated and melon reviews it higher than I would&#39;ve.
Man&#39;s not wrong
I still think Yeezus and TLOP are better than this album
yeah go fuck your self buddy
Take the L already kid
A.F: &quot;Hmmm...How can I make some quick cash and another 500k-1M views?? hmmm...oh thats it, I&#39;ll make a video based on Kanye West--works every time
It&#39;s cute how melon thinks Kanye wrote most of the lyrics on MBDTF.
Wow..the raekown feature wasn‚Äôt good, gorgeous instrumental wasn‚Äôt good enough, all of the lights is a horrid mess, chyi had a whack verse, your really tripping üòÇüòÇ
Re-re-Review it in 10 years melon.
Take: TLOP &gt; MBDTF
this melon is the roger ebert of youtube music criticism
Fuck u
My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantano
you‚Äôre a prick LOOOOOOOOOOOOL
You gave mbdtf a 6 but mbdtf a 6
this is a bruh moment. fuck you melon youre cringe
This review is a ton better. It doesnt seem like he is praising the album for so much time then giving two criticisms then throwing a 6. Light 6 album, 10/10 review.
Saying you would have given it a 10 if it was a 10 is so screwed up man. Pity points. Pity points.
Mellon actually rereviewed it. What a madlad
You would have gave this a 6 if it was 2030.
Knew this was a troll
We out here taking another L
tfw it wasnt even a meme
Now THIS is a review, Mr. Fantano. I forgive you now.
kanye brainlets are definitiely the most easily triggered fan base
Clickbaithony Fantano
Honestly I respect this a lot more than the original review, it acc properly breaks down each song and shows he properly took the time to understand it. <br>And even though I‚Äôd disagree with his ratings of Lost in the world and Runaway he makes personal valid points.
Oh shit, now review it again till it gets a 10
All of the lights is the greatest song in the album.
Melon got a flannel redux
melon i trusted you and always said  this album was meh. Now pitchfork and rolling stone started scaring me but thank you for sticking to your score so that i can adopt it without fear of having to really listen to the album and forming an opineon or whatever its called
You crazy for this one Melon!
Street lights, bud lightü§£ü§£
Omggg I can&#39;t believe you though J Zs verse on Monster was alright lyricism, its awful
HE WASNT JOKING????
Definitely agree with you on this one Mellon. <br><br>Unsubscribed.
Keep in mind that this is the same guy that gave MBDTF a light 6
HOW MANY TIMES DO WE HAVE TO TEACH YOU THIS LESSON OLD MELON!!!
Please review &#39;I Disagree&#39; by Poppy
...........I still can‚Äôt believe you gave DAMN. a seven
The dislike ratio is proof of how dumb and narrow minded people are about others&#39; opinions lol...<br>Go outside and take a breath of fresh air guys, really
So, in conclusion, we <b>Can&#39;t</b> get much higher?
when he started ripping into runaway i was ready to yeet myself off of a cliff
&quot;OVeRraTeD, LigHT siX&quot;<br><br>Yet you still rank this as 2nd in his discography...<br><br>True definition of a hater that doesnt care about our opinion, which is good but also coincidentally annoying af lol
Good luck explaining this to God
At the mall there was a seance...
Really was hoping he‚Äôd listen to the Dissect podcast season before a re-review..<br><br>That Sleepy Hollow line ties the whole first verse of Dark Fantasy together starting with ‚ÄúI fantasized bout this back in Chicago‚Äù and ending with ‚ÄúSo much head I woke up to sleepy hollow‚Äù which is supposedly a neighborhood he grew up near in Chicago meaning that the whole first verse he is getting head in Chicago and thinking about the glamorization of fame thats awaiting him. <br><br>This clever lyricism even manages to go a step deeper when the bridge ends with ‚Äúand woke up back in Paris‚Äù after what seems almost like a fever dream type moment (at the mall their was a seance/sky filled with herons/saw the devil in a Chrysler LeBaron) and places the entirety of the song in a place where Kanye is dreaming in the present, reflecting back on an ignorant younger version of himself dreaming of the future, a dream that turns into a nightmare before waking him up back in Paris. A dark fantasy. <br><br>Genius level lyricism imo and unfortunately lost on many people, myself included until listening to the Dissect podcast
Shoulda slammed it and then give it a classic/10
this is a antichrist like review
When i opened the vid, i disliked it just for the memes, but when i finished the video i had to give a like. Say what you want, this was a good review.
He waited 10 years so it‚Äôs a ten
Shawn Cee is a better reviewer <br>You just don‚Äôt know anything about music
I can&#39;t believe this album will be ten this year...
Oh, I know see who ‚Äúmonster‚Äù is about
Unpopular opinion: I agree
He&#39;s right you guys
It‚Äôs happening
Stg I saw this appear in my subscription box and I thought I was trippin
Now review yeezus again. It should be a 10
Love how you stuck to your opinion after 10 years of pressure!! Still agree with it tho, album is overrated
hey, I&#39;ve seen this before
It&#39;s highly overrated, it&#39;s not a bad album but it&#39;s so weak conceptually that it doesnt matter
Looks like Anthony&#39;s struggling to pay rent this month.
Roddy Ricch please Melon
Yea yea cool review anthony but I really wanna know when you&#39;re gonna re review mbdtf.
Confirmed: Blue 6/10 flannel
HAHAHAHAHAHA
I‚Äôd consider this album a masterpiece but I totally agree with his critique on the skit in Blame Game as well as the random placement of Comment #1 at the end of the album.
Isn&quot;t this the guy who gave MBDTF a 6?
That Runaway disrespect
LOL
Uhhh when did I get thrown into another dimension?
That&#39;s what too much soy does to a person
dark fantasy and devil in a new dress are still my two favorite kanye songs
10/10 REVIEW IT AGAIN
It‚Äôs crazy how nitpicky you get in this album and just excuse so much that‚Äôs the same but way worse on Pablo.
REREVIEW MBDTF FANTANO
Good job Anthony. Good job.
HE FUCKIN BAMBOOZLED US AGAIN!
&quot;In celebration of hitting 2 million subscribers, I&#39;m going to lose them all.&quot;
i‚Äôm disliking this but i still like you
If this review was a question on my version of &quot;Let&#39;s Agree&quot; , I would......AGREE
&quot;Oops, I did it again&quot; - Anthony Fantano after giving MBDTF a 6 for the second time, 2020.
Blame Game is only good because of Aphex Twin - Avril 14th.
12/20
10/10 Review it again!
Cop lights, flash lights, street lights, bud light
Hell of a life is great, but yeah never been sold on so appalled and runaway
nice video Anthony üëç unsubscribed and reported for violent or repulsive content
I&#39;m just here for the comments üòÇ
omg anthony i love your flannel +_+
Honestly, this isn&#39;t even funny anymore.<br><br>Doing this shit twice really makes me wonder the credibility of every review you have ever done and weather or not you are even a mediocre reviewer.<br><br>Inb4 i get attacked by some crazy fan that takes Melon&#39;s reviews for the word of god
The meme is real
i vomitted to this review<br>not because it was bad, i just had to vomit
People who drop dislikes because they disagree with your opinion really be donkey-brained
At least you‚Äôre consistent, wrong 10 years ago and still wrong now. Impressive
Ego
Runway is great. Some lyrics are questionable but he‚Äôs just havin fun, vibe with it. Sometimes looking too deep into songs can make you lose enjoyment. This and TPAB are albums of the decade imo
Anthony clearly didn&#39;t watch Terrance explanation about Runaway.
Good to know that this album still isn‚Äôt as good as Lil Yachty‚Äôs ‚ÄòLil Boat 2‚Äô
Yeezy did not taught you
Nice troll, Melon. Now release the real review.
We need a Care For Me Redux now
Anthony amazing review, but why‚Äôd you start spewing pro Iranian propaganda and executing American soldiers at 7:89 ?
This guy gave beerbong and bentleys a 7 and mbdtf a 6, it‚Äôs unbelievable how people still listen to this muppet
I would score this album lower and yet you vastly underrated Nicki Minaj&#39;s verse on Monster. Nicki&#39;s performance is second to none, her corny bars are only elevated by her inflections and precision on the beat!
Thanks melon , son‚Äôs crying now
I think this review might be a way of anthony to ask for help
Watch your tongue melon
we wouldnt be so mad about your opinion if you werent responsible for forming ours
This guy really just gave it a 6 ü•¥
Hell of a Life is a banger.
at least give it a damn/10 cmon man
Gorgeous is legendary
review grimes 4aem!
If Life of Pablo is his best Kanye West album, then I&#39;m OK with that
God damn Melons got 8000 dislikes and counting
I wish i could unview this video
&quot;Nope, you are nitpicking and biased, it&#39;s a 10/10, i win, bye, bye&quot;
Op
Review it again
The score has dropped by 0.5 point from &quot;light to descent 6&quot; into &quot;strong 5 to light 6&quot; over this decade. That means, he is going to give this album &quot;strong 0 to light 1&quot; after 110 years, and vice versa, he did possibly gave 10 to this album 80 years ago.
HOW MANY TIMES DO WE HAVE TO TEACH YOU THIS LESSON, OLD MAN? üòÇ
&quot;Can we get much higheeeer?&quot;<br>Melon: &quot;No&quot;
Unfollowed :( Disappointed in you Melon
Two things. <br>1. You reminded me how great this album is.<br>2. Did you just say, did we give this a album a listen?
Me melon head<br>Me need money<br>Oh me know<br>Me rereview mbdtf
You guys really expected something different this time üôÑ
FFS MELON
Yo man i&#39;m not even gon cap this was kind of a baller move to review this album again and give it the SAME SCORE LMAOOO
I think it&#39;s fucking incredible that he reviews it again because people were so offended by his score and he just gave it the same score lmao
piss off -_
If Rick Ross‚Äôs verse on Devil in a New Dress isn‚Äôt mind blowing, then I guess I just don‚Äôt know what is.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=758">12:38</a> I love the bar where he says Sasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong, Loch Ness<br>Goblin, ghoul, a zombie with no conscience
I can&#39;t believe you&#39;ve done this.
he did it he did it he did it he did it he did it he did it oh my god oh my god oh my god he did it he did it
This is the dude that methodically separates the peas that get into his mashed potatoes
Everyone : this is the best album of the decade<br>Melon : above average
<b>checks like/dislike ratio</b><br>I know how this one ends
‚ÄúSo much head, I woke up to Sleepy Hollow‚Äù<br>Mr.West had received so much head that he proceeded to wake up in shock. Indeed, his once mighty cockhead was whittled to an unsightly numb. thus, Kanye was headless.<br><br>Or more realistically; kanye mashed some brains until he past out. In the morning he learns that the shear force of his loving left this poor girl headless.<br><br>either way, got you melon.
you‚Äôre killing my vibe melon
22 minutes. Redux review???
MADMAN MADMAN MADMAN
REREDUX REVIEW PLEASE
I&#39;m finna drop my own 808s &amp; Heartbreak after thisüíî
I had (and maybe still have) several problems with my mental health. To be honest I had several problems before taking medication related w voice(s) I couldn&#39;t control inside my head so YouTube has been fundamental to silence them. Now I take good care of myself  so I&#39;m in a better place, but I guess I just wanted to let u now that watching ur videos has been a key part of my life. Years that were really important shaping a person u (in some way) have been every day helping me lol. Thanks. I really hope that everything turns out good for u. Sorry for grammatical errors I&#39;m from Argentina xd
amthomy famtamo
Music really is subjective huh...
Review it again fanny. You didn&#39;t hear the synth arpeggios on lost in the world
Kanye was brainwashed before and now he is awake get over it melon Kanye is based now.
Looooool
Maybe if the album had some pots &amp; pans clanging and a blender going he would&#39;ve gave it a 10
Melonhead is the Eminem of music critics
This is still a very well written review
Blue flannel?
Hey, pls review Rare by SG, just came out, would make a fun video, fun record. Plsthx:)
Why am I so amused by a melon headed white man rating my favorite album ever a 6/10 for the second time a decade apart
Love ur videos :)
An obvious troll
You think Kanye cares what he rates this album? Right...and you shouldn&#39;t neither.
This guy doesn&#39;t like All of the Lights
I was 6 when you gave it a 6. 10 years. Nothing changed
Fantano you legend
This album wasn&#39;t the Magnum Opus Kanye needed, this was Hip Hop&#39;s Magnum Opus. I can&#39;t remember for the life of me where hip hop was headed in the 2010&#39;s, but it definitely was a whole lotta dance, high school and feel good music. Then this came in and a resurgence of grand, dark, taboo and hard knocking hip hop made its renaissance. You&#39;re Wrong
couldnt agree more with this review
glad the score is the score.
Anthony Fantano rating Anthony Fantano: I give this a light 6
This is a 10/10. If this was art it would be a Basquiat, if it was literature it would be shakespeare etc. It is a fine form form of art. Happy for Kanye he has always loved Jesus, sad for the fans who will never get to hear more of his genius or perform his old stuff. Amongst the GOAT, I stake my reputation on it.
ANTHONEEZY FANTEEZY TAUGHT ME
I honestly completely agree with your opinion. This album isn&#39;t that interesting. It doesn&#39;t show any emotion, it&#39;s boring, doesn&#39;t have any great sounds, isn&#39;t well melodically structured. Beats aren&#39;t interesting and the interest fades away in an hour.<br>I can see how it is not bad, and alright. At most.
review angel dust
the HEADLESS horseman yes but HE COLLECTS HEADS bruh c&#39;mon. I don&#39;t even like kanye.
You high
nope you&#39;re nitpicking and biased bye bye
Bravo, Sir. Bravo.
I really don&#39;t see why had to add right at the end that Kanye is a stupid n word, that was just too much melon, that isn&#39;t what I came for. At least you gave it a strong 10 after all these years.
you&#39;re wrong
still correct
Fantano only did this because he knew he&#39;d get a shit ton of views if he put out another video rating MBDTF at a 6 again.
so glad I‚Äôm not the only one who thinks Nicki Minaj‚Äôs verse on monster was cheeks
He just needs the views
You&#39;re wrong Melon, try again in 10 years
10 out of 10 review it again
People only get mad at the 6/10 score because its &quot;suburban whiteboys first good hip hop album&quot; 90% of Melons viewers weren&#39;t even born before 808s &amp; Heartbreak FACT
&quot;Runaway&quot; is just the closest thing to an epic that Kanye has ever made, instrumentally.
Realistically speaking, what are the chances of someone that didn&#39;t like the album when it came out, would like it 10 years later. This was the greatest album release of my life time, if you weren&#39;t going crazy back then than it&#39;s fine, it&#39;s just not for you.
If u double down I SWEAR TO GOD
I like this album but it&#39;s never felt super amazing to me tbh i feel like i&#39;m missing something with how much hype it has
done with this guy
tbh I was always more offended by your Yeezus review than your MBDTF review
shit taste. people with agree with fantano no matter what lmao
Yeah... so this critically acclaimed Kanye West album?<br><br>It&#39;s NOT GOOD<br><br><b>EXPLOSION</b>
It feels like you see this album as a discount store TPAB
Broooo I feel like you‚Äôre completely missing the message in ‚ÄúAll Of The Lights‚Äù if you liked ‚ÄúPower‚Äù how could you not get AOTL? It illustrates that time period in more detail perfectly... <br>It‚Äôs about the Taylor swift incident specifically not just some ‚Äúdomestic abuse‚Äù filled song. ‚ÄúI slap my girl she call the feds did that time and spent that bread.‚Äù His girl is the music industry and the slap in the face represents how he felt after the Taylor incident. Like he let his girl (fans and music) down. ‚ÄúI did that time‚Äù is his public and self imposed exile to Hawaii suggested by Mos Def. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt see my daughter‚Äù (childlike mindset towards making music)  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on my way headed upstairs to my surprise a nigga replacing me I had to take him to that ghetto university‚Äù saw someone replacing him represents how the music industry continued to move and seemed to have forgotten about him and focused on other artist. Ghetto university goes with the theme of college dropout meaning he had to fight his way back into the industry dropping arguably one of his best albums to date. It‚Äôs genius melonü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
I think you couldve gotten your point across with 4, maybe 5 n bombs. But 13?for shame, melon
I think most of his viewers have always just been so confused as to how this melon could possibly rank this masterpiece lower than EMPTY FORGETTABLE TRAP GARBAGE! That&#39;s the problem Melon, you seem like a hypocrite
Best reviewer in the game for a reason, was right and sticks to his guns
But thank you! I always thought Jay&#39;s verse on Monster was underwhelming and that Nicki&#39;s voice was annoying
6+6=12
10 outta 10 review it again
Listen Mr. Melon. You can give the album a six, but dissing Nicki&#39;s verse on Monster is a sin
Damn, he really did Nicki‚Äôs feature like that
It‚Äôs ok, being wrong only twice in 10 years is a good track record
Excellent review my dear Melon, but to go that far and say he should‚Äôve included Kim‚Äôs sex tape as a music video, was a bit uncalled for
ten outta ten<br><br><br>review it again
Graduation &gt; 808‚Äôs &gt; MBDTF<br>Just my imo don‚Äôt kill me
I love you melon, it‚Äôs awesome
Kanye is trash
Okay, but when you gonna rereview MBDTF?
melon bad
I liked the video then you started shitting on trump so now it‚Äôs disliked you fucking socialist
Fuck. You. Fantano
All of the lights is still one of my favorite songs. IDGAF what a melon thinks.
It happened!
WHAT????
Yes, this album is overrated af. He‚Äôs got much better albums. An album TRULY worthy of a redux review is MAGDALENE melon. I still ain‚Äôt forgiven you
You do realise Pitchfork ranked this the second best album of the decade?<br>Wtf melon.
Damn I thought this was heading for a 7
Melon still attention seeking in 2020‚ò†Ô∏è
Shut up Melon<br>Shut the fuck up
Kanye gave his Christ to life, melon, cut him some checks. <br><br>That‚Äôs how it works right?
The Mixing On All Of The Lights Is Specifically Bad Solely On Kanye‚Äôs Voice To Emphasize The Emotions And Emotion Kanye Was Trying To Convey On The Song Which You Seemed To Understand.
Oh Fandango you did this strictly for all the smoke. I respect your hustle. Rating is still bullshit by the way. Fuck your opinion.
our boy played us like that
So no head?
What does a blue flannel mean?
I didn‚Äôt think anyone could be this pretentious
This is the Force Awakens of Fantano reviews
COME ON MAN HELL OF A LIFE IS A FUCKING TUNE
Is this real?
congrats on 2 mil
Shouldn‚Äôt this be a Classic Review? Come on this is just being petty
haven‚Äôt you hated on devil in a new dress your whole career?
Noooo
REVIEW OF THE DECADE
He can&#39;t keep getting away with it
Last straw melon. Unsubbed and reported to the reddit admins
Madman
now do it again
To pimp a butterfly is better than this overrated shit. Can&#39;t get a 10 in a million years
I guess you&#39;re just not like the other girls huh
Personally I think this full album is like a 7 or 8 out of 10 due to some tracks being a little dull and feeling out of place. But about half of the tracks are in my opinion really really great, making the album actually one of my favorites. <br><br><br>The ones I really like are: <br>Dark Fantasy <br>Gorgeous <br>POWER <br>All of the Lights - sry melon, I still think it&#39;s a total banger<br>After this I usually skip to Runaway, but sometimes I listen to Monster.<br>Runaway - my favorite track. I like the contrast between Kanye&#39;s and Pusha&#39;s verses, one feeling more sad and apologetic while the other being overly boasting and mistreating in a way. Kind of feels to me like Kanye&#39;s verse is more mature while Pusha&#39;s is about a more naive rapper who has recently gotten rich and started living &quot;the good life&quot;<br>Hell of a Life is a nope for me.<br>Blame Game - I don&#39;t really like the skit at the end either. It gets dull after multiple listens.<br>Lost in the World - It&#39;s a nice closing track I think. It keeps the high energy, while still feeling like a calm finish to the album.<br><br><br><br><br>I wasted like 15 minutes writing this to a sea of 4000+ comments. Nice.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=1098">18:18</a> I use incognito so you won&#39;t know that.
Hell of a Life isn&#39;t meant to sound sexy. It&#39;s meant to sound dirty. Dirty like the theme he talks about, falling in love with a pornstar. The Black Sabbath sample sounds super dirty and the arpegiattor synth sounds super glittery, which is perfect contrast for what you could find in Las Vegas, a sinful life surrounded by lights.
I still consider Late Registration and Graduation better albums than this.
melon out here really being a masochist knowing this shit about to get 10k dislikes
Not enough dislikes on this one.
Anthony is too woke to truly enjoy this album.
HE DID WOT
LMAAAOOOOOOO
everyone downvoting this review are the same people who have been asking for a rereview. you cant expect him to change his opinion people.
idk ... whether its Kanye&#39;s best work or not but, man .....quite sure its your worst review.. ü§£ü§£
Holy shit dudes, how insecure must you be to be angry about someone‚Äôs subjective opinion of some art piece you like...
Idiot
At this point it really seems like Melon is just a verbose Magic Conch Shell, giving out random scores.
where&#39;s the Sam Hyde podcast?
Again Melon, really?
2010: 6<br>2020: 6<br><br>Ten more years and melon will end the world by summoning the beast, which he will then also rate a 6/10
&quot;Domestic violence is bad... HOWEVER&quot; - Melon 2020
Now you are just beating a dead horse, fuck off melon
Just let Ye be, he do no harm. Melon what&#39;s ur deal
Honestly how did anyone think it was going to be anything but a 6 again?
We&#39;ve been hoodwinkled, bamboozled, led astray, run amok, and flat-out decieved.
REVIEW I DISAGREE!!!!
My man doubles down, what a legend
So melon got jokes...
Best strong 5 to light 6 album of all time, peace.
SHES SUPPOSED TO SOUND LIKE AN OBEDIENT SEX ROBOT ITS PART OF THE VIBE BOOMER
this album is easily a 5 1/2
I can‚Äôt believe I have to continue to form my own opinion.
Melon, now that it&#39;s 10 year old, I think you should review MBDTF again. I think your score of 6 might have changed since it came out
Smh you really had to say RZA was trying to do his best MC Ride impression on ‚ÄòSo Appalled‚Äô. This Death Grips Fanboying has completely gotten out of hand!
&quot;Cringey&quot; -well thats one way of putting it. Hate to say that I somewhat agree with you more now than before.<br><br>Yikes.
you missed a chance to say classix/10
This is the funniest prank on your audience I can think of
I‚Äôm mad not gonna lie but respect Fantano went to extra lengths to say how much it sucked
His runaway critique hurt
Aw hell nah, we getting you out of here
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=655">10:55</a> Did Melon just confirm he killed Xüò≥
CLASSIC REVIEW FOR MBDTF?? Oh wait... üòµüòµüòµ
I just disliked for the memes Melon. Still love you
I kinda have to respect you sticking to your guns and not letting other people&#39;s opinion affect the way you absorb this album. But you definitely should&#39;ve done a joint review of this album with DEHH. It would&#39;ve been great to see the back and forth.
When I saw the title I thought Kanye had randomly released a redux version of this crappy album, I really have never understood why people love it so much, and it‚Äôs a big reason I‚Äôve appreciated Anthony‚Äôs opinion if it. But then I liked Yeezus way more so what do I know
That screenshot of your Life of Pablo review looks like you have a giant hitler moustache
666. The mark of the melon
I still don‚Äôt get why Kanye was okay with fergie on All of the Lights or RZA on So Appalled. Like why?? <br>Raekwon has the most pointless verse on Gorgeous too.
You should one for 808s
HAHHAHAHA
Y‚Äôall know this is wrong, right?
6 isn&#39;t even bad, guys, honestly I say it&#39;s too good of a rating for this project
Bad melon
I agree with the 6
I thought classics week was over
Unfunny meme
Awful album, this was my first Kanye album that i ever listened and din&#39;t like it at all.
kanye has no more artistic integrity and &quot;things to say&quot; than drake or katy perry, he nust found out the way he speaks hides it effectively<br>4/10 shitty person boring rapper
For the record, I personally never wanted this.
dude gave ksg a 10.. that&#39;s all you need to know really..
Maybe in 2030 you&#39;ll give it a 7
ok dismissing the cyhi verse on so appalled like the tiger woods line wasn‚Äôt on it will not be tolerated
In Kanye&#39;s Worst to Best:<br>Fantano: &quot;Dont forget GORGEOUS&quot;.<br>Now:<br>Fantano: Man, the strings.
Lil pump - Logic = MBDTF<br>melon math.
Thank you Anthony very cool
Melon, I enjoyed the review but the whole ‚ÄúLet Australia burn‚Äù speech at the end was a bit off lad
This was a better review, and honestly reflects the score but I still think its a 7 at least
Its crazy what content creators do for attention nowadays lmao, they prefer to look like ignorants just for views than being coherent
You really Went from a 6 to a Light 2. Are you Serious?!?!?!?
Never Re-review DAMN you monster! Stay away from my child.
Okay, I have to say I respect your opinion loads more than I did before. You articulated your gripes very well and I see where youre coming from, actually, you made me think about the details I‚Äôve never noticed. Despite disagreeing with your rating, this is one of my favorite reviews of yours period.
yeezy taught me
I like the cyhi the prince feature, even though the rhymes are cheap his voice and pronounciation completely switch up the vibe of the song and makes it more interesting.
Bruuh
I love you melon boy but your wild for this shit man.
Yeezus Redux Review when
You can be mbdtf or watch melon conquer
He really did us like that
Damn the ending of runaway is how melon hears kanye&#39;s message through out the album and really don&#39;t understand what kanye trying to say
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=1094">18:14</a> Melon...I feel personally attacked!!
Based on both reviews and how much time he spends on talking about just the opening track fantano must put on his headphones listen for 8 minutes and go &quot;nah it&#39;s a 6&quot;
sooo what was the point of this then?
Man said &quot;fuck yall, 6 TWICE&quot;
How Anthony.. How?
Omg omg omg
Why are people still moaning? He thoroughly explained his thoughts on every track and his score makes perfect sense to him.
how dare you
LOL he still doesn&#39;t understand the meaning of All the lights. It&#39;s not about domestic violence. ITS ABOUT HOW HE MADE TAYLOR SWIFT FAMOUS
Thank you melon for ruining my 2020
I went to listen to Runaway to see if it was really that bad, and for a second I thought I could give him credit by saying that he could be taking on a perspective other than his own and critiquing its logic.<br><br>And then I remembered we are talking about Kanye.
review Iran&#39;s military
He‚Äôs just trolling at this point
I guess you just don‚Äôt get this album do you fantano?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=44">0:44</a> Melon liking his own reviews lmao
HAHAHAHA
wow, thanks Anthony, you ruined my birthday
Absolute madlad.
why did he review it twice to give it the same score lol,
&quot;The women on the other line sounds like an obedient robot&quot;<br>Woman: <b>Yeezy...programmed...me</b>
WHAT. ARE YOU CRAZY ?!?!?!?!? (still liked the video cause you put a lot of work in it and i respect your opinion even if I don&#39;t agree &lt;3 )
Can someone tell me the albums that are behind him?
Everyone expecting this review:<br>- &quot; Can We get much higher&quot;?<br><br>Melon:<br>- 6o Hiiiiighhh
Melon BACK ON HIS <b>BULLSHIT</b>
wack
Wow Anthony, i didn&#39;t need to see a 20 minute video of you talking about your dark twisted fantasies and calling them beautiful üòí
face reveal for 2 mill?
The absolute madman
On the Anthony Fantano: Human Being Review at 1mil subscribers, you listed MBDTF&#39;s 6/10 as your &quot;Least Fav Opinion.&quot; What happened to that energy?
YOU MADMAN
Even now fantano cannnot justify his 6 rating
I saw the like to dislike ratio and quickly lost hope
There&#39;s one thing to say about that:<br>...<br><b>CHICK-FIL-A!</b>
Melon just shut the fuck up man your just being stubborn
Did this man really just skip over All of the Lights (Interlude)? What a joke.
Gotta get to 3mil subs for another review
Ok but when are you gonna seriously review it again?
This review is what happens when you overthink music. I get that he&#39;s trying to flex his review muscles but this album is not a 6.
I can&#39;t believe Anthony hated Nicki&#39;s Monster verse.......
From 1 to  10 I think it&#39;s a 8
I always thought MBDTF was an acronym for my blood on the dance floor.
:(
Yelling white power throughout the review was enough, but did you really have to give it a 2/10?
the only video on youtube i have ever disliked
When she wraps her lips around your lightsaber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=282">04:42</a> <br>üòÇ
I can never figure out why this album has so many different covers
Any more 6 you give Kanye he&#39;s gonna be turning into the Devil while he&#39;s been preaching about Jesus Christ. Nice going Melon!
Wait , that&#39;s not how you supposed to play the game
you know what, melon is making sense on this. I fucking hate to admit it, but I have to.
I don‚Äôt even care about the album rating but you gotta but major respect on gorgeous. Not only is it Kanye‚Äôs best song but it‚Äôs one of the best rap songs of the decade.
Big troll move
Great! Thank you for taking back your old review and giving it a 10!
Watched. Subscribed. Disliked. Reported.
I always struggle to explain why I really don&#39;t care for MBDTF but after listening to this, you explained everything I feel but couldn&#39;t put words to
Bruh This is the biggest plot twist melon ever did I thought that‚Äôs a classic review
I know its blasphamy but i still rate it 10/10
I actually rate the man way more for the fact that he can go against the grain like this and justify what he says
12/20 niceee
Good review, I agree!
Fantano: This is easily one of the most damning commentaries on the black community and the American government‚Äôs treatment of it on any modern hip-hip record.<br><br>Fantano: 6/10
Next decade, Cal should review this
Son of a bitch
Yes Anthony is right it‚Äôs a 6
OH...MY...GOD
IGHT, now do YEEZUS gay boiii!
100% agree
<b>talks about the album like it&#39;s a 7 or 8</b><br><br><br>melon man: nah it&#39;s a 5 tho
I dislike this.
Well that&#39;s a weird way to spell &quot;Kanye West - My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy REDUX REVIEW&quot;
Melon does it for the views/ad revenue.
Stop cyberbullying kanye
I think the vast majority of hip hop fans will disagree on your take Nick Minaj‚Äôs verse
i got baited so fucking hard
Review it again
this is worse than ww3
Didn‚Äôt you already re-review this and give it a 6? Or am I a time traveler?
The drums are so blasted in All of the Lights to make the audience feel caught up in the glamour that Ye is feeling
I‚Äôm sorry Anthony. It‚Äôs only fair that I dislike for the good old days.
No, he wasn‚Äôt describing YOU in Gorgeous, Anthony.
HOW MANY TIMES DO WE HAVE TO TEACH YOU THIS LESSON OLD MAN!!
i want a redux review of swimming you heartless bastard
Oh no.
Bruh you ain&#39;t shit üòÇüòÇ
Every motherfucker who thinks a score really means so much to them, they deserved to see this review and make sure their feelings are hurt.
Feeling a light 6k dislikes
Melon pulled out a whole new colored flannel specifically for this album, therefore it‚Äôs the most prestigious album he‚Äôs reviewed.
Gorgeous has some of the best rapping EVER. How can you be torn by it being ‚Äúfaint‚Äù
He clearly didn‚Äôt understand the runaway distorted outro
like i know it&#39;s good but you don&#39;t have to break your 5 point scale for it
rei harakami review
He cant keep getting away with this
what a way to celebrate 2m subscribers! I am so proud of you.
Shit I‚Äôve never agreed more with a Fantano review in my life, literally this video was relatable (except Lost in the world it‚Äôs great)
6/10 people liked this video
It flabbergasts me that you still don‚Äôt see this as one of the best hip hop albums ever made
HAHAHAAHAHHAH HE GAVE IT A SIX AGAIN FUCKING MADMAN!!!!
Ok but..  How the fuck do you give this a 6/10 and Ye an 8/10?
CAL CHUCHESTA HAS BEEN REPORTED MISSING SINCE 2019!<br><br>Gender: Male<br>Height:6,2<br>Weight:Thicc<br>Race: unknown<br>Mixtape:Fire
I fucking love how the score is unchanged
<b>This fight will never be over</b>
CAN&#39;T FIX STUPID
Why do you hate nicki?
He did it. The madmelon did it. He lowered the fucking score
U just need to let it grow on you melon
He doesn‚Äôt understand that All of the Lights is a metaphor
I feel like I‚Äôm the only person that loves all of the lights
Fantano finally breaks and reviews MBDTF again, only to give it the same score, absolute legend
Runaway is HIGHLY relatable because we ALL have been dicks to the ones we love most.<br>The autotune segment allows us to think back on these actions and reflect on the very real feeling of being a BURDEN to your entourage.<br><br>a masterpiece that perfectly encapsulates the sentiment &quot;im trash, stay the fuck away from me&quot; without trying to end on a fake positive note
Now do a Blonde redux review
fuck you melon
Watch in 2030 melon giving this a 6, making it 666
i&#39;m losing my shit im on the floor laughing
Imagine if you re-reviewed Deltron 3030...?
Kanye has the best teeth in the game. Fuck off melon.
Wtf
greatest album of all time
A 10/10<br>REVIEW IT AGAIN
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=1006">16:46</a> TAKE THAT BACK MELON GUY
Wow, this was such a cogent and pre-meditated review that I have to applaud Melon for the score he gave it. Now re-review Yeezus please
Anthony, I understand Kanye comes from an African-American background, but that doesn‚Äôt justify addressing him as the n-word?
My boy Melo said....it&#39;s still a 6
The madman
My Beautiful Light Six‚Äôed Fantasy
i get you didn&#39;t like it but did you have to say &#39;all of the lights&quot; would be better if it was called &quot;all of the white&quot;&#39;
We‚Äôre actually witnessing history here
Most of this album is pure cringe. Why people say it&#39;s underrated by melon is beyond me... I&#39;d say he even overrates it. this record is 3 at best
We stan our consistent melon
A 6! A6?!? Alright bro we‚Äôll be seeing you
THE NERVE
<b>Listen you little shit</b>
REVIEW THE GOODBYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD ALBUM
Better review than the first one lol<br>But damn, &quot;overrated&quot;. That shit hurts melon. MELON THAT SHIT HURTS
Whole album is cringe.<br>8/10
Throwing that Speech at the end of the album was like when Adam Sandler put those videos of twin siblings playing with each other at the end of Jack &amp; Jill to trick the dumb masses that the film was about anything sentimental or had a meaningful message about family.
Mellon man probably also hates thriller and all other great works of music
Did this man really re-review an album that came out almost ten years ago, just to give it the same score? Even after all the backlash, death threats and the general bad reputation? Anthony, you are <b>THE</b> mad lad.
I appreciate your opinion and arguments, although I disagree with most of them. Wish you a good day, Anthony!
wish i could like this another 6 times
Omg, funniest trolling ever!
‚Äúall of the lights is a horrid mess‚Äù<br>bruh
Do we call melon bitch for short from now on?
This album is so badly produced, it&#39;s insane. 4/10 to me.
Hell of a Life is dummy fire
Y&#39;all happy now?<br>You like this?<br>You like what you got?
What a weird way to spell Dr. Dre The Chronic review.
I know opinions are just that, options. That being said, this fucking sucks.
REVIEW IT AGAIN
The way he was talking I thought he would give a Decent 4 lol
wash your ears melon and review again
It seems like he mostly dislikes it because of the lyrical content, and he mostly praises the instrumentals and melodies. It seems wrong to me though, to have this album rated lower than some of his other albums that Anthony has rated higher - like Ye for example. This was a better review than the first one, but I still disagree on most things. I like other Kanye albums better myself too, but MBDTF is at least a 8/10.
As much as I love Kanye, I don&#39;t think this is his best and it also shouldn&#39;t be the best album of the decade. If anything that should go to Because the Internet by Childish Gambino. The amount of work put into that album and the message it conveys, and its importance to that decade surpasses anything I&#39;ve heard in that time. It&#39;s a complete cinematic experience from watching his short film Clapping for the Wrong Reasons and his screenplay that coincides with the album, and really shows just how talented Donald really is.
This is some serious reaching buddy. It&#39;s getting to the point where you&#39;re actively trying to misquote and take Kanye&#39;s lyrics out of context just to justify your shitty score for an amazing album. <br><br>First of all, Kanye isn&#39;t trying to say domestic abusers shouldn&#39;t have bad things happening to them in AOTL, He&#39;s painting a morally grey situation where yes he absolutely did fuck up. But does he deserve to have his daughter taken away from him? Not to mention the fact that it&#39;s purposefully left vague to which degree of violence did he slap his girl and in what situation. NOT ALL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS EQUAL. Your interpretation of the song is so fucking shallow and basic it&#39;s hilarious, and not because kanye is being basic, it&#39;s because YOU&#39;RE being basic. Also, why Kanye should give 2 fucks about other celebrities&#39; domestic abuse scandals is fucking beyond me. <br><br>As for your criticism of for the line &quot;So much head I woke up sleepy hollow&quot;, dude why would you immediately jump to the conclusion that he&#39;s talking about a blow job here? Once again your understanding is very very shallow, I could easily say that line was about kanye being a hot headed person cost his head to disappear.<br><br> You say the chris rock Skit conflicts with the tone of the song? (I don&#39;t see why that&#39;s a problem, you could see it as comic relief that makes the song three dimensional, but okay) that could only happen if your looking at it in a very surface level (I don&#39;t know if you have noticed but this guy is constantly taking the most dumbed down and shallow interpretation of the album, I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s genuinely extremely stupid or he desperately wants the album to be shallow in order to justify his score) sure, the way Chris Rock talks is funny, but the conversation is anything but. Especially in the context of the song. How is a guy discovering his girlfriend is cheating on him funny? And I&#39;m already gonna stop, This is so ridiculous.<br><br> All your criticisms of the production and the instrumentals are just are retarded. You don&#39;t explain why it&#39;s bad, you only describe the beat and then say you just don&#39;t like it, tell me why you don&#39;t like it? Any one could do that with any piece of music ever! What&#39;s wrong with the vocoder solo in Runaway? Why does it go for too long?
absolute madman
you absolute madman
Wow made another review just to give it another 6.... you still sleeping on it melon
Good luck explaining this to God when you get to Heaven.  üò°
Melonlord&#39;s Dark Twisted Fantasy Review Part 2: Electric Boogaloo
Re-review yeezus
The cello nod to Lil Yachty about bad lyrics was great LOL
i see you liking your own videos melon.
Phenomenal review, melon. Love all of the lyrical explanations. I‚Äôm suing you.
This man really made a near 23 minute video just to give it the same score
Genuinely a great review. Biased because I agree with almost all of it, but I think anyone should be able to appreciate the insight here.
&quot;Anal and gangbangs. That&#39;s pretty vanilla.: - Fantano.<br>What kinda life are you living, Melon?
farty ass bass lines
Lmaoo
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=456">7:36</a> what about Kanye on Cudi Montage? He speaks on the justice system really well in that verse!
You absolute madman, Ily
Where‚Äôs the classic/10?
One thing I can say forsure, Kanye should have absolutely included Bud Light in All of the Lights.
Your lying
Could we get much higher? Kanye asks, needledrop be like NO
At least Kid Cudi went from 0 to hero
the REAL isis
While I massively disagree with this review, I do really appreciate you actually going into detail. The big problem I had the the original review is that I don‚Äôt think it really went into free ail or explained itself, whereas here you were really clear and explained all your decisions. Shows how much you‚Äôve improved as a reviewer over the last 10 years
Someone told me about this so I was lucky enough to be able to brace myself for melons shitty opinion....
Re-re-review MBDTF
Imagine leaving an angry comment and disliking the video because of a variable reviewscore number.
FUCKING MADLAD
A way better review than the original, even tgough I disagree with a whole bunch of what you said, even with some of your positives
OH MY GAH<br><br><br>A NEIGHBOURHOOD VEGAN LIKE ME AIN‚ÄôT SUPPOSED TO BE GETTIN NO KALE SMOOTHIE LIKE THAT<br><br>Chuchesta taught me.
Now do Yeezus
neever met anyone who said jayz had  a better verse than nicki
We all know why you hate this album.... Its Creator is too dark for you literally and figuratively ( if you know what I mean)
Yeezus redux
Loved it not much wrong about the album but I‚Äôll give it a 6... wtf lol
YOU‚ÄôRE A 6/10 ANTHONY!
OH SHIT IT&#39;S HAPPENING BOYS
I find it funny how everyone loves this album except you. But hey, if you feel like you need to protect your ego, then stick to those guns my guy! üëè
Wwwwwwoooooooooooowwwww
How the hell... DO YOU NOT LIKE GORGEOUS?!?!?!?!
All of you should shut the fuck up. It&#39;s his opinion.
Okay let‚Äôs break this down:<br><br>He doesn‚Äôt like all of the lights<br>He doesn‚Äôt like Nicki‚Äôs verse in monster<br>He doesn‚Äôt like lost in the world<br>He doesn‚Äôt like Kanye‚Äôs auto tune in runaway<br>He doesn‚Äôt like the Chris Rock outro to blame game<br>(In the original review at least) he thought so appalled was one of the best songs on the album<br><br>I‚Äôm starting to think maybe I can have my own opinion on this album because I love all of those things (and also agree with his current view on so appalled)
i love you
Set the nuke off on &#39;em!
Melon is actually telling us to flip the 6, IT&#39;S A 9
We still in classics week?
I&#39;m so appalled, Spalding ball, bald Tony Tano giving sixes to y&#39;all.
lmao damn melon really posted a 20 min video just sayin shit aint change
A twisted 6 is actually a 9, so I think Melon is just creatively giving it a 9.
What‚Äôs with the album artwork? When did that change?
People: Rereview MBDTF<br>Melon: Yeah I always find, yeah I always find something wrong
its his opinion guys
Just a reminder that melon gave  ‚ÄúLil Pump‚Äù a 7
I guess he just doesn‚Äôt understand gang.
Perfect troll
Melons needs to listen to the MODELS.<br>You ain&#39;t got no fucking Yeezy in your serato?
Amazing review!
welp, time to commit a hate crime
Yup this album continues to be not very good.
FYI WE ARE DISLIKING THIS VIDEO, NOT LIKING IT.
When I first downloaded this album all of these years ago the tracks were out of order and &quot;Who Will Survive In America&quot; was the second track. For at least a year I thought that was the normal track order. To this day I still feel that the song works much better between Gorgeous and Dark Fantasy...
I agree so much with this album being so overly praised...... People act like this is the greatest fucking thing since bread and butter.
Damn bro you got the whole squad laughing...
Gonna listen to this 25 times at least
repeating your initial review word for word was not funny melon
Dog shit
I can&#39;t believe this is happening
Did I hear that correctly, Runaway is ‚Äúcringy‚Äù and the outro is ‚Äúannoying‚Äù. Did we listen to the same song melon???
Fuck you Anthony
How u gonna dump on all of the lights like that
nicki&#39;s verse is fucking amazing foh
He did not just do this shit to us AGAIN. Melon man you are CRAZY. Liked and subscribed.
Friend: the food is not that hot<br><br>The food: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=284">4:44</a>
Here&#39;s to another decade of &quot;you gave X album a 7 but you gave MBDTF a 6&quot; üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Ight so now could you please do because the internet redux now cuz come on it&#39;s so much worth more
We were all waiting for him to praise Runaway but we forgot he&#39;s a melon
WE WANT JACK BOYS REVIEW
You&#39;re still wrong after all these years and that&#39;s ok
Well, at least he still likes and praises &quot;Power&quot;, and that&#39;s all that really matters to be. One of the best rap songs of the decade, easy.
Glad you said that about runaway. Its so true!!
Thats the Problem with overanalyzing everything all the time..everything is cringe.. that album is great you are just stuck
Melon saying Cyhi had the worst verse on So Appalled. Say sike
crazy he&#39;s gonna review me later this year
This album really aint that good
Nahhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Now redo Yeezus
This was made during classics week. You said it yourself Anthony, it&#39;s a confirmed classic!
Haha turn that 6 upside down and it‚Äôs a 9 haha. Why you do this :(
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs living in that fitted blue plaid shirt,<br>Saying something mean in it,<br>Gave a bad review for Kanye West‚Äôs best music,<br>Screams from the haters,<br>Time to redux review it,<br>I guess every YouTuber needs his intro music‚Äù
Calling Runaway cringey should get him court martialed
HE GAVE IT A SIX YESSSSS
Redux Yeezus
REVIEW. IT. AGAIN.
This single handedly ruined my 2020 thanks melon
‚ÄúAllow me to reintroduce myself ‚Äú
u just gonna keep rubbing it in huh
Little overanalyzed there melon, guess it‚Äôs better than the underanalyzed original review though. If this album dropped today you‚Äôd give it at least a 9 but you‚Äôre caught up in the meme
Gorgeous has always been my favorite song lyrically on this album. I&#39;ve tweeted that Alec Baldwin line so much lol
Melon about to be assassinated
I don&#39;t like you
really early April fools joke but whatever you want to do anthony
Wow can‚Äôt believe he gave it a 10 good review melon
But why is it the &quot;second best kanye album&quot; when its A FUCKING 5
The dislikes are hilarious, Kanye Stans are worse than ACTUAL Stans
Hurt me once, shame on you. Hurt me twice, shame on me.
üòê
Fantano actually is the kind of dude to ask that you skip the Runaway outro in the whip
ah, so THAT&#39;S the MBDTF people have been complaining to you about on twitter. got it.
All we need now is a third review of this album, in which Anthony gives it a 6 once again. Then it would be 666. The devil&#39;s new dress will be the skin of Kanye West, and then he will come out with an album called Satan is King.
Where the fuck was Cal in this video Melon??? I feel the same way about your reviews as you do this album: the features are the best part!!
If you listen to the review he clearly loves it, as I love you Anthony. It may have gotten a 6 from Anthony, but this review is a strong 10.
hard disagree. that chris rock sample SLAPS
&quot;Put the pussy in a sarcaphogus&quot; is easily my favorite Kanye line.
guys he kinda made some actual fucking points
Melon trolling 24/7
You gave My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy a 6, but My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy a 6??!!
Ten years ago I thought you underrated this, but today I think you‚Äôre being generous. It hasn‚Äôt aged well. A few solid bangers though.
Re-review the nemnem album melon!
MBDTF/10
Jay is on point lyrically here? <br><br>Sasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong Lochness,<br> Goblin, Ghoul, a zombie with no conscience<br><br>Question what do all these things have in common?<br>Everybody knows I&#39;m a motherfucking monster<br><br><br>wow
A toast for you, Anthony!
another 6/10<br>melons a savage, melons a monster<br>melons a pimp, melons a player
Did this man just say ‚ÄúFarty ass bass lines‚Äù
üì†: Hes fucking lying, its flawless/10
Power was my fav song on the album. I remember hearing leaks of I&#39;m so Appalled, and I thought it was gonna be so godlike, and the shit was mediocre lol. This album is ambitiously mid.
10/10 review it again
<b>How many times do we have to tell you this, melon man?</b>
i disagree
Stand User Name: <b>Anthony &quot;Melon&quot; Fantano</b><br>Stand Name: <b>You Won&#39;t Get What You Want</b>
Now he has to give DAMN a 7 again
Bruh
Say what you want about this review<br>But it objectively <i>is</i> in 1080p
please do eminem worst to best.
I blame jay-z&#39;s verse on monster
Fantano: You&#39;re a 6<br>MBDTF: CAN WE GET MUCH HIGHER?<br><br><br><br><br><br>Fantano: No.
I think the verses on runaway are, in fact, cute
I respect the fact that you gave this a 6, but watching this video it seemed like you enjoyed it more and i felt that you were going to give it a higher note
I would‚Äôve loved it if Melon talked up this album like it was a 10/10, not even criticizing it once and making it seem its a gift from god. Then at the very end still give it a 6/10.
Omgimgomogmimg
LMAOOOOOO
Melon, I agree that the album is a tad overrated. But we all know it deserves higher than a 6. Youre just giving it a 6 to troll us at this point
the Jay line u mentioned is good, but it is a corny ass verse overall. he literally just starts listing every monster at one point. nicki had the illest verse on the song and it was the moment she proved she truly belonged by outshining both Ye and Jay on the same track. she stole the show with her energy and flow. from this internet rapper&#39;s point of view anyway.
Triipppiiinn
u done fucked up faneto
You can just accept it, YOU WERE WRONG, ITS A CLASSIC
Wtf
I disagree about Nicki &quot;overshooting.&quot; I honestly think this is one of her best verses to date, feature or otherwise. Love the performance and suits the tone of the song. And I&#39;m not even a fan of hers.
I feel like some of the albums songs, specifically runaway, can be a bit overbearing and overwhelming. I personally love runaway and I love how it overwhelms my sense of sound but I&#39;d be stupid if I was unable to see why many people would dislike it.
WHAT MADE YOU ALL THINK HE WOULD CHANGE HIS SCORE JUST FROM A RE-REVIEW LOL
This got 120k views in 1 hour. GoddAMN.
Does this mean we get a re-review of your also-infamous Instant Gratification review?
Damn melon a 6/6? It‚Äôs at least a 6/6
Fuck I saw the like dislike ratio
Gyuwp
I think after the years of watching Nicki Minaj blow up, become an over-saturated global superstar, and fizzle out, her voice is kind of tired now, but that Monster verse was a goddamn revelation when it first hit
Thank you for fucking up 2 decades.
Just say you‚Äôve never listened to it still and move on
Lol
You‚Äôre still way to easy on this piece of shit album. Fuck MBDTF
The culture just peaked, you all saw it happen
FINALLY
dunmud
Jackboys
In exchange, give us Kanye&#39;s College Dropout for Classics Week so we can revel in the Classic/10
I love the ending of runaway especially the Sound. Its right on the edge of being painfull. You get goose bumps and dont know if its because its touching or because its awefull (too crazy high frequecies).
Don‚Äôt worry bro you can review it a third time and get it right
This shit is.. fuckin ridiculous
i demand a 2030 redux.v2
you&#39;re overrated
I can certainly see why he thinks it&#39;s a 6/10 now (he disliked pretty much every song lol) but I still disagree with 90% of the things he&#39;s said.
Sixthony Sixtano
review it again
Say runaway is a 10 and I won&#39;t call lester
Fantano, you really can&#39;t fully get &quot;Gorgeous&quot; until you&#39;ve worn sunglasses while walking around an airport bumping it on your headphones
Smh melon i held you to a higher standard than that
Wrapping up classics week we&#39;ll I see
You know what I disagree but I respect your opinion
I think Cal sums up my thoughts here pretty well<br><br>10 outta 10, review it again
as much as people wanted this rereview... i really hope you go back to yeezus one day. i think it aged wonderfully and was ahead of its time.
Where are the fav tracks and least fav
ngl I was ready to be mad but you came through
melon just pissed so many more people off
This is proof... <br><br><br><br>Cyber bullying Lighthony Sixtano works...
I love you for reviewing this again. I hate you for giving it a 6, again.
I‚Äôm so appalled by this review üòû
Let‚Äôs make it a tradition to review this album every 10 years
Could you review the marshall mathers LP on its aniversary this year? Since its getting 20 years old, i guess it deserves a retro review due to its impact on hip hop
Melon, I love you
Melon is just hating cause Kanye doesn&#39;t have a Ridge Wallet sponsorship
The album so nice, he gave it 6 twice :)))))))))
RUDEX CHERRY BOMB
The headless horseman decapitated people.
In all seriousness tho, Although me and melon still vehemently disagree about this album, I truly appreciate him for doing a redux on this album and him going track by track is refreshing af as a lover of this album. <br><br>Thanks for the redux melon. Truly appreciate it
kanye west is pretty awesome, and baku is the reason why he rules
dont you ever come for nicki minaj like r u dumb.
The day of reckoning has come
Damn imagine being wrong about the exact thing twice over 10 years apart
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=625">10:25</a>, when he starts bashing &quot;All of the Lights&quot;, that&#39;s where I start to realize why he has so many downvotes.
Look man. What‚Äôs up with you giving this album a 6. Everyone agrees this is at least a 7.
Our brother is lost and confused
HE CANT KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH ITTTT
Melon this is cool and all, but when is the mbdtf review coming out?
Antonio el Fantas
I think all his points are valid, and he kinda perfectly explains a lot of my own problems with the album(especially that god awful auto tune outro on runaway)
I agree with most of your points... however, you failed to mention that this album is a masterpiece.
Congrats on the 2 million that‚Äôs dope man,you should buy a crass shirt or conflict!my friend!or treat yourself and get a laserdisc player and buy repoman.laserdisc are fun!
I respect melon for not giving a fuck
The only way I can cum now is by watching all the Kanye stans getting angry at you for stating your opinion.
Since the fuck when are your eyes brown am I just mega small brain idk why I thought they were blue. I swear I actually watch.
He really doesn‚Äôt understand the albums narrative at all. Didn‚Äôt know he viewed music like this at such a surface level.
Listening to the review alone I agree with a lot, though I don&#39;t see how that equates to a six in your book. You&#39;re typically such a fan of most experimental music and MBDTF fulfilled that need so well. Ehh my opinion
Shoutout r/kanye !
This review is what I&#39;m going to show my kids when I need to teach them about how you can&#39;t believe everything you hear or see on the internet.
If you loved the album and asked for this redux review, be careful what you wish for. Because you just got it... again.
How are you gonna say nicki overshoots jay but criticize her lyricism lol
He really caved in and gave us the review. It‚Äôs a shame he still doesn‚Äôt see it‚Äôs greatness
Surely you do a re-re review.
World war three didnt start but he had to bomb something
Absolute madman
I can&#39;t believe he gave it a Strong 10 to Light 11
WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK OH MY GOOOOOD
Hi everyone, <br><br><br><br><br><br>She sukk onda dikk ona plane ijutcolla ehed.
<b>everyone disliked that</b>
The only reason you gave Kanye a 6 is because he didn‚Äôt buy your Ridge Wallets
Cover a Jack Stauber album please
So this proves to me that Melon needs to listen to Dissect season 2.
Okay Melon. What The Fuck
i rate u jackass out of ten bro
&quot;That&#39;s pretty vanilla.&quot;
10 OUT OF 10 REVIEW IT AGAIN
I think the more puerile and basic Kanye that he was turning into from societal messages of ‚ÄúGorgeous‚Äù to ‚ÄúAll of the Lights‚Äù is BETTER. I‚Äôve always found Kanye‚Äôs social messages a little too studied and disingenuous. And given his sudden change of heart... I was right. <br><br>So the Kanye you like is the fake Kanye and not the Kanye who learned not to be fake and to focus on things he actually knows and understands.
Lyrically I think you‚Äôre nit-picking
You know if this guy wasn‚Äôt so charming I‚Äôd be mad
I have to say that you have all my respect after this, melon
Only melon would have the balls to go back to his most infamous review and give it the exact same score. I‚Äôm not even mad.
MBDTF Redux Review 2100 edition: NOT GOOD
How is it the 2nd best album then?
HE CAN&#39;T KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH IT
Whether or not you love it, this album warrants a 20+ minute review rather than a 7-minute one. This came off so much more clear than the original video, and while I love the record personally, and there are certain points where I totally disagree with the melon (lost in the world, hell of a life), I understand exactly where he is coming from with every point and this really just shows how much better he has gotten at reviewing music and getting his opinion across. Not gonna lie I really love and respect this video, and that fantano chose to do this.<br><br><br><br><br>Unsubscribed
2 (two) jay-z features.<br><br><br>fantano:  kanye is putting jay z features on here like they&#39;re going out of style.<br><br><br>me, subconsciously: flannels have been out of style for numerous decades. <br><br><br>me, objectively: this review makes me squirm.
Yep, the ALMOST universally acclaimed album by Kanye West.
I‚Äôve gotta say, it‚Äôs been nearly 10 years and the album has never graced my ears. One day I‚Äôll give MBDTF a full listen without Melon‚Äôs influence.
Great review melon head, but you took it too far making from of kim&#39;s diaper ass.
No one man should have all those sixes!!
Bwuh the vocal solo in runaway is awesome
Melon thank you for doing another review and giving this album the TEN it deserved &lt;3
cop lights, street lights, spot light, light 6
<b>Calls Runaway cringe</b><br><br><b>Enjoys Hobo Johnson</b><br><br>Pick one.
Review it again in 2030 and the number of the beast shall be upon us. Also, I&#39;m pretty sure every critique made about Runaway&#39;s lyrics are the very point of those lyrics, it&#39;s a full on Pinkerton moment.
We should all dislike this review in unison
MELON SHUT THE FUCK UPPPPPPPPPPPPPP
imagine reduxing an album and roasting Jay-Z for, &quot;undershooting it,&quot; and criticizing nicki for, &quot;overshooting it.&quot; <br><br><br>this review of the review... is... NOT GOOD
Bruh u gay melon
The mad lad did it.
I mean
A decade past and you are still wrong
Oml He actually fucking did it üòØüòØ . dont know If it was worth it but hey it happened tho
2 times 6 is a 12. Mbdtf &gt; tpab
This is like the new decade&#39;s Rick Roll
Damn, Melon really starting this decade strong
You know I actually like the record less with each year so I think Anthony was ahead of the curve on this one
Its just a MBDTF review in HD and a moldy flannel. Clickbaited again
This guy really called Runaway cringe, lost a little bit of respect for you today Melon.
Not wavy
Clearly melon has a vendetta against kanye and his genius. At this point it&#39;s just a hate crime reviewing MBDTF.
Fantano is totally correct with his analysis. Kanye&#39;s shit drags on in a lot of his tracks.
Don&#39;t mind me, just hear to read the comments
good morning kanye <br><br><br><br><br><br>shut the fuck up
140 year later, MBDTF will be a strong 0/10
The mad lad actually did it
Am I dreaming
you a savage for this melon
I can&#39;t believe you admitted you were wrong and gave it a 9
is it still classics week?
love the mail line
Can&#39;t believe you said you&#39;d give it a 10/10 if it was named &quot;My Beautiful Light Twisted Fantasy&quot; you racist!
‚ÄúSTOP STOP HES ALREADY DEAD MELON‚Äù
This is a weird classics review
MBDTF WALKED SO TLOP COULD RUN
how many rap albums have a 94 metacritic?
i love how people are still genuinely mad that he still doesn&#39;t love this album after however many years it&#39;s been chill the fuck out
this isnt swimming by mac miller..
You were supposed to give it a 10 this time.......
5.2k dislikes. People fucking relax. People don&#39;t have to agree with your taste in music. Do you really need validation???
Melon what do you think of all of the lights interlude?
Man r u sure this things a 6
Now do a redux of the redux wtf
Racism
Melon please review the MBDTF Short Film!
Kanye is making history today by becoming the first rapper to get two 6‚Äôs for the same album. Goat üêê
congrates on the 2 mill man! here to 2 more!
All of the lights<br>Spot light<br>Street light<br>Stop light<br>light 6
Uh Oh this gonna be a doozy
Anthony, your content genuinely helps me keep an open mind about all genres. Thank you for your articulate reviews!
You‚Äôre right of course - especially knowing what we now know about Mr West and his üëª writers...
This man really just did a redux review just to shit on the album once again. What a legend you are melon.
YOU SON OF A BITCH
You know what melon I&#39;ve had enough!!!<br>MBDTF is not a 6, YOU&#39;RE A 6!!
Yeezus!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Knew he was gonna rate it a 6 again lol.
Can&#39;t wait for the 3rd re-review in 2030.
An L for me for clicking on this and thinking it&#39;s gonna be different, still love you melon.
THANK YOU!
Anthony I have to be at school in 7 hours why did you do this to me
try again
Now re-review Lil Pump‚Äôs album that you rated higher than MBDTF, I cant even remember it‚Äôs name.
Congrats on 2 mil, melon!!
One of your best reviews to date
I think it‚Äôs a really good album, even if at times overrated.
I still think this album is at least an 8 but the Review is waaay better now
I only just listened to this album recently and honestly I agree with everything except your opinion on Runaway. I love that song. But MBDTF is definitely not Kanye&#39;s best album. I do really like the first half, but everything after Runaway is just plain not good.
classic/10 ??? why not?
YEEZUS REDUX WHEN
I mean, I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm surprised lmao
Get rekd mbdtf stans
He‚Äôs finally released the spell
Niggas really thought he was gonna up the score.
YOU WERENT CAPPIN WOW
FUCK YOU!!
Okay so I liked this. I like MBDTF, and think it should be higher, but Melon delivers his point wayy better than the OG review. Like, in the first one I felt like Fantano gave it a lot of praise and then gave it a six over what we the comments felt like were smaller criticisms. This time I think he tells me more about why this is a 6
some people never learn :/
Notice how he emphasized ‚Äúsix‚Äù at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=382">6:22</a>
OH SHIT, HERE WE GO AGAIN
turn the 6 upside down it‚Äôs a 10 now
God this sucks
I&#39;m so gagged he gave it another not-so-good evaluation lol
Melon reviewed it again just to shit on it, DAMN
Melon like 96‚Äô Jordan, back on his bull shit
LET&#39;S HAVE A TOAST FOR THE MELONS
You just had to do it twice
wait all of the lights is easily the best track on the entire record WHAT
no, I&#39;m not having  melon.
im gonna keep coming back to this video just to see what happens to the like to dislike ratio
Hm, thats a weird way to say ‚Äùbest album of the decade‚Äù
Melon just trolled the whole game in the description
&quot;I met this girl on Valentine&#39;s Day, fucked her in May, she found out about April so she chose to March&quot;<br>weakest verse my ass
Tell us an album like this that did it better?
NO
He really slept on Rick Ross&#39;s verse on DIAND
Are we still on classic week?
4 points off for chris rock alone
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=250">4:10</a>
he thinks he‚Äôs above everyone else and his opinion is more valid when he hates on something popular. i respect genuine opinions, but this has been a trend in all his videos
CEO of being wrong
Runaway = 6/10<br><br><br>nonE Of uS woUlD be HeRE wiTHoUt CuM = 8/10
Can you please review it again in 2030 and give it another 6?
Honestly, even through all the dislike and scorn he got for his original review of MBDTF, he still stuck to his guns and you gotta respect that he still gave it a 6<br><br><br><br><br>Disliked
Lol @ all the dislikes. Kanye fans will never let it go. Late Registration will forever be his best album IMO!
Redux review care for me PLEASE
Can&#39;t wait to see the re-re-review in ten years Melon.
Okay I finally listened to the album. Never understood the meme. WHY 6? WHY DID I NEVER LISTEN TO THIS? IT&#39;S BEAUTIFUL. I have been missing the fuck out these last 10 years.
I literally listened to this album for the first time ever earlier this week... Loved it. Your crazy Melon it&#39;s a 10/10!
Lmao that porn search history line is FIRE
i am now afraid for kanye&#39;s wellbeing. if he dies in the next couple of months it is entirely your fault
What if he‚Äôs had this album confused with The Money Store the entire time? What then..? üòü
The verse on ‚ÄòLost in The World‚Äô is a whole lot of something, it is a poem that he wrote to Kim K before they got married <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=1226">20:26</a>
Thanks for the redux Fantano!
Lmaoooo good man
hey anthony fantano whats your address? i wanna ‚Äútalk‚Äù
Ok thats cool but when u are going to review it again
Cannot believe we pressured him to give another review for it to score it the same score. There is absolutely no way this is a 6.
Wow. Even in the old review, you rated the album a light to decent 6. Now it‚Äôs a strong 5 to light 6??? I wish you never did a redux review on this album, meldawg.
Hold this L.
Who‚Äôs ready for that 2030 re-re-review
You gave MBDTF a 6 but MBDTF a 6?!
He did it again!
Wrong again, Melon. See you in 2030.
Delete this... Please
Oh wow well this has been coming for years... TYAF (thank you anthony fantano) s/o Lil B
Ehhhmmm....at 3 million subs , yeezus redux?
Dummy
The beat on Hell Of A Life is euphoric!, one of the standouts.
H E  C A N &#39; T  K E E P  G E T T I N G  A W A Y  W I T H  I T
I absolutely love gorgeous but can&#39;t seem to get into the other songs, or at least the other songs don&#39;t have the same longevity for me;so I agree with this redux review
Selena Gomez - Rare
Based
&quot;So much head I woke up in sleep hollow&quot; I think is clearly saying, he got so confident and big headed, it blind himself to the real world and being a real person, loosing his head like the headless horseman
More like MBTFO, huh?
Why not review a classic album you HAVEN&#39;T heard or reviewed?  How about Willis Alan Ramsey or Gus Black&#39;s &quot;Word of Mouth Parade&quot; - or what about a new classic that you haven&#39;t reviewed, like Kris Kelly&#39;s &quot;Runaways&quot; or Gon&#39;s &quot;Diagonal Fields&quot;???  Or maybe a bona-fied classic that NO ONE has heard, like 1974&#39;s &quot;Not Just Another Bunch of Pretty Faces&quot; by the band IF ???<br><br>Who cares about Kanye at this point???
Wrong.
Nice redux Anthony, but you didn&#39;t need to say the n-words that Kanye raps throughout the album, you could just say like &quot;dudes&quot;
Review it again
3000: Rererererere-review of MBDTF: NOT GOOD
day 17 of trying to get melon to review classical music
The concept of runaway clearly went WAYYY over your head. He‚Äôs explaining how he‚Äôs a bad public speaker and how his message gets portrayed the wrong way hence the song sounding like a love song but in reality it‚Äôs not and the distorted voice is like what we hear when Kanye talks and his real message is foiled because of his poor public speaking abilities.
You would‚Äôve given it a 10 if you realized Alec Baldwin is on of the main actors in hit tv show 30 Rock
Disney, Universal, Miramax... but I never thought you would make a sequel, melon
Took you 10 years to make an update and you‚Äôre still wrong. Feeling a light 6 on your opinion melon.
DECADE LIST GIVE IT TO ME
Now do a video of all your 10s and fix those scores.
The album is meh, it always has been. One mans meh is another mans 10/10 though and some people just cant get that. No amount of people bitching, moaning, arguing and insulting should change that. If it&#39;s a 10/10 for you then that&#39;s all that should matter. Its fucking baffling to me how so many people need other people to agree with their taste. Its literally the same thing as saying &quot;I fucking love strawberry kiwi snapple&quot;... &quot;you think it&#39;s just OK? You&#39;re a fucking idiot that doenst know fruity drinks then&quot; or &quot;how could you say cheeseburgers are delicious but meatloaf is meh&quot;. Grow up and be comfortable with your own opinions guys.
It already has 5k dislikes lololol
Fuck yea
He‚Äôs going to get cyber bullied for another ten years, I hope melon learns his lesson and gives this a 10 next time
I genuinely couldn‚Äôt take him serious and actually thought he was just fucking with us when he said nickis verse on monster was ok and that rick ross‚Äôs amazing verse on diand was ok aswell,what a fucking joke
This man really dissed Nicki‚Äôs best verse of her career ü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Review it again
Melons Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is not My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy
You comments on All of the Lights &amp; Runaway miss the cultural impact of the songs and their corresponding videos. Imagery that envoke more emotion and compliment their sound.
You&#39;re a fucking madman
To 10 more years of ‚Äúreview it again‚Äù
kanye west is not the sharpest tool in the shed
me: 2020 is off to a rough start, at least we don‚Äôt have to experience Fantano reviewing my beautiful dark twisted fantasy<br><br>Fantano:
Amazing
Are you fucking serious
Nice review man<br><br><br>But that 12 minute interlude about extreme porn was unnecessary
How to watch this video properly :)<br>1) Check description<br>2) Leave a dislike<br>3) Move on with your day
how do you not like so appalled
Clickthony Clickbaitano here
OH MY GOD WTF ITS ACTUALLY HAPPENING
I wonder if Melon still considers College Dropout his favourite Ye album, or if that‚Äôs changed since his Worst to Best. <br><br>Also stop bullying MBDTF‚Äôs latter half, Melon, you know Runaway‚Äôs fire.
if this wasnt made by kanye west i feel like the same album wouldve gotten an 8 from him
So unfinished Yandhi is a 8 but the greatest album of all time is a 6?
This man answered the call to re-review and just gave his original review like god damn you guys got punked
Year 5000: Light to decent 0
Thank you Anthony for giving your point clearly. I feel much same about &quot;Blame Game&quot;, &quot;Hell of a Life&quot;,  &quot;Runaway&quot; and &quot;Who Will Survive in America&quot;. I also think that Kanye failed to dive deeply into its concept, which is carried out by himself in the first place. And that is the biggest issue about this album in my opinion...
madman
lol I don&#39;t think you understand how powerful All of the Lights is, you gotta want to have all of the lights you know what I mean
See you guys at the 2030 re-review
Pitchfork: This is the second best album of the decade<br><br><br>Rolling Stone: This is the best album of the decade<br><br><br>Melon: Nah it&#39;s not even as good as lil pump&#39;s debut album everyone already forgot about
why are people so upset that melon doesn&#39;t love an album? we all have albums that we think are overrated, i love mbdtf but this is a great rereview
I hope this gets more dislikes than the original review
I respect your opinion and some points...<br><br><br><br><br><br>Unsubscribed <br>Canceled my patreon<br>burning my thatistheplan beanie
Yeezus REDUX REVIEW next
Saying you dont like the album because &quot;he&#39;s black&quot; is not a good qualification
Cringe
I agree
red: bad<br>yellow: good<br>blue: looking good, anthony! :-)
We asked for this and it hurt even more the second time. Runaway is a perfect song and there is no debate about this at all. This album is a minimum of a 9 and I will fight over this
Melon you get a soft 6 as a person.
this aint Christ-like
Yeah the rating sucks but the bad part about the original review is that he barely says why he dislikes it... now i know why the album is bad
thank you melon for validating my opnions. i will now regurgitate them to all of my friends, and watch them slowly disappear out of my life.
lol, dude decides to keep digging. This review is gonna keep aging like a block of cheese in a sauna
The only part about this album I dislike is when Jay-Z says ‚Äúsuck my balls through my ‚Äòdraws‚Äù. Still not it Hove.
i hate you
Bruh this meme is cringe
Time to thumb down again üëå
You think you‚Äôre funny for this don‚Äôt you huhü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Hold Up<br>Why Is Chris Lahiffe, The Little Brother of Nino Lahiffe From the 10/10 French animated Hit, Miraculous Tales Of Ladybug &amp; Chat Noir Doing The REDUX REVIEW and not Melon. This is Utterly Ridiculous <br>Unsubscribing
still u missed the point of Runaway by criticizing his singing abilities and other silly things
Saying you would&#39;ve given it a 10 if it was called &quot;My Beautiful White Twisted Fantasy&quot; was racist to say the least, Melon.
It would‚Äôve been jokes if he rated it lowerüòÇ
Why they put the pussy in the sarcophagus?
whats the point of rereviewing something if you&#39;re opinion is going to be the exact same? thought you were better than clout chasing like this anthony. <br><br><br>unsubscribed.
It‚Äôs hard to tell whether giving it six again is genuine or trolling.
How can you go over dark fantasy without mentioning the opener?
Love the undervelvet record
Antonie, yo opinion wron, diz the bes album of all time.
props antknee for reinforcing his opinion rather than just bumping up the score to satisfy fans
No. Review again
i agree doe, ive always felt like mbdtf had its moments but was massively overrated. favorite ye record is late registration by far
It‚Äôs funny cause I agree with a lot of the flaws melon finds with the album, especially in regards to Runaway and the Chris Rock outro. However, these flaws don‚Äôt significantly deter my enjoyment of the album. I think MBDTF is atleast an 8 personally, but im still rly glad he did the redux review cause it makes a lot more sense than his original, even though the numerical score still feels a little low based on his verbal review
gay melon
Congrats on two million melon!
Turn that 6 upside down twice...its still a 6 now
Hearing him say Runaway is ‚ÄúCringey‚Äù hurt my soul
Wtf happed
I think this album is a classic. <br>It holds significance in hip hop and Kanye‚Äôs career. It‚Äôs grand, it‚Äôs massive, it sounds rich and expensive, the concept is so manic and so Kanye, albeit loose....<br><br>But ANYBODY who thinks this album doesn‚Äôt fall off a damn cliff after Runaway is a LIAR. Blame game is decent but Melon is right... Every time I listen to this album it essentially ends after Runaway. I‚Äôll listen to Blame Game tho if I‚Äôm feeling real simpy.
I read the comments and spoiled the video... I was looking forward to this for years..
10 years and we&#39;ve made no progress. We&#39;ve lost the game
oh it has a 6. many albums i adore are a 6 in melons eyes, so i guess this album should be right up my alley
very un-christ-like review melon
The only reason you&#39;re giving MBDTF a 6 AGAIN is because of those t-shirts you have, you&#39;re not fooling us! You have let commercialism consume you with the t-shirts and the nifty wallets!
Billboard named MBDTF the greatest album of the decade.
Good review. Hardly disagree
You&#39;re wrong
My beautiful dark twisted fantano
Now listen here you little shit...
i wanna hear him recreate all of MBDTF
‚ÄúEverybody look at me! I‚Äôm ignoring the concepts of concept album and believing that makes me smarter than everyone else!‚Äù
NO
2030 Re-redux: strong 4 to a light 5
This is coming from a guy who had a top album of &quot;a long hot Los Angeles summer day&quot; in his top 100 of 2019 but not even Nas&#39;s Lost tape 2 or Survival by Dave east, I could name more by I don&#39;t even need to
Anthony shits on the best hip hop song of all time runaway. Jus devaluated all his music opinions
You gave it the same score ü§¨
Review Turn on the bright lights for classic week. You‚Äôve had it on your display in the background before
Ah hell yeah I can dislike this video again.
hahahaha such a troll
Melon is gonna have to take a trip to the ghetto university
u know it is at least a 7 tho
Hes not wrong tho. MBDTF isn&#39;t very good at alot. Theres a lot of good and bad. Still give it a 7.5 tho
I waited years to hear him review this again <br>And once again I was disappointed
Geez Melon, I get that fans  annoyed you for the review but did you really have to say you hate them And wish they ate doodoo
I feel like he lets the standard he holds an artist to effect his score. No way he actually likes lil pump‚Äôs album more than this masterpiece.
This guy is such a fucking hipster
Honestly I agree with you on this review still. Even when I heard it back then, I thought the first half was great and 2nd half fell apart. Listening back a few months,  I still think this. From a production standpoint it gets messy/the songs aren&#39;t as strong.<br><br>Well explained re-review.
Still waiting for JACKBOYS
Ehhh.... Maybe when i was in my younger adulthood, I needed guidance in my music taste. Now in my mid 20s, I don&#39;t need junk filling my sub inbox...
Fellas, we got duped
guys i‚Äôm so excited I hope he gives it a higher score than before
Where is roddy richh review at?
Guys if we keep asking him it‚Äôs just gonna be a 5 next decade
Nobody‚Äôs talking about how Melon didn‚Äôt like Nicki‚Äôs verse tf is wrong w u melon man?
Damn he doubled down on that score. Much respect to you melon, couldn&#39;t be me if I had to deal with some of these Kanye stans out here. Congrats on the 2 million btw
I love ya melon, but if you&#39;re sticking to your original score on this masterpiece, I&#39;m sticking to the thumbs down button üòÅ
Runaway lyrics are cringe but every Cardi B song isn&#39;t?
Fine, whatever. Now re-review Yeezus because that shit has aged super well IMO and doesn&#39;t deserve a damn 5.
I agree with you completely. Very overrated album üëå and I thinks it&#39;s a 6 as well .
Its honestly refreshing seeing actually orginal comments for once. <br><br><br><br><br>Still dont know why you beat my wife though anthony, not very cool
Redo it
Welp that&#39;s it I guess. Thanks for ruining the album for me, Melon.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=866">14:26</a>
Kanye west imphasis yes imphasis on CON YAY
Absolute madman he gave a 6 one more review and he will summon satan to end this world!
Imagine if he did this on April 1 2020 only to give it a 9.
Y O U D O N &#39; T L I K E A R T ?
By omission, he‚Äôs letting us know that his favorite part of ‚ÄúMonster‚Äù was when Jay Z listed off a number of monsters.
lmaooooo
TURNED OFF THE VIDEO AS SOON AS HE SLANDERED THE HELL OF A LIFE INSTRUMENTAL
whole world knows it‚Äôs classic/10
HAHAHA
BRO
Nice review fantano, but I think you already reviewed this. super lazy and disappointing.<br><br><br><br>9.8/10 This review has a little something for everyone
im high asf melon why u wasting my time like this bru?
This dude really complained about Nicki Minaj&#39;s verse on monster.  L
Sounds like you got to review this album a third time.
Thanks for being honest melon ‚ù§Ô∏è live love melon
Well, folks.<br>That&#39;s what we&#39;ve been asking him for years and years now.<br>We did our best.<br><br>I&#39;m gonna go back and stream Echoes Of Silence for a better therapeutic mode.
10 years later, and somehow Fantano‚Äôs opinion of Kanye‚Äôs personality is a reason the album is bad? All of the Lights isn‚Äôt anti domestic abuse enough, ‚Äòmake a nun come‚Äô isn‚Äôt sexy and ‚ÄòI sent this bitch a picture of my dick‚Äô is cringe. All of those comments, at least I‚Äôve interpreted it anyway, are an exaggeration of his personality and present him as like an unstoppable, egotistical, fame hungry monster (which is exactly the entire ‚Äòspotty‚Äô concept of the record). I don‚Äôt see why those up front comments make it a worse album or why they‚Äôd rub him the wrong way that much.<br><br>Bad form Melon. <br><br>Gonna have to give this take a light to decent 5.
The second I look in the comments to type something I get spoiled
I don‚Äôt know what it is with MBDTF but melon‚Äôs not too good at that shit
Melon still poopy 2010-2020 confirmed
I respect your opinion, Anthony. Great review, well thought-out. But since I love this album 10 years later. Disliked and subscribed
I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE
He likes it slightly less now lol
Re ducks lol
you really did it to em
üßêüßêüßêüßêüßêüßêüßê
baroque rap LMFAO
Yeah... I remember having similar thoughts when I listened to it for the first time a few years ago. I‚Äôd give it a 6.5 or a 7 personally, but out of all the ‚ÄúClassic Kanye‚Äù era LPs it‚Äôs my least favorite, and it‚Äôs certainly overhyped in the hip-hop/mainstream rap conversation.<br><br>The only thing I REALLY disagree with is your thoughts ‚ÄúHell of a Life‚Äù. HELL OF A LIFE IS DOPE! I love how weird the instrumental is put together w/o sounding like a complete mess (*cough* Ghost Town. *Achoo!*). It inspires me to incorporate unorthodox sounds into my own production as well.
Siri, who gave MBDTF a six?
<b>HAHA</b>
Imagining waiting a whole decade for this, and he still gives the same score
At least MBDTF got a flannel now
6/10? Again? Ok, I see how it is melon boy üçâ
GOT EM nice melon
Ive lost all respect sorry this is absolutely rigged for money...or ratings in not sure which. Just saw it live sry
Why does Anthony dislike [Insert a good song from this album]? No but seriously what&#39;s his beef with Runaway?
I love it
Congrats everyone you got what you wanted
8
The fact that you rate any Brockhampton album over this is (in my opinion) proof that you actually value the aesthetic of music more than the substance. <br><br>You like the way those BH guys dress, the way they present themselves with some sort of sophisticated atmosphere, meaning they are &quot;deep&quot;. Pretty obvious that you wanna come off as an intellectual, and be that guy at the parties wearing a flannel &amp; a fisherman&#39;s beanie talking about &quot;can you guys play some Frank Ocean or Kevin Abstract please?&quot; <br><br>I don&#39;t take you seriously at all as a music critic, because this aesthetic&gt;substance perspective you have is such an unproductive way to talk about music. <br><br>Highly recommend you become a hype clothing review channel or maybe just start specifically reviewing your favorite album art.
Gorgeous instrumental is timeless
The madlad actually did it. Y&#39;all thought he was gonna give it a 10 this time
lmaooo imagine harassing melon for years to review this album only for him to come to essentially the same conclusion
We all knew it was coming
This is delightfully devilish
Ye fans turned the 6 upside down issa 9 now
10/10 review it again
Melon seriously dosen&#39;t like Nicki Minaj&#39;s best verse ever.
Nicki Minaj is the best verse on Monster!
Here&#39;s to another 10 years of TND<br><br>Forever!
It‚Äôs actually like a 4/10 üíÄüíÄüíÄ
Wtf melon, I bought all of those ridge wallets just to get another 6?!?
What part does he talk about all of the lights?
at this point, we boycott melon
Fuck you dude
I swear if I see you imma slap the shit out of you for giving this album a 6
delete this before /mu/ and reddit idiots start riding down your opinion
Great review. Thumbs down.
Yeezus is better
Review the film.
A 6 again???? What a fucking troll üòÇüòÇ
anthony why
Do a redux review of Take Care by Drake
LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Anthony must need some real cash quick because every time he does a Kanye album it gets tons of views
I hope I&#39;m not the only one but whatever I actually like Hell Of a Life not even gonna lie
I literally made a YouTube account to tell you that you‚Äôre absolute trash
So, melon man calls MBDTF overrated but gives Lil Pump a 7. Why am I even watching his videos?
I personally connect to the album because when I first heard it, I was in a very similar headspace to Kanye. Just completely jaded with life and only concerned about vain things like money and sex. It&#39;s not a healthy headspace, but I think it is a common one and it is part of why the album is so influential and revered. I still love the album even though I&#39;ve gotten beyond those feelings and become more mature. It&#39;s a retrospective of how you once were, but never want to be again
Review it, AGAIN!!
Bug emojis üêúüêúüêúüêú
I remember that album cover art differently
mr. west, stay in bed today. no need to wake so early and see such a travesty
This Melon really tried to throw us off with a fuckin&#39; blue flannel, thought he would redeem himself but really just gave it the same damn score, sealed his fate and the last nail in the coffin. Honestly this was the ultimate power move from Melon, and I did not expect less.
HE FUCKING DID IT!
I feel like you‚Äôre kind of over-analyzing Kanye‚Äôs lyrics on this album. Kanye is a weird, flawed, twisted mess of a human being, and I think that this album, as well as some of his most appalling lyrics, are a brutally honest reflection of that reality. Kanye is by no means a likable person. You don‚Äôt have to sympathize with him. But he‚Äôs undeniably captivating, and I think that‚Äôs what makes this album so loved. <br><br>I can understand why you take issue with certain parts of this album. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the best album of the 2010s, as many music publications have deemed it (that title goes to TPAB). But it‚Äôs not a fucking six. The production is just way too good. I‚Äôd probably give it an eight or nine.
PEEP THAT POLYPHIA COVER
Nigga said Ci hy verse is unnecesary‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è
He‚Äôs gone and done it again
*Nicki Minaj&#39;s British voice*: I can&#39;t believe you&#39;ve done this
Fuck you
How Dare You Not Please Your Millions of Subscribers.<br><br><br><br><br><br>+Respect<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Unsubscribed
how can someone be so wrong on an album after 10 years. i honestly feel bad for him, he just doesnt fucking get it.
U may have 2 million subscribers but holy shit look at that ratio
When i woke up and saw this was uploaded i fell of my bed and landed on my son! Should probably get off soon, he hasn‚Äôt moved in 3 minutes...
Honestly if Hell Of A Life didn&#39;t exist this thing would be a strong 9
I appreciate that you have the courage to be wrong twice
MBDTF is overrated and mediocre. It doesn&#39;t deserve a 10. What does deserve a 10 is Party Rock by LMFAO.
Farty ass bass
THIS IS A FAT ASS BRUH MOMENT
Oh boy, here we go again
Lost In The World is one of the most beautifully composed hip hop songs of all time... but ok.
WOW it‚Äôs MBDTF all over again üôÑ oh wait
10 more years and he will like it, dont give up gents
Get fucked melon boi...  this albums a 10
Yeezus Redux when?
i cry to that song
Melon really be sending a message here....
Nicki&#39;s verse on Monster was on point prove me wrong
Not very christlike, Antwan.
Great review of the most overrated album of the decade
This man gave LIL PUMP a fucking 7.. just saying
I disagree and agree on some points, but I must say ‚ÄúGorgeous‚Äù evokes the most emotion for me out of any track on this reccord.
do it again
genuinely do not understand your viewpoint even after hearing you ramble on for 23 minutes about it. <br><br><br><br>album is at the VERY LEAST a strong 7 to a light 8<br><br><br>but i mean, your are who you are. i am not a melon. you are the melon. i listen to what you have to say and not vice versa
MBDTF is a good album with some great songs. But it&#39;s no masterpiece as a whole.<br><br> I know people are loathe to compare the two. But listen to TPAB after this one and it&#39;s no contest. TPAB just flows better, less FT. bloat, and ends fucking fantastically.
Not only did you give it another light 6, but this time you considered a strong 5 to light 6 instead of light to decent 6, LMAO
BUT WHY DON&#39;T YOU HAVE MY OPINION!? DOUBLE DISLIKE!!!
Wow fuck you
YOU<br>STILL GAVE IT A 6 BRO WHY
Re-review it again
For your consideration: All of the Lights is an honest portrayal of somebody who made mistakes in the past , grew since making those mistakes and realizes that he has an opportunity to provide better circumstances for his offspring so they don&#39;t grow up in an environment where violence/destructive behavior is the norm.  Like that&#39;s literally what the words of the song say.<br><br>Also the instrumental for this song is a transcendent masterpiece and the blown out drums fucking slap.<br><br>Just my un-asked for two cents, thanks for the re-review.
Why again?
Man fuck you
Plan C : drop melons head on iran
I demand a RE-REVIEW!!!
I thought you were gonna give it a 5
i hate you
I like this review better because you explain your thoughts more cohesively, but also hearing your criticisms of the album of the decade makes me cringe
He gets a like for the consistency after a decade
I feel like a masochist. I disagree with him, but love the fact he tells us we&#39;re still wrong.
the mad lad
This album isn‚Äôt a 6. I guess it‚Äôs a culture thing you can‚Äôt feel.
Runaway is just not that good ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Sounds like your biggest dislike on this album is the lyrics. But I don‚Äôt understand how there are songs not by Kanye with even worse lyrics that you consider good?
Conspiracy theory: He is trolling for views
Am I the only one who thinks he should revisit the money store
Logic‚Äôs first two albums are better than MBDTF
you asshole omg lmao
melon‚Äôs bluetiful dark twisted flannelsy
Melon the kinda guy to re-review a 10 year old record to give it the same score
Anthony redo this review expeditiously
Worst review yet, not quite sure how you got to 2 million subscribers. I Liked and subscribed though.
This is a weird way to end Classics Week.
you really had to do this right
melon has now confirmed he believes the only kanye album above a 6 is the college dropout
6/10 + 6/10 = 12/10 AOTY
i still cannot believe that this man actually thinks that &#39;&#39;hell of a life&#39;&#39; is horrible
You only gave it a 6 because you believe that it was a 6.
lightthany sixtano
.
Anthony probably pees on small woodland animals for fun
Oh my god. He actually did it
LMAO he still ain&#39;t give a fuck what yall have to say
this is an interesting way to announce your presidential campaign, mr. melon. you have my vote!
I guess we agree to disagree. Runaway is an absolutely amazing song
L
Lol y&#39;all are so mad. You really thought he was going to drastically change his opinion on it?
I think you should re-review this review
I love how you stuck to your guns, Fantano. Don&#39;t give in to peer pressure!! MBDTF is a bloated monstrosity and it should be understood as such.
I agree with Fantano and back in the day I was a huge MBDTF fan. This album has some amazing highs but also some very deep lowes.
I can not believe I got excited for this
Solid review, while I still see MBDTF as a 10/10 I really enjoy how you really dig into the album and clearly explain why you have issues with it, it helps to look at it in a new light. Maybe I should relisten to see if it really is overrated. Unsubscribed.
review it again
Did this man say that Runaway was cringe???<br>You are cringe melon &gt;:^(
review wasn‚Äôt bad
I really agree with this review. Too many awful lyrics that kill songs before they can even start, and awkward production decisions that dont really pan out. I feel like the more you read into this album, and learn all the lyrics, and dive deep into it the worse it gets, and you&#39;re left with a really confusing mishmash of all the really incredible stuff that worked really worked and everything else that just feels unfinished. <br><br>If you just listen to it and ignore all the bad stuff I can see how it might look like a masterpiece, but if you actually take everything in it leaves a really bad taste in the mouth.<br><br>Also, thanks for doing a kind of fun re review of this album, even if it did end up being pretty serious. Hope you have a nice day and thank you for always making such good videos man!
You gave MBDTF a 6, but you gave MBDTF a 6?
The &quot;girl&quot; he talks about on every track (except for Blame Game) is fame itself. He &quot;slapped her&quot; with the Taylor Swift incident, and cries about it on Runaway. Plus, on Runaway, the distorted vocals represent how he has problems making people understand his point of view, therefore we hear a distorted message.
I may not agree with this review, but could we please stop disliking over a difference of opinions? I don‚Äôt listen to critics because I want my opinions regurgitated at me. I listen to them because they make me think about art in a new way.
He gave it the same score because<br><b>WE WON&#39;T GET WHAT WE WANT</b><br><br>It&#39;s a metaphorical 10 ü§Ø
Hell of a life is fire
BOO THIS MAN BOO HIM NOW!!!
Anthony: Gives MBDTF a 6 <br>Comments: Review it again. 10/10<br>Anthony: I&#39;ll fucking do it again
W anthony
10 - Perfect<br>9 - Really loved it<br>8 - Loved it<br>7 - Really liked it<br>6 - <b>Liked it</b><br>5 - Average<br>4 - Disliked it<br>3 - Really disliked it<br>2 - Hated it<br>1 - Really hated it<br>0 - The worst<br><br>Another person commented this but I can‚Äôt find it. Just posting it here and changing it a bit
PLEASE REDO I DONT LIKE SHIT I DONT GO OUTSIDE BY EARL SWEATSHIRT. YOU SAID U LIKED IT MORE AND I WANNA SEE WHAT YOU WOULD RATE IT NOW.
the production alone gives this a 9 for me, but I do think this is a better review than your first one
I hope he&#39;s ready for another decade of getting harassed for giving it a 6
Me: Throws bread to the ducks at the park<br><br>The Ducks: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=1073">17:53</a>
CLOWN
I&#39;m thrilled to see that you now appreciate this, and went as far as to say it was &quot;the perfect album&quot;, but it was misguided, unfair, and racist to give it a 6 solely because &quot;blacks should receive 3/5ths the score they are entitled to&quot;, and that &quot;they should be grateful that they get a score to begin with&quot;.  I won&#39;t keep paying for your racial sensitivity classes if you only go for the vegan ice cream I buy you on the way home!
His least favourite verses are Nicki on Monster and Cyhi on So Appalled... This man just mad for the sake of it
I give up. He truly refuses to understand the genius of this masterpiece.<br>DAMN YOU MELON, DAMN YOU.
You would
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=1116">18:36</a> Truly amazing
this is the one time i will ever agree with you
Okay...CyHi on So Appalled said &quot;I met this girl on Valentine&#39;s Day, fucked her in May, she found out about April so she chose to March.&quot;<br>Not sure how you can call his verse &quot;bad&quot;
To Pimp a Butterfly is way better.
It‚Äôs okay. Imma wait for that third review.
Absolutely amazing review melon. I really enjoyed the deep dive into each and every track along with your unique and creative descriptions. My favorite part is when you gave the album a 10/10, thank you.
Finally the 10 that it deserves!
this is for sure a video you don‚Äôt wanna read the comments for before you watch it. or maybe you do to save frustration, but then you‚Äôll be frustrated he gave it the same score
Gorgeous is a PERFECT song
I think it comes down to how much you enjoy the singles on this album. Power, All of the Lights, Runaway and Monster will make you sway to how much you love this album. Either you love the album, or it‚Äôs not for you. I think we know where melon sits.
Holy shit he&#39;s actually going in on him
Wow, a 10, holy shit! Thanks Anthony
While every fiber of my being disagrees with anything less than a 9 for this album, I&#39;m kinda contempt with this review. The first review felt so oversimplified and weak and was more like &quot;here&#39;s a 6. K. Bye.&quot; This one felt like you actually treat the album with the respect it deserves and your problems with it are so much more clear and I can genuinely see where you come from. Glad this came out. Too bad you&#39;re wrong.
it‚Äôs just so weird to me that someone can give KSG a 10 and this a 6. Not even complaining I just think it‚Äôs strange
‚ÄúFarty ass baselines‚Äù lmfao melon boy funny
Man, melon must be getting desperate for views... Ain&#39;t gonna watch this bait.
Sayin  runaway is ‚Äúcringe‚Äù hurts. I think melon just hates globally loved things. He probably hates the Goonies
This album was pop rap trash in 2010 and it still is in 2020.<br>Kanye stans gotta face facts.
90% of the black communities failings are their own fault. You only have this opinion cause your wife is black and you listen to way too much rap music.
YOU STILL DON&#39;T LEARN MELONMAN
Wait what the hell I don&#39;t like this album anymore
Shoulda done it shirtless smh melon
So Appalled and GORGEOUS are 10/10
You fucked up again melon
I strongly disagree with your take on Runaway&#39;s lyrics. The way I view that verse (&quot;she find pictures in my email&quot;) specially. Here, to me, Kanye is showcasing something that happened to thousands of guys in the technology age, something relatable to tons of people you probably know, its a verse about not being able to handle one&#39;s own desires, even though they are with someone they love. And those final minutes could be read as the way the peoole understand the things he says or even in how he feel like he&#39;s not understood fully.
I&#39;M CRYING HE GAVE IT ANOTHER 6 LMAO
I like how the cover art changed in 10 years
LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
He re-reviewed it and gave it a lower score LMFAOOO. Devil in a New Dress is a top 10 Ye song btw
It‚Äôs funny how he praises how Devil in a new Dress is a return to classic Kanye when it‚Äôs the only track on the album he didn‚Äôt produced
This video is evidence of a guy trying way too long to try and get an album but the only thing he ends up doing through his listens is finding every minute nitpick he can about this album. I don&#39;t think Fantano hasever applied this much minute scrutiny to every second of an album like he did in this review. So many of these nitpicks don&#39;t matter or their severity is way overexaggerated. An obnoxious review IMO
Fuck me antknee, you couldn‚Äôt compromise to a 7 and here we are waiting another decade waiting for you to be right
yeezy reupholstered my pussy
I still love you Melonoma
Yall really thought he was gonna change his opinion. When melon speaks, he has spoken.
I don‚Äôt think when Kanye said ‚Äúall of the lights‚Äù he was talking about a light 6 melon
The real score is CLASSIC/10 tho
Respect. Respect. Good job Fantano. You finally did it. Thank you.‚ô•Ô∏è
Before i watch, is it a 10? :)
&quot;Farty bass-lines&quot; great, now I can&#39;t listen to Hell of a Life the same ever again.
Overrated? <br><br>10 is over 8. Does that work?
It‚Äôs a good thing your opinion means as much as mine
HE STILL DOESNT LIKE RUNAWAY!<br><br>BOOOOO THIS MAN
we have to cancel him. he has disrespected the runaway outro
Hearing people say Runaway was song of the decade made me embarrassed to be a music fan. Most overrated album.
Fuck u melon u fruit looking ass
when you really need the clicks
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=1223">20:23</a> Pretty sure that was his love letter to Kim K
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=482">8:02</a> Your proof of Trump being a scammer is a settlement? You seriously have a low bar. I wonder who Anthony actually supports on the democrat side. It‚Äôs basically Trump vs a clown circus. CNN just settled a case with Nick Sandman so I guess CNN are scammers now.
but anthony why don‚Äôt you like it
Have you ever done a review of the dillinger escape plan&#39;s calculating infinity?
yeah whatever lol
This album would&#39;ve been better if it was only the Chris Rock skit<br><br>I AIN&#39;T NEVER BEEN TO THIS PART OF PUSSY TOWN BEFORE
The blurry moaning sound at the end of runaway represents how the media percieves what kanye says and shows how he feels he is misunderstood anthony
melon how do u give this album a 6 but give DAMN. an 8........ u let me down melon.
22 minutes? <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>pass.
I understood your opinion then and i still don&#39;t understand it now.
Undoubtedly the best album of the decade to me but it‚Äôs okay melon I still love you üòò
Bad review. Subscribed.
So he saying ye better than mbdtf üòê
Even Baldtano giving MBDTF a Light 6 again won&#39;t stop kanyeposting posting lizzo. Btw fucking light 6, what did you even do for these 10 years, it&#39;s his best album üö´üß¢ at least worthy of a strong 8. Not wavey at all baldman, not wavey at all.
Anthony where have you been? Come home, mom&#39;s been making eggplant and casserole. She misses you, it&#39;s been a while since we all had dinner and play Mario Kart together
Bruh
Man...the Runaway outro hits me with goosebumps every single time without fail. I actually skip right to this part the majority of the time instead of listening to the verses. I just can&#39;t fathom how it doesn&#39;t evoke a sense of frission for the listener but to each his own
No way
I STRONGLY disagree CyHi was never meant to be on the album but he wrote down a verse while Kanye was sleeping and he saw the verse he wrote and loved it so much he put it one the album. Plus his vs is honestly good          <br><br>‚ÄúI met this girl on Valentine‚Äôs Day, fucked her in May<br>She found out about April, so she chose to march‚Äù
melon actually dropped the score from ‚Äúlight to decent 6‚Äù to ‚Äústrong 5 to light 6‚Äù <br><br>lmaooo
Guys if he reviews it again he‚Äôs gonna give it a 666... this means his ridge minimalist wallets are a deal with the devil confirmed.
Can&#39;t believe you gave this a 6 but gave Nostalgia Critic&#39;s The Wall a 10.
Imagine thinking Ye is better than MBDTF
The beat on devil in a new dress was done by Bink!
TLOP was my favorite album of the decade.
its ok to be wrong melon boy
Now THIS is a great review. <br><br>I disagree with the rating but at least this time you actually talked about the music.
You‚Äôre farty ass, melon
Nope, you are nitpicking and biased. I win bye bye!
The runaway disrespect ‚òπÔ∏è
Please listen to Cosmic Surgery by Neat Beats. spotify:album:0zlLi9xAKvF6fDVIW4XZbJ
Fuck this. When are you revisiting AM, melon?
This Nigga
Bruh this one of the reasons why ww3 will happen
I think it‚Äôs a little interesting that Melon dissed Hell of a Life so badly, especially considering it‚Äôs so thematically similar to All Mine; a track that Melon didn‚Äôt completely hate. In many ways I think the songs has a similar effect to the latter, where Kanye shows how his sex addiction is one of his faults and one of the ‚Äúdark‚Äù parts of his fantasy.
The memes gonna be real good.
He can talk all the shit he wants about this album but he can never take back the placement that he gave it on his Kanye Worst to Best video. It&#39;s okay to like the album Fanthony.
I can&#39;t take the All of the Lights slander my god
Can&#39;t wait until 2030 when he finally gives it a 10
Please review turn on the bright lights already
I agree
10/10 REVIEW IT AGAIN!!
fantano: &quot;i really like the majority of the songs on here&quot;<br>also fantano: &quot;i&#39;m feeling a 6 on this&quot; <br><br><br>wtf
10 out of 10, re-review it again!
you...you really did this shit again melon
Bullying doesn‚Äôt work guys üôÅ
Holy shit
You gave MBTDF a 6 but you also gave MBDTF a 6? Cmon melon.
daaaamn givvem the piledriver anthony
All jokes aside I really respect this review. First of all I‚Äôm happy that Anthony proceeds to stick with his honest opinions even after 10 years of pestering. And second this review truly dives deep into what made anthony give the album a 6/10, for the original review came off vague, unorganized and understates the negatives while overstating the positives making the final score seem off to others. Great job, Anthony!
I agree with Melon
For a long time this was one of my favorite albums of all time, and one of my two favorite hip hop albums along with Good Kid, MAAD City. I still get Gorgeous and Hell of a Life stuck in my head from time to time. But in light of the absolute train wreck Kanye has become as a person, it makes me a bit uncomfortable now, like we as a society enabled him by making this one of the most celebrated albums of the decade. I know it&#39;s not very rational, since worse musicians have also been similarly enabled, but it was enough to keep the album off my most recent Top 10 list. I&#39;d still give it at least a 7 or 8, though.
When are you re-reviewing the album next?
Just remember, that we asked for this...
This video has Finn Wolfhard flipping off the camera energy
the &quot;s&quot; sound at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=573">9:33</a> &quot;austin powerS&quot; was edited in lol
melon laughs like an anime villain
Disliked.
Coming from someone who doesn‚Äôt even like Kanye West very much, this record is at the very least a strong 7 to a light 8.
How Is Ye An 8?
dude anthony why dont u review some of eminems classic material man,i really want to know what u feel about sslp,mmlp,tes...Fuck his newer ,latest 2 albums atleast his older more solid works,cant u review them dawg?
I‚Äôm going back to sleep
This next explanation is dedicated to the Mallory Bros, specially Terrance who beautifully explained why ‚ÄúRunaway‚Äù is great.<br><br>The lyrics sound corny at points and just nonsensical if you want to call it like that, but that is what Kanye is trying to say. Everything he says, gets misinterpreted by the public, and even when he is being serious and expressing his opinions, Kanye detractors find a way to point out only the bad things. Kanye even agrees that sometimes he just explodes and say (or do) some random shit that looked immature in the long run.<br><br>And thats why he wants a toast for douchebags like him, feeling ashamed for his actions.<br>This is the part of the song where you can hear what hes rapping and its dedicated to the people who actually pays attention to his words. <br><br>At the very end, when his voice gets wrapped up with the autotune and his words fade away to the point where we cant understand him, Kanye‚Äôs critics will still find something bad about it: ‚Äúyou cant even understand what hes saying‚Äù ‚Äúthis autotune crap doesnt make sense‚Äù ‚Äúit made the song too long‚Äù. But if you hear closely, the melody its still the same... because hes reciting the exact same lyrics, but now we are listening from the ‚Äúdetractors‚Äù point of view that just wants reasons to hate on him, not wanting to see that even this egotistical Kanye figure can say sorry and feel ashamed for his wild actions
You crazy for this one Rick
wow
Is this a remastered or a remake?
MBDTF: Melon&#39;s Back Doing This Fuckery
It‚Äôs like watching the same video twice
This video is basically a remastered hd version with enhanced graphics and teeth
I demand a re-re-review
Kanye still does speak up for oppressed people, he just does it more in interviews rather than the music. He‚Äôs still fighting to make the world better, he‚Äôs just doing it in a different way. Arguably a more meaningful way now since he‚Äôs less talk more action
<b>Boos from the crowd get louder</b>
The fact that melon talked about this record 10 years after it was released shows both his reluctance to do a redux of this review and how incessant the whining of his fans is
CAL COUNTER 2020<br><br>Cal Chuchesta did not make an appearance in this video<br><br>Cal has appeared in 0% of Anthony‚Äôs videos this year
This is Fantano&#39;s Bottomless Pit, a work dedicated to his fans that can be interpreted as a thank you and a fuck you, lovely.
BUDLIGHT! lmao
Uh oh woah
Imagine being this wrong TWICE!!
first 12 ever
THE DAY HAS FINALLY COME
Hell of a Life is about masturbation not sex, I feel like it&#39;s supposed to be sad and uncomfortable. More about Kanye&#39;s porn addiction than sex addiction
don‚Äôt care didn‚Äôt ask plus you‚Äôre white
Alright, since you want to talk about why you dislike classic albums, when is the Dark Side of the Moon review coming out?
how he bouta disrespect ChyHi like that
He made this review just to piss off the Kanye stans lmao
you should review Hisscivilization by Jupiter Apple
wonder which cover variant the 2030 redux redux review is gonna use
How&#39;s the divorce going Melon? Heard you lost full custody of the kids.
You&#39;re still wrong.
you are officially brain dead sorry
Is this album is a 6 my life is a 0.
I wish he just resaid verbatim whatever he did in his original review
6 6 6 6 6
He even dropped it down slightly
Billy Joel please....
you literally rated it the same thing. the Kanye stans are gonna be so mad lmao
scroll back up
So are we making this the most disliked video on his channel? Cause this sure as fuck deserves it.
Legend
Uh Nicki&#39;s &quot;Monster&quot; verse is literally one of the best verses of the whole decade what are you going on about
Jokes on you, now you gotta re-review it again melon.
Damn, I never thought I&#39;d live to see the day.
I‚Äôm starting to believe you are a music reviewer that doesn‚Äôt like music
Does this mean I can have the vinyl that one dude sent you?
this is easily the best think melon could do for 2 million<br><br><br><br>thankyou wallet salesman üëèüëè
i hate you anthony i really do
Lil Pump and Lil Yatchy got higher ratings than this masterpiece....... let that sink in.
Man gave The Origin of My Depression an 8 and this a 6.... I know an opinion is an opinion but this opinion is objectively wrong.
My beautiful dark twisted melon
Mans has done it
You&#39;re my melon you&#39;re my vegan<br>You&#39;re my trans you&#39;re my sition<br>You&#39;re my Anthony you&#39;re my Fantano<br>You&#39;re my strong 5 you&#39;re my light 6
The melon has saw his shadow, 10 more years of MBDTF memes. <br>Is this really what you wanted fantano?? We was really gonna finally retire this meme
This has been probably one of the longest review of needle drop that I sat down and watched. I loved the album, and still love it after hearing fantano&#39;s opinion about it, but I also gotta say he does raise good points. Thinking back, does that voice guitar idea grow old very fast? Yes. Does Reakwon&#39;s verse tie barely to the otherwise very cohesive song? Yes. But I suppose there are too many other redeeming qualities about this record that when one does not think of it critically, it&#39;s easy to focus just on how great it is.
...
How about you review it again
&quot;Anal and gangbang...That&#39;s pretty vanilla&quot;<br><br><br>- Anthony Fanatno (2020)
Wow he gave it a 6 again.<br><br><br><br><br>DAMN.
That Rick Ross verse might be top 10 features of the last decade
Agree on monster tho, I still don&#39;t feel it.
Are you kidding me with saying CyHi had the weakest verse on so appalled??? you gotta be joking smh
He gave it a 2014FHD/10
Well if this is a 6 then Jesus is King must be a zero
You don&#39;t like runaway because you&#39;re not a douchebag
If you actually like runaway you deserve to be made fun of
How are we just going to ignore that this guy said that he changed his opinion on DAMN. and he thinks that it is worse than a 7
Anyway i admire that you have the balls to put the same score that you put 10 years ago knowing that the people won&#39;t react well
Another 22 mins of life wasted...
Remember this is his opinion and even though his opinion‚Äôs quality is enough to damn all of humanity to the 9th ring of hell, we should respect it.
people can&#39;t understand it&#39;s a <b>WACK</b> album <br>possibly one of the worst album made by kanye
So basically, you think that Lil Pump‚Äôs mixtape is better than Kanye West‚Äôs My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy?<br><br><br><br><br><br>Foh
6/10? <br><b>That ain‚Äôt Christ like</b>
man really made a 22 minute video to give the same score I&#39;m sick
Melon, when are you going to do a My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy redux review?
Review The Cure‚Äôs 1989 masterpiece ‚ÄúDisintegration‚Äù
The Runaway outro is the best moment of the humanity.
You‚Äôre lucky Cal is overseas right now
THIS IS APART OF CLASSICS WEEK SO THIS RECORD IS A CLASSIC/10
First (hour)
Kanye: CAN WE GET MUCH HIGHER (than a 6)?<br><br>Melon Man: NO
i gagged when he said the outtro on runaway was bad
I disagree.<br><br>It‚Äôs a 5/9
Can&#39;t wait for another light 6 on 2030
I can&#39;t believe you gave into the meme. Disliked.
So apparently this melon man is supposed to preach to us?
Bernie Sanders has taken wayyyyyyy more than Trump
2019 ain‚Äôt lookin that bad
I liked the video but you‚Äôre a dick
When you said runaway played at your grandfathers funeral I had no idea I‚Äôm so sorry melon
Do &#39;I Hate Mars Bars&#39;.
Not gonna lie you had me in the first half
If this album is a 6 then To Be Kind is a 3.
Memes aside, props for sticking to his guns on this, despite the decade-long backlash. 2 million subscribers well deservedüëå
Now pls do acid rap
I want him to review it again so we have a trilogy
SIXTHONY OUT OF TANO
What I can say is that you articulated your points a lot better in this video compared to the original review.
I get it, you didn‚Äôt like the album, but did you had to cover every song on the album replacing the lyrics with ‚Äúyummy yummy‚Äù?
My Boy Down To Fuck
Is his shirt blue or gold? üßê
I‚Äôm surprised cause he did a redux but didn‚Äôt change his score for this album. But I knew that he wasn‚Äôt gonna get higher than a 6 because the yellow shirt is absent :)
10 outta 10.<br>Review it again.
HOLY SHIT IVE NEVER CLICKED SO FAST LETS GO BABY
LMAO
Well when you put it that way I guess it is a 6...
He did it AGAIN
Lil Pump got a 7. Never forget .
This is cutthroat Anthony why did you need to go in like this.
Will u<br>Redux<br>Review<br>Mah Mixtape
I thought this was a classic review ü§î
I don&#39;t know why hearing this man call my favorite album a light 6 hurts so much, but it does. Just give it a 7 man. It&#39;s a great album!
you got me hyped for another 6?!?!?
üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
Wow. All the memes for this? That‚Äôs so disappointing.
Y&#39;all really need to accept that All of the lights, Hell of a life &amp; Blame game are really weak tracks. That lets us with 10 track, 1 of them being just an interlude &amp; another one being the outro &quot;Who will survive in America&quot;, if only 8 tracks of MBDTF(An album consisting of 13 tracks) are worth listening to, Y&#39;all think Melon would give this album more than a 6?
This guy gave ‚ÄúYe‚Äù a better score than MBDTF ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢
Review it the third time with the same score, now youre saying Kanye is the devil
Bruh i was hoping for a classic/10 cause even if you don‚Äôt like it personally it‚Äôs kinda hard to say it‚Äôs not a modern classic.
Oh man, Hell of a life was my favorite track on the project....unsubscribed.
things were going so well in the beginning of this video and just spiraleddddd
KTT punching the air rn üíÄüíÄ
Yoooooooooooooooooooooo
There‚Äôs <i>salt</i> in these here hills, boys, there‚Äôs <i>salt</i> to be mined, <b>YEEEEEHAW!</b>
Bruh just listen to College Dropout if you want over an hour of top notch rapping and extravagant beats. The skits are more entertaining too
I don‚Äôt wanna hear another word out of you melin
I‚Äôm laughing
He just said the rick Ross feature was subpar F
Great review as always Mr. Fantano. I think you have a great outlook on this album. Fuck you, unsubbed.
I have such a weird conflicted feeling because I feel like a lot of your points are fair yet at the same time I LOVE this album. Not sure how that works.
Classic/10 nice review melon looking forward to more of classic week
Huh. The review makes me want to listen to the album after a long time sleeping on it. Outside of ‚ÄúPower‚Äù, initially most tracks didn‚Äôt really grab my attention.
My mans really gave it a 6 again, respect
I just want to let you know Melon I hate you very much.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=990">16:30</a> It sounds like Jerry Seinfeld roasting Kanye
Okay but the link in the description goes to the POWER music video
This fuckin guy I swear... still liked the vid tho but couldn&#39;t unjust give us a 7, damn.
Blasphemous
I give this review a light to medium 2, you had your chance to redeem yourself melon man and you blew it ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è it‚Äôs ok tho 2030 you can give it the score it truly deserves üëçüèª
so melon still thinks Lil Pump self titled and Lil Boat are better than this album
I‚Äôm unsubscribing
He will review it in 2030 and give it a 6 again so is going to be kanyes most satanic √°lbum
of all your videos this is definitely one of them
man he doesn&#39;t like runaway? buddy
This is even worse lol
I‚Äôm not even like a HUGE fan of this guy but I know of the legend of ‚ÄúMy beautiful dark twisted fantasy‚Äù on his channel. And even after all this time he still gives it a 6. Absolute fucking mad man
fuck you
I heard he bought coke with my money, that ain‚Äôt right girl, you getting blackmailed for that white girl
Melon, can you now re-review all the Weeknd albums and DAMN. by Kendrick Lamar
Sorry melon, but I disliked because in the middle of the review you called him the ‚Äúblack Seth Everman‚Äù.
Clout chasing lol, it&#39;s sad, it&#39;s disappointing<br><br><br>and I hate Kanye guts
Hot take: this dude a clown
i thought it was classics week still
I mean he&#39;s literally selling 6/10 merch, why would he score it higher now.
I wanna sit this man down and tell him how disappointed I am
Lmao
Hmmmm sorry melon but you failed the test. Try again in 2030
i knew he would give it a 6 again. I love this guy.
I don‚Äôt know if I should like it because he re-reviewed it or dislike it because he gave it a 6 again
I certainly like this record more than you but I don‚Äôt have a logical defense for the lyrics on Runaway and the Chris Rock bit on Blame Game and I never have.
The original review was a Light to Decent 6, and now he gave it a Strong 5 to a Light 6, so he actually lowered the score
You need to fucking be trolling rn wtf is wrong with you
Would&#39;ve been a 10 if unkle Adams had a feature
Why did everyone want a re-review of this album again?
Same sh*t different decade
its actually happening.
Anfony faantabo just literally started going for songs he didn‚Äôt go for the first  time what the fuck
Very cringe L üëç
Had to take a double take on this video to make sure it was in my subscriptions and not my recommended.
HOW DO YOU DISLIKE LOST IN THE WORLD
ANOTHER 6. HOW? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
P I N K  F L O Y D  W O R S T  T O  B E S T
When u gonna review that new Roblox that just dropped?   Its bananas...
FUCK
This is the last straw melon
king
Lol goddammit
ngl my heart dropped when melon-head said &quot;overrated&quot; :(
and here is my second time dislike Melon
Georgethony Bushtano here and I still don‚Äôt care for My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy
We get it. Logic doesn‚Äôt like the album. But what do you think, Anthony?
Guys, just take a moment to realize that all those years using or reading thousands of times the meme &quot;review it again&quot; leads to this very video.
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahajajahahahahahajahahahahahahahahahaja <br><br><br><br><br>No.
Dude doesn&#39;t understand that Runaway is a metaphor, where the girl he&#39;s telling to runaway is fame and glory that he&#39;s lost after 808&#39;s and the T-Swift incident
Fuck Koonye West
I like how ambiguous melon was being at the beginning ab the record but we ALL knew it was going to get a 6 again
2010 : light to decent 6<br>2020 : strong 5 to light 6<br>Premeditated murder
From a &quot;light to decent 6&quot; to a &quot;strong 5 to light 6&quot;? I&#39;m calling it, in 10 years it&#39;s gonna be a &quot;decent to strong 5&quot;.
Eh no matter what the melon says it&#39;s still my favorite album
No shit nooooo shit, this video is going to blow up HARD
Devil in a New Dress is the best Kanye song ever
You just made this worse
Re-re-review MBDTF
And I always find yea I always find somethin wrong
wrong answer anthony. review it again
Ok, now I have to wait 3 years for a Yeezus redux review.
&quot;Where&#39;d you learn to treat an album like this?&quot;<br><br><br>&quot;Melon taught me&quot;
this kinda shows how much better he&#39;s gotten at reviewing though, he&#39;s way more clear in this review than he was in his original.
Next one do Pink Floyd! (DSOYM on why you think it&#39;s overrated, Animals on why it&#39;s your favourite Pink Floyd album)
‚ÄúTrivialize domestic abuse scandals? Obedient sex robot??‚Äù Put the feminist views away melon. This is His fantasy.
It‚Äôs a 9 and you know it
Interesting way of telling us to unsubscribe
To be fair I do agree with you on quite a few things you said, however I don‚Äôt think the album is ‚Äòoverrated‚Äô. I feel like there are too many songs you like aspects of or like to regive it a 6? Runaway and So Appalled are the two best tracks in my opinion, very closely followed by Gorgeous, Dark Fantasy and All of the Lights. Such a good album <br><br>P.S. please review Because the Internet again, it didn‚Äôt get the recognition it deserved
LMAOOOO
Now do a MBDTF classic review
You said this was his second best album.. you make no sense
in the words of stormzy, im not mad, just disappointed.
kids see ghosts &gt; college dropout &gt; yeezus &gt; late registration &gt; life of pablo &gt; my beautiful dark twisted fantasy &gt; ye &gt; jesus is king &gt; 808s and heartbreaks
u don‚Äôt believe that
So when you said you respected it‚Äôs place as one of the best albums of the decade, you meant you think it‚Äôs way overrated..
oh fuck 6 again
At least the review is more explanatory and detailed than the previous one.
ITS HAPPENING, EVERYBODY STAY CALM
L. L. L. LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
Next: redux review Yeezus
Part of the chaotic cringe typical Kanye raw lines are what make the album. Its raw. Keeps you on edge. Those Nicki vocal inflections, the RZA feature. All the weird stuff. It was supposed to be there. Not meant to be refined. It&#39;s a dark twisted fantasy. A look into someones unfiltered fantasy with all the flaws of a human and their perverted desires
As Cole from Dissect pointed out, Kanye&#39;s Sleepy Hollow line also refers to a neighborhood he grew up near. So he &quot;awoke from his Dark Fantasy&quot; back in Chicago. The verse was a dream.
fantanoK
Emperor Fantano: Execute order 66
A 10 OUT OF 10, REVIEW IT AGAIN!!!
melon: im feeling a light 6<br><br>everyone expecting an above 8 rating:<br><b>visible anger</b>
TOP TEN ANIME ARCS THAN TURNED OUT TO BE GROTESQUE (REDUX)
If every song on this album was three minutes shorter it would be a 10
Congrats for getting 2 million subs, man!
The mad melon did it
Thank you for your opinion.
bruh
If MBDTF review 1 was the 911 of reviews <br>MBDTF review 2 is the Iraq war
melon, eat a sack of poop! Fantasy a 10!
NO WAY. FLANNEL. 2020. MBDTF. THIS CRAZY.
FINALLY
nice ADR on &quot;powers&quot;
this is a fucking war crime
I appreciate this redux. I find myself agreeing with your reasons for disliking a lot of the stuff that I love. For example, All Of The Lights <b>is</b> a mess on all fronts but I just push that all to the side and strain my ears to hear all the gorgeous horn and vocal arrangements. I do wish those drums were quieter, I do wish the lyrics weren&#39;t about some guy who slapped his girl &#39;cause Michael Jackson died, yet somehow I still love it. If melon hates it for those reasons, I completely understand and actually agree intellectually, just not emotionally. He has every right to give this album a six, it&#39;s only rated as high as it is for the Production Porn of it all, and if that&#39;s not your thing, this album won&#39;t rank highly for you.
He gave it a 10 right?
my beautiful dark twisted 6/10
Which Aphex Twin track is sampled on MBDTF??
I appreciate you reviewing this but you didn‚Äôt have to go off in the middle of the review talking about how thicc my dad is. Kinda rude and cringe, melon.
EIGHT OUT OF TEN. PERIOD.
&quot;All Kanye talks about on Hell of a Life is gangbangs and oral sex.&quot;<br>&quot;She wanna roleplay till I roll over&quot; going over Fantano&#39;s head
Now for the 3 million special, do another redux review for this album so we complete the 666 trifecta Melon.
can we get a red light redux now?
Review it again 10 outta 10, Review it again 10 outta 10 üëè
Whaaat?? Nicki‚Äôs verse is epic bro
Turn that 6 upside down it&#39;s a 9 now.
This guy also gave cancer 4 Cure a 7 and electricity is on our side a 5
Can you review r√© from Caf√© Tacvba
imagine rereviewing an album almost a decade later just to give it the exact same score lmao, let alone your most infamous original album review. ily melon but this is just pointless clout chasing here.
Thank you for re-reviewing this album in a much more clear and eloquent way. Your original review was kinda confusing and not that clear, so thank you for going track by track and giving us a better picture.<br><br>That being said, I think something that has held you back from liking this album (and maybe a couple others), is that I don‚Äôt think you don‚Äôt consider camp enough when you‚Äôre reviewing things. I completely agree that MBDTF is a mess, but that‚Äôs why I love it so much. It‚Äôs so repetitive, overblown, corny, blunt, crude, and egotistical that it turns into a ‚Äúbeautiful dark twisted fantasy‚Äù of music. It‚Äôs almost like he took all the criticisms that people give him and purposefully made the album to anger all those people.
he did it again.
Talk about the album,...don&#39;t sing....
As long as Runaway gets respected, I&#39;ll take whatever.<br><br>EDIT: No...
melon, eat a sack of poop!
Thank you so much for finally re-reviewing MBDTF, and giving us a lot more insight on your opinion on this album, Anthony.<br><br>Unsubscribed.
Saala gandu
I look forward to the re-review of TPAB
I can respect (or at the very least, ignore) your gripes with the lyrics or concept of this album.<br><br><br><br><br>But, claiming that the vocoder solo at the end of runaway &quot;sounds terrible&quot;, &quot;wears out its welcome&quot;, and &quot;isn&#39;t interesting for half of its runtime&quot; - no, bro. Just no.
lmaoo i love the fact that you gave it a 6 again tbh üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Watch this get twice as many dislikes üòÇ
Thank you Anthony for extending Classics Week
Lets agree: this album is part of classics week.
I‚Äôm not even a Kanye fan but like this is so rad that he did a redux review
üí™üèº‚ù§Ô∏è
The same guy who gave MBDTF a 6 is giving MBDTF a 6
But you think swans make good music fucking idiot
Not a Pink Floyd worst to best.
hey a 6/6 ain&#39;t that bad
Idk Anthony I still love this album idk where you&#39;re coming from with this
Is this just the original review remastered??
I wish he did a shot by shot recreation of the original review
My problem with the score is that he sounds like he likes it and then goes ‚Äúbut I don‚Äôt like hearing him talk about himself. 6/10‚Äù
So you hated the Nicki verse and the Cyhi verse. Two of the best breakout verses ever considered by fans. Wild.
Everybody unsubscribe so we can have melon re-review this when he hits 2 mil again
I feel like there‚Äôs some sort of ‚Äúfirst word of every sentence‚Äù prank going on here but I‚Äôm too lazy to check
Wtf melon :-(
kinda weird that you switched up how you grade albums just for this review, but i won‚Äôt complain about the 6/6...<br><br>a perfect score for a perfect album.
I‚Äôm with you on this being overrated. Not so much on your Runaway and All Of The Lights takes
Will this review be even more divisive than the original? <br><br><br><br><br>Probably. With that said I do get more why Anthony feels what he feels. Besides it isn‚Äôt the worst reviewed Kanye album of the decade from Anthony so that‚Äôs a positive.
Just dislike and move on.
MISERY, MISERY, MISERY, THAT&#39;S WHAT YOU&#39;VE CHOSEN.<br>I OFFERED YOU FRIENDSHIP AND YOU SPAT IN MY FACE
This isn‚Äôt even his best meme but we still support our king
Melon should listen to Terrence Mallory talk about Runaway. It‚Äôd at least give him a new outlook at the choices made on the track
Somebody call Gallagher, we&#39;ve got a melon to smash
10 OUT OF 10. REVIEW IT AGAIN. 10 OUT OF 10. REVIEW IT AGAIN.
Man I think the album is overrated but it‚Äôs not a fuckin SIX dude
LMFAOOO
do you need a borrow a rag to remove the clown makeup anthony :(
Jokes aside, I really disagree with a lot of your thoughts. You take many songs for their surface meaning, and fail to see the album through the correct lens, which is of a man who is coming to grips with his vices, lost in the world, seeking redemption. The album has a narrative, yet your analysis makes it seem like a collection of songs that Kanye made, liked, and threw together in sonically pleasing order. Also Runaway outro slander will not be tolerated, 3 minutes of pure emotion.<br><br><br>Light to Decent 3/10
6/10 REVIEW IT AGAIN
ok here&#39;s the thing about the solo at the end of runaway. To me it&#39;s beautiful because it&#39;s like a guitar solo combined with how the human voice is able to express emotions through melodies at such an insane level of intensity that I feel no instrument can. The runtime it takes is perfect to me cause it gets more and more emotionally intense until the very end
you need to runaway melon
&quot;Anthony Fantano, (hates) Kanye West, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (will be no more than a low 6), forever.&quot;
Here is my redux dislike
Anthony re-reviewing this album as a part of his classic reviews is his beautiful dark twisted fantasy.
bruh
Rereview my beautiful dark twisted fantasy
I thought history was gonna change
This review was a bit late, almost had to form my own opinion
REDUX DISLIKE
All right. When we getting a Kamikaze redux???
He&#39;s right tho
Nice re-review but you didn&#39;t have to spend the first 2 minutes silently toasting to yourself.
wowowowowowow ok
This is still better then the money storeü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Youre overrated
He did it! He actually did it!
Take this L
ooooooo
aight thats it anthony, im pullin up to yo crib
Fuck you, amirite bois???
Damn I was putting the pussy in a sarcophagus but Melon uploaded
Anyone else freak out when he started &quot;Im feeling a strong 5 to....&quot;
The kardashian <b>CLAN</b>
Don‚Äôt you dare shit on GORGEOUS
OH MY GOD THE SON OF A BITCH DID IT
I think the life of Pablo is Kanye‚Äôs best album
Lmfao
Somehow I always knew this is what he would say.... AGAIN
First review: light to decent 6<br>Redux review: strong 5 to a light 6
How is this a 6?
Anyone else on mobile hate the new comment format?
lmaoooooooo the dislikes already there!
WHATS THIS???? UH UHMMM UH WHATS THIS
3 months and 22 days early, Anthony
10/10 review it again
I&#39;m very glad you made this review, as there is now an adequate explanation for why you gave it a 6 which the original review lacked.
Let‚Äôs wait for TPAB redux, it will be a 20/10
6thony 6tano
Y&#39;all been waiting  for him to review it again just   for him to give it a 6 again üòÇüòÇüòÇüò≠
I applaud you for not becoming a sheep. The reality is this album just isn‚Äôt that good. Just because an album is sonically appealing doesn‚Äôt make it good. The drop off in lyricism and versatility from graduation to this is very extreme
How many of you unsubcribed because of this?
Keep re-reviewing this until you give it a higher score
idk what ur talking about. the mixing is awful on the remaster is awful. the only good thing out of this album was monster. i&#39;m being completely honest.
Melon: and this is my review ~in e minor~
This is my real first time being disappointed in a review by the thick melon. <br><br><br><br><br><br><b>I had you in the first half didn&#39;t I?</b>
disliked! thanks for the re-review, anthony!
Y&#39;all really waited an entire decade for this?
You&#39;re definitely going to hell now
Your Beautiful Dark Twisted Rate
So many people saying he&#39;s wrong like he&#39;s not allowed to have his own opinion. Y&#39;all just like it more than he did, good for you.
&quot;Jay-Zs lyricism is on point on monster&quot; <br>Oh no no no no no no no
Thank heavens my melon 6 mbdtf shirt isn&#39;t obsolete
hot take: he‚Äôs never listened to the album
<b>Fantano</b> *gets bored listening to a 6 min kanye song * 6/10<br><b>Also Fantano:</b> *listens to swans play one chord for 35 mins * 10/10
Melon you know what I think you&#39;re a 6/10 too
The mad lad finally did it...
IS IT A 6?
Anthony: <b>gives MBDTF a six</b><br>Me: re-review it<br>Anthony: <b>gives it another six</b><br>Me: re-review it again
Don‚Äôt come for All of the Lights
That‚Äôs great and all, but did you really have to reupload your old video melon?
I kinda agree with Anthony, this album isn‚Äôt a 10, I like most of the songs on here but most of them drag on for too long
This nigga gave a death grips album 10/10. Ion wanna hear shit lol
THE MADMELON !!!!!!!! HE DID IT AGAIN !!! THE MADMAN !!!
Great video Anthony!  unsubbed.
The fact that he only talked about devil in a new dress for a quarter of the time of everything else is super disappointing, easily one of Kanye‚Äôs best songs of all time and super unappreciated
He finally did it
Oh my God I am giddy
Who else really thought he was gonna give it a CLASSIC
Now do a redux review of Angelic 2 the Core and give it an 11/10
Me: I bet its still a 6<br><br>Roughly 22 minutes later: Why didn&#39;t I just check the description?
Since the original review got 30k dislikes I&#39;m certain we can make this Redux get 40k Redux dislikes
Literally 10 seconds before he gives the score Shawn Cee tweets that you gave it a 6 and spoiled it for me. I can‚Äôt stand niggas
Thumbs down
die lit redux next ?????
This man melon really rereviewed MBDTF to give it a 6 again that is so funny Anthony you&#39;re forever goated ü§£ü§£ü§£
my mans is tripping
Holy shit my prediction was right
Review it again
<b>NATION.</b>
he actually gave it a worse score this time technically. last time it was a light to decent 6. This time, a strong 5 to light 6. wow melon wow
Jesus fucking Christ what did I just experience
This isn&#39;t the calligraphy video I wanted, you GMO-infested melon.
I was gonna type a rude response but it&#39;s okay to have your own opinion, even when it&#39;s wrong.
<b>DAMN.</b>
He gave it a lower score, but he also gave a far more detailed review than the original. Respect
out of curiosity, are you going to review the 2 live albums King Gizzard just put on Bandcamp?
<b>BOAH, HE BOUTSA DO IT!</b>
Hopefully you expire you melon
i&#39;m gonna force feed you meat MELON BOY
Light 6 this year<br>Decent 6 ten years ago.<br><br>Bruhhhhhh... how?
This hurt. Ever so slightly.
Anthony Fantano is the new 6 God.
Anthony&#39;s opinion is starting to mean nothing to me.
Let‚Äôs argue: both of the reviews were for clout
Is this what you all wanted?
HE FINALLYDID IT
Omg an album with theme and slight cohesion with some live instruments?! Literally the greatest piece of music ever-hip hop fans
Honestly the fact that you don‚Äôt like runaway actually discredits everything you‚Äôve ever said about music
This was the most punk shit Anthony has ever done.
Kanye: &quot;Penitentiary chances, the devil dances and eventually answers to the call of Autumn all of them fallin&#39; for the love of ballin&#39; got caught with thirty rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin&quot;<br>Fantano: Light 6<br><br><br>Kanye: &quot;She said I&#39;m in the wrong hole I said I&#39;m lost&quot;<br>Fantano: 10/10
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck
I don‚Äôt know Anthony. I play football, and the #1 song that hypes me up everytime before a game its All Of The Lights. One of my favorite Kanye songs ever, its just so epic, i don‚Äôt care about its technical flaws
I‚Äôm not gonna lie. My penis got a little wet after seeing this
As much as I like the memes I would like to see some actual discussion regarding his critiques sometimes
It&#39;s cool to see Anthony stick to his guns after all these years, Idk if I would keep watching this channel if he suddenly stopped being a dumbass.
Kanye is a bad rapper
why does this feel beyond HD
I‚Äôll always find something wrong...
This is dumb af
y&#39;all crying Melon gave it a 6 twice I mean idk what to tell you its a 6 and that&#39;s just what it is
Too late melon boy. I already formed my opinion on this thing 10 years ago. Better luck next time slowpoke!
You listened to Dissect didn‚Äôt you?
did you guys really think he‚Äôd change his mind lmfao. always agreed with this review, this album is really nothing special, although it it real good
Review it again
bold man. rated it a 6 again. my respect for you is a lot man lmao
You forgot to rate it classic/10
wHat chu said
&quot;solid features&quot; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=1299">21:39</a>
why
‚ÄúPut the pussy in the sarcophagus. Just do it ‚Äú -Anthony Fantano
Wait wtf did he just give MBDTF a 6? My father will hear about this
go fuck yourself
dislike
You do make some good points in this video. <br>Unsubscribed.
To be honest I think his pride won&#39;t let him realize he probably made a mistake, so he&#39;s keeping the score
10/10 review it again
this video is what started ww3
Fuck you anthony
Turn one of those two 6&#39;s upside down, its now a 69. Nice
This is a good review
HE CANT KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH IT!!!!!!!
Melon is just here to collect. Making the same vid twice.
uh oh uh oh uh oh uh oh uh oh uh oh uh oh uh oh uh oh uh o h u h o h u h o h u h o h u h o h u h o h u h o h u h o h
6 squared is 64 + 5 = 69<br><br><b>Ray J has entered the chat</b>
I mean, were you guys really expecting any other score?
goddamn it
I‚Äôm getting ptsd
My friends and I always thought the line out of All of the Lights where he mentions meeting up at Borders was so fucking hilarious and specific, like, &quot;Wow Kanye, Borders, damn.&quot; Lmao
poop
not like this...
PABLO IS BETTER PABLO IS BETTER PABLO IS BETTER PABLO IS BETTER
Really enjoyed this one, but you didn‚Äôt have to talk about how much better Jesus is king is the whole time.
Re review it again
BRUH
Guys, it&#39;s okay. He&#39;s just giving it a 6 so his MBDTF 6 shirts can sell
Anthony: New year new me!<br>Also Anthony: <b>Light 6</b>
God damn melon ouch
Alright boys we got em<br><br>Now let‚Äôs meme him into re-reviewing Life of Pablo so it gets the 10 it deserves
So you gave MBDTF a 6 but you gave MBDTF a 6?<br>Imagine if Anthony still around by 2030 and does another redux review and gives it a 6 or a 5 lol
Anthony disliking Nikki &amp; CyHi‚Äôs verses might be the biggest crime of this review.
What does the blue flannel represent?
I&#39;m fine with the Chris Rock skit slander or the slander of the Gorgeous beat, but don&#39;t disrespect Nicki&#39;s verse on Monster like that.
I‚Äôm glad he re reviewed it because his reviewing style changed since 2010. And he covered every song. I can see better why he doesn‚Äôt fuck with it
How can someone listen to runaway and not like it. I legitimately can‚Äôt wrap my head around that concept
It&#39;s ok anthony you can do another review anytime.
Melon really had the audacity to make us look like fools and make us think that he‚Äôs come to his senses
Its at least an 8 bruh come on melon
The fuck did you guys expect
Alright internet, do your thing.. again.
Everyone<br>The time has come<br>He‚Äôll finally give it a 10<br><br><br><br><br>wait
2020 best year ever
Fucking finally I can finally love this albu- oh uh wait nevermind
Anthony Fantano.....<br><br><br><br><br>You just dont get it do you?
I&#39;m expecting a 10
2 mil sub face reveal??
You only gave it a 6 because you gave it a 6.
watched the whole review thinking he&#39;s gonna change his mind. starts talkin a lil shit. &quot;ok&quot; keeps talkin shit. &quot;wait...&quot; still gives the album a 6/10. &quot;y must u do this to me&quot;
you gave mbdtf a 6/10<br>but you also gave mbdtf a 6/10<br>????
Hahahahaha hahahahhahaha
Anyone else getting deja vu?
lmao
Wait what is this real
lmaoooooo Melon you crazy this one
I don‚Äôt agree and I don‚Äôt have to
everyone dislike the video
imagine being wrong twice
Your brain no work proper
Why did he skip devil in a new dress? Low key, the best track on the album
i respect you so hard for sticking to your guns
Lol‚Äôd a lot more than I thought I would. Good job melon. 6/10
I saw a blue flannel and thought melon man came to his sense......I was wrong
Remember this is the same guy who gave my beautiful dark twisted fantasy a 6
He doesnt like Runaway? 3 strikes and your out.
u made another video to shit on this masterpiece
D U D E S
I mean yeah cool but you were supposed to like it more this time
just because kanye turned into a born-again christian doesn‚Äôt mean that you should give the album a score of 6 to represent your alliance to satan
he gave it a worse score this time lol, holy shit
HOW MANY TIMES DO WE HAVE TO TEACH YOU THIS LESSON OLD MAN
You should take the score out of the description. Actually make us listen to it this time
Even though you gave it the same score this was a MUCH better review than the original. Great job, Melon.
Terrible re-review melon, do it again.
How dare you do us like this Melon
The sad thing is all the people who base their own opinions off of his are now gonna never appreciate the beauty of this album.
This. Fucking. Guy.
This is the most awaited video of all time
Well, third time&#39;s the charm<br><br>REVIEW IT AGAIN <br>REVIEW IT AGAIN
DAMN. REDUX REVIEW<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>7/10
No
oh well, maybe the third time will be the charm
OH MY GOD I LOVE THIS!!!
Melon in a blue shirt&gt;devil in a new dress.<br><br>SYKE, you suck melon!
What a well thought out revisit of this album. You stated your points very well and I‚Äôm happy you revisited the album and gave it another listen and I‚Äôm proud to see how far you‚Äôve come since your initial review. <b>dislike</b>
sorry melon i had to dislike
God dammit not this shit AGAIN antny
Anthony reviewed MBDTF on classics week. So it‚Äôs at the very least a 9/10 confirmed
EL MOMENTO M√ÅS ESPERADO POR TODA LATINOAM√âRICA UNIDA
So this album has aged worse over time for you. SMH
MANS HAS SPOKEN
LOL, ya boy&#39;s doubling down.
You fucking troll.
Nah can&#39;t agree with nicki and ross&#39; verses being anything but amazing, but at least you&#39;re sticking to your opinion. Don&#39;t understand how anyone could say Ye or Pablo are better albums lol
I knew it was going to be this. And I‚Äôm happy about it
I‚Äôm finna RE-DEUX this dislike
I like this review more than the original because you gave a more in depth reason on why you didn‚Äôt like the album. Even if I like MBDTF, this was still a great review.
HAHAHAHAHAHAH
Can&#39;t wait for the back to back lil pump and damn reviews so we can get those 7&#39;s again
Glad to see it‚Äôs still the same score
While I disagree with a lot of this, I am glad you made this video. You did a better job explaining your reasoning this time. I&#39;ll take a well-argued and thorough 6 over any other 6.
Be careful what you wish for...
Please review my beautiful dark twisted fantasy a third time this is terrible please you communist melon boy
So when pusha t talks openly about how he is going to groom young girls it&#39;s fine but if kanye talks about domestic abuse it&#39;s problematic??
Went from a decent 6 to a light 6 üò≥
So you gave MBDTF a 6 but MBDTF A 6??
The melon must be destroyed...
this review is more dark and twisted than the album itself
Why has noone made a compilation of him singing songs from albums he‚Äôs reviewing ü§îü§î
I respect that he stuck to his opinion, he could have easily given this a higher score just to please everybody<br><br><br><br><br><br>Unsubscribed
Ok
<b>Still waiting for reduxx review of SB2H</b><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Guess we gotta wait til 3 mil subs.
What I got out of this review: <br>Kanye comes on hot and ready like a pizza. He finishes sloppy, rolled over covered in jizz and cocaine
Complains about feature bars with no mention of goblins and ghouls
Where‚Äôs that damn Redux review now
Please Anthony, just start enjoying music
Fuck you mealon
I really couldnt agree more...the most overated fucking album ever. I in the camp of this being a 2
Since this is the 2 Million subscriber special, we should unsubscribe until he hits 1.99 Million, then re-subscribe so he has to remake this video.<br><br>You will not get away with this Melon!
So what&#39;s changed?
I just would like to take this opportunity to remind everyone that Lost in the world is the most underrated song in Kanye‚Äôs entire discography and why it‚Äôs never brought up as an elite song is baffling.
This is a perfect example of ‚Äúbe careful what you ask for‚Äù.
geez, you didn‚Äôt have to give it a 6/10 for not featuring lil xan
Nice review Melon, but I wasn&#39;t so sure about the that section between the start and end of the video where you gave the same review as last time. Unsubscribed.
Fuck u
We ever gonna get a for emma forever ago classic review tho
OMG I CAMT BELIEVE HE REALLY GAVE IT A 10!!!
Nicki&#39;s verse fit the song, melon üòí smh
Music is subjective people this is just his opinion.
He said Nicki Minaj&#39;s verse wasnt one of the best verses of all time? Okay, calm down.
you&#39;re still right
Melon really do be looking out for us tho. I was worried my 6/10 memes wouldn‚Äôt work anymore but alas, thank you Anthony
This man really said ‚Äúfarty ass bass‚Äù
damn, extra classic review this year!
DISLIKE GANG WE OUT HERE
This is more depressing than the existence of Yummy
THE TWO TIMER
You&#39;re still wrong
He actually fucking did it<br>Edit: I‚Äôm disappointed
HE DID IT. NOW STOP ASKING HIM.
Mad Respect
‚Äúfarty-ass bass lines‚Äù ü§£
I think that one verse in Lost in the World is actually one of Kanye&#39;s first love letters to Kim, which saves it for me. Otherwise it&#39;d be super cheesy
Can&#39;t wait for the 2027 DAMN re-review
This is a 22 minute Fuck You, 10 Years in the making.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=1312">21:52</a>
ITS HAPPENING
The crazy bastard did it
How can you not like All of the Lights????<br><br>Heck, how can you not LOVE All of the Lights?!?!?!?!
look man, you just don&#39;t get this album in the way that most of the people that love it do. and that&#39;s ok. I&#39;ve been entranced by this record since the first time I listened to it, but you didn&#39;t experience it in the way that I did, and there&#39;s nothing wrong with that. everyone interprets art differently, everything get something different out of their experiences. nothing wrong with that.
shut up
&quot;anal and gangbangs, and that&#39;s it. that&#39;s pretty vanilla.&quot;
In short: This album is a masterpiece without Kanye‚Äôs vision, but with Kanye‚Äôs message.
No
Stubthony Borntano here
Anthony: &quot;its overrated&quot;<br>Everyone: &quot;thats a weird way of saying a 10&quot;
ohboi
Melon has now become the CEO of racism
can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs still 6/10 u fucking nut
the ‚Äúyou‚Äôre my devil you‚Äôre my angel‚Äù verse was a love letter he wrote to kim. not just nonsense melon üôè
üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°
Fantano, you should go back and review one of the last decades classics, MM...FOOD by MF DOOM
You need to do this for DAMN. It went completely over your head, like it did with allot of people.
Nobody:<br>Internet: Breaks
MELON GONE AND DONE IT AGAIN
We gon fight if this a 6. Literally galahger up in here with melon.
I expected you doing random things for 22 minutes instead of actually reviewing the album
All of the Lights does have a terrible verse from Kanye imo
I can&#39;t tell his fear on the video, the man could have not done this and people would have just slowly care less about it, but then the Melon just achieve another 10 years of infamousity
Melon just game ended all of us
Friendship has ended with Anthony Fantano, now Shawn Cee is my best friend
Bruh
Honestly Anthony fuck you, you really didn&#39;t need to put a hit on Rick Ross it doesnt matter if you think his verse was too short.
It&#39;s still a 6/10 LMAO üíÄüíÄüíÄ
I understand that you disliked the album, but did you really have to give it a 0/10 just to spite the fans?
Melon just gave MBDTF a 5.9
the ‚Äúyou‚Äôre my devil you‚Äôre my angel‚Äù verse was a love letter he wrote to kim. not just nonsense melon üôè
The ultimate move. He used a meme to kill a meme, to create another meme.
What the!
Oh melon
<b>OOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHH HE DID IT TO &#39;EM</b>
This is utterly unnecessary.
Do it again
‚ÄúThe songs are good but I don‚Äôt like Kanye. Mediocre album‚Äù
10 outta 10 review it again
Anthony we get it... black people are a 6/10, you didn‚Äôt have to say it twice jesus
just when i thought racism was over...
clownthany clowntano
Kanye West‚Äôs My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy: NOT GOOD
Perish in hell
What ?
Great review Anthony but you didn&#39;t have to call Kanye the N word 900 times in the span of 20 minutes just because he supports Trump... Jesus Christ on a bicycle
Lmao 10 years later
Technically,  reviewed it 3 times because you did that Kanye worst to best
To be honest, kamikaze is better than this
GOTEEEEEEEEEEEEEM
This is a joke right? A 6? Well ok it‚Äôs still 10/10 for me
We have waited almost ten years for this. I hope it‚Äôs worth it.<br><br>Edit: Disappointed with the grade given once again, but we can‚Äôt deny how each criticism is fair. Anthony liked a lot of the musical moments, but didn‚Äôt connect to the emotional beats. The length of the songs probably made them too drawn out for his liking and it makes sense when you look at it from his point of view.
I screamed when Fantano said he hated all of the lights
Damnit Anthony it would‚Äôve been funnier if you gave it a 5
He said All Of The Lights is bad? <br>I never knew this side of Melon, and I&#39;ve never heard anyone dislike this song.
He really just said YEET to all of our expectations
Fuck u
BAHAHA
Ok now do damn
nah
I never thought this day would come.
cmon man... give it at least a light 7....
Re-doing his most infamous review from 10 years ago just to give the same score... I respect the game you&#39;re playing here Melon.
When you said &quot;this week&quot; I was expecting sunday bro
let‚Äôs get this racist back under 2M subs
I honestly think this album deserves a light 4. I don&#39;t understand why people praise it so much.
‚ÄúYour wild sexy fantasy is just basically every college-aged straight dude‚Äôs porn search history‚Äù <br><br>DAMN ANTHONY WENT STRAIGHT TO THE HEART LMAOOOO
He hated monster for every reason it‚Äôs a good song. That Nicki verse was one of the greatest female rap verses ever.
This is cyber-bullying I can‚Äôt believe this melon man, a six out of ten a again. I hate you and I never want to watch another one of your garbage reviews. Subscribed.
I have to say I really disagree on Runaway and Blame Game, but I love that you rereviewed and stuck to your guns. You smart, you loyal, you brave.
he stood his ground
These punks will never see this ending coming
Hey, the headless horsemen actually decapitated his victims and collected their heads. In the film version he is revealed to have a collection of many, many heads. <br><br>I believe that‚Äôs what he meant lol
fuk u bald bitch
Check out my beautiful dark twisted fantasy Mr Reviewtano! <br>Review request:<br>Valasse Eruva&#39;s album Ascending Phoenix
so are you going to review the album or not..
Same as it ever was
Thank you Anthony.
you absolute RAT
Smh ü•±
Not sure if I should like because it was a good video or dislike because he had the audacity to give it the same score
Fantano fans: ‚ÄúNo. This is not how you play the game‚Äù
I completely disagree.
You gave MBDTF a 6/10 but MBDTF a 6/10? Come on melon, we need some better consistency
Cannot believe he shit on all of the lights like that
HAHAHAHAHAH
I mean.... he&#39;s right tho
Quick reminder that lil pumps album is a 7. Melon like lil pump more than this
Blocked and Reported
Funny as fuck since this dude makes reviews for the type of  people whose favorite album is MBDTF
This is just on better resolution
i don&#39;t know if i want to watch this
Careful Anthony you might go under 2 mil again after that
Dumb bald melon
Had to do double take and make sure I read the title right
The Sleepy Hollow line isn&#39;t in reference to the Headless Horseman himself but to what he does, which is collecting the heads of his victims. Kanye is saying he is in Sleepy Hollow as the Headless Horsemen (since he &quot;lost his mind&quot;) and that he gets a lot of &quot;head&quot; because of it. So yes, it does make sense UNCULTURED MELON!
Imagine being able to low-key troll your haters while also getting them to line your pockets lmao
Peer-thony Presh-tano
WHOA what‚Äôs with the like/dislike ratio??
Yay now I can watch this review in high definition.
It&#39;s still a 6. Melon is still the same after 10 years
im convinced we&#39;re listening to different music
You know what. I completely agree with your take and you make total sense on your critique of this album. Unsubscribed
Welp time to dislike
I love how some people were saying it would easily be an 8 and it better be a 10, some people saying itll be a 5 for the memes, yet melon hits us with the unexpected and yet completely logical 6
This is truly one of Anthony‚Äôs best reviews to date. His critiques are razor sharp, dissecting exactly what he likes and dislikes in the utmost detail. The pacing, personality, and eloquence of the review, as well as the context it holds within the Needledrop mythos, makes the video feel grand on a scale akin to the album itself. Absolutely horrible, unsubscribed.
CARE FOR ME RE REVIEW YOU FAT TITTY
See y‚Äôall at 25k dislikes
You want a giant dislike bar again melon?
Clown
Im calling your mom antonio,  you cant say someone sucks ass cuz is black
&quot;Penitentiary chances, the devil dances<br>And eventually answers to the call of Autumn<br>All of them fallin&#39; for the love of ballin&#39;<br>Got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin&quot;<br><br>6/10<br><br>&quot;GRATATATA-GRA-GRA-GRATA WO-WO-WOO-WO-WOOOOOO&quot;<br><br>10/10
He still gave it a 6?<br><br><br><br><br>damn.
ok we get you don‚Äôt like it but calling kanye the N word a whole bunch wasn‚Äôt very melon of you
It‚Äôs late Anthony I have kindergarten tomorrow
They said it would never happen
This redux review is my beautiful dark twisted fantasy
That‚Äôs Nicki best verse
anthony, thank you for making this video as in-depth and track-by-track as possible. so i can disagree with you way harder than in the original review
Classic/10
Aight, aight... If you were going to give this a lot of praise ten years later, I was going to give you my first downvote in ten years, but... I FUCKING LOVE YOU CHIEF, STRONG 5, LITE 6! ‚ôæ
Its actually happening.
I am proud to say I still agree with you Melon.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!
WHAT A MAN AND WHAT A 6
Your hairline is a strong 5 to a light 6 inches away from your forehead
This hit like a brick in my inbox.
You are awful Fantano
Monster is the only bad track
Anthony: Some of y‚Äôall bout to be real mad at me... but it must be said
This is the REAL last review of classics week
I give this review a melon/10
You&#39;re wrong but I slapped a like on it anyways
Kinda disappointed he didn‚Äôt just repeat the old review word for word tbh
tripping absolute nuts on Gorgeous
This Melon just ain‚Äôt ripe
dislike
Dislike gang wya?
no way no way no way no way no way no way no way no way no way no way no way no way
Whoa what<br><br><br>UPDATE : HE STILL GAVE IT A 6 WHAT THE FUCK
This dude really just dissed the Runaway outro....
wowwwwwww
Re re review this
God you‚Äôre so stupid. Why did god make you stupid? Maybe next life you be smart. Bigger brain to comprehend this album.
He said what he said before, but longer
At least he gave the TLOP redux an 8. <br><br>I&#39;m still baffled that you liked TLOP more than MBDTF though
Just reminding everyone, he&#39;s sitting down while recording this....
THE ABSOLUTE MADMAN <br><br><br>damn you blue flannel
I haven‚Äôt watched the review yet but you‚Äôre wrong
WHEN WILL YOU FRICKING FRICKS LEARN THAT YOUR ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES
I was actually expecting a light 5.
what&#39;s the point of a redux review if you&#39;re gonna give it a 6 again
Melon. Why do you insist on being wrong?
Fuck you melon bitch
how can you give MBDTF a 6 when you have MBDTF a 6?
Bro I haven&#39;t even listened to this album, but just give it a light 9 Anthony
This is going to cause ww3
‚ÄúCop lights, street lights, flash lights, BUD LIGHT‚Äù  - Melon 2020
This made me sad mad I don‚Äôt even know I‚Äôm now full doomer
Twisthony fantaso
Classic week, more like this classic is weak .
I respect him for doubling down
Bro. is Melon the white, male doja cat?
Imagine a redux album getting a lower score haha
NOOOO ANTHONY THIS WAS YOUR CHANCE
RIP melon
I love u so much for this
Third time‚Äôs a charm?
Glad you came back to the album with an evening more glowing review and gave it the missing 4 points Melon.
‚ÄúI‚Äôll fuckin do it again‚Äù...
YOU DIDN&#39;T EVEN CHANGE THE RATING WTF
fuck you with such a fan service u m... oh wait
The balls on this man to DOUBLE DOWN
A 10 ? A 10 ? Damn, Anthony ! You did it !
Review &quot;Grana Azul&quot;, a brazilian rap/trap incredible album. Lots of Frank Ocean inspiration.
Watching it before 30K views
okay now do TDAGARIM
‚Äúfarty-ass-bassline‚Äù<br><br>-melon
Without watching, did he come to his sense?
what if we just clicked on the video and it&#39;s a fucking 0/10 now
I respect it
Hey Anthony, I just spoke with Mr. West and he‚Äôs crying and I don‚Äôt know what to do like how can you make a grown man cry :(
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=467">7:47</a> <b>cough</b> cudi montage <b>cough</b>
Man you‚Äôre crazy
Can we get a Redux Redux review of MBDTF?
WHO ELSE SKIPPED TO THE END TO SEE THE GRADE!!!!!!!
<b>HE ACTUALLY DID IT  THE FUCKING LUNATIC</b>
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Mike Dean = Goat
I respect all your opinions except for hating on Nicki&#39;s Monster verse.  like what how do you not like that
Someone stop this madman!
Fuck you melon
Everybody: So Anthony, are you gonna give us what we‚Äôve been wanting for years?<br><br>Anthony: well yes, but actually no
‚ÄúIS THIS WHAT YOU WANTED YOU PEASANTS!‚Äù-fantano
Who cares
Anthony is sooo wrong about the runaway lyrics. Smh
honestly anthony just say you hate kanye because he&#39;s black and go
Anthony you&#39;re not allowed to my Harry Potter party anymore
Still trying to figure out what the blue flannel means.
Man, it took me so long to finally regain my own opinion. LOOK WHAT YOU‚ÄôVE DONE TO ME.
The fact that melon even talkin bout this record 10 years later should mean by default it is not in fact a 6/10<br><br>6/10 records don‚Äôt last 10 years
Wow, here we are. Again.
Fantano.... You&#39;re a madman, MBDTF is the favorite LP of Bernard... Wtf
dude really said jay z has a good verse in monster but nickis is bad? lmaooooooooooo
How dare you come for Nicki&#39;s Monster verse like that? That verse is fucking HEAT
I thought we were still doing classics week....smh
I hate this, especially everything said about Runaway
Bro what
This mans really said he loves jays verse but nickis is weak ü•¥ü•¥
THANK YOU MELON WE KNEW IT WAS A 10!!! <br><br>NOW PLEASE LET MY WIFE GO, SHE HASN&#39;T SEEN THE SUN IN DAYS!!!!
THIS IS YOUR LAST REVIEW
WHITE SUPPREMACIST
The absolute chad.
He fucking did it again I‚Äôm dying
Thanks for adjusting the score to 10/10 Melon. I guess I&#39;ll buy a Ridge Wallet now.
he reviewed this twice so that&#39;s 12/10 it&#39;s ok boiis
Oh no.... This aint gonna be good.
fantano do you upload daily?
THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THIS IS WHAT I WANTED
I...<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>AGREE!
This is the PERFECT RAP album of all time!
He did it. He actually fucking did it.
holy shit fuck you melon, i love you
<b>gives it a 6 again</b><br>Melon: This is me, this is how I win
Pretty good review but I didn&#39;t think calling kanye a &#39;cotton-picker&#39; was necessary
THIS VIDEO MADE LIFE WORTH LIVING AGAIN KAYNE BTFO
Bro Nicki‚Äôs verse on Monster is one of the best parts of the album, you‚Äôre insane.
Blasphemy part2: Electric Boogaloo
I CANT BELIEVE HE HAD THE AUDACITY TO DO THIS TO US
Ok but can u do a hair tutorial?
LMFAOOOOO
He did again
Why do you have to enable your shitty fan base like this? The comment memes are already stale as fuck and annoying as it is and you‚Äôre over here making it worse-even if you didn‚Äôt change your opinion on the album.
Can‚Äôt wait for the redux review Anthony!
I hope you get drafted you ignorant melon
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=622">10:22</a> you&#39;re welcome
MOST OVERRATED KANYE ALBUM EVER<br><br>Still, Melon is a biased mega libtard, so he hates Kongay
i&#39;ve had enough
Imagine if he gave it a 5/10. Kanye himself would implode.
LMAOOOOOOOOOOO
History has repeated itself
I‚Äôm so glad the remastered version was an improvement, but still kept the heart and message of the original.
FUCKING LEGEND!
homie literally is displaying his own record
Im done with your bullshit
This review only makes me realise how much I need to appreciate MBTDF more
10 years pass and the only difference in this review is a few more n words
Yeah fuck this review. It&#39;s literally just here to get a better ratio. And I swear to god if the Fantano dickriders start saying this album is overrated because of this review i&#39;m fucking done with this shitty fanbase and channel.
Thanks for the 18th Birthday gift Anthony
Melon do Because the internet again. Please, I really want to like that album, but you said I can&#39;t.
People seeing this video were so excited
Start everything over. Do it all again!
Fires, Iran, now this? I can&#39;t take much more of 2020.
good luck explaining this one to god.
Who everyone else thinks started World War III: Trump<br><br>Who really started it: Melon
you better watch your back melon
i respect the re-review and the thought you put in this melon.<br><br><br>you&#39;re still wrong tho
Anthony, you goof, you can‚Äôt just manically laugh for twenty-two minutes and call it a re-review.

He‚Äôs a real sav for this
While I disagree with your opinion, I&#39;m happy to see you actually review the content of the album this time around and I can respect your ideas! Great job, Anthony.
People BEGGED for a re-review just to get a more detailed version of the last review a decade later?  ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
My mans re-reviewed this entire album just to give it the SAME score as before!
This album hasn‚Äôt aged well at all.
preemptive dislike
Knew he blew it when he shat on nicki‚Äôs verse
Big facts. Nicki‚Äôs monster verse is super overrated.
He should&#39;ve uploaded this on April fool&#39;s day
I don&#39;t believe in white people&#39;s opinions
I&#39;m happy the meme is finally dying low key
just give runaway a 10 and we good
What the fuck.
melon rate my beutiful dark twisted fantasy by kane west please
DID HE JUST INSULT CYHI‚ÄôS VERSE?
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO DO THIS RIGHT
MELON YOU CAN&#39;T KEEP DOING THIS
HOLY FUCKING SHIT
No way.. NO WAY
WHY DO YOU LIKE YOUR OWN VIDS
f u
Once ye rerecords this with the profanity taken out melon will drop the 10/10
Damn I thought I was gonna finally be allowed to like this album üòî
Why Anthony? Why do you do this? Nobody made you do this and yet here we are.
The madman
Beatles worst to best you pussy bald headed fucking nerd
About to commit war crimes in response to this review
Not the N word
WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU
Fantano shitting on the lyrics of all of the lights as if he ain‚Äôt completely missing the metaphor
I thought you said Clipse was the last classic review of 2020...
Dead End Hip Hop &gt; This clown
Thats crazy, I literally just watched all your Kanye reviews 10 minutes before this video was released.
I had a nightmare last night where I looked in the mirror and Anthony was my reflection staring back at me
Didn‚Äôt think I could be more disappointed than the first time
Why they put the pussy in the sarcophagus?
Petition for Melon to keep reviewing this until it gets what it deserves<br><br>Like to sign
anthony what&#39;s your address i promise i just want to talk
I had this at a light 10 back in the day, but after taking the time to consider the matter, I think it&#39;s more of a strong 10 now.
<b>Fantano needs to get Bert Kreischer as a guest on the show and review Mein Kampf together.</b>
This is why WW3 is happening.
Somebody gotta stop this man
Ant Knee I was gonna write  CHANGETHONY SCORETANO but you had other plans
6 + 6 is 12/10 damn
Oh my god. Oh my god it‚Äôs happening. Oh god
Everyone dislike this video immediately
Did anyone else check Spotify for a MBDTF patch?
He gave this album a 6 twice, so really he‚Äôs saying that this album is a 12. Thank you melon man
apolgy for bad english it is my first languagen‚Äôt<br><br><br>where were you when Mi prtty Twisty Drk fantasy die agin<br><br><br>i was at house eating dorito when phone ring<br><br><br>‚Äúfantano kil agn‚Äù<br><br><br>‚Äúno‚Äù
<b>I&#39;M CALLING THE COPS</b>

6 out of 10, review it again!
blue flannel

WOW Anthony...your first 11/10??? I&#39;m honestly surprised
<b>HOLY FUCK. IT&#39;S HAPPENING. HELL HAS FROZEN OVER! IS SILVER KANYE RESPONSIBLE?</b>
Why is the bald man speaking wrong
How is he going to give MBDTF a 6 but give MBDTF a 6??

This is the best worst video in youtube

Get the shinebox ready
I will dislike this Melon, you can&#39;t keep doing this to us
You&#39;s a Bitch.
You just had to do it, did you?
okay now do it again
anthony did nothing wrong
ANTHONY CMON KANYE HAS CHILDREN YOU DIDN&#39;T NEED TO END THAT MAN&#39;S WHOLE CAREER
dirty melon why are you doing this I&#39;m expecting a rereduxdux by next year with an appropriate score OR ELSE
üò™üò™üò™üò™
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
re-review The Fader
Some men just want to see the world burn
Great review, I like the part where you gave it a 10
Waiting on retards not being able to cope with the fact that a score hurts them so personally.<br><br>Oh wait I&#39;m a couple years late.
How does this album finish weak??? Runaway, Blame game, and lost in the world are all top tier tracks
disappointed
can u answer my dm @morivera12 on insta plz anthony
I&#39;m getting sick and tired of your bullshit, melon. üò°
Fucking madman
At this point I‚Äôd be upset if it were anything above a 6.<br>STAND YOUR GROUND ANTHONY!
Fuck you still
classic week day 5!
Thanks melon, I hate it!
You putting me through a roller coaster Mellon boy
Its fucking trash kanye is fucking trash grow a personality people you dont have to like things to belong
My Beautiful Dark Twisted Penis swells with enthusiasm.
You would hate this album less if you liked it more
Mbdtf threedux when?
another video<br><br>another dislike
So to celebrate you decide to waterboard the album again. You Monster
LMFAOOOOO
Bruh, why.
Don&#39;t worry guys! In 2030 when he re-reviews it again he will get it right!!!
THE BASTARD
You fuckin mad lad..
I&#39;m impressed yet a bit puzzled that Anthony bothered to make a new 22-minute long re-review of this album just to give it the same rating as before.
Anthony with the biggest bruh moment of the decade
dislike
Just poured a big bowl of Cheerios for this one mate.
&quot;look how they re-masacred my boy&quot;
We all know this is a 10/10, why doesn&#39;t Fantano?
The lad still kept it a 6
IF YOU LIKE IT WHY U GIVE IT A 6
This review is genius
I‚Äôm praying for your safety after this one
IT&#39;S THE SAME SCORE HAHAHA ALL THE HYPE BEASTS ARE PISSED
Ten years later....and he STILL ain‚Äôt change. üòÇü§£
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unfair!!‚Äù
MAD
I was hoping for a 5.
Oh my
HOLY FUCK!!!
6+6=12<br>12/10
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA pls he leaveee
How can you dislike the guitar instrumental on gorgeous?
Biggest troll in the game
Cant say I saw this coming
Do MBDTF again
about damn time
The Mallory Bros has a better take on Runaway and the album as a whole
WHAAAAAAT LMAO<br><br><br>edit: still a 6 lmfaoo
Ah fuck, I can&#39;t believe you&#39;ve done this
Best album of the Decade, instant classic.
NO WAY
This is a day in history.
The balls on this melon
Fuck u
Can‚Äôt believe melon lowered the rating to a 2/10 just to fuck with us...
But Anthony.... the headless horseman....chops off heads. He collects heads... so sleepyhollow has a lot of heads
ITS A 10 CONFRIMED!!! I KNEW ALL I HAD TO DO TO GET MELON TO CHANGE HIS MJND WAS SLEEP WITH HIM!!!
As long as you recognise Devil in a New Dress Is legendary, we gonna be alright.
I‚Äôd argue life of pablo is the final version of mbdtf. it‚Äôs a very maximalist record like this one, but we get a much more stripped back look into just how twisted his mind really has become, although mbdtf is much more poetic
ok but when are you gonna review TPAB
You need to do the redux again in 2030
SELENA GOMEZ RARE REVIEW!!!!!
If the first one was Hiroshima, this is Nagasaki
The mad lad did it...
the melon? not he is no longer the melon. he is now a fucking wild animal that demolished the melon.
Despite him giving it the same score, this is undeniably a better review
i respect your opinion. unsubscribing and reporting
That‚Äôs crazy stream worth by Ni√±o Bueno
Biggest bruh moment of the decade so far
It‚Äôs still a-<br><br><br><br>better than SBTH
Y&#39;all were so caught up by the score you didn&#39;t realize he never capitalized the description...
Daaaaamn son
He didn‚Äôt cave to all of us yelling at him. I can never recover
Why re review it if you haven&#39;t changed on your views on it
i hate the mix on this album its so muddy and flat. its my least favorite ye album.
LMFAOOOOOO
the fuck just happened
Wait im confused, so in his Kanye worst to best My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was #2 on the list. Is that to say that all his other work such as Late Registration Graduation TLOP (Which was a 8/10) are all less than a 6/10?
LOL Still the same.
OMG THIS IS HAPPENING AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
MBDTF came out 10 years ago?
Devil in a New Dress is arguably the best track Kanye has ever made
Please
AGAIN?!
FINALLY FINALLY FINALLY
Again,  This is the 9/11 of music reviews
You didn&#39;t have to review your fantasies again Anthony, but okay...
see you in another 10 years then baldy -_-
can u do a review of Paradise by Lana Del Rey?
Gorgeous would fit snugly on Kids See Ghosts
Ya‚Äôll just can‚Äôt handle that it‚Äôs just a good but flawed album
Review damn again
Oh, yeah. I recognize you. Haven&#39;t I seen you before?
22 minute review only to shit on black Jesus some more. Respect, never change Trollthony
jackboys?
He&#39;s right though, it is a 6/10
So Ye is better than MBDTF?
HE DID IT
HAHAAHHA Y‚ÄôALL REALLY FUCKING<br>THOUGHT ANTHONT WOULD COME THROUGH?
Anthony gave it a 6/10 again because that&#39;s his beautiful dark twisted fantasy.. his review game has reached a level we were never prepared for
Great! Now i know how to feel about the album
Holy shoot, he didn&#39;t!
Anthony‚Äôs been doing a lot of fan service with the black parade and mbdtf reviews, wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he just straight drops a link to his sextape in the next video.
starting off the year like this melon boi?? we won&#39;t allow this one to slide, not this time..
He really fooled me by putting this during classic week. This was cold af Melon
Who else scrolled down to the bottom of the description to see what score Melon gave it?
MBDTF is still the best album I‚Äôve heard this decade, and possibly ever
HE DOUBLED DOWN
Wow WTF
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO NOT LET HIM RE-REVIEW DAMN. HE‚ÄôS A MADMAN.
AHHHHHHHHHH
Who else clicked the description, saw the rating and immediately went to the comments.
Nice video, but please stop mentioning how you constantly have ‚Äúdark, twisted fantasies‚Äù about Kanye, Anthony. The man has a family and kids.
ok now time for a reredux review
Hype beasts won‚Äôt be happy about this one
He really still gave this a 6 huh
Ya know I kind of respect him for sticking to his guns
Melon you know 6+6 is 12/10
worst video you‚Äôve ever made, i can‚Äôt believe this. unsubscribed.<br><br><br><br>9/10 - ‚Äúit has a little something for everyone‚Äù
You can‚Äôt keep getting away with this
&quot;Twice the pride, double the fall.&quot;
This was cool and all, but when are you finally going to review MBDTF? It has been 10 years Anthony come one
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNaT3KazKoE&amp;t=251">4:11</a> I was not expecting that I smell a new Fantano Review album approaching
The meme is dead<br><br>Long live the meme
Hey Melon, you can borrow my anti-Kanye-stan bunker if you need. I think you will.
April 1st is 3 months away
If anyone is interested in joining a community of creatives to support and recognize each other‚Äôs original works as well as collaborate then rely to this comment for details. I‚Äôll reply with a discord link.
React to mbdtf!
This oozes big dick energy from the Melon Man
Bruh he deadass enjoyed Ye more than MBTDF
DEN OUTTA DEN, REVIEW IT AGAIN
Wow
Man this shit is fucking ridiculous
Lmao
Alright boys get the pitchforks
Idk what people expected, he&#39;s said his opinion on it hasn&#39;t changed much for years.
THIS IS THE ONE WEVE BEEN WAITING COR
melon idk about the trump endorsement you gave after the rating, but other than that nice review
For some reason with that &quot;Exporting&quot; tweet, I already expected this!!! I knew it!!! Anyone else?
Damn, he‚Äôs still wrong
A decade old album and still sounds great. The production and sequencing on this album is top notch, one of the best ive ever heard. Sure some of the lyrics are bit corny, but its Kanye album after all, he always has some corny lyrics on his albums. <br><br>Overall a classic album tho.
WHEN WILL YOU LEARN? YOUR ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCEZZZZ!!!
Why
He really just did this too shut us up huh
Sauce?
ITS EVEN FUNNIER THE SECOND TIME!

So ..... this count a classic review?
I dont like this one bit melon
You son of a bitch, you actually did it !
If you hit 3 mil would you make a video apologizing for giving Age of Adz a 6?
Imagine if he goes back below 2m subs after this
MBDTF <br>CLASSIC/10<br>Yeee finally melon listened to his subscribers.

&quot;Want me to re-review this? Well fuck you, 6/10&quot;
Isn&#39;t this the guy that gave MBDTF a 6
MBDTF Review (2020 Remastered)
you had one ch- wait no<br>you had TWO chances and you blew them both LMAOOOOOO
Glad I‚Äôm not the only one who thinks this album is so overrated
ALRIGHT, LETS GOO REDUX REVIEEWW!!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>h o l d   u p</b>
Boo this man!
anthony after uploading this: omg I can&#39;t believe I just did that I&#39;m so random skskskks anna oop
WAIT WHAT, IS THIS FR?
no
What the fuck did we ever do to you? This was fucked beyond belief. This was some sick fucking joke that makes me angrier than ever<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Subscribed.
Fantano reviewing Kanye West along the years be like: i hate this album, its awesome
YOU FUCKING HEEV
that red and blue contrast is making me uncomfortable
hehe, goody video anthony. love the part where you reviewed the album!
6+6=12
Who&#39;d say that ww3 would start because of a Review. <br>Nice melon.
The unmitigated gall of this fellow
OPINION WRONG OPINION WRONG
*checks score in the description <br><br><b>‚ÄùSO YOU HAVE CHOSEN DEATH‚Äù</b>
Melon man bout to start WWIII
this redux is like getting a parking ticket and just saying ‚Äúno thanks‚Äù
Based.
well 6 + 6 = 12/10
Ruthless
Well. You‚Äôre dead to me. Don‚Äôt fuck with my life like this.
OKAY WTF R U JK ?e?ee&quot;WQSDQFWF
In honor of how the comments section was actually super genuine and substantive when you did your original review before it became a meme apocalypse, thank you so much for all your hard work, Anthony ‚ù§Ô∏è <br><br>You‚Äôve brought attention and awareness to so much great music and wonderful musicians, and a lot of joy to my life and so many others. Congratulations on 2 million, and here‚Äôs to 2 million more!
Oh boy
FINALLY ADMIT YOU&#39;RE WRONG
Poopylicious<br><br><br><br><br>I had to make up a new word for melon giving MBDTF another 6/10.
Fuck yes Anthony. We all saw it coming
Just give the kids a 7/10 already
I respect your opinion of the album, but did you really have to say that kanye was 6/10 of a man?
Kanye West: Worst to Best REDUX<br><br><br><br><br><br>By which I guess I mean a tier list.  I&#39;ll take it, Melon.
Hey, at least this is a well written review despite the low score. 10 years ago it was trash
Guys use a common denominator 6/10 + 6/10 = 12/10
You really gonna re-review to give it the same score?
Lets see this launch Anthony&#39;s career again!
ITS HERE
Antony have different opinion than me, review bad
BRO
I Love You So Much Anthony
Melon&#39;s greatest power move holy <b>FUCK</b>
Honestly I didn‚Äôt think you would actually do a redux review. I thought you just said it as a joke.
It&#39;s happening
I still haven&#39;t heard this album, but I&#39;ve heard everything Ye dropped afterwards
theres no fucking way
I hope all your salad gets stolen, you vegan fuck. I hope they draft you first. :(
<b>You did it you crazy son of a bitch</b>
Lmfao what the fuck were y&#39;all expecting?
I hate MBDTF, its awesome
now all you fuckers can shut the fuck up
ITS STILL A 6
It would be wise to avoid the comment section on this one, lads.
It‚Äôs really not that amazing. It‚Äôs damn solid but overrated af
You only gave mbdtf a redux because you wanted to piss us off with another 6/10
Well time to dislike this
I&#39;m so glad he didn&#39;t bow to pressure and change the score. I&#39;d personally put it a little bit higher than a 6 but I like that he stood by the initial review
Review it again
SHUT UP MELON is a classic/10
WHAT THE FUCKKKK
HOW CAN A PERSON BE THIS WRONG?
damn that‚Äôs crazy
If this was MBDTF, he would have given it a 10/10
This is gonna get so many dislikes
Technically it‚Äôs a 12 cause 6+6 is 12 cuz you reviewed it twice making it the best album of all time
Technically, this is still a classics review.
But wait....what do we do now....Antwon. Give me purpose
Hey man i understand you didn‚Äôt like the album that much but you didn‚Äôt have to say the n word so many times. Like after the fifth time that was enough
Says the guy who gave MBDTF a 6/10
god fucking dammit melon you done it again
LOOKS LIKE MEATS BACK ON THE MENU BOIS!!!!! üò§üò§üò§üò§üò§üò§
gives a 6/10 just to redux it to a 6/10. Nice.
The mad man did it
No fucking way.
WHAT A GOD
His beautiful dark twisted fantasy was him thinking this review was going to appeal to everyone
Damnit
great review but I don&#39;t understand the part where you called me a moron? please explain thanks
THE SCORE HAS NOT CHANGED, I REPEAT, THE SCORE HAS NOT CHANGED<br><br><br><br>So carry on
This exact video was my beautiful dark twisted fantasy
Melon: Kanye bad<br><br><br>Comments: <b>HOW MANY TIMES DO WE HAVE TO TEACH YOU THIS LESSON OLD MAN</b>
GODDAMNIT MELON NOT AGAIN
This isn&#39;t allowed
This is probably the most hyped I‚Äôve been for an Anthony video
you fucking madman
You should review MBDTF
Watch the vid upside down. It&#39;s a 9 boys!!!!
10/10 review it again
fantano says he anti war but he dropped a nuke
My Beautiful Dark 6ted Fantasy
BRUH
Fuck you dawg change the score
I knew exactly what he was going to do. What a pointless video.
Top 10 Moments Before Disaster
no
You‚Äôre so bored for this
ya gotta respect it honestly
He misspelt 10/6
Feel like he did this just to get back at the Yeezus stans
Hi Anthony, can you sleepover this weekend?
&gt;still a 6<br>NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<br>REVIEW IT AGAIN
Do my eyes deceive me? Am I in a coma? Did the blast of a Nuke nearby distort my vision? No, the Melon comes in with Blasphemy part 2.
You monster....
FUCK YOU MELON
a 0/10 just because it&#39;s old now is a little unfair
Kanye‚Äôs next, he‚Äôs gonna die. Anthony‚Äôs gonna kill Kanye soon, just wait
No way he gave it a 6 again
the most top 10 anime crossover of the decade already
Guys don&#39;t worry, he gave it a strong 10 to light 11. Go back to your homework.
turn that 6 upside down
An actual good review, actually responds and listens to his fan base, and it‚Äôs a 22 minute long video<br>Unsubscribed.
Get ready for  another decade of memes
Wow didn‚Äôt think Anthony would ever give an album 11/10 but he finally did it
Welp now what
the crazy bastard actually did it
Everyone: RE REVIEW MBDTF<br>Anthony: Ok.<br>Everyone: NO, NOT LIKE THAT
Idk why but these videos remind me of a special episode like a halloween episode or xmas episode.
Your 10 years late Anthony, I already formed my own opinion on this album
OH SHIT!
Aww shit...here we go again...
I knew I shouldn‚Äôt have checked this as soon as I noticed the lack of a yellow flannel in the thumbnail
Thought classics week was over but I guess not
You gave MBDTF a 6, but gave MBDTF a 6.
YESTHANOY YESTANO
Yessir! Forever A 6/10
Damn When I First Saw This Video MBDTF Was 6/10
bruh is fantano coining the term &#39;baroque rap&#39;
I‚Äôm fucking livid melon man
MBDTF DIED FOR THIS
It&#39;s a strong 4 at best
I fucking hate you, Anthony.
Come on fam
Arguably the most important piece of the fantano lore since the execution of thatistheplan
HE ACTUALLY DID IT.
I clicked as fast as I could just to get disappointed faster than No Man‚Äôs Sky
Nice video melon but can you please do a redux review of my beautiful dark twisted fantasy
Still a 6 üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
A 6? WHAT?
Still can‚Äôt count to 10 I see.
Approval rating lower than Bush coming out of office.
Spoilers<br><br>DAMN/10
(6+6)/10=12/10
NO.
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAATT
bRO WHAT THE FUCK
THIS IS SO FUCKING SICK
After all these years the album never grew on him.

Nooooo
This is hell on Earth
Although, I do have to admit that I respect that. Disliked, unsubscribed, good video Anthony!
Can we get much higher?
This is fucking amazing already
Good review Fantano.<br>Unsubscribed

Mbdtf is Kanye‚Äôs most overrated album, yeezus is 10 times better and tlop is 15 times better

Yup. I love this man.

Nope, do it again
Today isn&#39;t April Fool&#39;s day Fantano

GOD DAMN I CAN&#39;T BELIEVE I&#39;M ALIVE TO SEE THIS AND I JUST HIT PLAY<br><br><br>god DAMN antonio I can&#39;t believe you gave it a 6 again

Where were you when Anthony Fantano gave MBDTF a 6/10?
IM NOT GONNA CHEAT BY LOOKING IN THE DESCRIPTION THIS TIME I WANT IT TO BE A SURPRISE
Like Feefo once said:<br><br><br>&quot;Dislike&quot;
WRONG DO IT AGAIN
YOU SON OF A FUCKING BITCH YOU DID IT
Should‚Äôve known you wouldn‚Äôt have changed the score
Wow a 2/10 just because Kanye is black? A little extreme, don‚Äôt you think Anthony?
The greatest troll of the decade
The madman has done it again
oh no
Knowing people will get unironically angry at this is the ULTIMATE satisfaction. Thank you for this.
Anthony come on now
Last time i was this early, MBDTF was a 6
Really? A 6?
You‚Äôve made God very unhappy with what you did here.
