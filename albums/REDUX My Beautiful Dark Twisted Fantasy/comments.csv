@proggornashibatorh,2024-06-12T09:21:37Z,2024-06-12T09:32:16Z,3,"most of the comments haven&#39;t even watched the video, lol.<br><br>i don&#39;t give a shit if you like this album or not, i like it too and have a lot of great memories with it, but y&#39;all are acting like critics are supposed to support your opinion in order to not being mocked and joked about. why are y&#39;all so sensitive about what others think of your favourite things, that&#39;s childish as hell<br><br>i feel so sick of people trying to call Fantano &quot;biased&quot; while also being biased as fuck.<br><br>a bunch of fucking whiners that can&#39;t accept that a person can have an opinion that is different from yours while being just as valid and respectable without saying he just &quot;tries to be different&quot;, this is such a toxic way to think and yet people can&#39;t recognise it because they&#39;re so eager to tell you you&#39;re wrong.<br>Fantano understood the album better than most of it&#39;s fan base, told you about it&#39;s weak points and you just can&#39;t stop, this is ridiculous."
@Refrez-,2024-06-10T09:52:49Z,2024-06-10T09:52:49Z,1,"I am 4 years too late but I would argue that Runaway was never meant to be relatable. This album isn&#39;t supposed to be relatable. A lot of this album is Kanye admitting to all of the things people say he is but unapologetically admitting that he knows it&#39;s not really a good thing for everyone around him, but it&#39;s him and that&#39;s what he&#39;s going to be. The opening lines &quot;She found pictures in my emails, I sent this bitch a picture of my dick, I don&#39;t know what it is with females, but I&#39;m not too good at that shit.&quot; are so simple and stupid on purpose imo. He doesn&#39;t recognise these things as problems other than because of the fact  it causes an issue with his partner when he&#39;s caught and becomes an issue that affects his life directly. He thinks I just sent a picture of my dick why is it such a big deal, he doesn&#39;t understand women but also admits that he knows it is clearly hurtful. He doesn&#39;t have anything clever or introspective to say, he just sent a picture of his dick and got caught. So that&#39;s exactly how he describes it.<br><br>I&#39;m just talking out of my ass for an argument."

Furthermore, it is not a sex song, it is a satire of the romanticization of the lives of celebrities compared to the lives of porn actors, in runaway in the bars that you mentioned, Kanye&#39;s idea is to be ashamed, to admit that it is a Disgusting guy who is shit, and he says it with that unpleasant bar of sending photos of his penis, the verse that comes after Pusha T&#39;s is pretty good, the verse from Lost in the World is a poem that he dedicated to Kim, interpreted as Kim, is his &quot;salvation&quot; from this void he was in after everything that happened in his life but he knows how toxic this relationship can become since he knows what a disgusting person he is."

I might hang myself in my room and just write the link of this horrible, deplorable ranking of the greatest rap album of all time as my entire suicide note. Im not suicidal in the slightest, but watching this horrible, disgusting, repulsing, garbage review has made me closer to that than when my own relatives die. As the biggest music nerd to walk the planet, you give raps magnum opus a mere 6/10. This can&#39;t be healthy behavior, you should attend hours and hours of therapy forr this take. You should be chained up in a bunker, forced to only listen to this album on repeat, with that being the only sound you hear. And when you get out of the bunker, the songs never escape your mind and they forever replay over and over again and everything just sounds like MBDTF to you for the rest of your life for this deplorable take. I hope when you sleep, your pillow is warm, you get crabs overnight, you&#39;ll feel so appalled when you wake up and see you have crabs you pass out and wake up in a dystopian world where you never get to hear the peep or sound of music again. I thought i could trust you fantano, you know more about music than i do and you&#39;re too blind to realize you found gold. Your brain should be experimented on for this idea in your mind that this album is anything less than a 10/10. You&#39;re a lab experiment with one mission that is to have the worst MBDTF take of all time. Even bone marrow babies can realize this album is beautiful, hense the album name. And not even youd can realize that, you must&#39;ve been forced into deep monkey sex unwillingly and full of unenjoyment when you listened to this so you have so much PTSD when you listen to this that you dont like it that much. To explain everything said in this essay of a comment: I don&#39;t really like that take"

@Camo_bomb,2024-01-05T01:47:56Z,2024-01-05T01:47:56Z,0,"To me this review feels more like a classic review than a typical Fantano review, which is what I think the album deserves as supposed to a numeral rating. The impact this album left on pop culture, the future of music, and the careers that were made because of it need to be acknowledged"
