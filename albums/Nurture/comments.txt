im not gonna lie this is a 10/10 perfect album for me. has some of the best songs ive personally ever heard in my life, and in the case of Unfold, perhaps the best song i‚Äôve ever heard. if anything deserves a 10, it‚Äôs nurture.
‚ÄúThis feels like what living in animal crossing must be like‚Äù best way to describe nurture
this album is a 10 but its okay we all make mistakes fantano
It&#39;s my favourite album of all time - and i&#39;m not a huge EDM fan, but something about this album - just hits spots i never knew needing hitting
I‚Äôm aware he‚Äôs not gonna see this but I just think dullscythe is an incredible track to follow mother about the disarray when moving out and finding stability in that
No way he calls nurture the ‚Äúdiscovery of this generation‚Äù and still only gives it an 8
Most 9 sounding 8 i‚Äôve ever seen
This has become my favorite album of all time
I wonder if Porter knew the influence this man had on EDM, hyperpop and even stuff like glitchcore, glitchbreak just from this ONE ALBUM
It&#39;s been two years already since this released. My god
All the real ones love dullsythe
You know you&#39;ve achieved your magnum opus when Fantano rates your album above 5
‚ÄúNurture is the Discovery of this generation‚Äù is all the proof I need to assume that he either secretly thinks both albums are a 10, or he thinks that our generation is worse than his.
Dullscythe is a bit of an oddball, but I don‚Äôt really see it as poorly paced or incoherent at all. To me it sounds like a song being written in real time.
The piano piece on wind tempos and blossom is some of the best music I‚Äôve heard in a minute.
Worlds to me is still his best album. Peak EDM.<br><br>For this one, Nurture, I actually expected it to be scored 7 since some parts of it felt repetitive. 8 is a really good review that I wouldn&#39;t complain with.
The beginning of wind tempos reminded me a lot of All My Friends lol
9/10 one of the best, most impactful edm records I&#39;ve heard
When I have found his music and started listening to his album sometime earlier this year it was such a different type of music and it completely changed my life and the way I view music. The music has also made me become more one with nature because of that laying in a grassy field feeling that the album gives you. I do agree there are some songs that don&#39;t make sense but other than that it&#39;s a beautifully written and composed album.
Discovery is now a 10 for him. Which only makes this praise even more amazing
Porter gets a 9 and thundercat gets 6. This is why needledrop will go down as the absolute worst reviewer in the game.
FT better
Look at the sky I&#39;m still here I&#39;ll be alive nextüíö
This album is just beautiful, i didnt know Poter so i wasn&#39;t expecting the electronic sound at all when i listen to it, from the art cover i was expecting something more acoustic, so it completely blew me away, i can&#39;t belive such concepts could be mixed and coincided so well thogether, the statement: &#39;&#39;AI meats nature&#39;&#39; is 100% accurate when describing this album, beautiful.

Nurture has changed my life. Makes me cry every time
This album has been my self care for the last 6 months. Been to see Porter&#39;s live show featuring Nurture twice now since April, and its an absolutely positive, feel good, sensation. So grateful to have been re-discovering his music at this time and to be there for the live performances.
This album sounds like frolicking through a grass filled valley in heaven
Completely agree. I literally have zero criticisms about your criticisms.
Burn in hell forever
This video is part of nurture live now
Just came back from his nurture live show, was absolutely amazing!
:
i dont really agree that it has themes rooted in escapism like worlds. worlds was very much making songs out of stories, while the narrative of nurture is focused on porter himself/the struggles hes faced. its one of the reasons i like it so much, its more honest, and the sounds really reflect that. on a different note i wouldnt call nurture feel good and/or blissful. its not really sad either, but i just wouldnt really call it happy.
What&#39;s the album in the background?
My god what a jewel, what a masterpiece. To think it got a strong 8 makes me wonder what a strong 9 would be for this guy...
as someone who has discovery in their top 3 albums of all time, i just need to check this out now after that comparison.
watched this to hear his opinion on mirror and he didn‚Äôt even mention it lmao
recently of his album list of 2021 he really gave this album on top of the Top 10s<br><br>this album absolutely grew onto him and it&#39;s easily the best album of the year for sure<br><br>( it really feels like it&#39;s now a 9/10 lol )
I disagree with many points made in this review. However, you are very attractive and hot. Every time I see your bald head I get shi
dude ur entire purpose is parasitic. it‚Äôs sad that the society bothers w music reviews. same society that used to take joy in public executions so no news there. u just feeding the beast. porter is as pure and beautiful as they come. wish he didn‚Äôt give this rake legitimacy by appearing
This generations &quot;Discovery&quot; is not Nurture in our opinion. Its Charmed by DJ Sabrina The Teenage DJ.
DULLSCYTHE is not the worst track at all.
I‚Äôve listened to this album so many times now and I still can‚Äôt believe how good it is
Proceeds to be snubbed by the Grammys
dullscythe is my favorite song in the album
Robbed ,man. Robbed
You appear in his new Tour visuals Mr. fun moment
Seeing this video pop up during Porter‚Äôs Nurture tour visuals had me in tears. I wish I could see it again.
Who‚Äôs here after seeing ‚Äúworlds strong 5‚Äù on the big screen on the nurture tour. This fan base will never let that down üòÇ
Good thing fantano wore the same shirt for 7 years
Wow he called it this generations &quot;Discovery&quot; wow
Nuture&gt;worlds....nostalgia cant redeem itself
&quot;the &#39;Discovery&#39; of this generation&quot;<br><br>now that is a compliment
Yeeeeeeeeesss
Mirror is one of the most gorgeous songs I&#39;ve heard in a couple of years.
Given that I loved Dullscythe, this is easily a 9 for me.
Better then Worlds
this does put a smile on my face
Congrats on the cameo.
Aimer - &quot;daydream&quot; album PLEASE...ü•∫
&quot;Some Artificial Intelligence having a religious experience.&quot; Damn Melon you good ?
When I find myself feeling sad or down, I watch this review.
I agree that nurture is better than worlds overall. Worlds has a few very good tracks though, namely goodbye to a world as an example.
HOW IS DULLSCYTHE UR LEAST FAVORITE WHAT
This a 10 melonboy
Nurture Review<br><br>Jake Peffley 9/20/21<br><br>Before I get into the bulk of this material, I want to explain my thoughts on Porter‚Äôs music in general, and how I got turned onto him. Back in 2016, when I was either 12 or 13, I was recommended Porter‚Äôs legendary track, ‚ÄúShelter‚Äù. At the time, this was one of, if not the most beautiful track I had ever heard. The mix of synth-pop instrumentation, obscure female vocal sample passages, and heart wrenching lyrics, I was infatuated with the track instantly. So Obviously after hearing this, I had to check out his other material. Now although I did like overall his SpitFire EP, what I did not expect was how amazingly surprised I was at his earth-shattering debut album, ‚ÄúWorlds‚Äù. From the Enormous ‚ÄúDivinity‚Äù, to the more melancholic tracks such as, ‚ÄúFellow feeling‚Äù, or ‚ÄúGoodbye to a world‚Äù, there is NEVER a dull moment on this record. After listening to this album religiously for about a year, I was really wondering where Porter would go with his sound next, which leads me to Nurture.<br><br>The roll out for this album was spectacular, not only because every track promoting this album was Stellar, but also the aesthetics of the art work, really resonated with me. What I‚Äôll finish this thought up with, is that the Album cover looks like what the album sounds like, Laying face down in a field of digital grass. A very Warm, melancholic, but freeing mixture of emotions.<br><br>For my actual review, I will be going track by track, and listing all of the qualities that stand out to me, but before doing this, I just want to say every track on here is amazing in their own way, and spoiler, I believe this album to be nothing less than a 10. (which is rare coming from me.)<br><br>Lifelike: A beautiful mix of folk, glitch hop, and electronic music, that serve as an amazing opener to this project. From the beautiful pianos, to the subtle vocals porter lays into the track, I think it works so well. <br><br>Look at the sky: One of my personal favorites here, given the sentiment alone. ‚ÄúLook at the sky, I‚Äôm still here. I‚Äôll be Alive next year.‚Äù This single line was almost enough to make me tear up, considering the timing of this album roll out. The pandemic had shown my true colors of what I am on the inside, relating to my depression, and existential thoughts. Hearing Porter repeat this phrase over and over, really did make me feel comforted. Something I was in desperate need of. Now going into the instrumental, Again there‚Äôs a mix of folky strings, and the electronic synths and samples porter is so good at orchestrating. Overall this track feels very uplifting.<br><br>Get your wish: This track is a great little song about moving forward. The instant standout in this track for me, is the soul crushing electronic instrumentation Porter implements when singing the chorus‚ÄúSo tell me how it felt, when you walked on water, did you get your wish.‚Äù This is a big part about what I love in the album, how Porter uses his amazing electronic mastery, as well as these folk elements to really emphasize the message he‚Äôs trying to portray.<br><br>Wind Tempos: This is probably the most underrated track on the album, and is easily in my top 5. The piano / violin duo that makes up the intro is certainly beautiful, however what this eventually blossoms into is one of the most exhilarating, and heart wrenching things I think I‚Äôve ever heard. Basically, over these melancholic pianos, a female-like android‚Äôs vocals are added. Now, it‚Äôs hard to describe, but in Fantano‚Äôs words, it sounds like she‚Äôs going through a ‚Äúreligious experience.‚Äù This is definitely one of the tracks that makes more sense when executed, then explained, so go listen to it, as that‚Äôs better than any explanation I could give.<br><br>Musician: Being the most upbeat track on here, Musician offers a much needed exciting feeling to this record, and succeeds in flying colors. From the synth pop sound, to the enthusiastic lead vocals, Musician is one of the catchiest songs in the bunch.<br><br>Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do: The second track with no lyrics, which serves as an interlude of sorts. One could maybe write this song off as being not as exciting as the other tracks, and on one hand while I slightly agree, I think this track has a feeling of frolicking in a field of digital flowers.(Which more than makes up for the lack of structure, in my opinion.)<br><br>Mother: One of the most beautiful sentiments on the record, seeing porter express his love for his parents, while at the same time grieving the feeling of growing up. The heavy synths that Porter layers his passionate vocals on top of, truly makes this track one a ‚ÄúHappy Cry Moment.‚Äù<br><br>dullscythe: Another fully instrumental cut here, with most of the track filled up with glitching piano, drum, and synths, that all add on top of one another, and eventually all give away to show a cavernous piano solo at the end. I can see this track leaving some of Porter&#39;s fans, and general listeners, kind of confused, however I think this weird little passage is very unique, and fits into the album quite well.<br><br>Sweet Time: I need a girl that will treat me like Porter treats his fiance. This whole track is dedicated to Porter having a fear of death, not because of his own mortality, no he‚Äôs just scared that he will never be able to see his fiance ever again. She is so important to him, that he would not be able to live without her, and this is something that is so beautiful to me. As for the instrumentation, the nocturnal drums, spacious synths, and the wasm feeling add to Porter&#39;s very heartfelt lyrics in a beautiful way. And once these sounds build up, a new layer of spaced out synth tones make way for porter to repeat these same sentiments, but hitting harder due to this space he has allowed for himself to fit over.<br><br>Mirror: As you may know, Nurture arrived 7 whole years after worlds, due to Porter kind of doubting himself and his art, given past criticisms, and fear he would not live up to his full potential. This song is basically addressing that confrontation, and sounding beautiful while doing it. The majority of this track is the repeated chorus, ‚ÄúAnd I know you&#39;ll say how I&#39;m a burden. Yeah, do your worst all at once, I know what you want from me, from me<br>I know what you&#39;re thinking, And it&#39;s not the voice of all the others, You&#39;ve only said it to yourself, I know what you want from me, from me, I know what you&#39;re thinking.‚Äù<br><br>Something Comforting: My favorite song on the album, maybe even my favorite song of all time. The constant feeling of being let down, feeling like there&#39;s nothing you can do, and wanting, needing, and CRAVING something that will comfort you, having someone that will give you comforting words, is something that I connect with, on a deeply personal level. The Electronic, Folk, Synthpop, and glitch hop sounds that pop up here are almost as powerful as the ideas presented here in Porter&#39;s lyrics. I‚Äôm not ashamed to say this, but the first time I heard this track, I basically bawled my eyes out. Everytime I hear this track, I tear up slightly. It just hits so close to home, that I can‚Äôt help but be addicted to the feeling this track gives me. And Porter If you‚Äôre reading this, which you probably aren‚Äôt, thank you for making this song, I love and adore you for it.<br><br>Blossom: A beautiful little guitar ballad, written to his Fiance, with the same sentiment of the track sweet time.TThis one really doubles down on the feels, like I said before, being fully guitar driven. It‚Äôs very easy to see how much Porter deeply, and truly is enamoured with this person, Especially the tone of voice he uses  when he says ‚ÄúIf I can‚Äôt stop time.‚Äù and ‚ÄúI just want you happy.‚Äù A great transition into the outstanding outro tracks of this album.<br><br>Unfold: A top 3 track for me, and I think the heaviest track Porter has ever put out, sonically. The track starts out with these weird pitched up vocals that build up into the chorus, that just blows me away e=very single time I hear it. From the Crashing percussion, to the heavily layered, yet also spacious synths, I seriously don‚Äôt know how a human is able to come up with this kind of sound. As the track continues, Porter repeats this Chorus, ‚ÄúAs I watch the Water Unfold, It‚Äôs a feeling I want you to know. Cuz I‚Äôm not the same as I was, as I shoulder the weight of the world.‚Äù and gets more and more demented, and heartbroken. It really makes you feel as if the Earth is falling apart at the seams, and nothing is real. A real mindblower for sure.<br><br>Trying to feel alive: The last track on this album, and is a damn good finish. This is another track for me that is extremely relatable, as well. The main theme I pulled from this is that Porter is trying to get all of these things that he thinks will fulfill him, and give him purpose, and is underwhelmed, constantly on the search for a greater purpose in Living. With these thoughts in mind, Porter proposes that maybe he doesn‚Äôt NEED to feel, ‚ÄúAlive.‚Äù The dissatisfaction in life is inevitable, and he uses this to drive himself forward, and give himself purpose. <br><br>Overall, I think Porter has really done something special with this project, and I‚Äôm likely never going to enjoy an Electronic release as much as I admire this one. Thank you for giving us this experience Porter, and I hope to see you continue your musical journey throughout the next few decades. And on that note, if you guys are still here , thank you for taking your time to read my thoughts on something that is highly personal to me, that I cherish as much as I do.<br><br>Favorite Tracks : Look at the Sky, Get Your Wish, Wind Tempos, Musician, Mother, Mirror, Something Comforting, Unfold, Trying to Feel Alive<br><br>10/10
Lil easter egg in the visuals at second sky ;) Like if you saw it and came here.
Fellow Traveler better
Wait.. he didn&#39;t mention mirror
He wore his good review flannel so I was pretty confident from the beginning! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
I just want to come forward and say that I cried after Blossom
As a fan of worlds, and someone who discovered Robinson through Shelter originally, I fully agree Nurture is leaps beyond these. This whole album is a masterpiece, it‚Äôs so beautiful, every song deserves its own praise, from soft and atmospheric to the unique and experimental like dullscythe. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever get tired of this album, nothing has touched me more then ‚ÄúTrying to Feel Alive‚Äù.
This is becoming my favorite album of all time
This album is legitimately great. I can only find 2 songs that I don&#39;t really find playlist worthy but there&#39;s banger after banger here.
To me dullscythe is like a quarrel between porter robinson and virtual self
Fellow Traveler&#39;s Nurture is better
If u listen to the lyrics he talks a lot about how he didn‚Äôt know what he could make that would match the expectations of worlds which was huge that‚Äôs why he took so long bc in his eyes he wasn‚Äôt satisfied with his work
‚ÄúA societally neglected generation of terminally online kids using anime and music to soften the blow of their pandemic-ravaged reality‚Äù ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm in this picture and I don‚Äôt like it
Nurture is easily better than Worlds imo, although I love both <br><br>Nurture is my album of the year and easily one of my favourite albums of all time
I liked nurture but &quot;this is the Discovery of this generation&quot; is not a take i can agree with  at all lmao
it also gave me daft punk vibes for some reason
Nurture robinson
Went back to this album recently, and loved it so much more
I&#39;d argue that Nurture is a continuation of Worlds, where Worlds felt like throwing yourself and losing yourself in a digital works, Nurture feels like a being violently pulled from a digital world that you&#39;ve spent so long in that you forgot what is real and what isn&#39;t. The acoustic sounds from Nurture are almost grounding you to reality while the glitching almost feels like an afterimage or a ghost from this unreal world we were trapped in during the early 2010s of electronic music (Worlds).
Im only here to leave.
Wind Tempos is‚Ä¶.ugh. It‚Äôs so good. Sweet Time??? This is a great album.
aoty baby
I took a shot every time you said aesthetics and o fuck we boolin
‚ÄúThis song feels like what living in animal crossing must feel like.‚Äù üòÇüòÇ
I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts on Mindless Self Indulgence&#39;s Jimmy Urine&#39;s 2018 album Euringer!
Melon you are also part of those sad anime boys tbh. Don&#39;t lie you still cry to Shelter.
I will forgive you on your opinion on &quot;Mirror&quot;, but you&#39;re on thin fuckin ice
Anthony, great album! Totally agree..hey, how about you review a tone poet like Lee Morgan&#39;s The Rahja?
This album is BIG &quot;end of the pandemic&quot; vibes
We know u wanted to give it a 9.
Album of the year IMO. Life-affirming, beautiful, inspiring, and encouraging. The world needs more of whatever Nurture is.
Damn! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKtqB-SFIaw&amp;t=207">3:27</a>
Nurture was well worth the 8 year wait
Can&#39;t believe he didn&#39;t like Sweet Time. I&#39;m on the verge of tears every time I hear this song
I just wanna know who paid him to rate this on the same level as discovery?!?!?
Damn I didn&#39;t think this guy could actually say something nice üò∂
Mother and Something Comforting broke me. actual tears
&quot;maybe a societally-neglected of terminally online kids using anime and music to soften the blow of their pandemic ravaged reality&quot; hoooooooo boy. Im gonna have to go for a whole WALK
Sounds like shit I would&#39;ve bumped in middle school
Nice to hear this as Worlds is one of the only bright and happy albums I have enjoyed basically ever.
sorry but if you enjoy the second half of Wind Tempos I cant get behind your reviews
So happy mellon reviewed this album so I could discover it, I wake up thinking about its tracks, thanks Anthem!
üëçüëç
He recommended this album to vaush lol
I absolutely love this album, but I don&#39;t think Porter gets enough credit for his lyricism in it, especially how nearly every song has a counter in the album. Get Your Wish and Musician really contemplate how success took away his love for music and Musician describes how he got it back. Mother and Sweet Time comes from a mother&#39;s, then father&#39;s, perspectives of their child and their love for them. Then you have Mirror and Something Comforting, the former talking about how critical your inner thoughts can be yet how uplifting those voices can be too, giving you that &quot;encouragement&quot; you hear at the end of the song, only to be drowned again into his depression and fear of giving up his sadness at the cost of possibly losing who he is, desperately wanting that voice to come back. Unfold and Look at the Sky are oddly enough counters as well, because in the lyrics of Look at the Sky he describes how he was as a child vs. how he&#39;s changed growing up, looking up at the sky as a way to regain that childhood wonder and to get through the difficult times. Unfold is the climax of the album, telling us how he went through the changes he did and how this album was him taking us with him through it all. He&#39;s not the same as he was, we saw the sky and the world move on. I think needledrop is spot on with Trying to Feel Alive being the closing credits, how Porter almost missed the magic of his music through his depression, but then using that same music to bring himself back. That feeling both motivated and scared him in a way that is meant to be understood after listening to the whole record. Blossom really throws me for a loop, but it might be my favorite song on the track; it&#39;s absolutely beautiful, and nearly makes me tear up hearing how somber it is. Two people having to say goodbye and learning to let go. The saddest and probably most unnoticed thing about the track is that only the male voice says &quot;I love you&quot; in the track, the female voice is silent for that line. Honestly this is one of my favorite albums in years and I can&#39;t stop listening to it. Definitely grateful to be able to listen to this on repeat for days now lol
Grammy contender!
Probably my favorite review of yours, definitely captured a lot of my feelings on the record (once I listened to it after your detailed review), so I have much gratitude Melon for this extremely quality review.
I question what he was even thinking with dyllscythe.
Didn‚Äôt completely hate this album, but this music is what I‚Äôd imagine a Pepsi commercial would use if they were trying to be artistic
What phenotype is this mutt?
The fact that you&#39;re sticking to your 5/10 on Worlds just shows that you&#39;re trying to make-up for your mistake with this 8. <br>Clearly Worlds was somewhere between a 6 (above average) - 8 (great) depending on your opinion of EDM.<br>Nurture is a very good album and 8/10 seems fair.
Juxtaposing this album to Discovery.... come on. Nurture is fantastic but comparing it to perhaps the BEST electronic album of all time is laughable.
Coming back from listening to this album for a while, and damn, this shit is <b>really</b> good. The genre of the album is unusual for me, but I love it. So glad I gave it a listen. <br><br>Also listening to Worlds after Nurture, I kinda get how Fantano rated it less. The appeal of Nurture is much easier to pick up for people outside of the genre.
Discovery hit me in high school then this album hit me in my 30s.
I feel like if you were to listen to Worlds and Nurture back-to-back it would be a jarring difference in style. But if you nestle Shelter in between the two albums, it&#39;s like the keystone piece bridging the two albums together.
am i crazy or did he skip Mirror? Track 10?
I&#39;m addicted to this album please don&#39;t help me
Hmm but dullscythe is amazing tho
rewatching this to make myself feel good about my otherwise bad music taste
APPRECIATE HARDER LEMON!<br><br>We stan Porter.
I listened to this album 2 separate times, once in my car, and once through headphones, and I really just didn&#39;t get it at all.<br><br>The best way I could describe my reaction is just complete boredom. Listening to this album all the way through was tedious, in a way similar to what one might feel while folding laundry or doing the dishes. That was at least until I got to the occasional, misplaced, high energy, hyperpop/glitchy sounding parts, at which point my boredom would shift to just being completely annoyed.<br><br> I was hoping based on everyone&#39;s reaction and hype that this would be the album that would change my mind about Porter Robinson, but it was not.
he didn&#39;t mention this but Yvette Young (Covet) played the acoustic guitar part in Look at the Sky
Meanwhile his brother: <b>PISS N POOD ON.MP3 BY PHARREL WILLIAMS</b>
honestly, him calling it the Discovery of this generation might be a higher honor than if he were to score it a 10/10. like wow what a special thing to say about an album
How can you not like dullscythe bro, it&#39;s one of the best tracks
This album smacks. Change my mind
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKtqB-SFIaw&amp;t=270">4:30</a> &quot;..part minimal, part glitch piano passage..&quot; I can only hear LCD Soundsystem - pretty distracting from an otherwise good song
This makes me happy
Dullscythe might be more aphex twin than aphex twin though // it‚Äôs a damn fine track tony
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKtqB-SFIaw&amp;t=204">3:24</a> how the fuck does he know
I loved the callback to LCD Soundsystem on Wind Tempos :)
This album made my dad come back from getting cigarettes, put down the bottle, and become a loving father.
He&#39;s still wrong. It is a 10.
Worlds is my favorite album of all time. <br>But i still like u bro. Music is art which is subjective and thats what makes it great.
Everyone Liked That
lol wow it took him this long to release a review that I actually agree with.
What song is the ‚Äúone more time‚Äù of the album he never says the name of the song lol
porter robinson deez nuts.
But why didn‚Äôt you like Dullscythe?! It was such a creative track üòç
Worlds was better
this album getting me thru my breakup
Man this album was incredible, it was so textured and i had such a great experience listening to it front to back without stopping any of the tracks, it definetely felt like it took all those years to complete, i&#39;ve never listned to porter&#39;s music that much apart from shelter but this album really made me a fan instantly
Never been that big into electronic music but gave this album a shot because yellow flannel, it‚Äôs really grown on me, pun intended, in just a few listens
Buen v√≠dio :D
:)
honestly i agree on dullscythe just because it sounded like the odd one out of this albulm but besides that the whole thing is absolutely great
Remember being 15 and hating Anthony with all my being for his assault on my emotions.
This album reminded me of the new Purity Ring album Womb, especially since you gave both Worlds and Another Eternity low rankings, you should review Womb because it has the same &#39;improvement&#39; you mention.
Redemption baby
Melon finally likes beep beep boop music
Fantano not liking dullscythe all that much makes a lot of sense given he wasn&#39;t a huge fan of Worlds, and dullscythe is by far the most Worlds-esque song on the album. It fits right in with Polygon Dust and Fellow Feeling.
Worlds &amp; Good Faith were both better tbh..
tbh i wasn‚Äôt too sure about dullscythe at first, but it really grew on me the more i listened to it!
I literally cannot fathom how he doesn&#39;t enjoy Worlds but does enjoy Nurture but like, go off I guess
<b>BOOBAH</b>
Ya.. this albums sounds like modern day elevator music. Boring radio friendly pop sounding music. Sounds like music you‚Äôd torture Guantanamo prisoners with.
It&#39;s a pretty album, but it&#39;s not fun to sit down and listen to. It&#39;s makes great background music.
You completely missed the mark on Worlds. Ever listen to Fellow Feeling? His exploration of glitch was arguably better than Nurture
My album of 2021 so far. Wonderful.
Each song sounds like it could be a pokemon town theme
Booo. Get a better taste in music
5/10 overhyped as fuck
thanks for reviewing that. have you watched his set from the 2021 Secret Sky? its on youtube. it&#39;s fantastic and shows how he would present the album instead of just pressing play start to finish. it is a journey and a great listen with tons of live music energy to it
Nurture is by far Porter&#39;s best album yet! Personally, I think he has refined his style and established a new direction into his career by making his music more intentional and personal Which I think is the best move for him! As for Worlds I respect your opinion but I think Worlds was pretty good but not to the level as Nurture is. <br><br>The only criticism I think I can come up with for nurture is his reliance and use on vocaloids seems to be a crutch for him which I think the usage of vocaloids can bring character to the songs but it can be distracting at times.  Personally, I would like to see him use his natural voice more often in the songs which can possibly bring more meaning and impact to his songs.  I really think Porter has a really great voice and has the potential to use it in a way where it can bring his music to a whole new level.
YESSSSS
I been listening to Mother so much I haven‚Äôt revisited the rest of the album a lot. I like what he said about this sound being of a different dimension, and just vibes escapism.
LETS GOOO
The album on the shelf is Betty Davis - Self Titled (1973). An in your face funk/soul gem which laid the groundwork for outspoken explorations of female sexuality in popular music and influenced artists like Madonna and Prince
DODIE BUILD A PROBLEM REVIEW NEXTTTT ANTHONYYY!!!!!
This album makes me feel like i am going to be okayüò≠üò≠
I still don&#39;t get it. Maybe one day it&#39;ll click with me. Sounds like EDM trying to elevate above itself but not quite getting there because the weight of its musical tropes are too heavy. The vocals are also meh. Really dig some of the folktronica instrumentals and textures hidden around, like on do-re-mi. But whenever there&#39;s a climax/beat drop, I just wanna move on. It becomes so derivative of mediocre EDM. If I wanted to listen to something like this I&#39;d listen to Anamanaguchi, I feel like they have much better style, and when they get loud the layers really shine with something huge and fantastic. Don&#39;t really see how people can say Nurture&#39;s anywhere close to as good as [USA] or Endless Fantasy.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKtqB-SFIaw&amp;t=208">3:28</a> way to attack us melon
God gave this man the strongest redemption arc I&#39;ve ever seen.
damn an 8 <br>lesgoooo
8?! LET‚ÄôS GOO
Can we talk about how the only thing said about Something Comforting was &quot;Thankfully the throttling dance beats picked the pace up once again on Something Comforting.&quot;.....lol. There is so much more to be said than that! Idk, personal bias for me, it&#39;s one of my favorite tracks on the album lol.
Review <b>Bad Nerves</b> Debut Self Titled LP please!
finally
is this Marc Rebillet with no hair?
anyone feel like he&#39;s giving it a good review just to redeem himself from the Worlds review? He&#39;s afraid of the internets fury
YES SIR I&#39;ll ignore your comments on Worlds but YES Nurture is AMAZING
I can&#39;t fucking believe dullscythe is your least favorite track wtf
‚ÄúArtificial intelligence having a religious experience.‚Äù<br>Best quote in my opinion hahaha
Too saccharin but musician is a good song.
worlds was one of a kind when it came out ez 11/10 but sadly a lot of electro house, future bass, synth pop artists were influenced from porters album which caused its own wave which made the music a lot more common and mainstream. he def influenced the sound of the electronic scene for the next few years and it honestly made the sound get old quick
I love worlds, but I agree with ant fant. I‚Äôll listen to them but I‚Äôm not coming back for those songs. As for nurture, there‚Äôs more good there but for me there‚Äôs not something as iconic as good bye to a world. I love mirror so much, and have been listening to it on repeat since the music video dropped, but nothing can compare to the sheer influence goodbye made on the internet. I‚Äôm going to give the whole album another hit, then the secret sky 2021 again, and see what I really think
Fuk u worlds is great
The yellow 8 flannel strikes again.
Shelter is the only song ik tbh haha
Its weirdly and strongly  reminds me or has nods of XTC Skylarking.
Man, i don&#39;t know why but i cant get into theneedledrops vids. Its all too subjective. I don&#39;t even disagree its just kinda unrelatable i guess
SPELLBOUND!
Looks like he learned his lesson after porter robinson fans TP&#39;d his house for 3 years straight
this album feels like spring in the day and driving through the city at night all at the same time
Porter Robinson is officially the new Thomas Bangalter.
That must be a good quality flannel if it lasts over 10 years. What brand?
Who&#39;s the girl vocalist in most of his songs?
Why would you start a video just completely shit talking the artist you are about to review? Worlds is 7 years old. Now I&#39;m salty and have no desire to watch the rest of the video..
this review is p accurate. sometimes he is right.
Wow, I didn&#39;t know Porter was a really good EDM artist, now I gotta give him a listen
Nurture is way better than Worlds. Can&#39;t get into Worlds.
For anyone wonder dullscythe is a song meant for porter to show off to producers with his sound design, automation, and composition skills. If you‚Äôre just an average listener who doesn‚Äôt understand those things you can just skip the track for the most part
tbh I was expecting a 7ish but 8?! WHEW
You learned from your mistakes. Good job.
Who else is watching another review without having had heard the album?
YES finally got one right!
&quot;Maybe a societally-neglected generation of terminally online kids using anime and music to soften the blow of their pandemic-ravaged reality.&quot; Painful, but is he wrong
I love wind tempos
For how long it took porter to put this album out I was underwhelmed, especially coming from the high energy of worlds. BUT NOW I GUESS I GOTTA GIVE IT ANOTHER CHANCE. thanks melon üòë
You missed Mirror!! The best song on the album imo
‚ÄúThe discovery of this generation‚Äù very well said sir
This album is such a vibe
Calling him Robinson instead of Porter just sounds wrong
&quot;LEAST FAV TRACK: DULLSCYTHE&quot;, What are you SMOKING??
My dawg sitting here talking about Worlds like he hasn‚Äôt been to the tour‚Ä¶oh wait
REVIEW THE NEW FLYINGLOTUS SHIIIIT
total nonsense. clearly there is a camp that disagrees. So ill be in my tent.
&quot;What living in Animal Crossing must feel like.&quot;<br><br>Bruh
mr anthony fantano would you consider reviewing fortitude
I LOVE SO MUCH THIS √ÅLBUM
‚ÄúThe discovery of this generation‚Äù is one of the nicest comments this album could ask for.
LETS GOOOOOOO
Hit the nail on the head with the animal crossing comment, I literally said to myself &quot;wow it&#39;s like I&#39;m in aminal crosing&quot; during my first listen
Thought this was an early review of Bright Green Field for a second
Melon, this album is so blissful and beautiful. I am so thankful for you for introducing me to it
idc worlds &gt; nutrure
Melon!!! You need to review ‚ÄòBitterzoet‚Äô by Eefje de Visser!!! We need it!! Pretty please!! üôè
Bruh it sounds like rugrats theme song
Review new FlyLo
So I can respect your rating here tony cause like you Dullscythe is a bit of a disconnect from the momentum of the album, but all in all I&#39;d say it is refreshing to have him back after such a  long gap and with something new and exciting. I think his increased use of instrumentalist and his own vocals shows the growth of Porter as an artist and as a person, not to mention the lyric retrospective content of it as well. Reflecting on Worlds, which I know you don&#39;t fully feel for it, he has become someone that has learned how to live and be happy with how life is and accept that he can&#39;t keep living in this virtual world he creates in his head. He has a life here in reality that has been calling to him for some time, and I think he has finally headed that call. I&#39;m really happy for him and his success for this album. As a die hard fan of both Porter and Daft Punk I agree that this album parallels Discovery, though I would not compare Porter&#39;s Worlds because they are just too different and too many ways to make any sort of comparison between the two.
wind tempos is incredible
Why isn‚Äôt it a 9/10 if you didn‚Äôt like one song?
he sounds very pretentious
So happy porter&#39;s getting the respect he deserves, nurture is something special
Dullscythe being the worst track on the album disappoints me because I absolutely love the song title and I had high hopes for it. <br><br>Ok just a clarification, I had this opinion before I saw the review
issa classic
I see boobah up here has been watching idubbbz new stuff
Review Retrograde by Alexander Bakarozos
&quot;It&#39;s like listening to an artificial intelligence have a religious experience&quot;<br>Lmao this made me almost spew out my water
been watching videos on porter for a while now, this review tipped my interest so now im gonna go give both reviewed albums a listen
Huge W
8??? Man as a Porter Fan I wasn&#39;t feeling the album a whole lot. I would have thought you would have hated it lol
Factoring in that Daft Punk comparison, I‚Äôm considering this an 8.5
change your opinion on worlds. its wrong. who hurt you as a child?
Ive said this before but just review yelawolfs new album. Its good
I was a huge fan of Worlds and would agree that Nurture was WAY better. That being said you really didn&#39;t like Worlds???
Good review, you skipped Mirror btw :)
I dont like how he just glazed over Musician.....
It&#39;s weird that when I grab my phone that&#39;s on full screen at the end of the video Anthony is still oriented correctly.
I can&#39;t relate on the dislike for Dullscythe, but I&#39;ve always felt Sweet Time was too... empty? I need to listen to this a few more times...
While I havent listened to World&#39;s in over 2 years I am going to get angry at you and hate you for liking this album more than worlds especially since I was underwhelmed by this album.
Don‚Äôt wear the yellow flannel again until it‚Äôs a 10
WHAT IS THE SONG LIKE ONE MORE TIME YOU DINDT SAY THE NAMEW AHAHFUFHOIA
Porter Robinson continues to be the only artist who can make me feel nostalgic while listening to a song for the first time
Damn
Fucked up Friends 3 next?
Gotta agree with Fantano regarding Worlds, it was just a shitty EDM-pop album but people praise it as the next fucking burial or some shit
hearing this album for the first time felt like one of the most intimate experiences of human emotional connection i&#39;ve had since this whole disaster started fourteen months ago<br><br>it&#39;s the kind of music that puts a hand on your shoulder and says ‚Äòhey man, i know things are rough now, but they&#39;ll get better, and it&#39;ll all be okay in the end‚Äô
LETSSS FUCKINNGGG GOOOOOOO <br>Worlds got slapped, but nurture earning that 8.
Get Your Wish is my favourite from this album
Fantano redemption arc
I adored it. I&#39;d be really interested in hearing the unreleased KKB/Porter collab that was heavily sampled in the track Musician.
Manchester Orchestra next!!!
Shocked to see Nurture get a good rating by melon himself!
I really appreciate your unbiased take on this. I pretty much agree with everything you said. If I had anything to add, I would say this record is WHOLESOME AF. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.
Porter Robinson got a deserved 8, I can die peacefully now :D<br>Also, dullscythe was a banger probably one of the best in the album, but it is totally type of song that you really like it or you really don&#39;t.
Let&#39;s gooo
i need you to  fucking fight Oliver again!! hahahahaha pls! i need u to win!
Much like you are comparing the growth from Worlds to Nurture, I think what you weren&#39;t considering when you reviewed Worlds was the growth from Spitfire.
Please review Bronson EP by Odesza and Golden Features
999 Porter fans in the comments üôèüôèüôè
Oh Anthony I&#39;ve waited 7 LONG YEARS for your redemption and you did me so proud. Worlds is amazing but Nurture feels like the turning point into a new generation of EDM in general.
dullscythe was actually my favorite track on the album, but then again that&#39;s because i&#39;m a fan of opn and i felt like it was a track that a more sanguine and positive opn would make.
review ¬¥if i could make it go quiet¬¥ y girl in red
YEEEEEEEEEES

this review bumps in the whip
What song is he talking about that is the One More Time of the record? Replayed it several times but I didn&#39;t catch the name of the track.
Review dj khaleds album
This album and review have honestly put worlds in perspective in such a way that I don&#39;t even think Anthony is all that wrong about it anymore
This is one of my favorite records of the year.
Does melon know about fullmoon lullaby? It&#39;s such a beautiful bonus track ü•∫
I was in the car with my buddy yesterday and I mentioned that I hope that you review this album and not 10 minutes later my friend gets a notification off Instagram about the upload for this video. We sat and watched the whole thing stoned
I found this album beautiful, poignant, moving, and mesmerizing.
No one talks about Unfold its a freaking banger easily my favourite off the album
My boi got an 8 let&#39;s goooo
THATS QUITE THE IMPROVEMENT
I love pleasant surprises and when good artists finally get SOME FUCKING JUSTICE.
The last review on this wall leaves on a good note
Musician was a grower for me and may very well be my favorite song in the album for me now. Unfold is great too! Reminds me of Sea of Voices
Okay, now give Manchester Orchestra the score they deserve
HELL YEAH!
Should‚Äôve reviewed Fullmoon Lullaby
If &quot;the Discovery of this generation&quot; isn&#39;t the best kind of glowing praise, then I don&#39;t know what is.
tha NK YOU
review cfcf memoryland next
finally i can form an opinion on this album
Wow. I listened to this review yesterday not knowing this album dropped and was super hyped to listen to it today. Now having listened to all of it, I find that I have the opposite of Fantano on the level of Porter&#39;s two feature albums. Nurture wasn&#39;t bad, but I am severely underwhelmed.
Can you review Private Reasons by Bruno Pernadas?
Discovery of this generation is the perfect description! For worlds.
Didn&#39;t know of this artist but I listened to some of the songs and WOW. I am pretty happy to find another new artist this year that gave me that spark. It&#39;s pretty rare I get a spark from artists I haven&#39;t listened to before so I&#39;m glad I watch your reviews. Good and bad!!
Review our new album Melon thxx
I disagree with a lot of these characterizations but I&#39;m glad Anthony enjoyed the album!
I wasn‚Äôt expecting this üôèüèª<br>now review the new Dinosaur Jr. record
TOP 10 ANIME REDEMPTION ARCS.
Unfold was absolutely beautiful I‚Äôm sorry
Both albums are just okay but God if Musician isnt the best pop song Ive heard in years.
Your Worlds review is still pretty bad, and feeling the need to double down on it at the beginning there is pretty telling of a weird stubbornness.
Completely agree! Nurture is beautiful.
(:
You know an album is good when the comments are without any memes or shitposts. As easy of a 9 as there‚Äôs been so far this year imo
&quot;...the <b>Discovery</b> of this generation.&quot;<br><br>Well, DAMN!
8 is the new 10
It&#39;s a 9 from meüòéüòé
Tristam - WLUWD review please
‚ÄúGo touch some grass‚Äù oh ok
I&#39;ll be waiting for a redux review.
W
Fantano: hates Worlds for being sweet, artificial, and annoying<br>Also Fantano: loves hyperpop<br>???
ICE MELT BY CRUMB NEXT PLZ AND THANKS
I‚Äôve liked this album since it came out but the discovery comparison really made me think about it differently. Even though I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a one hundred percent accurate comparison, it‚Äôs still close enough that it really made me gain a new appreciation for nurture.
Woah didn&#39;t expect this review!
The melon didn&#39;t like &quot;dullscythe&quot; only because that word has &quot;dull&quot; in it
Rorter Pobinson<br>Robert Patinson long lost twin
lmao i knew when i didnt like this album that fantano would like it
The piano break in &#39;Wind Tempos&#39; makes me think of snuggling under a blanket next to a fire on a cold Christmas Eve watching a peanuts Christmas special
Fantano please do an OK Go review
I would give it a 7 more than an 8 for the reason that I feel from a composition perspective, the album doesn‚Äôt take risks at all, most songs have very similar chord progressions and melodies. But I get that it‚Äôs the point of the record to be very uniform.<br><br>But despite that I really enjoyed nurture, it‚Äôs so pretty.
i love dullscythe
Porter listened a lot to Jon Hopkins. You can tell with all the cinematic foleys and atmospheric building.
Proof that Anthony can&#39;t rate electronic albums with an 9 or 10
I don&#39;t get it. It&#39;s so overly compressed and the mixing is eh
W
I knew he would give Nurture a better review than Worlds, its more his (and probably the general public&#39;s) cup of tea. Not to say Nurture is normie, but Worlds did alot that the average person didnt get, or enjoy, from some I have talked to.
Nurture is a masterpiece üôè
Nurture was far too sappy for me.
Porter Robinson is new age Owl City. The difference is his music isn&#39;t just bland mainstream electro-pop
The Melon has been forgiven üôå
SPELLBOUND! BOI<br><br>damn the DIscovery of this generation...thats a hell of a compliment
Worlds was great but I gotta say I&#39;m not as huge on it as I used to be.
BOOthany BAHtano fml
Somebody can say me, what Is that album in the red shelving
Yessssuuurrrr
new gojira album..... review the new gojira album......
We need a review or Tristam‚Äôs WLUWD album üòá
LETS GOOOOO
He said he felt Trying to Feel Alive felt almost like a credits roll of the album and I never thought of it until now but that honestly seems to make a lot of sense. I always felt like Unfold should be the closer even though I liked TTFA, but now I like it even more
The first time he hasn&#39;t pissed me off nice one melon
I wouldn&#39;t call Nurture escapist in the same way that Worlds is. In fact, I feel the whole point of Nurture is that it&#39;s rooted in reality and facing one&#39;s inner demons and finding peace in the real world.
He had us in the first half, not gonna lie
Not being funny but every time he interviews someone they get a good review...<br><br>Gorillaz<br>Conway<br>Etc
Fair review. I love this more than WORLDS. And I loved WORLDS very much and still do. As Porters has grown as a person and a music producer, Nurture speaks to me more 7 years later. It came at just the right time for me.
Finally the Melon man is on our side
But we still don&#39;t know his opinion on Virtual Self =(
I dig the album but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll listen to it for long. Porter&#39;s Secret Sky performance was amazing, though. Would love to see him live. Also Dullscythe almost rules but never seems to start. Bummer
Called it.
do ‚Äúto see the next part of the dream‚Äù
This is one of the most 9 sounding 8s in a while.
It&#39;s one of those albums where I cried through the whole thing and I really couldn&#39;t tell you why.
Finally Porter Robinson getting some recognition, I love it.
cried
So glad you like this one, Anthony!
R O B I N S O N
Imma check it out
HE SKIPPED MIRROR
I remember catching the music video for &quot;Shelter&quot; on adult swim when it premiered and it was magical
The very subtle cut and screwed Kero Kero Bonito feat. on ‚ÄúMusician‚Äù is fantastic
taking a walk through Porters head üî•
YES! YELLOW FOR PORTER!
Okay okay I love it so so sweet of me too lol love love it
Your right Melon. It is a beautiful album.
I am noticing more yellow fannel reviews this year. I am very cool with this.
ofc dullscythe is my favorite lmao
Unexpected but appreciated, gotta make time to listen to the whole thing all the way through i&#39;ve heard half of it so far and listened to his Secret Sky set in the background and liked what I heard though.
Oh boy
I love this album so much. It&#39;s exactly the music I needed at this point. There&#39;s hope in the world again I feel and this is its anthem.
The worlds slander is gross lmaoooooo <br><br>You shoulda seen it live kiddo
wind tempos BEST track easily
Did anyone else think he was going to give this a 3?
Trans...<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Gender
Eight
I&#39;ve been meaning to check this out since it dropped, definitely going to have to now üëç Cheers for this review.
we need the Superwolves review, maybe now that Kozelek seems to be pretty fucked you can give Bonnie Prince Billy his due
look at the sky‚Äôs sick as fucj
Sounds like a Japanese RPG from the 90s? Nah dude, that&#39;s chiptunes. This is late 2010s stuff.
Nurture is something that get better by time in my opinion, my first impression was meh, but now I love it already
ha bdm beat deez nuts
You have officially redeemed yourself from your Worlds review.
please stop reviewing electronic music
What&#39;s yourself with the remarks on worlds, glasses.
Classic Nature Vs Nurture Melon
LFG!!!!!!!!
more edm plssss
This makes me very happy.
It really is the great album, I agree on almost everything. I think to fully enjoy dullscythe you need to listen it to some spacious sound system, that worked for me. On headphones it gets pretty chaotic, almost too chaotic.
Im pretty much with Anthony almost 100% (I love Mirror and he didn&#39;t mention it here) really surprised he enjoyed it this much, and really happy Porter is getting the respect he deserves
Review some women&#39;s albums now
giving this an 8 after giving worlds a 4 is a good redemption arc. stream nurture
HE GETS IT NOW :D
I am waiting for this, thanks.<br> Good thing this one won&#39;t disappoint you this time
‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüèª
‚Äúporter robinson.. *forever*‚Äù<br>so true
I am genuinely smiling at this review
such an unexpected positive review from melon.... but we already knew it was great boys  :)
OH MY GOD AN 8
&quot;this is even more groundbreaking than speeding bullet to heaven 2&quot; is definitely the best compliment this album could&#39;ve gotten out of him. very touching.
I&#39;M SO HAPPY HE LIKED IT BUT WHY DIDN&#39;T HE SAY ANYTHING ABOUT MIRROR AAAAAAA
It feels really weird to be here after all these years as someone who was introduced to Porter Robinson through ‚ÄúSay My Name‚Äù and the Spitfire EP. Like, it‚Äôs a little jarring with that perspective.
We want a gojira fortitude review
Where‚Äôs the Pete and Bas review
Anyone else get a Takagi Masakatsu - Rehome vibe from this album? If you know it be my friend, if you haven&#39;t heard it go NOW
Mans called this the Discovery of our generation and gave it a decent 8
:LFGshelter: porter fucking did it boys
Porter Robinson is the intersection in the center of a square with vocaloid, anime themes/osts, JRPG osts, and Daft Punk for corners.
FUCK YES I PREDICTED THAT 8 AND I&#39;M SO PROUD OF THAT 8
HE DID IT YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
LETSS GOOO
dudeeee dullscythe is my fave off it. makes me think ive grown w porter all these times w his music
Epic
Amazing album
PORTER WAKE UP YOU HAVE AN 8
review mid-air thiefs &#39;crumbling&#39; right now
you should listen to PUTA by Zahara, one of my favourite albums this year probably, heartbreaking lyrics but really healing
Oh shit here we go again
Porter robinson is the reason why i make musik
This album is too long for me. Songs 4 through 11 I felt I was stuck in the same 3 minute song for half an hour. There are not enough ideas for 63 minutes of music on that album.
YELLOW FLANNEL LET&#39;S FUCKING GOOOOO
No need to lie Anthony, we know you cried listening Sweet Time as well.
Glad you enjoyed this one. Loved this album and I&#39;ve been waiting to hear your opinion on it.
I feel weirdly happy that this album got through to a hard-to-please critic almost as much as it did to me
even though i disagreed with his worlds review, I did see where he was coming from. it feels really good to see such a positive response to nurture though.
He&#39;s wearing the flannel for the new porter release<br><br>I&#39;ve been waiting for this
This album means so much to me and I&#39;m glad that Joshtony Butano gave it an 8
Antonio el Fantas
8 NNNNNOOIIICE
I fucking love this album. Mother and Sweet time made me cry so hard üíÄ
BOOBA!!
MANTAP MAS MELON
Let&#39;s goooo
Great, now review the new Gojira album please anthony
Finally
Personally, the ‚Äòdip‚Äô comes in the mid-section with do-re-mi, Mother and dullscythe - still good songs but they just don‚Äôt resonate with me a whole bunch. All songs before and after that part are some of the most elating pieces of music I‚Äôve heard in a while.
I loved worlds more than everyone when it came out. Now after a few years I got really sick of the kind of overwhelming production on that record. I found myself agreeing with Melon more and more. Nurtures already growing on me as an album and I think people will still love it in many years to come
He wore the shirt. God I‚Äôm so happy he likes it.
He gave Worlds a 5 lool
<b>Mirror crying on the floor</b>
I really hope Nurture serves as a shift for EDM/Pop music - if the euphoric soundscapes of this end up permeating the mainstream I‚Äôd be so goddamn happy.
Melon you gotta stop using your 9 language for 8 albums I get way too excited at the end
I agree
Mirror is so good (and definitely my favorite so biased), but it hurts to not hear it get mentioned in this review..
YESSSSSSSS
Thank you Melon for the review, very cool!
More electronic reviews please
dullscythe is seriously your least favorite??? just false
10/10 for me, but 8/10 from Fantano... LFG!
the porter stans are satisfied, you&#39;re safe for now melon
NO WAY
I&#39;ve already listened this album like 10 times, now that it&#39;s an 8 imma listen it another 90.
&quot;Wind tempos&quot; sounds like it samples LCD SOUNDSYSTEMS- All my friends.
LESSS GOOOOOO
‚ÄúThis is the ‚ÄòDiscovery‚Äô of this generation‚Äù - holy fucking shit, what a compliment!
OHHHHH YEAH! YEAH, MEL0N
Manchester Orchestra album review?
good review. now i wish he&#39;d re-review worlds :^)
Thank you Melon now I can continue to love the album in peace
You would have given it a 10 if it was do-re-mi-fa-sol-la-SI-do
dullscythe is my favorite D:
my guy skips mirror and lifelike... Good review though. 10/10 imo.
Hi, I&#39;m Anthony Fantano and you&#39;re watching Discovery channel.
sugoiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Nurture = 6 &lt; 8 = Worlds
LET&#39;S FUCKING GOOOOO
I feel like if you want more nurture then you should listen to Motoro faam.  I find a lot in common between Porter&#39;s work and theirs. I would like the porter to continue moving in this direction.
‚Äú...it‚Äôs like listening to some artificial intelligence have a religious experience.‚Äù  Damn. This image you‚Äôve painted is causing my mind to glitch.
This album makes me feel so many emotions all at once. It&#39;s what I needed
Probably my album of the year. It‚Äôs exactly what I personally needed after this last year and a half. Gave me the escape I needed
My man, thanks for reviewing this. Was great to hear your takes after listening to this over the last few weeks. First electronic album in a while I&#39;ve come back to again and again to listen to. Been loving your Twitch stuff lately too.
Im here!
review WLUWD by Tristam
&quot;I love Porter Robinson&quot;<br>  ~Lil B
As an avid fan of both porter robinson and daft punk I genuinely couldn‚Äôt be more pleased
Animal crossing: The Record<br>(Or for my weebs out there<br>LAID BACK CAMP: The RECORD)
Appreciate you Anthony üíö
thank god you didn‚Äôt fuck with one up melon
Nurture was worth the wait. As was this review :)
Fuck Yeah! glad you liked it but how you talked about it I expected a 9. Anyway I am looking forward to your Andy Stott review now!
Cant wait for the interview!!
Our Boi here has been reaaally into the &quot;credits-roll moment&quot; thing for the entirety of 2021
Do Smokin Texas by Wacotron please
that was the most 9 sounding 8 i‚Äôve ever heard in the history of fantano reviews
Wind Tempos is such a beautiful song
We did it. We bullied Fantano into giving Porter a good score. üôèüèª
Finally, now my soul can rest a bit. Worlds is still better though.
One of the prettiest albums in a while
AOTY
Coming from that McDonalds video that his brother made to the positive reception this album&#39;s receiving, I&#39;d say that the Robinson family as a whole have been putting out bangers recently.
boothany , hey my last name is booth
This album is Imagine Dragons of electronic music
Damn can‚Äôt believe with dullscyth, I totally agree with his POV
Kinda surprised he went a big talk about how momentous it is and how much he liked the album right at the end, then gave it and 8. Great score, but honestly expected a 9 after that talk up üò≥üò≥
&quot;Like an artificial intelligence having a religious experience&quot; True
As a long time Porter fan since the release of Spitfire, who loved Worlds with songs like Fellow Feeling, Sad Machine and Goodbye to a World bring some of my all-time favorite songs I will say that I feel that Nurture is a vastly superior, more personal, more emotionally resonant, more original, more experimental and musically mature release, while yes Dullscythe dips the littlest bit I greatly enjoy the odd progression and experimental sound palate, and really that&#39;s my biggest complaint with the LP.<br><br>I thought it was gonna be tough picking my album of the year, but unless anything impresses me as much as this it might stay my favorite.<br><br>P.S. check out See Through by Kumi Takahara, one of my favorite artist debuts of the year, who you might enjoy it you like classical/orchestral/instrumental music, WLUWD by Tristam, which I&#39;ve been waiting for forever and has some incredible songs on it, Decade by Dream Machines, which has great jazzy funky electro rock songs one after the other, Drugstore Heaven by Houses, an artist I&#39;ve greatly enjoyed for a few years now who seems to have a great grasp on Electronic Rock and is one of the few albums I haven&#39;t been disappointed to hear songs from a past work repackaged for a new one, and Lost Aria by Elliot Hsu, with beautiful fantasy anime/videogame feeling instrumentals and natural feeling sound mixed with electronic-esque sound patterns and lovely wind and string instrument sounds.
I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts on my new album Love and Losing It!
Hmm been waiting for this one for a while, ever since I saw the worlds album review.
Please review typhoons by royal blood next üôèüèª
Yes! Someone else who really loves wind tempos. It&#39;s been in my ears a lot. It has a very genuine feel to it like it&#39;s almost too personal and is supposed to be hidden away. Like a vulnerability that isn&#39;t easy to share with someone.
Just looking at that album cover is giving me allergies
Me happy ‚ò∫Ô∏è<br><br>Edit: THE DISCOVERY OF THIS GENERATION. Thats awesome.
Can you review World Famous Tour - Wavedash
Love it
That thumbnail tho
this makes me so happy ü•∫ i adore porter so much, can‚Äôt wait for the interview
I stg if it‚Äôs not an 8-10 imma do some immoral things
im so hyped for my vinyl to arrive
Definitely not as good as WORLDS, but still a beautiful album nonetheless.
Fantastic album, but every time I listen to Sweet Time I keep having the image of the Spiderman ass slaps in my head during the clapping beat.
Why was mirror skipped why why why that‚Äôs the best one why
you know i was expecting a &quot;yeah ti&#39;s alright&quot; but man compares it to discovery yo :flushed:
dullscythe is actually my favorite track haha
Strong 5
Will we be getting a Gojira Fortitude album review soon?!
Truly was not expecting the yellow flanel.
Wow did not expect this but glad he got the good review. Personally thought it was the weakest of the Spitfire, Worlds, and Nurture eras.
2014: meh<br><br>2021: literally daft punk
i may finally be able to tolerate u now, bald guy. congratulations
Giving the album a zero because porter is a &quot;weeb&quot; does not count as a review, Melon.
LETS GOOOOOOOOO AN 8!!!! With an interview on the way
based
Porter deserved more credit for Worlds. This album is just a natural progression of a great artist.
Can you review music from your subscribers?
It&#39;s a much tamer album than Worlds. That&#39;s why you liked it. You can&#39;t stand anything that sounds even vaguely EDM-y.
Porter Robinson made the one best comebacks of ALL TIME I&#39;m so happy for him ngl, he&#39;s in the HALL OF FAME of electronic artists/musicians for sure üêê
Forget edm start reviewing some underground techno fantano
You&#39;re alright, Fantano.
still waiting on that NOT GOOD rating for dj khaled&#39;s khaled khaled
Blessed day
That look you have on your face in the thumbnail is so fucking hittable
This album is surprisingly good üëç‚ú®
I love salad
So proud of Porter. Been following him for a long time
This is a 9 but yes great review
I didn&#39;t expect this what a pleasant surprise :D
Yellow flannel + serious look in the thumbnail + 1 word summary in the description had me bracing for a 10/10
Somebody wake me up for the next 9, please.
Good job Porter! I would say overall it is a better album then Worlds. My biggest dislikes about the album is that there is pop structure, so some tracks do get repetitive and you kind of already heard the whole track within the first 2 minutes. Compositionally, some tracks are more forgettable then others because they just aren&#39;t as good imo. Blossom, Sweet Time, Wind Tempos and Trying to Feel Alive are more forgettable tracks. There is parts in every song that I love, but I think Porter could have developed many ideas better. For example the beginning of Unfold is beautiful as well as the second half of Dullscythe but not the other parts. I think during the secret sky performance, the changes and differences in the songs actually made them better... the Mirror intro, Look at The Sky bridge, Musician 1.0 version etc.
I CALLED IT<br><br>Edit: I was expecting yellow flannel but man, calling it the Discovery of this generation is insanely high praise
I never really followed Porter until his Secret Sky performance, but I have now really fallen for this album. Musician has hit me the hardest in terms of favorite tracks.
Nice üëç
I&#39;m listening to this album right now... I have to say... it&#39;s really fucking good.
You didn&#39;t like Worlds? Fight me irl in a Denny&#39;s parking lot.<br><br>I&#39;ll be waiting
MY BOY GOT AN 8 LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOO
I attended the secret sky fest even though I had to stay up till like 2 pm for it to start due to Time zones and it was just Beautiful, KKB, Porter himself, Rezz and many others in a virutal set the quality of a game like Genshin Impact that is free.... and with many secrets to explore and many other different cooler arenas on the top of the world for a better view and Different Voice chat groups In-Set ? .<br> It was magical and mic wasn&#39;t even working at the time to talk. That&#39;s how good it was.
Now this is a fair review
Gotta disagree here. This album is nearly unlistenable.
Fanatao, why are you just talking for 10 minautes while he&#39;s faceplanted on the grass? Help him get up already!!
Porter‚Äôs doing some of the most good right now in electronic/pop music... very nuanced record. My AOTY so far...
Cool review, Fantano. But maybe get a different flannel for the 9/10s and 10/10s. Getting real sick and tired of seeing these 8/10s.
porter changed my life as a little high schooler with the escapism of Worlds to keep my life worthwhile, now I&#39;m a college grad out in the &quot;real world&quot; and Nurture is exactly the reality-affirming support that I needed.. I hope lots of people find comfort in his music thanks to this review
Let&#39;s be honest here, nothing was ever going to be like Worlds. Hoping for it was a waste of time but with that said the very happy sunshine optimistic record which is Nurture, isn&#39;t for me personally. Not a big fan of &quot;happy&quot; music in general. Can see why people may like it though.
boosting this amazing review
POG CHAMPION
Please review head above the waters by dijahsb i feel like its not getting enough traction even tho its a great hiphop/rap album in my opinion
Love ya dude. You are a special person Fantano and I am glad to be alive alongside you buddy. <br><br>Stay safe and keep it up far-away brother and thank you for your reviews and all the work you do.<br><br>Much love from Ohio.
&quot;the Discovery of this generation&quot;<br>damn.<br><br>i adore Wind Tempos is such a sad but beautiful song, im glad he liked it a lot as well, one of the best experimental songs Porter ever did.
You say worlds wasn&#39;t your flavor but aren&#39;t you supposed to give the least biased album reviews you can
Aaaaaaaa OMG AAAAAAAAAAAAA
Man Fantano really liking these boring ass albums lately, but I&#39;m glad he&#39;s putting some respec&#39; on Porter
The very surprising overwhelmingly positive light shined on this album by Fantano here is ALMOST enough to help me cope with the heartwrenching 7-year continuation of Worlds-bashing in the beginning of this review. I think you have to have been a member of the EDM community around that time to really understand that album. Still mine and many others&#39; favorite of all time.
not many people can understand how great of a track dullscythe is
NOTHING BBUT BANGERS FROM PORTER
Anyone recognize the vinyl on melon‚Äôs shelf?
I honestly think Worlds is better and Unfold is the best song on the album so you‚Äôre still on my shit list melon
melon just doesn‚Äôt understand dullscythe yet, it‚Äôs one of the most concussively glowing songs i‚Äôve ever heard
‚Äúthe discovery of this generation‚Äù beautiful.
Look At The Sky and Musician are both classic Porter Robinson anthems. Loved this album overall.
why is he to referring him as robinson lolll
The few songs I listened to made me feel like I was lobotomized and pumped full of Adderall.
the &quot;spellbinding.&quot; genuinely had me thinking this was a 10
DULLSCYTHE ENJOYERS RISE UP!!
LESSSSSGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 8/10
This album sucks
And here I was expecting 6 or below, ready to smash the dislike button. Not today. Well done.
Good review Anthony, but stripping and flagellating yourself while begging Porter to forgive you for your atrocious review of &quot;Worlds&quot; and also wanting him to be your friend seems kinda desperate and tacky.
How he compared it to Discovery and generally described the impact of the album on himself, kinda weird that it&#39;s only an 8.  Tbf tho, 9/10 record.  Love it.
i was so worried this was gonna get a score similar to Worlds. sad you didn&#39;t touch on the lyrical content though, that&#39;s one of the best parts of the album
thank god melon gave this a good review or else I would‚Äôve had to return my deluxe edition vinyl box set and stop listening to porter all together
This completes me.
SOMETHING OVER A 7 LETS GOOOOO
do gojira
oh wow i haven‚Äôt even listened to it yet but i am glad he liked it bc it seems like everyone else really wanted Porter Robinson to have some acclaim. glad this turned out well, guess i will have to get around to checking him out.
character development
Only a few songs into this and very glad I‚Äôm listening
NURTURE IS SO GOOD AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Damn I had a hard time recommending some tracks from this last year to my peers, mostly because we didn&#39;t connect with electro/edm stuff much. However his secret sky set in 2020 was really amazing and I keep coming back to the singles to destress.
REVIEW THE NEW CRUMB ALBUM PLEASEEE
The second half of dullsythe is one of the most beautiful pieces of music ever recorded
Nice
This time its real
unfold not on favorite tracks is a human rights violation
LETS GOOOOO Porter truly is a legend to this modern generation
8/10, its beautiful
Any time I see the flannel I always think 10. It‚Äôs been 2 years Anthony, just give us a 10.
I know that it‚Äôs just Fantano‚Äôs opinion, but dullscythe is a freaking banger, its second part is so beautiful and it has so much nostalgic vibes.
finally i can rest
PORTER DID IT BOYS HE GOT AN 8 LETS GO
see yellow flannel, is not 10/10, close the video
The review is 9 minutes long fantano you should&#39;ve given this a 9 smh
You still have Worlds wrong
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKtqB-SFIaw&amp;t=168">2:48</a> LOOK AT THE SKYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Dullscythe is my favorite track. The second half is especially beautiful.
eh i like his brother better
The best part about nurture to me is that it&#39;s an album about artistic growth that embraces the aesthetics of literal, natural growth. After 7 years of waiting, we got something that felt like a huge step forwards in every way, and it takes that fact to heart.
&quot;Spellbinding&quot; indeed, melon.
I was expecting a ten until dull scythe. I really liked dull scythe though.
I can sleep now
I gave the album a 6.4/10. I wish I liked it more but I‚Äôm grateful I liked the songs i liked
He actually LIKED it?!
I&#39;VE BEEN MANIFESTING AN 8 SINCE THIS ALBUM CAME OUT IT FUCKING WORKED I SCREAMED AS SOON AS I SAW THE YELLOW FLANNEL
Truly a masterpiece.
THJIS IS FUCKING REDEMPTION YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
It‚Äôs really cool to hear a mainstream edm artist make what is basically an ambient record
REDEMPTION
REVIEW THE NEW DINOSUAR JR ALBUM, OR ELSE I WILL BURN DOWN YOUR HOUSE WITH LEMONS!!!
Makes me satisfied that melon likes a Porter record :‚Äô) but dullsythe is the best song on the album you uncultured bald fuck
Am I the only one that seems to appreciate dullscythe? It‚Äôs not necessarily a ‚Äúsong‚Äù per se, but it‚Äôs craziness makes it so great and beautiful
Digital Grass
Wind Tempos is song of the year.
Mirror is the biggest grower. Give it a few more listens you will realise it&#39;s probably the best track on the record.
Less overpowering and more enveloping
YELLOW FLANNEL!!!!!
Man, I absolutely loved this album. I‚Äôm happy I‚Äôve have it an 8 because I think it deserves a lot of credit in my opinion. For me, it was a solid 9, but I do understand the points made in the video.
If you like grandiose cinematic electronic then listen to the new Lido
melon seems extra nice today
BASED
Dreamland 2021 review please!!!
I like the face you&#39;re making in the thumbnail
Not a prior fan of Porter&#39;s, but really been enjoying this album a whole lot. I know I should go back and check out Worlds at some point too and give it a fair chance with an open mind. In terms of favourite tracks, I&#39;d be quick to put Unfold up there, take Dullscythe out of least fav, and replace it with do-re-mi.
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
nurture getting an 8 now i can sleep well
&gt; Yellow Flannel<br><br>FELLOW GAMERS, WE HAVE WON
a surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one
Yeah, first listen through wind tempos was the one that stood out. Amazing album.
porter is trash
This whole album truely is incredible ‚òÄÔ∏è
Like cool and all but it took me a minute for me to actually realize when he was talking about Look At The Sky when he compared it to Daft Punk&#39;s One More Time. Even had to rewind for me to get it lmao
From a 5 to an 8, this truly is something comforting
He forgot to mention Mirror<br>He forgot to mention Mirror<br>He forgot to mention Mirror <br>He forgot to mention Mirror <br>He forgot to mention Mirror <br>He forgot to mention Mirror <br>He forgot to mention Mirror <br>He forgot to mention Mirror <br>üò©üò©üò©üò©üò©üò©üò©üò©üò©
This makes me happy
ILL FUCKING TAKE IT BABY
I now forgive you for giving Good Faith a 6 üòÇ
LET&#39;S FUCKING GOOOOOOO
didn‚Äôt even mention mirror lol
fantano experimenting with zooming in and out of your face I see you
What&#39;s the album above Pure Comedy?
You fucking LOVE to see it!!
i‚Äôve haven‚Äôt fell in love with an album this much in awhile
this is defintely what we like to see
YESS!!! I&#39;m here before Bandstand
I am so fucking happy he likes this album. Porter really dropped it at the perfect time, been on repeat since
&quot;It&#39;s like listening to some kind of artificial intelligence have a religious experience.&quot;
Oh my god... we have unlocked<br><br><b>the good ending</b>
weebthony futano
Holy shit Porter Robinson is BACK?!?! FUCK YEAH
Put some respect on his name! r/porterrobinson letssss go!
Boo bah... is that a teletubbies reference?
I definitely do not like his vocals on this album.. was let down tbh. Need more instrumental songs. WORLDS&gt; NURTURE
Melon man... you have redeemed yourself. I‚Äôll forget about the Worlds review now
I did NOT expect the flannel to come out, very happy with it though
HOLY SHIIIIIIT ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
This is huge improvement over Worlds. My main issue with that album is it was cluttered with EDM tropes like adding a bunch of singers and being eclectic in pop electronic. Nurture is a journey of the self that Worlds should‚Äôve been. It encapsulates a lot of things that make Porter such a unique artist in a genre that‚Äôs sort of fading. The inclusion of those chipmunk  vocals remind me a bit of Quasimoto/madlib. It‚Äôs spruce with a lot of great ideas that propel the album into a nature setting. I dug the direction and sentiment that Porter was going for this album. Plus the tracks like Dullscythe and Musician are dope. Only issue with this album is the pacing and some of the mixing can be unbearable like Unfold. Still, Nurture is a glistening project of hope and wonder that takes sound to a promising end.
Instant AOTY
everything is pardonned anthony
Well deserved üëè
so good, so feel good make u smile type album
lessgooo
SOMETHING COMFORTING
Could have sworn we were cruising toward a 9 but glad you enjoyed it too. The album actually did inspire me to stop living selfishly and start taking care of myself for the sake of my loved ones.
Anthony I drove by the house and saw your garage door was open, no cars in it. I pressed the button and ran out before it closed on me. Just looking out for you and your things!
Well done on getting this one right anthony!
What‚Äôs the album in the back?
One of my biggest influences ever getting the love that his new album DESERVES :&#39;)
Review &quot;Te Amo L√° Fora&quot; by Duda Beat please!!!
LETS GO
I have waited years for this &lt;3
LETS GOOOOO HUGE W ANTKNEE, this album is a masterpiece, people will come around if they hatin, it‚Äôs so great
üò≥üò≥üò≥üò≥üò≥
This is one of the most beautiful albums I‚Äôve heard in a while. 10/10 imo.
Next time, I need VirtualSelf album ü§©
ngl Worlds was a game changer for me. Nurture was different and wasnt as impactful for me
saying that this is ‚Äúthe discovery of this generation‚Äù is probably one of the best things someone could say about your music tbh
FINALLY
WORLDS is goated
‚ÄúThe Discovery of this generation‚Äù<br><br>Damn that‚Äôs a pretty high praise
Review Khaled!
How did he skip over Mirror?  Honestly a CenterPoint in the LP.  Good review overall, Album absolutely slaps.  Nurture &gt; Worlds imo
Fantano based
I feel like the sound palette of this album is pure 2000‚Äôs singer-sogwriter; Baths, Imogen Heap, glitch-era Get Scraped deadmau5, plaid. The way the drums are textured is absolute perfection by my sensibilities. <br><br>Also, like, there‚Äôs these lil high pitched glitch sounds (zippo lighter being opened sounds??) that are completely out of the acoustic range of the entire song. Sweet time and mother would be waaay too consistent otherwise but the lil sounds snap my ears to attention and reset the fatigue every time. GOD I love this album.
I trust the Yellow Flannel. Forever.
THE REDEMPTION
AYE YUH
This album hit at the perfect time
WOOOOOOO
Look, I&#39;m happy for Porter Robinson and all, but I&#39;m just waiting for Nav to put out another album so that he can get a 5th NOT GOOD in a row
Melon confirms Nurture is good
Worlds was so good man
I mean he&#39;s going to double down on his Worlds review, ik he doesn&#39;t like it but the critisms barley make any sense. It&#39;s like saying I don&#39;t like rock because there was overly distorted guitars with the vocals... As a reviewer your supposed to give some objective view on art, weird when you see his 10&#39;s. Who care nuture 8
Thank you for loving this album as much as I did, Melon, you da best
NURTURE AOTY
YEEEEEES FINALLY
Fantastic review, PLEASE review Robotaki‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Grand Mirage‚Äù one of the best electronic albums released last year
OH MY FUCKING GOD lets go
I think Porter could really appreciate this review.
character development
A welcome surprise
Damn, saying it‚Äôs the Discovery of this generation is high praise considering that Porter‚Äôs favorite artist is Daft Punk. Glad he liked this one even though Worlds didn‚Äôt grow on him.
its what he deserves
YEAAAAAAAAAAA
OMG 8!!
Wind Tempos actually made me cry when the halfway point hit like gods damn it hits the high that that recent Wolf Alice track Last Man On Earth tried to do but didn&#39;t pull off
It&#39;s a good time to be a Porter fanboy
‚ÄúSpellbound‚Äù<br>LOL
Love Porter. But still waiting for the London Grammar review, melon!!!
alright alright alright imma give this one a listen at work tomorrow.
Thanks for taking your time with this one Melon :)
Porter robinson with an 8? Okay I listen to it
The first song sounds like some Sims loading music
I searched for this review around 1h ago, but there was just the Worlds review, and then it appeared 30 minutes later lol
lesgoooo
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKtqB-SFIaw&amp;t=169">2:49</a>, what track is he talking about? I&#39;m assuming look at the sky?
YES, the meme has come true. Back with the yellow flannel, this time for real üí™
Awesome follow up to Worlds :) Even more heartfelt now!
Honestly what a great review. The word choice you used was intriguing but very accurate. It was to the point but still gave enough insight to these songs and the album as a whole. The more critical points of the review felt deserved (even if dullscythe is my favorite song of both the album and the year). Overall, very enjoyable and glad to see you enjoyed this album as much as you did. (also you did a better job of explaining the issues with worlds here than you did in you review so nice)
Dude the nurture = discovery connection is THE highest compliment porter coulda got for the album
A good Porter Robinson album?????????????????????? I NEED THIS. I NEED THIS AT AN IN-PERSON FESTIVAL.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKtqB-SFIaw&amp;t=255">4:15</a> I loved your comment on wind tempos - its probably one of my favorite tracks on nurture, such an incredible song that defines the album imo
Friendship restored with Porter Robinson
melon giving respect to porter is what we all needed, but i still cant get over calling him &quot;robinson&quot; since we all just say porter in the community and it really throws me off
W
&quot;The Discovery of this generation,&quot; Wow...
Ngl I did not see Melon giving Nurture an 8. What a happy surprise! I loved this album personally
You know the album was worth the wait when even Fantano is in love
Riddim
Loved it and I&#39;ve never liked porter much spitfire, virtual self and world&#39;s all felt lacking to me (though I do think you were too harsh on worlds) but this album felt whole to me it felt satisfying and refreshing in comparison to the others similarly I feel the same about Madeons new record which follows a similar path of me not enjoying his early works but finding his new record to be a fulfilling experience. I particularly agreed with your comparison to discovery
Anthony is fucking based, not just for this review he&#39;s just very based
MASSIVE W.<br><br>(please listen to nurture btw, it&#39;s one of the most sincere and candid albums i&#39;ve ever listened to)
quite an amazing album! while i dont like it as much as Worlds i definitely do enjoy it a lot and can definitely see it growing on me.
Honestly you stole the words out of my mouth
‚ÄúLeast favorite tracks: DULLSCYTHE‚Äù<br><br>Fuck you melon that‚Äôs the best track and I can‚Äôttttttt...have a good day. Opinion a fine.
I absolutely loved this album. Glad Anthony agrees
Melon forehead so shiny I saw the review score right as I hit play. üëç
loved this review, but trust me when I say that dullsythe is a masterpiece, and it&#39;s only a matter of time before everyone realizes that
Comparing Nurture to Discovery is very high praise!! That&#39;s awesome
Oh shit
LETS GO BOYS
Relationship with Anthony mended.
this is either going to be in the top 10 of fantanos best of list or number 1.. because he seems in love
BOOBA?
Wind Tempos forever.
how is unfold not in favorite tracks melon
2021 so far by your melon<br><br><br><br>10: 0<br><br>9: 1 (Promises)<br>8: 15<br>7: 14<br>6: 11<br>5: 10<br>4: 4<br>3: 3<br>2: 1 (The Battle at Garden&#39;s Gate)<br>1: 0<br><br>No Score: 2 (OK ORCHESTRA, Fearless (Taylor&#39;s Version)<br>Not Good: 1 (For Those That Wish to Exist)<br>Not Bad: 1 (The Future Bites)
The only thing Anthony does all day is play his Pure Comedy vinyl just to hear the line ‚ÄúBedding Taylor Swift every night inside the oculus rift‚Äù and then returns it back to the shelf
Did he actually just call this &quot;the Discovery of our generation&quot; what the fuck lol
I love how blissed out this album is.
MY HEART LITERALLY JUMPED OMG
i love how we were all prepared for a 5 or a 6, a decent 8 is a present from above
This is one of the more surprising yellow flannels I‚Äôve seen in a good bit
please step on me anthony
We&#39;re waiting for yasuke!!
im glad you rated this album the way you did, since it means a lot to me right now. and i totally agree with the rating on it. there are some solid songs on it, meanwhile a few just seem a little lackluster. but overall glad that you agree &lt;3
I can only imagine how it would feel to have your album described as the &quot;Discovery of this generation&quot;
His least favourite song is my favourite lmaoaoao
And so, peace was once again restored to the land, and the war was finally over. The end.
All the EDM white girls will spare you this time for this review
&quot;I feel like this is like the Discovery of this generation&quot;<br><br>...<br><br>LET&#39;S FUCKING GOOOOOO
We got an 8, which is kinda like 10.
Decent to strong 8, and he described it as &quot;this generation&#39;s Discovery&quot; (daft punk). Holy shit.
I&#39;m really glad that Mr Melon liked Nurture. Maybe he&#39;ll be forgiven for his Worlds review, just maybe...
FUCK YEAH FINALLY AHHHHH ITS A SERVEEE
This review almost feels kinda rushed... there were some portions where I didn‚Äôt completely know what Anthony was talk about
Whats the album to the right of him?
Flying lotus. Make the video.
It feels good having a record we can both like for once Anthony.
FINALLY
How it must feel to have this curse melted away
Ha ha funny video laughed so hard I peed all over my sweaty feet
Cover art is awesome üëè
review Gojira - Fortitude please!
‚ÄúThis is the Discovery of this generation‚Äù man wow
Yellow flannel
good review anthony fantano
Yeah but is it as good as the Porter Robinson BBC1 essential mix from 2014?
What was the first track you were talking about for the first 4 minutes?
I thought it would be a 9 but ill take it, love this album.
WTF AN 8 OMGGGG.
From a 5 on World&#39;s to an 8 on Nuture, just goes to show the growth of Porter. He&#39;s found his sound and it&#39;s beautiful. Great review bald man! Who knows, his next album might be a 10?
dude he forgot mirror and that‚Äôs like the whole point of the album
funny fact: <br><br>‚ÄúMusician‚Äù is a unreleased collab of Porter Robinson and Kero Kero Bonito. He just sampled his own unreleased. Lol
YELLOW FLANNEL LETS GOOOOOOOOOO
YELLOW FLANNEL
thank you anthony, this review was very spellbinding.
I am SO glad Porter&#39;s getting positive attention here before and I hope it&#39;ll turn many on to his music. For me, on lonely nights, not even in the edgy or over the top doomer way, I find myself VERY deeply connected to his music. There&#39;s an instant wave of reminiscent nostalgia of a better time I can&#39;t quite put my finger on that very few other artists replicate for me. You feel simultaneously a melancholic wave wash over you while feeling hopeless. It always leaves me feeling different emotions with moods each time, and it&#39;s not uncommon for the aesthetic to completely swap my perspective in the span of two listening sessions. Sometimes, Anamanaguchi scratches the same itch...but not nearly to the same degree, haha. I think you put it the best way you could: Spellbinding. Simply spellbinding.
YELLOW FLANNEL YELLOW FLANNEL
GIVE. ME. THE. 10
I&#39;m making it a buy to own it for an eternity. Good review
THANK YOU, SIR! ‚ò∫üôè<br>üî•üî•üî•
Most satisfying review I‚Äôve watched:)
Isnt this Nick Robinsons brother?
8
Nurture is far far greater than Worlds, 8.5/10 in my book
I like how you spend the first two minutes of this review digging yourself into a deeper grave üòÖ
Didnt care for it myself but I&#39;m glad to see this review lift so many spirits!
Review PUTA by Zahara please
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKtqB-SFIaw&amp;t=169">2:49</a> he never says the name of the song he&#39;s describing but I&#39;m almost certain he&#39;s talking about look at the sky as its the first full song on the album and it comes before the next song he talks about (get your wish)
&quot;What living in Animal Crossing must be like.&quot; -Anthony Fantano

Redemption arc, you love to see it
You‚Äôre forgiven for swimming.
The redemption arc. Weebs in boys
I‚Äôve seen so many Goodbye to a World AMV‚Äôs so this is very cathartic
melon dont act like you dont want to review the NEW DJ KHALED ALBUMM
se viene
Porter Interview????
On behalf of PRD, you have been forgiven for your past sins
Damn, did not expect the yellow flannel for this :&#39;) You love to see it!<br><br>Edit: &quot;The Discovery of this generation&quot; damn that&#39;s such a good way of putting it
PORTER AND A YELLOW FLANNEL LETS GOOOOOOO
YESS!!!! I love this album so much. I love this direction for Porter SO much. It makes me really happy that Melon is enjoying.
da children drop
The cover Art describes perfectly the listening experience!
i dont even watch your reviews anymore, i just listen to whatever album youre reviewing and drop a like
Positive porter review. Nature is healing‚ù§Ô∏è
Weird, this doesn‚Äôt look like ‚ÄúDJ Khaled - KHALED KHALED: NOT GOOD‚Äù Review... how odd
Porter stans, did you get your wish?
this album was an emotional roller coaster.
You didnt caught something in your eye, Melon, let your feelings come to you ;)
I didn&#39;t expect it. I love this album
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKtqB-SFIaw&amp;t=170">2:50</a> you talk about a certain song for like, 30 seconds but you never say which song it is you‚Äôre talking about????????
poopface
A good review holy shitttttt
I got excited for a second because I mistook the cover art for the upcoming Squid album
this gotta be a 9
Very good Fantano, very good.
Love this album so much. Glad melon did as well!
This doesn&#39;t look like a 10/10 review for &quot;Fortitude&quot; by Gojira
instantly one of my favorite albums of all time
I was not expecting such a good review. Very pleased!
Day 5 of asking Anthony to review the new Dinosaur Jr Lp.
holy crap by his expression on the beginning i thought he was gonna give it a 10, still good album
Anthony Fantano finally admitted his favorite anime show he&#39;s been watching for a while.
Yeah. Nurture &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Worlds
wait which song are you saying is the One More Time? Look at the Sky?
i was worried cause he was taking so long to drop a review. don‚Äôt do this to us melon
Nice.
YES
nice!
No joke here, just here to say Nurture‚Äôs an incredibly beautiful, heartfelt album that feels like a warm hug that we‚Äôve all needed for quite some time.
The album is really, really bad and boring.
im gonna listen to the album, bc the cover art is fire
Well deserved score
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOO
Oh god yellow shirt.
I&#39;m still waiting for you to review &quot;Smooth&quot; by Carlos Santana and the singer of Matchbox Twenty, Rob Thomas. The 1999 hit single to win Grammy of the year, album of the year, and record of the year! Proving that it was the hit single to close the last millennium!
I see yellow, serotonin rises
Let me guess they are gonna dislike this video like worlds?.
HE GOT IT RIGHT
Best album of this year, nice
Good review!!
B O O T H O N Y  B A N T A N O   H E R E
porter is always good
Now this is the good shit
this album makes me feel intense sadness. i love it but can&#39;t listen to it at the same time, it&#39;s really a weird experience.
Ah yes, now I can finally watch Fantano again because he finally gave Porter the score he deserves, feels good to be back after 7 years!
Holyyyyyy shiiiit Melon you outdid yourself on this one. Thanks for cementing my personal opinion in the album dawg
Anthony why do you have a photo of my child laying face down in the grass on your wall
Hope you had a good day Melon!!!!
YEAHHHH POSITIVE REVIEW FOR PORTER LET&#39;S GOOO!!
Nurture average review
First
Love you Melon
THANK YOU ANTHONY. THE PORTER COMMUNITY APPRECIATES YOUR VALUED INPUT.
You should check out some Seven Lions :)
YELLOW FLANNEL LESSFUCKINGGOOOOOOO!!!!
FANTANO YOU SLY DOG
Original guess: low 9üò≥idk havent heard yet
I&#39;m glad to see planking is making a comeback
Thanks, I needed an opinion on this album
The description made me think this was going to be a ten. üôÉ
This is an out of nowhere positive review
Anthony is my father.
FUCKING FINALLY!!!
The redemption arc I didn‚Äôt know I needed
absolutely based but Unfold should be in best tracks imo
Hi
I wanna porter your robinson <br><br><br><br>I‚Äôm sorry. Please forgive me
Another case of 8/10 syndrome
Don&#39;t lie Anthony you only rated it well to avoid him insulting you on the interview
Thanks Fantano! I can now tell my friends their opinion is wrong :)!
A GENIUS ALBUMüò§üò§üò§<br><br>ps: deserved a 9 but still
PORTER GAAAAAAAANG<br>Edit: ‚ÄúThe Discovery of this Generation‚Äù I‚Äôm so happy for Porter and his album, that‚Äôs such an amazing praise
Let&#39;s goooooo
Damn, ok earliest I‚Äôve been here
An 8, LETS GOOOOOOOOO
It‚Äôs those anime guys
Porter getting the respect he deserves. I might just forgive Melon for his Worlds review.
Shitty pop
LETS GOOOOOO
ANTHONY FANTANO
DAMN RIGHT
first but i cant think of a racist joke rip
I loved this album!
One of the best albums of 2021 imo. It&#39;s so rare to see Electronic music done so raw and passionately but with a brilliant ear for melody and sound. This is Porter pushing Electronic further beyond it&#39;s boundaries, perhaps even more so than Worlds did. It&#39;s such a stunning album filled with moments of pure genius and heartbreak. Definitely would reccomend even if you don&#39;t like Electronic Music, it&#39;s worth the listen.<br><br>Definitely a 9 for me
I keep waiting for that next 10
he gave it a 6, just kidding i haven‚Äôt watched it yet.
Nice melon
Gay
IT&#39;S HERE
