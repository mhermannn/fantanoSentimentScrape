hi everyone bootheny botano here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new porter robinson album nurture this is the latest full-length lp from electronic music producer and songwriter porter robinson seven years after the release of his beloved debut worlds an album that admittedly when it first dropped i was not into it it did not get a positive review and i still get a lot of crap for that review to this day and i can't really say i've warmed up to the album all that much since i mean i get it's one of the more respected records of the 2010s when it comes to electro pop and edm aesthetics but i just don't care for how those sounds come together on this particular lp the overly idyllic and sunny group vocals combined with how overpowering artificial and fantastical the instrumentation comes across i just don't really care for the the flavor of this record i could say more but i'm not here to rile up anybody's uh world's review related ptsd besides i was actually looking forward to this new record not just because i thought all the teasers were legitimately great but it's also been a pretty long time since world's dropped at this point and i know since the release of this lp robinson has had his hands in other things but it's still a very large gap between records so i figure something new and exciting has to have been cooking up in that time especially since much of the edm landscape robinson was pulling inspiration from at that point has changed radically since then now i don't know this might be weird to think for some robinson fans but personally i see nurture here as being leaps and bounds better than worlds and this is despite both projects scratching similarly escapist itches as nurture is a fairly feel good blissful shimmering project but the sound palettes robinson employs this time around are a lot more nuanced gauzy less overpowering and more enveloping there is a softer and slightly more organic approach on the vocals too which i greatly appreciate which i find to be way more listenable than a lot of the tacky and faux epic singing performances strewn about worlds and while japanese pop and media soundtracks have served as an inspiration in robinson's stuff for a while it seems to bleed through even harder here especially in the piano work that pops up occasionally folk music actually takes center stage on a few tracks too blending in perfectly with the generally joyous and dreamy vibes of this record nurture is a consistent project but still one with a lot of versatility in its track list a lot of highlights too one of the first songs on the record this may be a stretch for some people but i really feel like this is the one more time of the album it's just that euphoric dance anthem with a driving beat super addictive ear worm chorus setting an epic and otherworldly tone for the record now of course robinson pulls these core parallels off with a radically different set of sounds and aesthetics there i think also is a pretty strong difference in who this album is meant to appeal to at the time it is being released maybe a societally neglected generation of terminally online kids using anime and music to soften the blow of their pandemic ravaged reality now following this track is the equally sunny get your wish the crisp drums and digitized bird sounds underscore some really cheery synthesizers that feel like the soundtrack to a japanese rpg from the 90s all of these elements building to some amazingly heavy dance beats around the midpoint i also love the cute but alien manipulations on the lead vocals from this track and many others on this lp2 they add to the records feelings of immersion that all this music just everything here is coming from a different place a different dimension wind tempos is an interesting change of pace for the first leg of the record it's the longest song on this project at six minutes and not because the track undergoes some long winding epic progression or build or something no the whole first leg of the track is taken up by this part minimal part glitch piano passage eventually giving way to this delicate solo piano piece that is so beautiful it's difficult to describe the digitally mangled vocals that pop in on top of these pianos on the back end are strangely beautiful and moving it's like listening to uh some kind of artificial intelligence have a religious experience the track musician is another enjoyable one here for me it's a jittery pop number that sounds like a combination of the quaintness of the postal service some very pillowy shoegaze sonics and the collective intuition of like 12 bedroom producers do remy faso latido is a very cute semi-acoustic number i love the return of the nature sounds on this track as well as the gently pulsating beats all of which undergo these very speedy edge of your seat progressions this track to me feels like uh what living in animal crossing must be like the very euphoric and hazy electronic pop continues on to the song mother which lyrically gives away one of the most beautiful and heartfelt sentiments of the entire record but the following dull scythe does begin the start of a miniature dip on nurture for me keep in mind so far i do love the crossroads of glitch and piano music on this record but here it goes a little awry the various passages of this track separately are fine but the way they connect or don't connect creates a pretty jarring four minutes that doesn't really go much of anywhere in terms of like momentum or direction meanwhile the pacing on the track suite time for me did leave a little bit to be desired at its core the track feels like one of those slow burning pumping dramatic 80s anthems but ultimately it wasn't pushed far enough in the end thankfully the throttling dance beats pick the pace up once again on something comforting then blossom is a gorgeous acoustic number the track unfold sees a crossover with totally extinct dinosaurs the extra vocal layers i think help bring the record to a grand finish then trying to feel alive felt to me almost like a credits roll moment for the record but seriously what an enchanting record jeez you know it's not often i want to use language like spellbound because it seems like you know really pretentious and but i i did really feel spellbound by numerous portions of this thing it's just so pretty and i mean it's it really feels like the cover it feels like laying in a uh just a a sunny field of sweet smelling digital grass you know it's it's not a perfect record by any means there were a few tracks that i was a little mild on in terms of reaction but uh in some respects to take it back to the first comparison i made earlier in the review i feel like this is like the discovery of this generation you know it's uh very much an electronic music record that uh runs conceptual cinematic uh very holistic in its presentation of songs and aesthetics the flow of the record too and i don't know i mean i i feel like um that's really the highest compliment i could give it like regardless of score or descriptions or anything like that you know for some reason i just couldn't get that comparison or similarity out of my head and of course i mean that in the most flattering way possible and it feels weird to make it because i'm sure some people are going to listen to this record um based on that comparison and think oh this sounds nothing like uh discovery sounds nothing like daft punk and yeah you're right to observe that aesthetically that there isn't a whole lot of overlap but again both records to me uh felt very grandiose cinematic uh very holistic and i came away from both with just a positive glowing inspired feeling which i hope if you listen to this you get from it as well i'm feeling a decent two strong eight on this one tran position have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it
