        "original_comment": "Nurture Review\r<br>\r<br>Jake Peffley 9/20/21\r<br>\r<br>Before I get into the bulk of this material, I want to explain my thoughts on Porter’s music in general, and how I got turned onto him. Back in 2016, when I was either 12 or 13, I was recommended Porter’s legendary track, “Shelter”. At the time, this was one of, if not the most beautiful track I had ever heard. The mix of synth-pop instrumentation, obscure female vocal sample passages, and heart wrenching lyrics, I was infatuated with the track instantly. So Obviously after hearing this, I had to check out his other material. Now although I did like overall his SpitFire EP, what I did not expect was how amazingly surprised I was at his earth-shattering debut album, “Worlds”. From the Enormous “Divinity”, to the more melancholic tracks such as, “Fellow feeling”, or “Goodbye to a world”, there is NEVER a dull moment on this record. After listening to this album religiously for about a year, I was really wondering where Porter would go with his sound next, which leads me to Nurture.\r<br>\r<br>The roll out for this album was spectacular, not only because every track promoting this album was Stellar, but also the aesthetics of the art work, really resonated with me. What I’ll finish this thought up with, is that the Album cover looks like what the album sounds like, Laying face down in a field of digital grass. A very Warm, melancholic, but freeing mixture of emotions.\r<br>\r<br>For my actual review, I will be going track by track, and listing all of the qualities that stand out to me, but before doing this, I just want to say every track on here is amazing in their own way, and spoiler, I believe this album to be nothing less than a 10. (which is rare coming from me.)\r<br>\r<br>Lifelike: A beautiful mix of folk, glitch hop, and electronic music, that serve as an amazing opener to this project. From the beautiful pianos, to the subtle vocals porter lays into the track, I think it works so well. \r<br>\r<br>Look at the sky: One of my personal favorites here, given the sentiment alone. “Look at the sky, I’m still here. I’ll be Alive next year.” This single line was almost enough to make me tear up, considering the timing of this album roll out. The pandemic had shown my true colors of what I am on the inside, relating to my depression, and existential thoughts. Hearing Porter repeat this phrase over and over, really did make me feel comforted. Something I was in desperate need of. Now going into the instrumental, Again there’s a mix of folky strings, and the electronic synths and samples porter is so good at orchestrating. Overall this track feels very uplifting.\r<br>\r<br>Get your wish: This track is a great little song about moving forward. The instant standout in this track for me, is the soul crushing electronic instrumentation Porter implements when singing the chorus“So tell me how it felt, when you walked on water, did you get your wish.” This is a big part about what I love in the album, how Porter uses his amazing electronic mastery, as well as these folk elements to really emphasize the message he’s trying to portray.\r<br>\r<br>Wind Tempos: This is probably the most underrated track on the album, and is easily in my top 5. The piano / violin duo that makes up the intro is certainly beautiful, however what this eventually blossoms into is one of the most exhilarating, and heart wrenching things I think I’ve ever heard. Basically, over these melancholic pianos, a female-like android’s vocals are added. Now, it’s hard to describe, but in Fantano’s words, it sounds like she’s going through a “religious experience.” This is definitely one of the tracks that makes more sense when executed, then explained, so go listen to it, as that’s better than any explanation I could give.\r<br>\r<br>Musician: Being the most upbeat track on here, Musician offers a much needed exciting feeling to this record, and succeeds in flying colors. From the synth pop sound, to the enthusiastic lead vocals, Musician is one of the catchiest songs in the bunch.\r<br>\r<br>Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do: The second track with no lyrics, which serves as an interlude of sorts. One could maybe write this song off as being not as exciting as the other tracks, and on one hand while I slightly agree, I think this track has a feeling of frolicking in a field of digital flowers.(Which more than makes up for the lack of structure, in my opinion.)\r<br>\r<br>Mother: One of the most beautiful sentiments on the record, seeing porter express his love for his parents, while at the same time grieving the feeling of growing up. The heavy synths that Porter layers his passionate vocals on top of, truly makes this track one a “Happy Cry Moment.”\r<br>\r<br>dullscythe: Another fully instrumental cut here, with most of the track filled up with glitching piano, drum, and synths, that all add on top of one another, and eventually all give away to show a cavernous piano solo at the end. I can see this track leaving some of Porter&#39;s fans, and general listeners, kind of confused, however I think this weird little passage is very unique, and fits into the album quite well.\r<br>\r<br>Sweet Time: I need a girl that will treat me like Porter treats his fiance. This whole track is dedicated to Porter having a fear of death, not because of his own mortality, no he’s just scared that he will never be able to see his fiance ever again. She is so important to him, that he would not be able to live without her, and this is something that is so beautiful to me. As for the instrumentation, the nocturnal drums, spacious synths, and the wasm feeling add to Porter&#39;s very heartfelt lyrics in a beautiful way. And once these sounds build up, a new layer of spaced out synth tones make way for porter to repeat these same sentiments, but hitting harder due to this space he has allowed for himself to fit over.\r<br>\r<br>Mirror: As you may know, Nurture arrived 7 whole years after worlds, due to Porter kind of doubting himself and his art, given past criticisms, and fear he would not live up to his full potential. This song is basically addressing that confrontation, and sounding beautiful while doing it. The majority of this track is the repeated chorus, “And I know you&#39;ll say how I&#39;m a burden. Yeah, do your worst all at once, I know what you want from me, from me\r<br>I know what you&#39;re thinking, And it&#39;s not the voice of all the others, You&#39;ve only said it to yourself, I know what you want from me, from me, I know what you&#39;re thinking.”\r<br>\r<br>Something Comforting: My favorite song on the album, maybe even my favorite song of all time. The constant feeling of being let down, feeling like there&#39;s nothing you can do, and wanting, needing, and CRAVING something that will comfort you, having someone that will give you comforting words, is something that I connect with, on a deeply personal level. The Electronic, Folk, Synthpop, and glitch hop sounds that pop up here are almost as powerful as the ideas presented here in Porter&#39;s lyrics. I’m not ashamed to say this, but the first time I heard this track, I basically bawled my eyes out. Everytime I hear this track, I tear up slightly. It just hits so close to home, that I can’t help but be addicted to the feeling this track gives me. And Porter If you’re reading this, which you probably aren’t, thank you for making this song, I love and adore you for it.\r<br>\r<br>Blossom: A beautiful little guitar ballad, written to his Fiance, with the same sentiment of the track sweet time.TThis one really doubles down on the feels, like I said before, being fully guitar driven. It’s very easy to see how much Porter deeply, and truly is enamoured with this person, Especially the tone of voice he uses  when he says “If I can’t stop time.” and “I just want you happy.” A great transition into the outstanding outro tracks of this album.\r<br>\r<br>Unfold: A top 3 track for me, and I think the heaviest track Porter has ever put out, sonically. The track starts out with these weird pitched up vocals that build up into the chorus, that just blows me away e=very single time I hear it. From the Crashing percussion, to the heavily layered, yet also spacious synths, I seriously don’t know how a human is able to come up with this kind of sound. As the track continues, Porter repeats this Chorus, “As I watch the Water Unfold, It’s a feeling I want you to know. Cuz I’m not the same as I was, as I shoulder the weight of the world.” and gets more and more demented, and heartbroken. It really makes you feel as if the Earth is falling apart at the seams, and nothing is real. A real mindblower for sure.\r<br>\r<br>Trying to feel alive: The last track on this album, and is a damn good finish. This is another track for me that is extremely relatable, as well. The main theme I pulled from this is that Porter is trying to get all of these things that he thinks will fulfill him, and give him purpose, and is underwhelmed, constantly on the search for a greater purpose in Living. With these thoughts in mind, Porter proposes that maybe he doesn’t NEED to feel, “Alive.” The dissatisfaction in life is inevitable, and he uses this to drive himself forward, and give himself purpose. \r<br>\r<br>Overall, I think Porter has really done something special with this project, and I’m likely never going to enjoy an Electronic release as much as I admire this one. Thank you for giving us this experience Porter, and I hope to see you continue your musical journey throughout the next few decades.
