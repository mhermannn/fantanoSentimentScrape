Leave it to Mac Miller‚Äôs death and twitter hype to have him rate this almost 3 times higher than his original review lmaoooo. It‚Äôs cringe to see. While every other fan was enjoying this album, fantano did not understand the context clues/artistic direction of why this album is so telling yet carefully constructed until he passes. He was an artist who was so timeless but fantano has  hardly given him high reviews. The whole problem he‚Äôs had with Mac Miller in the past is his singing, but yet he seems to love it years later. I honestly just can‚Äôt stand to see it. It‚Äôs annoying to see people who shit on this album and suddenly become a fan of it.",3
