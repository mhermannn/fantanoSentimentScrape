Mac died to prove you a point
everytime i fall in love with an album everytime i look up this melonheads revirew on it and everytime it genuinely makes me angry
Hi Everyone <br><br>Assisted Self Deletion Tono here
aged like milk
most horrendous review ever lmao
Came here to remind myself why I shouldn’t care about your opinions
To this day I&#39;m convinced this was what killed Mac
It’s criminal how fantano reviewed swimming a 3💀
The fact people STILL care about his opinion after this shit review is mind blowing
All of his albums are great. I don’t care that he did a redux. I’ll never forget how horrible of a review this is.
This review is the FATTEST L Melon ever had
Never forget, if Mac was still around he would have gave his newer albums a 2 or a strong 1
I was a casual listener of Mac until this dropped even I thought this was killer, this guy just hated him.
I found this to be accurate.
Im glad you gave this one another listen in the REDUX
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgwPxFUUg94&amp;t=75">1:15</a> fuck...
This is offensive
r you dumb?
“Farty synthesizers on so it goes” This sentence alone discredits the whole review
Having &#39;Perfecto&#39; as a least favorite track is a crime against humanity
If Mac Miller had overdosed on fentanyl you would&#39;ve given this album an 8/10.
I’m back shit take
Still worst take i´ve seen on YouTube, ever
I think Melon killed Mac Miller
Nice. Gives an impression on latter reviews. Not really true xD
This is the worst Anthony Fantano album review in existence
Wow. I expected at least an 8. Dogshit opinions.
this was on my birthday. oh shittt
And he gave sexy red an 8 …. Credibility 0 …. I dont care that after his death he tried to redeem himself….
this is a shitty fucking take
I had to come to this video thanks to Reddit. He gives this good emotional body of work a 3 but gives Sexy Red&#39;s latest wack project an 8. Bruh... 😂
Is this guy joking
HOLY FUCK!!! NEVER FORGET THAT HE GAVE THIS A FUCKIN 3/10 AND JUST GAVE SEXYREDD A FUCKING 8/10 DICKRIDING EVERY SONG HOLY FUCKKKKK WHAT AN IDIOT. FUCK THE REDUX THIS IS YOUR OPINION AND YOU DONT DESERVE A PLATFORM WITH SHIT REVIEWS LIKE THIS LMAOOOOOOOOO
delete this review fantano
a fuckin 3?
What an L this take is
This is the only time ive ever agreed with fantano
His MBDTF review is absolutely bizarre, but this is just fucking deranged.
I know you changed your mind and that’s good but God you had something up your ass on this particular day lmao like holy hell
This discredited this man’s opinion on every level
this is your worst review
im so glad he did a redux review on this. still sad this was the original review bc it feels so disrespectfully offensive, but it shouldnt matter as fantano now gives it the praise it deserves
Fantano was truly just a mac hater before his death, but it seems like he has realized how horrible his opinions on him were.
Why does anyone take Fantano seriously, this is insane.
Bruh skull
Mac passed 5 years today, and I still don&#39;t know what the hell did you heard
count your days
Bro folded on his original opinion to pander to his audience. Weeaaakkkk
Wow! I actually kind of respected Fantano&#39;s opinions on music until I saw this review. If you cant see all the amazing talent and emotion Mac put into Swimming, you must not be as smart as I thought.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgwPxFUUg94&amp;t=96">1:36</a> based on what hes saying here alone i like it
This and MBDTF almost get Fantano killed ☠️
If i listened to albums based on his taste in music id miss this therapy session of an album and mbdtf.
this is worse than his mbdtf review. Im listening to this right now and i cried on &quot;wings&quot;.
B<br><br><br><br>R<br><br><br><br>U<br><br><br><br><br>H<br><br><br><br><br>.
Imagine going from this, to a 8💀 you’re the fakest clown on YouTube
You’re so fake melon
What a failed attempt to be edgy. This is why I can not take your work seriously. Congratulations that you revisited it after he passed away. That was the least you can do.
This review proves that fantano is a hater who has 1/10th of the influence mac miller has had on his fans and knows it
Idk what he was thinking with this one my guess is he was high
Bro this is still by far the worst take you have ever haf
This Review just shows how credible you are, you have no good opinions, you’re credibility is that of a fly, and pretty sure you have a contract with YouTube to be “Edgy” for views. Swimming is undoubtedly one of thee best R&amp;B hiphop albums to date. 🤷🏻‍♂️
This video is crap
I know you did the redux but the fact you ever gave this a three makes me question your validity. This album is easily a ten
This is the most garbage take ever
This… absolutely sucks. Everything Fantano said in this review is just blatantly wrong.
How does this nerd ass fool have such a big following?? Lost the lil credibility he barely had after this terrible take
Just seeing this for the first time. This video stinks man.
Trash sense of taste fck your family and u remember family
smh
Back again to leave a hateful comment
L review
objectively false
Swimming and divine feminine are beautiful albums
this is the biggest L he&#39;s made to this day
This nigga only changed his opinion on this album because mac  died
Before his death: light to decent 3<br>After his death: strong 7 to light 8
This mindset is a wholesale on why artists can’t evolve
the end of Self Care literally makes me cream, how TF is it excruciating you monster (I know he did redux but like, you monster)
Fantano when an artist is alive: 3/10<br>Fantano when an artist dies: 8/10
Fantano the kinda guy to give mac his props after he died
9.6k likes<br>59k dislikes
i aint gon lie mac miller is trash
if Mac Miller were white you would have given him a better score.
this is one of the worst reviews of anthony fantano fr
thank god fantano readdressed this one 🙏🏻
Sanafabich
damn...hot take to say the least. it&#39;s typical to find the genius in artists work after their death. personally, i wasn&#39;t a mac miller fan at all when he passed..he just wasn&#39;t on my radar. in the past i didn&#39;t care much for his &quot;college party raps&quot; I&#39;ll call it. but every now and then id hear a song from him i loved. so after he passed, i decided to give swimming a listen and was plesently surprised. this kid who i had chalked up to be a one-trick pony, similar to how i would view someone like asher rosh, was a heck of a lot more. although this is one of my favorite albums today, i could understand someone not caring for certain songs on their first listen. but to use some of the adjectives you chose to describe this album is insane.
This album is a 10/10 a fantastic masterpiece RIP Mac
So damn crazy. The “redux album review” gets a 7-8 but this one is a 3. Leave it to Mac Miller’s death and twitter hype to have him rate this almost 3 times higher than his original review lmaoooo. It’s cringe to see. While every other fan was enjoying this album, fantano did not understand the context clues/artistic direction of why this album is so telling yet carefully constructed until he passes. He was an artist who was so timeless but fantano has  hardly given him high reviews. The whole problem he’s had with Mac Miller in the past is his singing, but yet he seems to love it years later. I honestly just can’t stand to see it. It’s annoying to see people who shit on this album and suddenly become a fan of it.
This dude is always wrong
Big L
Wow, if you rated it 3/8, that just confirms that you definitely don&#39;t know music as well as you claim to do. Bad &quot;critic&quot; that is really just a pompous, tasteless as*.
Pretty good decent 8
mate its an 8/10
i disagree i think this should be 8/10
This album is so amazing
He&#39;s trying to dig himself out of the hole w/ his redux review... What do the people say?  Do we forgive this man???  lol
Who’s here after Anthonys redux review?
Happy he changed his opinion on this album with a REDUX. The album didn’t deserve an 8 and I could understand at the time before his passing he would critique it differently, but a 3 was very harsh. He must’ve been in a weird mind set at the time of that review.. thanks for giving an update on the album @theneedledrop
8/10
I prefer this review
i literally hate you
He redid his review and gave it a light 8. Justice has been served
It feels like you prob half ass listened to the songs one time and skipped half of the time when you reviewed this, now that everyone says your take is wrong, you walk it back lol
I&#39;m curious Anthony; you gave Swimming a 3 but you gave Swimming an 8? Liked and unsubbed
Not Canon
Whos here after the Real review 🙏
This didn’t age well
I guess props to melon for not deleting this awful review
Lol so someone passes and now they’re album is more than twice as good as before? You got it bro
it’s no longer cannon! 🎉🎉🎉
GO WATCH THE REDUX REVIEW
this is the cringiest thing ive ever heard someone say.
Almost 5 years later and he has re-reviewed it and done it proper justice. 3 -&gt; 8
Fantano going from edgy trying to be funny when picking apart someone to what he is now is fucking hilarious
Hey ted how have ya been
You won&#39;t believe what&#39;s gonna happen in 4 years
Now not canon
Now you just sound stupid melon
Top 10 melon reviews that aged badly 😳
He did it yall. <br>Our lives are complete.
Here after a redemption!!! He gave it an 8!!!🥳🥳
it aged very badly now
January 2023
I deem this review obsolete!
Feeling like a strong 3 to a light 8 on that one
Almost 5 years later and he corrected it. We did it guys!!
It took about 4 years for him to get it.<br><br><b>4 years.</b>
NEW REVIEW
I hope he truly felt the way he did at the time compared to now, hot take but I sometimes miss the harsh needledrop because nothing was unhinged if he didn&#39;t like an album from someone well loved he didn&#39;t care how brutally honest he was or how mad we would be at him.
This video aged well
He did a redux and gave it an 8!
i really hope that one day you realize this was actually at least an 8
It feels weird having this recommended to me after the redux review
he probably dubbed in that “effortlessly” because he voice cracked
+5
I have to disagree. In my opinion this record is a strong 7 to a light 8. marry me melon
And now it&#39;s a light 8. Greatest character development of all time.
From 3 to 8 just by dying.
„my regrets look just like reviews that I once did“ <br>-Macthony Swimmtano (2023)
Hey everyone it got an 8 now we can be nice to melon again
REDUX TIME BABY
We can all rest now. It is 8/10
hi, 2023 here: This is an 8 now, also (sigh)...nvm
glad hes made a redux review
mac milar
Bro was too generous in his redux review
who here after the redux?
well guess what mimi
From 3 to 8 is crazy
2023, here&#39;s the annual, dog that opinion was trash
He finally did the REDUX guys. We can leave him alone now.
Finally with the redux review Mac Miller gets the justice he deserves
And now, years later, he does the album justice.  R.I.P. MAC
Who’s here after the REDUX?😭
Glad to see a redux on this album, it definitely didn&#39;t deserve a 3.
Who’s coming back to this after his Redux review lol
ayo you should redo this fr
JUSTICE AT LAST MELON
3+8=11. And people didn&#39;t believe me when I this album was an 11/10 four years ago.
Came here after the redux review of this album, its great to see anthony coming back and doing some justice for this
Finally gave Mac and this album its flowers
Fantano has now seen the light
WELL WELL WELL , CHECK YOUR NEWEST VIDEO ANTHONY 🧐🙄🧑‍⚖️
Redux -&gt; Strong 7 to a LIGHT 8!
If Mac Miller made this album you would&#39;ve given it an 8
+5 😁
3 different ghosts visited scrooge fantano that night and now we got the redux
Today is a special day...
After all these years he finally realised it. We forgive you Melon.
hey champ.
This video can finally rest now
You have been redeemed mr melon man. May the melon gods be in your favor
I can&#39;t follow Anthony Fantano anymore after he gives ridiculous reviews to albums like swimming a 3, while giving albums like swimming an 8.
This Aged Beautifully
Who&#39;s here after his redux review?<br>He has now given this album an 8/10
The bad ending
Just came back to this shit and wow is this as bad as ever. Come Back To Earth is one of the saddest and most beautiful songs I have ever heard, it displays so much emotion and you didn&#39;t even mention it. What&#39;s The Use and Ladders are so amazing and so funky and have great messages and themes, songs like Jet Fuel and 2009 are introspective songs that show raw emotion and are just all around amazing. Swimming is at the very least an 8/10, and I feel like we heard two different albums. While Mac may not have an amazing singing voice, it adds a lot of emotion and actually makes the tracks much more enjoyable for me personally, and I actually like his voice. You literally like Bob Dylan who has maybe the worst voice I have ever heard to add on to that.
Swimming is a beautiful album Fantano. Shame on you bruh
L opinion
excited asf for redux
I found you on TikTok and decided to check out some of my fav albums reviews I forgave the first two but this is the final straw. My subscription lasted less than 25 minutes
REDUX REVIEW COMING SOON!
LMFAO THIS HOW U DO MAC BUT HAVE HIGH APPRAISE FOR SOME WEIRD ASS MUSIC JUS TO BE DIFFERENT. No wonder ur wife left u
What the HELL
at least he said his opinion on it has changed
i feel like fantano’s takes as horrible as this are really humanizing
L take
hmmm, 4 years later. L take
Wow! No dislikes. Everyone must agree with him then!
Dawg you gotta be retarded for giving this a 3. Like what the fuck bro
Didn’t even list 2009 and Self Care as favorite tracks smh
Swimming is at least a 6-7/10. L
I&#39;m convinced he listened to this while being chased by a dog across a construction site like wtf
ur wrong
bro heard swimming and said it was bad and heard circles and said &quot;i made a mistake&quot;
He said his thoughts on this album have changed, i wish he just make another review with a different approach.
Every (invalid) criticism here could apply to circles (which he gave a 8). Why did he turn around and give that album a 8? Is it because he died? Really curious
anthony really dropped the bag on this one
Genuinely his worst take.
Hi Everyone Im starting my own music review channel. Please check out my most recent upload where I review Swimming :)
This is the most fucked shit I’ve ever seen. Like fucked
Bro u gotta redo this one
Did he just say farting synths? This line of work is a joke Fantano you don’t understand art clearly
There isn’t a bad song on this album
Just to remind you L opinion
He did this on purpose to get views smart man
Nah wrong
&gt;:(
Damn bro if you can’t swim just say that
Dude is so wrong. Reviews are opinion based of course, and he can have points that he’s making with how Mac swallows his words, but he’s always done that… It’s just strange to not at least see the wonderful potential and the emotions that come through
I hate you Anthony Fantano
I think anthony thinks this is a bad album, cuz he thinks mac is being &quot;edgy&quot;. After mac died, people realised he wasnt being edgy or funny, but seriously talking about his life and his pain. <br><br>I hope he rethinks this album, because this review is so stupid 😭
Shut up
Some people say opinions can’t be wrong.<br><br>This is an objectively wrong opinion.<br><br>EDIT: Melon has atoned.
I like how people are still shitting on this review to this day
Anthony&#39;s worst take BY FAR
This is the worst thing I’ve ever seen.
actually so funny that this review exists the worst fantano take
This is by far your worst review. Even worse than mbdtf 6/10. In that review at least you were saying the album was decent. The fact that you gave Mac Millers best album and the best hiphop album of 2018 a 3 is just concerning. 2009 is Mac&#39;s best song and you say it sounds like a torture chamber?? We definitely listened to different albums because when I listened to this I heard a heartfelt, good production, emotional, masterpiece. Never in my life have I met someone who dislikes swimming. You are the only one. Forget all of your other shit reviews this easily takes the cake. <br><br>By FAR the worst music review I have ever seen in my life.
This is one of rare Fantano&#39;s L reviews.
for everyone here after youtube removes the dislike button: 9.4k likes and 57k dislikes
STRONGLY DISAGREE<br>THIS A 10 MAN.<br><br>had to get this out for once. i get how one could come to dislike swimming’s vocals or  maybe also the lyrics like u do melon<br>but still.. what point which place which kind of bad day in this universe does it take to be bored by these instrumentals like how’d u do it
FANTANO IS RIGHT. LOVE MAC
Imagine giving swimming a 3 then not even standing by it lol you will never live that one down Anthony
Dude completely invalided himself here.
Na that’s crazy L take
Saying MDBTF is a 6 is forgivable, it&#39;s still a positive review, but saying that swimming is a bad album... Bruh
Tho should have been album of the year this guy is a fuckin no talent bum !!!!
common fantano L
use this comment as a dislike option
W take
Just coming back to this video in hopes the rating has changed. Thus is Anthony’s worst review to date.
You’re GOOD am take is bad; that’s a 10. You’re MBTDF take is bad; also a 10. Swimming is another god damn 10/10 where you fucked bad Anthony Fantan’bro’
This was macs best album bruh
In these comments: people blinded by hindsight. RIP Mac, sorry that your circumstances mean more to people than honest opinions about your music.
Delete this shit now. This isn&#39;t a request, or rethink how you speak about this album bitch
for those curious, as of today it&#39;s 9k likes and 57k dislikes
Since swimming is a 3 and circles is an 8, swimming in circles is a 11/10, thank you watertony melontano, very nice.
3/10 for a top 5 album of 2018 is nuts
Worst take bruh
Bros brain was not operating on this day.
No
This review fucking sucks and so does Fantano
This is why idk if I can ever really respect you bald man
I can’t believe fantano laced Mac because he disliked the music so much
And how tf did he only spend 5 min on this review..fuuckkkk
40 sec in I hate the review.. this album is a hard 8 to a light 9.
yikes
literally the 911 of hiphop reviews
holy shit 😬 make it stop<br><br>I need a car horn, chainsaw, or crying baby so I don&#39;t have to hear this review anymore
this hurts to watch
heard you gave this a bad review, just came here to shit on you once again
How is this dude still making album reviews when he has the worst takes ever
Worst take of all time , Mac the goat
This video sounds satirical looking back on it
average fantano L
yeah this is his worst review ngl
Hs
Wtf is wrong with your taste
Fantano knows so much you would think he could make a great song.
Not even gonna lie I completely agree with this review. Not even joking.
@theneedledrop do u have down syndrome?
Use me as a dislike button
Dog shit melon, this review is complete dog shit
i thought mbdtf review was a bad take, but this? Jesus...
he has no clue what he&#39;s talking about.
Anyone else not understand what’s so bad about his singing? I find he has a very nice voice tho it may not be traditional. You can hear the emotions in his voice which makes it great too
did we listen to different albums????
still one of the worst takes ever
this dude is a damn clown he been giving horrible takes and his fans been eatin his meat
yeah fuck this guy in 2022 lmfaoo
I love how bro switched up once he died. Classic
This massacre haunts me to this day
thanks to this man a can&#39;t manage my anger for a week
Bruh
did my guy remove jet fuel from the favorite tracks?
worst take ever
Damn I don’t know anyone that doesn’t like this album 😭
Embarrassing
This is how I know you have zero music taste. Man likes yelling and noise way more than honest vocals and lyrics. Good to know where this loser stands.
i&#39;m not one to get caught up in opinions, but when aliens come here with hostility and violence and we ask them why, this review is why.
Mf really called &quot;So it goes&quot; instrument farty.I fucking cried to that song
Nah melon u fuckin squashed your own head on this one this shit is still a masterpiece
For someone calling themself “the internet’s busiest music nerd” you seem to have no taste in music. Good music anyway.<br>This is easily 8-9/10.
Worst review ever ever ever everEVER
This didn&#39;t age well at all 🤣
I HATE EVERY SINGLE SECONDS OF THIS REVIEW
This has got to be the worst album review I’ve ever seen, this guy is as dumb as one gets like fr it’s no wonder he’s bald.
This is his worst take, but at least he didn’t switch up.
Delete this video
Huge L Melon
This is my favorite album wtf
L + ratio
Common Fantano L+if it was called to pimp a swimming butterfly it would be a 10 in your books and watching this video is also reminding me of being in a torture chamber
This is the first and last video I will ever watch of yours. This is actually hilarious how ignorant you are to one of the best hip hop albums in the last decade. It&#39;s insane how many subscribers you have like just wild. From the bottom of my heart go f yourself you POS.
9.3k likes now and 57k dislikes. Yikes.
After a year I&#39;m back to check on this horrid take and I agree with my earlier comment. Four years and five days since this vid and it still seems like he didn&#39;t actually listen to the album but just wrote a script anyway, guessing it was bad and posted this. I still can believe the &quot;Emotionally vacant&quot; and &quot;Moody rut&quot; comments. For a guy reviewing music this was incredibly tonedeaf
This album is a legit 10/10 what a miss by melon boy
This is way worse than giving MBDTF a 6
Did this album so dirty. His best album, and then you give circles a way higher rating even though it&#39;s sonically the same style and lyrically of similar quality just because he died
honest to god does anyone take his opinions serious anymore he is actually losing his mind or something
do a fucking redux review this is insane
i think him giving Swimming a 3 then Circles a great score shows how possibly disingenuous some of his reviews are. They&#39;re basically identical albums sonically only difference is one is posthumous.
Damn that’s one GIGANTIC L
Swimming was beautiful and was the best album Mac, Rest In Peace, released.
What the fuck man. I have no respect for this mans music taste anymore. If you don’t like this album, I don’t like you. It’s a god damn masterpiece, one of the best hip hop albums ever created. Ever. Listen again and clean the shit out of your ears
this review should mos def should outshine mbdtf
Back for my yearly “worst take of all time” comment now that dislikes are gone 👎
You will always have a shitty take here Fantano. Fuck you! I still enjoy your content though. But fuck you!
i always liked mac miller(RIP&lt;3)a little bit but this album was just straight up horrible; easily his most boring work. way too much posthumous dickriding in these comments cuz i know like 75% of mac miller fans who are always talking about him even now didnt even really ride for him like that when he lived.
The most hated review, because it&#39;s unfair and pretty much bullshit
Booooo
From what I can tell, you just didn’t like the sonic direction Mac was going into. I understand and even appreciate your honesty if you don&#39;t care for any of the production and his vocals. However, if this was a review, you should have considered the actual narrative and plot of the album. This review is as bare and unfinished as you say Swimming is. There is a very powerful plot that drives this album: wanting to get help and company, but unable to find any, so he resorts to drugs, knowing that they wither him away. I get that if the vocals and production turn you away from analyzing these details, but it is required in the review to do so anyways. Your 3/10 is based on an unfinished analysis of this album, so for now, I&#39;m waiting on your redux where you completely and thoroughly review this album, even if it results in another 3/10.
This is his only review where I legitimately can not understand where he is coming from
This is how you know his heel turn on circles was some history correcting bullshit
OK WTF
I never even cared to listen to this album, but damn this take blows the MBDTF take out of the water.
Bro
Just more proof this man shouldn’t be reviewing music and got somehow got famous off internet luck
Is this a joke?
Wrong. It’s an 8 at worse . And I’m not the biggest fan. Chuck this on a vinyl record player and decent system and these beats are anything but lifeless.
Only reason he got so many dislikes on this vid cause of after his death ,<br>when this video first came out it had more likes than dislikes
Normally agree with mr.tano but this take is shit
did... did you listen to the album..?
This is easily worse than the MBDTF take
Coming back to this years later to leave a hateful comment
if anyone&#39;s wondering what the dislike ratio is, you can check with chrome extensions like Bring Back YouTube dislikes. It&#39;s sitting at 9.2K likes to 56K dislikes as of right now.
LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
Notice he doesn&#39;t say anything about Jet Fuel. Top 5 on the album.
This single video entirely discredits his entire volume of reviews. He is kind of exposing himself for being so far off the mark and not even realizing it.
Fantano needs to go back and revisit this album.
I&#39;m not a fan of this style of music, but I finally decided to listen to the album because I liked a couple of tracks... and what the fuck, melon-man
Wild take
this is still the most horrendous and atrocious take I&#39;ve ever heard in my life
No
this is embarrassing
gay
He&#39;s right
this is legit laughable, Swimming is fucking incredible
you need to rereview this, cuz you definitely went in with expectations here
after this i realize that fantano is the stupidest person in the world
this is even worse than mbdtf review
Your worst review by far. Psychotic take lmao
watching this review just ruined my week and shattered my heart
Worst take of all time.
No dislikes on the review so I guess everyone agrees with Fantano
I love Anthony <br>But this has to be the biggest mistake to date!
not my fave i’d prolly give it a 5 or a 6
he has some reviews that i disagree with but somehow this upsets me....great lyrics, beautiful music  and great performances from mac
This made me dislike you a little
L
It’s 2022 and I’m still not over this
Usually you have hot takes but 3/10 is perfect lol
Guys just because he passed doesn’t mean that the project automatically becomes the best piece of work the world has ever heard. It is still, til’ this day, AT BEST, a mediocre album and that’s me putting it nicely. <br><br>BUT the man was a very talented artist. I will never deny that. RIP Mac !
this is still awful 4 years later
Been enjoying your reviews lately and just subbed today but this is such a terrible take that now I&#39;m questioning everything you say.  I never thought someone&#39;s opinion could be wrong until now.
Some of the best production I’ve ever heard. Beats are stacked and the vocal performances are better. Wut
You have some really really bad takes. Your a meme to watch.
Were you drunk when you made this?
worst take of all time maybe?
This video destroyed any credibility you have
Actually crazy he gave this album an 3. One of if not my favorite Mac tapes. So it goes 🤷🏼‍♂️ rip malcom
Hater.
honestly i’m a HUGE mac fan and I do not disagree with fantanos opinion here, I dont think macs later work was even close to being his best work
I love how Ladders was just brushed on. Probably the best from the project imo
This review fucking SUCKS bro I want a video of you addressing this shit one day
Not valid
This is a MUCH WORSE take than his MBDTF review
Now melon has some good reviews but literally every detail he didn’t like about this album I disagree with. This is even worse than his care for me review.
Worst take of all time?
I truly respect everyone’s opinion, but honestly this is some of macs best music in my opinion, I was goin through a lot when I heard this for the first time, and it made me not feel alone, not many artists , songs much less entire albums can do that, and I haven’t ever been a big fan of Mac 😅 so it’s not like I’m a diehard lifelong fan taking up for my favorite artist,, up until this album, this album is what made me appreciate his craft, and made me wanna dig more,,,, this album is beautiful in my opinion as someone who just appreciates art in whatever form, by whoever makes it, I kinda feel in a way this review was kinda disrespectful, Mac must have fucked his girl at some point 😅 again respect everybody’s opinions but damn dawg, there’s som quality stuff here
One of the worst takes on any topic, in human history.<br><br><br><br>Subscribed.
this is still easily the worst review he has ever posted. no competition
I can’t believe that 9k fantano dickriders liked this☠️
I like hearing an album I enjoyed and coming here to see Melon hate it 🤣 makes me think I’m doing something right.
This dude should never be able to speak on this Mac’s name again.
This gotta be the worst take on the internet to this day.
Swimming is my favorite album of all time
you’re so fucking wrong smh
The guys voice is absolute shit but the instrumentals are great
Inaccurate
Sometimes I do kinda forget about lyrical presence and only focus on sonic quality, but even in Swimming’s case, I knew Mac was no Kendrick, but every critique is a critique of sound by Fantano and I just don’t see it. It’s such a distinct sound with the uncertainty in his lyrics with the “What do I know?” in Self Care as well as the constant oxymorons in Hurt Feelings and Small Worlds like the opining line “The world is so small till it aint”.
This guy just says things are bad to get a reaction
largest miss of this mans entire career
Once again here I am to spit at this review
9k likes to 55k dislikes if anyone wanna know
awful human
We&#39;re never gonna leave melon alone for this one. This is his worst review of all time. It&#39;s just completely tone-deaf
I remember this was the day i stopped giving a shit about melons opinions
This is my favorite album of all time and I agree with nothing you said.
Oof bad take real bad take
This has to be like the worst take of the entire decade I think
This one of the best albums
No mercy to the dislike button
He not feeling it lol
I would not want this dude grading my English essays
Swimming is one of the greatest artists expressions through music ever ever
This review is the worst man, I swear you listened to something else! Swimming is a masterpiece
It seems like every time I watch this dudes videos I tend to disagree with everything he has to say! He always seems to shit on all my favorite songs and albums. His opinions on music is garbage but I can’t seem stop watching his videos 🥴
If more people appreciate  it mainstream maybe he would&#39;ve  felt better maybe we could still haveac and show him we all love him but we got this cancerous fu k that most likely started to the domino effect you lifeless human I hate you b with every fiber of my being and I hope you fall off HARD People are staring to realize u pick ND choose and probably get paid for good reviews fuck you man become por ND bankrupt please
Why was he so hard on mac it&#39;s almost like he never gave it a full chance maybe he just doesn&#39;t understand  how to feel this album has so many amazing  songs  that actually  help people and make people feel it&#39;s almost like he just picked this album to trash and then gives a high score to the following lp so he can justify this biased mess he posted here
this is a really unfortunate review
One of the worst takes I’ve ever heard
looking back at this he looks even more like a dumb ass
To this day the shittiest take.
I think that this album was a great one to nap to. It’s gotten me through more sleepless nights then I can count on two hands.
this has got to be an album with a redux review
Dude needs to smoke a blunt n listen to it
Bruh, how? Was you listenign to a tampered down version? This is one of my favourite albums of all time
Anyone else check to see if this was released on April 1
Fantano biggest L to this day, dude couldn’t be more wrong
This review is genuinely awful
I usually respect your opinion but goddamn did you miss with this one
soulless critics dont know what they&#39;re missing, shame on you
this makes me upset
3/10?? Even before he was dead I was listening to this at least weekly, 3/10?
Nine times out of ten I get it wrong<br>That&#39;s why I wrote this song, tell myself to hold on<br>I can feel my fingers slippin&#39;<br>In a motherfuckin&#39; instant, I&#39;ll be gone<br>Do you want it all if it&#39;s all mediocre?<br>Starin&#39; at the wall and the wall full of posters<br>Lookin&#39; at my dreams, who I wanna be?<br>I guess you gotta see it to believe<br>Ooh, I been a fool but it&#39;s cool, that&#39;s what human beings do<br>Keep your eyes to the sky, never glued to your shoes<br>Guess there was a time when my mind was consumed<br>But the sun comin&#39; out now, clouds start to move<br>Don&#39;t tell me nothin&#39; but the truth<br>I&#39;m tired, I don&#39;t got a spare second<br>Win or lose, win or lose<br>I don&#39;t keep count, nobody checkin&#39; <br><br>Miss you Mac ❤️
I agree with most of the points brought up in this video, but would still give this album a strong 6.
This review was what made me view your opinion with less respect. From front to finish this album is beautiful and I don’t understand how you can’t see the emotional weight it carries. Even if Mac hadn’t passed soon after this album it still would have been held as his best album (among the masses). A three is so far from what this album really is and I wish the downvotes were still visible just because of this video.
This is the worst review he’s ever done. And he has done some horrible takes
Seems people get riled up about this review because they have a personal connection with the album, but you&#39;re spot on here. The singing is not good -- seriously go back and listen to 2009 and try and tell me that&#39;s on key. This isn&#39;t fantano&#39;s worst take, by a long shot.
XD
I really hope you make a redux of this review
Damn homie compared him to lil xan that shit was too far even for you
I’m sorry but you really missed on this  review
One of melon’s worst reviews. Not just because I disagree but every point he makes is just nonsense
How?
8.9k likes? Must be a great review!
Dude come back to earth was such a nice, mellow, soulful and emotional song. The chorus gives you a sorta hopeful feeling, the words make you feel how stressed out mac has been feeling and how he&#39;s ready to let go.<br>Hurt feelings was a disorienting bop where mac is sorta gloating and it makes you feel uplifted. It makes you feel hyped up.<br>Self care is a ride through how mac is sick of feeling down, he&#39;s ready to take a break and leave oblivion. It gives you a feeling that you&#39;re floating, and you&#39;re in that headspace where you&#39;re thinking about how complicated things are.<br>2009 is a song with a throwback vibe for the beat, when the actual song is about letting go of the past and staying in the present. It&#39;s a good reminder that the past is the past and that holding on forever only hurts you more.<br>So it goes is a woozy, dizzy song about how life goes on when you have things thrown at you. It&#39;s a song that says, &quot;hey man, there&#39;s highs and lows&quot;.<br><br>The fact you called this emotionally vacant makes no sense to me, I can understand you disliking it- that&#39;s perfectly fine- but you cannot deny that love and thought and emotion was put into these songs. This isn&#39;t some CLB or &quot;Welcome to the Madhouse&quot; type shit, this was real music. <br><br>You gave Lil Pump a 7- but you can&#39;t give this better than a 3? It feels like even if you dislike this it should be 5 at the least.<br><br>Personally, for me, this is like a 9. It&#39;s nothing revolutionary but it flows so nicely and it gives such uplifting and hopeful feelings, along with the fact it gives such substantial instrumentals along with mac&#39;s amazing vocals and lyrics.<br><br>It just baffles me how much you dislike this.
worst take ever but it’s your take
tf is this shit take meoln?
The fact that Ladders is barely even acknowledged here is the biggest crime.
I hate you
L
8.9K likes - 53K dislikes
Haha you think you&#39;re opinions on art mean anything. I will never watch another video of yours.
This is why the dislike bar exists. This is first video that comes up when I type in &quot;swimming album review.&quot; Imagine someone listening to this review and believing it before ever hearing the album
everytime i come back to this review i&#39;m more mad 💀 swimming is in his top 3 albums for sure
I watch all your vids but what the fuck are u talking about
Wow, 0 dislikes. This must be a well received and respected video! Great work, Melon!
Anthony please redo this
this has to be fantano&#39;s worst take ever
swimming and circles were created simultaneously. 3 to a 8. weird.
Come back to earth hits a lot different now that hes gone.
Imagine hearing this good ass album, but coming in with such negative expectations combined with being so pretentiously snooby that you give it a 3 in an effort to elevate your sense of critical legitimacy, completely ignorant of the potentially dangerous psychological impact your harshly negative review as a well-renowned internet personality might have on an openly struggling, vulnerable, mentally ill individual who cares more about his art than anything else in the world. fuck you fantano.
Still his worst take to this day.
every so often i come back to this review just because it still and always will completely baffle me how he just did not understand or grasp a record like this that has done so much and touched so many peoples lives including my own. such a beautiful album with such depth. i agree with everyone in the comments saying we can’t have heard the same album. no disrespect or hate whatsoever but more than anything i kinda feel sorry melon didn’t get to feel what we all felt, and i genuinely hope one day he does.
I think this is arguably your worst review ever
Brain damage
Stay away
right so I’m late and just heard this album and what the FCK is this 3
If a massive L was a video
Mali ka
The internet’s busiest music troll
This and your isaiah review are the worst  reviews on this channel
You know this review is bad when Anthony acts like it never existed.
I don&#39;t see any dislikes so I guess everyone agrees on this review😁
This is a war crime
I think you were a little harsh on this review, but it’s not bad, the album is pretty mid
What’s frustrating about this review is that Anthony bypasses the writing and lyricism completely. How come when you review a Kendrick album we are talking about what is being said, but not here? Any Mac fan picked up on the sadness that radiates off of every song in this album, it’s sleepy sound is literally a product of where Mac was in his life. It’s like Anthony picked up on zero of this, and just scanned through it and found it boring. To each his own, but damn, listen to the gd album.
WOW ARE YOU HELLA WRONG. It&#39;s blatantly obvious you didnt get him or where his head space was at smfh
Bro this review is so ass😂😂😂
I’ll always believe we listened to a different album. remember spamming the dislike till I was ready to declare war
Melon u r so wrong !
Never forget this had 55k dislikes... Even if Mac wasn&#39;t his type of music a 3/10 is just crazy. The production alone is way better than that. Did Mac fck your girl?
This is worse than the MBDTF review ngl
Great album a must listen
Hurt feelings, he liked hurt feelings more than any other song in this album? I don&#39;t care that this was three years ago I&#39;m about to-
L+ ratio
I wish they would bring the dislike button back just for this video
I am not looking at this with an eye for the past and loss but this album captured Mac Miller and his emotions and passion every song he puts so much passion into his music this hurts to watch
Daily reminder to dislike this video
Why does anyone listen to anything this guy has to say after this?
Mac would&#39;ve been 30 today. Fly high 🕊🤍
JuiceWRLD the GOAT!!!!
wow 8.9k likes must be a great review of this beautiful album
Lmaooo opinions are like assholes everyone has one. Keep the review chief his fans know good music when they hear it.
Never forget this is melon’s most disliked video and it’s deserved!
BURRO
Griffith didn&#39;t do anything wrong is the second worst take I&#39;ve ever seen, this review is number one.<br><br>And that&#39;s coming from ME.
3????????????????????????
wait i gave this a 10
nice to see people are, to this day, shitting on fantano for arguably his worst take
To each there own.  I love this album
In My Opinion: Swimming: Decent To Strong 9/10<br><br>Fav Tracks: Come Back To Earth, Hurt Feelings, What&#39;s The Use?, Perfecto, Self Care, Wings, Ladders, Small Worlds, Dunno, Jet Fuel, 2009, So It Goes
I feel this bald guy is a light to decent 3
wow, this video has 8.9k likes! im sure it&#39;s a very thought out and respectable review that most people agree with
wow anthony! 0 dislikes! this review MUST be good!
Hitting dislike even though it’s invisible now
Behind MBDTF this is the worst Fantano review in my opinion
a 3/10??? you’re joking
my boy gave fighting demons a light 5 over this
So wrong on this. Man I remember it like it was yesterday. It was my 16th birthday when this album dropped
The fact that Anthony gave Swimming (one of the best albums of all time) a 3 the SAME SCORE he gave to justice by  Justin Bieber where Justin literally puts an MLK speech about standing up for what you believe in despite persecutionin between two songs about wanting to bone Alec Baldwin&#39;s daughter is literally a federal crime. An in-JUSTICE  if you will.
Is this the worst take ever?
Worst take on an album I’ve ever heard. This album has something for everyone, while still maintaining the standard Mac has upheld with all his albums. His production, his ability to look inward and the way he pulls influence from generation to generation is unmatched. This guy needs to learn to take a step back and look into his life the Mac does on every album. I guess anyone can review music these days. Glad that there are people here in the comments who realize how unbelievably terrible this guy is at being unbiased when listening to music.
Thank God youtube disabled dislikes because all 60k+ must&#39;ve been embarrassing
God I miss the dislike button
fantanos worst take TO DATE
This has to be one of the most extreme like to dislike ratio I&#39;ve seen in a WHILE
Damn 8.8 likes, we really liked this review Anthony.
i hate you i hate you i hate you
dislike button
This really makes me want to see the number of dislikes
Another reason I can never follow or agree any of this scrubs opinions fuck you.
You know absolutely nothing of music
This video is the reason YouTube took down the dislike numbers.
Like legit everytime i watch this i cant get over &quot;emotionally vacant&quot; like 90 percent of the lyrics are introspective along with a delivery that perfectly describes the emotion that comes with those thoughts... what are you on seriously...
I&#39;m coming from a different review (The YoungBoy album) and I&#39;m not even a Mac fan I have listened to The divine feminine and The Spins, and 1 song from this album and yeah I have to disagree this is a big miss fr
Youngboy better. 4/10 baybeeeeeee
8.8k likes and 0 dislikes! Mr Fantano, your message and opinion in this video really does resonate with your fanbase, I&#39;ve never seen a musical review supported this unanimously! Absolutely beautiful!
Love you melon. But I think this is your worst review of all time
THE DISLIKES ARE GONE WTFFFF
A 3? Never knew the rating until now. Worst one I’ve ever seen actually
This is one of those reviews very we can&#39;t meme him like the way we did for the MBDTF review or be mad at him like Eminem fanboys are. This is just disappointing and painful and very perplexing. This deserves a redux, in the most respectful way possible. Becuase this is one of those situations where it didn&#39;t come down to perspective or music being subjective or anything like that. Melon was just wrong.
I’m the new dislike button
for people who want the dislikes back there is a chrome extension that brings it back.
wow zero dislikes? this must be a very well thought out, uncontroversial video with no bad takes in it whatsoever
Such a garbage take. Wrong on so many levels.
I can’t trust your reviews after this. You’re really reaching and trying to sound like you know what you’re talking about . Asshole.
No more dislike bar…
RATIO
Never forget that this was this man&#39;s worst dislike ratio now that it&#39;s gone
Can’t believe it’s possible to rate death grips “the money store” a 10 and then give this emotional masterpiece a 3 :/
I swear to god that the dislike uptade was made to protect this awful review from truth
This review aged so bad ..
Are u out of your tiny mind?
How you gonna give this a 3 and circles an 8?
i love melon but this is his worst review undoubtedly
yeah shut your mouth
you are a 3/10
This review is trrrash
Oof now this looks like a good review thanks YouTube for getting rid of the dislike was really needed.
Jon Brion: I was told to make it sound like you were ascending to Heaven<br>Fantano: Farty Synthenzier 🤓
This is his worst review
A 3?!?!
This review ain&#39;t it. At all. Like I&#39;m actually baffled for real. I hope Anthony returns to this record with 5-10 more years lived and give it another go.
Nigga didnt even mention jet fuel what a fucking joke
jesus christ so embarrassing. this record is garbage and yall cockdrooling brainless drones cant even be civil about it lmfao so pathetic
Lmao he has like 55k downvotes ahhhhhahahah deserved
Lol you are literally so dumb have fun babe💕 ☺️🤣
Come on melon album easily 8/10
I wonder how much dislikes this has 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
If Mac hadn&#39;t passed when Circles released, he would have gave it a 3 too
the melons worst take
you have a stupid
for everyone here after youtube removes the dislike button: 8.8k likes and 52k dislikes
Honestly kinda bummed. This is one of my favorite albums and I was thinking he&#39;d have a better outlook on it (at least a 6).
He better re review this album 💿 it’s amazing 🤩
Delete this video
YouTube is removing the dislike count so I must put it on record that there are currently 8.8k likes and 52k dislikes.
How can he not have so it goes in his favorates
this album is so bad lol
Fun fact: over 80% of dislikes came after Macs death. Fake fans
This might possibly be the worst video on YouTube
My first time seeing this as I’ve seen it getting more attention due to the removal of the dislike button. But holy FUCK this is ridiculously bad. Deserves way more dislikes
I know the button is still there right now but... DISLIKE.
Came here just to dislike the video
You need a new job, you suck
How bad does this feel?
Yeah had to come back after faces re-release how can he trash a person so much before his passing and after becoming a person who is awe of his production and singing horrible person to review any type of music guess his channel dying is karma of his hypocrite personality.
Honestly not even gonna watch, just here to dislike before YouTube removes the counter.
Before YouTube disables dislikes, the like to dislike ratio is 8.8K to 52K
just a reminder that this is a dog poop review
This might be the worst take i have ever heard in my entire life. Don’t switch back now that he’s gone, you’re tweakin
Came back to shit on this review one last time before the dislike button is gone for good 🙏
You gave swimming 3 and circles 8. Most blatant rider I&#39;ve ever seen. Embarrassing.
Just here to leave a dislike before YouTube takes that button away. You&#39;re fake af Ant
This review aged like sour milk
Horrific review, never watching this weirdo again
Wow! 8.8k likes? Everyone must have agreed with this review!
while the dislikes are still here just wanna say this review has 52k dislikes
This is the wrong opinion
When I realised dislikes got removed I instantly went here
This review is the ultimate disrespect to Mac as an artist and a person. Fantano you must do a redux
nah dude
I honestly can’t respect Fantano until he addresses this review, it seems like he’s got such a vendetta in this, objectively ignores positive aspects
Aaaaaaaaaaaaand unsubscribed
I seriously don’t understand what your standards are for music but some of your takes are just utter shit. Fuck you and go listen to some Death Grips
Delete this melon..
wings may be my favorite song of all time
How do u have a following? Why do people care ab what u say?
this is why nobody knows who anthony fantano is
Damn genuinely surprised this got a damn 3. Easily Mac’s best album. So layered in the instrumentals, experimental trippy ad-live, strong concept with psychedelic lush reflective bars. I get not everyone likes the same thing but this is his magnum opus to me sadly. Wish he was here to tour it. This album is comforting to me with the instrumental grooves from Thundercat and Mac’s production credits himself. Mac’s syrupy lyrics and wild delivery, and the general personal to Mac yet open to interpretation lyrics are comforting to me. I think Circles is a great posthumous release but Swimming is really like a comfort blanket that I can also just vibe to. Such a fun album to drive to and just enjoy life. To me it was Mac coming to terms with imperfection and accepting his life in all its ups &amp; downs.
You must listen to all this albums with your ears closed, unbelievable
Fantano has given almost all of macs projects decent or bad scores and with how similiar swimming is to circles it baffles me that he gives this such a low score
I swear, him saying this is &quot;emotionally vacant&quot; makes me feel like we weren&#39;t listening to the same album
I genuinely wonder what Anthony would think of the Dissect season on this album Bc swimming is like a 9 or 10 to me and listening to Cole break it down just gives me more and more respect for it <br>This is way worse than the MBDTF review
This guy hears music but doesn’t listen
it’s not about technicality Fantano, it’s about what it took to make this thing. One of the best albums of all time.
I like how after Mac Miller died, he started acting like he liked his music.
I think that like to dislike ratio is worse than MBDTF
One of the worst reviews from anthony fantano
I get it&#39;s his opinion but Swimming has many elements in Circles and that&#39;s a 8/10
I unsubbed this channel many years ago. This review is proof that I made the right choice. Never thought an opinion could be factually incorrect until I watched this.
Emarassing especially after crying to good news lol made sure I disliked otw out
Worst music take of all time!
i feel like fantano should give an update on his opinion of this album because this review feels a bit angry and disappointed and with mac’s passing and melon’s enjoyment of circles, i feel like he could def come back to this album with more of an appreciation and enjoyment for it (at least more enjoyment than a 3/10). just an idea though, some opinions change with time and some don’t.
What can I do as an lover of Millers album swimming against such reckless hate coming from Melon?
yikes
&quot;it feels emotionally vacant&quot; come on now melonhead, you&#39;re just projecting
Worse than the MBDTF review. Far worse.
So funny how since he’s passed you love everything he’s done or pretend to enjoy his music. Before he passed you shitted on everything he’s done. But you love circles love faces all of sudden in your newest video. It’s hilarious haha.
I’m very happy that 3 year later people are still shitting on this awful review
YO I NEVER HEARD THIS ALBUM BUT U GOTTA DO A REDUX REVIEW JUST FROM LOOKING AT THESE COMMENTS
this is the worst video on the internet
Melon missed on this one.
Still the worst take you’ve ever heard
I hope this was a gag video
I’m just making sure my dislike is still here
Did melon ever apologize for this?? Unbelievably rude to Mac .. :/
??????
Came here just to dislike this video because I just learned about the rating you gave him. Honestly I think I have to disregard everything you’ve said about music because of this. 🖕
DO YOU JUST HATE MUSIC
Swimming in Circles needs to get a redux double album review.
🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡this man is a clown 🤡🤡 how can you say this is a 3
This is still the worst review of anything ever
How is this dude allowed to have an opinion on music?
damn melon
no fucking way fantano <br>i respect you but godamn
Ahhh yes, the most glorious of L’s
HE DIDN&#39;T JUST FUCKING DISS SELF CARE, I&#39;M UNSUBBING
Wow.
I know music taste is subjective but I genuinely cannot fathom how Anthony hates this album so much. Every gripe he has is everything I love about the album.
Fuck dude I mean seriously? Just found this channel the other day and have had a great time going back and remembering a lot of great albums from this past decade.<br><br>&quot;Emotionally vacant&quot; is probably the last descriptor I&#39;d use to articulate what Swimming is as a project.<br><br>I understand that everyone is entitled to their musical opinions but this feels so unbelievably wrong. Maybe a bit of bias from a lot of us as Mac unfortunately is not here anymore, but seeing that Fantano gave Circles an 8 this seems like total bullshit.<br><br>They&#39;re two parts of one whole. It simply doesn&#39;t make sense to maim Swimming in the way he did here.<br><br>Everything from the juicy, head-bopping bass lines by Thundercat to the intimate relationship Mac forms with the listener as the album progresses makes this one of my absolute favorite listens.<br><br>This review is unquestionably, irrevocably, just stupidly wrong on so many levels. Gotta come back to do this one again at some point, imo.
Damn that ratio
Just letting you know the last thought Mac had of you is how much you disliked his album, if he even cared at all
You can’t cry over Mac and give him a 3/10 in the same breath
ooff, this video did not age well.
Garbage review
Ratio
and he still so delusional
I still don&#39;t get how he rated this album a 3, and gave circles a very high score when they are fairly similar. This album is very introspective, heart-felt, and has fantastic production. Really thought he would give this a 7 or 8
He said, &quot;the beats on this thing are consistently lifeless, spacey and bland.&quot; Then 5 seconds later says, &quot;the generally the beats on this thing are pretty pleasant, occasionally they are show stoppingly pretty in the case of 2009.&quot; He&#39;s contradicting himself, and it truly feels like his opinion on this album was maybe not fully fleshed out because of some other reason. Its like he had something else to or review, and it&#39;s easier to skim and hate in a five minute video, then to take in, analyse, reflect, and point out the many specific traits that make this album amazing and unique.
rereview pls
I swear to fucking god, melon
I hate u
Dude, I so fugg love this album.
Honestly I agree w your Kanye reviews way more than this.
bro 😭
Worst review you made
It’s never made me so happy to have people upset with Fantano
This video is a war crime
I must be the only one who agrees with everything he said about it. Sorry it’s just not an engaging album super bland. His lyricism is definitely not that good
as a kanye fan this is worse than mbdtf
Nah he tweakin
No respect for Anthony for his review it’s more opinionated then a review
I know I’m late on this video, but this was the worst take since this video dropped.  Not a good review 🙁
Guys, Do you think Melon is making this up or something for views or something?... right?  ....
It was a different time when Mac Miller was alive and Swimming was in rotation, I wasnt really feeling it much at the time but it certainly has grown on me. I wanna know more of Melon&#39;s retrospective thoughts on this, especially since it ties in with Circles.
Yes, he rated KSI’s first and new album higher than this, let’s talk about it
He kind of sounds like he is drowning. That is the point.
Bro howwww you give this a 3/10. It&#39;s sooo good
Yeah seriously, I was a fan of this dude but this review is so off that it honestly hurts my feelings and makes me not trust his ear. And I’m honestly not interested in any other reviews from him. I’m giving this review a light to decent negative 10
Here in 2021 to say this review is still trash
How dare you!
That&#39;s fucked up Fantano, you hurt the world&#39;s feelings
Just to let everybody know, this got the same score as Tattletales by 6ix9ine. Yes, TATTLETALES. You heard me right
Redux right now
What about What’s the use… why is that not a favourite track. It’s perfect
this was weird
this hurts
3 years later. And wow bro it’s obvious that Fantano had no connection to Mac’s emotions he didn’t connect at all until he cried to Good News…he really thought Swimming was a 3? It’s so good with no features. The music hits so fucking hard to everyone even before Mac passed.
Terrible score. Still love you, fuck
How how how did he say swimming was a 3/10
This guy is just dumb with big words
i would give it a light 2
Maybe Ohtony Notano is his evil twin??
This is a terrible review. This album was beautiful.
Holy fuck. Aren&#39;t you supposed to maybe listen to a little bit of the album and then review it? Not just ramble on for minutes. This was cancer
3/10? lol.<br>It&#39;s not my favourite album of Mac&#39;s but even I&#39;d give it an 8. I think anything below a 6 for Swimming is just straight-up harsh.
This dude has to be trolling with this review.
fantano common disasterclass
Everytime I watch this review, I lose brain cells
We all hate you
This has to be your worst review ever bro swimming is definitely a 9/10
This album is trash, i would OD if i made an album this bad
How do we tell him?
so no
I’ve never seen 48k dislikes on a YT video. Ever. Said 2 good things. Why do you do music reviews again?
Pakyu
This is such a hot take it feels like satire.
soooo bad
Absolute dogshit take.
three??!? <br>….deaf melon
this is an L bro… swimming is a masterpiece
Your opinion was Dumb as fuck.  I waited 3 years just to tell you this nigga
shut yet fookin mouf. Who the fook is this guy!?
Fast forward years later and I&#39;m not listening to this album anymore and I have the cd in my car. This album was probably his best work but it faded away from my rotation and just because it&#39;s his best work does not mean everyone who wasn&#39;t a big fan of him before will turn over. His death just gives it the sadness he was trying to convey on the songs when he was alive
how dare you compare mac to lil xan
ahhhhhhhh sooo this is what crack does to a person
48 thousand dislikes
One of the ones I agree with. Mac got lazy quickly over time. Cocaine is a hell of a drug
after this review i hope you took your normal pills melon man
This is the worst review I’ve ever seen
This is a worse review than MBDTF
Aleast i&#39;m not bald
Bro this shitty review has 48k dislikes
I love Swimming very very much, but if you hate Mac&#39;s singing voice on the album as much as fantano does, it makes complete sense why you would dislike the album. You pretty much <b>have</b> to click with his voice, like most people do, to enjoy the album.
How could you call the beats lifeless?
Oh yeah, literal nails on a chalkboard death grips is 10/10 but swimming is 3/10? Literal troll, you can&#39;t convince me otherwise
i used to really hate this review when i was in my mac stan phase lol but i can kinda agree now
I respect Anthony a lot. I really do. Because of him, my music taste really expanded like never before especially during quarantine, and I&#39;m enjoying shit that I never thought I would enjoy listening to, and at the end of the day, I respect his opinions on his reviews because well it&#39;s his opinion. But on this review, this had to be the worst and I mean THE WORST review on an album in the past decade. This is the first time I feel like an opinion is just wrong if that makes any sense. You don&#39;t have to be a musical genius or die-hard mac fan to know that this album was a decent one to listen to. The instruments and the message behind the songs were enjoyable and beautiful. For the most part, it wasn&#39;t a complex album at all, to listen to and understand its meaning. I mean this man should&#39;ve given this album AT LEAST a 6-7 on the album. AT LEAST. And the fact that he gave circles an 8, which is literally the sister album to swimming makes no fucking sense at all in my opinion. Honestly, this is your biggest L Anthony. Forget about MBDTF or HOB, this is really your biggest L.
This review will forever be his worst review worse than mbdtf
ur opinion is not valid.
I liked the video
Didn&#39;t know someone could be objectively wrong
Ratio
what the fuck
You know some sins are unforgivable
I get that music is subjective but even still this review is just wrong. Such a good album the disrespect is worth a dislike...
Just listened to the album, what the fuck is this rating
coming from someone who loves this album to death, IT&#39;S A FUCKING OPINION.
This channel is so hilariously misguided. Why does anyone give this person any attention or clout? Seems like this guy is just salty that he never became a musician
Honestly I get the hate on this more than the MBDTF review, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a ridiculous opinion. A lot of the songs after Ladders particularly are seriously boring to me and completely forgettable
We definitely need a redux review wtf
Emotionally vacant ????
You don’t deserve ears
My favorite review from Fantano
Listening to this album while on acid and trust me it’s an experience like wtf this album is so fucking good
yep i&#39;m back just to check the dislikes again 😁- keep disliking boys.
Woah I&#39;ve never disagreed with a music review more
Your worst review dude
oh god melon, no
All songs sound the same and different at the same time.thats an art. I never heard album which have whole experience like this one..
Wannabee Simon Cowell
shame
I always gotta come back when I see this just so I can be happy seeing those dislikes. 🙌
I’m just commenting so I can dislike something on this video twice
How did I never see this till now 🤦🏽
had to come back to this video just to laugh
2009 was a beautiful song
Still disappointed by this review. I&#39;m all for diverse opinions, but I can&#39;t take someone seriously who thinks that swimming is bad or even not emotional. Sorry
Everyone is allowed to have a opinion but this one is just wrong:(
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgwPxFUUg94&amp;t=76">1:16</a> did not age well. RIP MAC
I love you Melon, but this review is a disgrace.
I was going back listening to people&#39;s views on mac. Normally I don&#39;t mind negative opinions on others&#39; albums, you do you. If you don&#39;t like it, that&#39;s fine. You are entitled to your own opinion, but I think you put on the wrong album. &quot;Emotionally vacant&quot; and &quot;Moody rut&quot;. You have got to be joking. I hope you went back to thins after his death and reevaluated because this was sloppy.
Anyone know how you can dislike a video twice?
Couldn’t have gotten it any worse, makes sense it’s at the top of the list for “worst reviews”
Horrid review
Dude you keep saying his “beats”? Rappers who just rap on beats and don’t ever get involved in making the music are about as talented as my 8 year old niece. This wasn’t a hiphop album besides the song “Hurt Feelings” and maybe “2009”. This wasn’t made to suit the youthful mumble rap fan base. Grownup music.
This is easily your worst review
I genuinely don&#39;t know how you could listen to the album and come to this conclusion.
Swimming: an album with substance and really good r&amp;b tones is a 3?<br>Meanwhile pump has a 7!? 🤦‍♂️
this video didnt age well
You invented the incorrect opinion
Bro how can you say that about 2009
I am very angry at this still, because Mac Miller is one of those artists where he saved a lot of people including me so when I first heard swimming I loved it like it spoke to me in so many ways and I could relate to it too that’s why I highly disagree with this review Rip Mac Miller he deserves wayyy more respect and honour:/
What the f... Mr. Fantano :(
i can’t even watch the whole thing
Watching fantano shit on my favorite album of all time is a weird feeling
This is how you know the guy doesn&#39;t listen to albums, he&#39;s only on here making empty content
melon this is your biggest L
It’s bad
Bro gave this a bad review because of his voice
Never forget
Fuck you Logic
Dont mind me, I just came to dislike this specific video.
I don&#39;t even like Mac Miller but this album is better than a 3 surely
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS ANTHONY HONESTLY
Wtf...??!!!
Biggest L ever.
OMG... I did not know it is possible to be so wrong.
make sure this comment has more likes than the actual video does.
cover looks like amogus
swimming is a 10/10 are u serious?
Just came here to dislike this video again
nice to see people are, to this day, shitting on fantano for arguably his worst take
How do I dislike a video twice
Wow what a shit review
Bruh I made tea listening to this masterpiece on my record player!     <br><br><br><br><br>It was beautiful 🥲
This is the worst thing I’ve ever seen
I come back every day to see if the score has changed, no luck yet
Does this guy have PhD in music??
Damn you need to re evaluate your life
you hate mentally ill people
This review is bad, Tony.
You tripping bro
worst review on this channel
Just listens to swimming again and was blown away and came back here just to hate. Swimming was an amazing Album and Macs brought it all together to me. Honestly this review just feels way too harsh for no reason. The whole listen I felt the internal pain mac had at the time.
This review is probably the least accurate and most aged video on YouTube
probably the worst take melon has ever done
In 2021 you crazy on this on fantano .a three .a fucken three !!!
Damit melon
10/10 record
worst take ever made
Did we listen to the same thing?
This still feels like a troll. What humor are you even referring to on Small Worlds? That song makes me cry.
This album sucks
terrible review, you should listen to my beautiful dark twisted fantasy by kanye west, i think you’d like that better
<b>the one review that everyone agreed was bad</b>
Did you forget that Mac was white?
This dude gave lil pump a 7...
How about this , yo mama
Fuck you take the lil xan comment back
No you&#39;re wrong
Stfu
This worse than the mbdtf review
???
I lost all respect for this dude after watching this
Lmao these people so mad, you know it&#39;s his opinion right? It&#39;s fine to disagree but completely insulting him is dumb.
The whole point you hate the album is the whole reason it&#39;s great. He is showing his life  in the current state. The lack of emotion you say is the most emotion in the album. The whole thing is him saying he is tired of being himself.
Pause. 3 out of 10? Take it back Melon I know you didn&#39;t mean it
How can you give this album such a low score? It&#39;s way better than the money store
terrible review
no
fantano I&#39;m banning you from listening to music
2 years since this review came out and I still haven&#39;t forgave you for it
I don&#39;t remember last time I commented on anything. I&#39;ve probably watched all of fantano reviews and I love the guy. But this? This is the worst, man. I saw it the day it came out and still come back sometimes to see if something so bad was really concieved by a man with functioning hearing. I remember hearing Self Care for the first time, and being kinda mixed on the slightly off-key singing, but I am living human with real human emotions and I&#39;ll never get how do you hear this album and say shit like &#39;emotionally vacant&#39;. Do the redux man, it&#39;s embarrassing.
Y’all know this is just his opinion, right?
Got damn them dislikes tho
Well, you missed the point of the low key singing.
Honestly the album is a loveable mess. Way too many hands. A clusterfuck with some great tracks but no cohesion. Circles is so much better it&#39;s kind painful reading some comments here. The production on Circles is another planet shit.
He compared Mac to Lil Xan :(
Y’all saying swimming is a masterpiece are a little dumb. I disagree with his rating but it isn’t a life changing piece. Just a relatively good album
Looking at the like to dislike<br><br>-Nobody liked that melon
This album will stand the test of time and you will realize what a mistake you made. The review was a total clown show.
Shitty review
The entire review feels like Mac keyed his car 20 minutes before he started recording so he dragged the score from a 7 to a 3
This is as close to objectively wrong as you can get with a personal review
hands down your worst review ever
Wrong flannel melon
Nope
Why Ant Nee. Why
Anthony Fantano claims another soul
Having your own opinion is important, but you&#39;re wrong
I mean, honestly Fantano was like, indirectly describing someone who was super fucking depressed whilst describing the record
I just found this channel and was watching best of the decade lists and such, noticed a general lack of Swimming in them and came to see what he thinks of it. A lot shocked. To each their own, I guess. I&#39;ll just be here never getting over how much I like Swimming. Cheeeeeers.
melon’s worst review
I totally get disagreeing with Fantano but assuming he only intended to pander to Miller fans when he gave Circles an 8 JUST BECAUSE you disagree with him is petty.<br><br>That assumption becomes even worse when you realize how flawed it is. He gave one of X&#39;s posthumously released album a 2 and the other a not good.
Based Melon.
THE RATIO ON THIS  VID  LMFAOOO
This might be the worst review of all time
You know, I hope this man can live peacefully after this disgrace, because I wouldn&#39;t. I grew to love this album after disliking when it came out, it is great just like Circles. RIP Miller.
One of the most beautiful albums I&#39;ve ever heard... &quot;emotionally vacant&quot; haha
Thank you the album was so boring to me I feel like his producers did more than him on this
Man I kinda agree with melon on this one. The album was seriously flawed imo.
You are so fucking weird. Edit: I’ve never listened to Mac Miller
Fucking idiot.
came back to say fuck you melon for this insulting 3
This killed Mac.
This is my favorite album of all time. Fuck you melon I just unsubbed.
Man, this didn&#39;t age well.
fuck you
This guy sucks.<br>This album is a smash.
just a reminder he rated dj Khaled&#39;s new album Khaled Khaled better then this one
Absolute dipshit
you missed
I’m not even a hardcore Mac Miller fan and this review makes me unreasonably angry
????
The fact that he only talks about the album for 5 minutes is worse than the 3 imo
Lol I knew this review would have a tone of dislikes. I don&#39;t think Mac Miller &#39;s music is bad, I just think Melon  doesn&#39;t like it, which isn&#39;t bad, but it&#39;s not good to say to Mac Miller fans. I&#39;d agree that Mac Miller&#39;s music can be pretty simple sometimes, but I&#39;d say that isn&#39;t a bad thing. Sometimes simplicity works. And also Mac had a one of a kind voice.
Youuuu 🙃
lifeless?? bland?? emotionally vacant ??
what the actual fuck are you talking about
Garbage review
easy 7/10
so disappointing to see this review.
god i hate you so much
damn melon, this didn&#39;t age well
Where is this coming from ?
i. come here when i’m angry
Jesus Christ this guys reviews miss the mark often
You’re a class act moron
usually love and respect this guys opinions good or bad....big swing and a miss on this one
i think melon is wrong here but not that wrong. a lot of songs on here i don&#39;t like, but this album doesn&#39;t deserve a 3/10, it&#39;s more of a 5/10 or at most a 6/10. i 10000% think circles is better
oh my dear melon... this time we do NOT agree...
Melon gave Mac a 3/10 for being emotional and moody on Swimming.<br><br>Melon then gives Mac an 8/10 for being emotional, moody, and dead on Circles.<br><br>Hmmmmmmm
This has to be a joke right?
Anthony, what the fuck?
Never even heard this album, but I gave this video a like just because of all the annoying, obnoxious brats whining about being confronted with an opposing opinion. Get over it.
Biggest cap of the decade
lil pump is a solid 7 smh
no, i will not forgive this one.
Am I the only one who agrees with this review?
to this day, this review gives me chills. this is the one of the worst reviews i’ve ever seen
THIS MAN CALLED 2009 A TORTURE CHAMBER <br>THAT SONG IS GORGEOUS
this review was always wrong, mac&#39;s death didn&#39;t change anybody&#39;s opinion on this video.
Joke?
Just want to let you know that you’re still loved, Melon.
You obviously don&#39;t know what your talking about.
You have no soul. Wouldn&#39;t want to know what kind of Garbage you listen to.
This review objectively sucks. Not because of the final score but because of the beautiful nuances and concepts within the album that you decided to ignore and the very shallow and ignorant takes towards the album that you chose to discuss instead. Bad, bad review. I have my own opinion and feelings towards this album so I don’t care that much but for YOUR sake, I do think we need a REDUX review of Swimming ASAP.
I’m not even gonna watch this interview but I heard u gave it a 3, dawg what is wrong with you?
bro is trippin thinking 2009 was not good
Holy shit the dislikes are overbearing<br><br><br>Disliked
BAD REVIEW
The worst review you&#39;ve ever done, seconded by the House of Balloons one
REDUX FANTANO
good review keep it up!!!
dunce
oh my lord, anthony was capping so hard
MELON THIS IS AN 8 AND YOU KNOW IT
fantano is a dork
How do I delete someone&#39;s YouTube Channel?
No Anthony, just no.
Bunch of sissy’s in the comments
just remembered he did this and I had to come back and dislike lol
Yeah this ain’t it
This review aged like a banana sitting in milk outside on a hot day in the middle of the Amazon rainforest
u fuck up wit dis one man, damn u an idiot
You should stop making videos it would make YouTube a better place
this man is on crack
Oh good, I am not the only one who found this album incredibly boring and lack luster.
This guy is the SKIP BAILEY of music. Loves to feed people subjective generalities and doesn’t remotely know about the intricate technicality or expression. You’re really not going mention anything harmony based? What about the complete balance in frequency despite the unorthodox instrumentation? How about the overall energy curve in tone, character, and aesthetic? I never make comments like this, but it pains me to think someone out there is actually letting this whack ass opinion influence their perception of this body of work. Man only cares about getting a response
It’s okay to be wrong
mac milar
Hi everyone, Wrongthony Reviewtano here. This review of Mac Miller’s album, Swimming, is, uh, NOT GOOD.
Bruh what even is this I had to unsubscribe this is terrible
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgwPxFUUg94&amp;t=53">0:53</a> you fucking what?
Fuck this review
Such a shit review
Man, I disagree hard with melon on this one but I gotta appreciate that at least he has his own point of view. Nowadays it really is like everybody wanna talk but they got nothing to say. Look at any review on pitchfork or stereogum (I know nobody gives a F about pitchfork or stereogum anymore but they&#39;re still major media corporations). They give every album that doesn&#39;t suck a 6 or a 7 and then say some bland BS about the album in the review like they hardly listened to it. The writers are so interchangeable too. Can you name a single pitchfork or stereogum reviewer by name?<br><br>Not a huge fan of Melon but at least he isn&#39;t just a parrot or someone who seems to be in it just for the paycheck
God i hate this fucking video
Who’s here after he deliberately left this out of his recent vid
Mac Miller stans crying in the comments gives me life
What a joke
This is a war crime. Before Mac passed this review still was universally agreed on to be bad lol
Aye bruh...... still got time to delete this...........
only fantano simps can thumbs up this trash
Na how did KSI’s album get a better review than Mac Miller’s Swimming ? <br>Edit: no disrespect to KSI but wtf
Fantano&#39;s aux cable was halfway disconnected when he listening to Swimming.
This ain’t even on his Most Hated Reviews ever video 😭
Can’t believe this exists
WHY ISN&#39;T THIS MENTIONED ON THE MOST HATED REVIEW VIDEO MR. FANTANO
Didn&#39;t even include this in his &#39;most hated reviews&#39; video...
Definitivamente no sabes ni mierda sobre música.
bruh
it’s a 9
WTF
this man gave swimming a 3/10 in a 5 minute video
Every once in a while I go back to this review just to assure myself this guys brain is a melon (:
Still can believe this disgrace of a video fuck u melon
Tf? I just listened to this and it was great...
Wow I don’t think he’s said anything factual and im only halfway through
I make sure to check back into this video just to double and triple check that I’ve disliked it every few months. Just to be safe.
No comment 👉😂
this is the worst album review ever
&quot;Simultaneously trying to hold a note and a mouthful of water&quot; - AHAHAHAHAAAAA!
agree and disagree, jet fuel was fire
yea no thanks fantano.
ur a fool
YOOOOO DID HE REALLY FUCKIN SAY HIS VOCALS SOUND MORE LAAZY THAN LIL XAN WTF BRO!!!!😭🤣🤣🤣 that shit went over my head the first couple times what a bitch lmfao.
worst review in internet history
The divine feminine slander was bad too😐
The ratio is immaculate
Melon you&#39;ve never been so wrong in your entire career
Damn this video had so many dislikes
Why is everyone getting mad that he has a different opinion. Don’t get so mad that he doesn’t think this album is the literal second coming of Christ.
no.
You a bish
Gonna get a load of hate for this... It&#39;s very sad that he died, but this review is one of the few critical takes that explores honestly exactly how I feel about MM. I&#39;ve never understood the love, a few exceptional songs aside (and even then that&#39;s largely as a result of working with exceptionally talented &#39;producers&#39; like Jon Brion or Flying Lotus, ie ppl making more memorable &amp; interesting music for him to mumble over - he does sound like he&#39;s attempting to gargle wasps), and the lyrics aren&#39;t particularly deep or fun. Guessing ppl will sh*t on me for this, as they&#39;ve done with AF, but c&#39;est la vie.
YOU ARE FOOKIN DISGRACE TO THE INDUSTRY!!!!!!! ITS ARGUABLY ONE OF HIS BEST ALBUMS,  AN THEN YOU DOUBLE BACK TO CRY ABOUT THE SONG GOOD NEWS CUZ YOU KNOW YOU NEED YOUR EARS CHECKED, AND PEOPLE DONT FUKK WIT YOU!!!! SMH YOUR A PIECE OF SHIT!!!!
This is the worst review I have ever seen for anything. Wow.
Mac Miller, 4 weeks. RIP.
3
this gotta be the worst video ever made, you melon
&quot;Effortlessly&quot;, you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about man. Or you&#39;re deaf. Because Swimming is fucking fire 🔥
Swimming is so much better than Divine Feminine
3????💀
Wow Anthony. From a loooong time subscriber, you should apologize for this. I know it&#39;s hard to get all of them right, but this must have touched you in some place that hurt you when you were little.
this needs a redux, this album is so emotional to me i can barely listen to it anymore, atleast an 8!
Honestly we did not see Mac miller&#39;s death coming so I dont think we can blame him that hard on this video<br><br>also him crying on good news might have something to do with his death
This is the only bad opinion.
Reported this for being misleading.
How is this not the most disliked video on YouTube
This is better than circles
3? God damn, Melon.
Cmon. Just came back to this album and WINGS still got me flying
Still his worst review of all time, nothing has top this yet
ill never forgive u for this one fantano
Honestly given the time and place Mac was In when he released swimming all of these tracks are full of emotion and Is honestly one of my favorite albums of all time.
I think this might be the only review Mellon has made where he’s completely wrong
you definitely gotta rereview this oh my god
Normally I don&#39;t get mad at Anthony&#39;s reviews but damn something about this one makes me very annoyed
Love Anthony but this gotta be his most disappointing and undeserving review to date.
He really gave the same rating to swimming and tattle tales
So this is basically  why the worst of the artists will be always better than the best of the critics. So easy to talk, so hard to create.
Is this a hate crime?
WHAT THE FUCK
Horrible review. this album is golden
Remember Lil Pump&#39;s Album got a higher score
Swimming is so mid guys 🤓🤓
Yeah this ain’t it chief
The Disrespect
Let’s make this the most disliked video
This review is embarrassing melon, I&#39;m embarrassed for you
Bro it’s a 10 or 9. Not a 3
Came back to be wowed that he disliked the album so much. <br><br>Wow.
All I gotta say to this while using at this it’s really annoying seeing this now...
Massive L
Trash ass take on this album.
Anthony you’re not invited to the cookout.
This is the worst thing on the internet
this is like the only review your so wrong abt
This was a masterpiece and it moved me I don’t get why you hate the vocals as they were sincere you seemed to have no problem with Kurt contain having different singing
I appreciate fantano and his impact on the music industry, but I hope he knows that this review would&#39;ve had the exact same response from the public if Mac were here today. I understand where he&#39;s coming from in this review and his critiques, but I just feel that we as a public had a very different view of the album from the moment it released. Godspeed NeedleDrop.
showed your true colors and now you&#39;re only praising him cause of his passing. go fuck yourself
SHUUUSHHH
Nope
incorrect 😔
Last 2 minutes of self care is my favourite 2 minutes of sound ever.
you got this one wrong big guy
Incorrect
he compared mac with lil xan
I bet you he likes the album now.
When you compared Mac Miller to lil xan I turned off the video
A DECENT 3? A DECENT 3???? WHO GAVE YOU A MIC AND CAMERA? WHY WOULD THEY?
This review has lost all credibility for this guy imo
This is your wrongest fucking review. Disliked with all my accounts
Yea mam I disagree and feel like your just not a fan of him
ths guy SUCKSSZzzzzzzzzzzzz what you smoke before you listen to the masterpiece?!?!
How  about a re listen and post a updated review
This review was just flat out horrible
If Circles is a light 8, then swimming is like a strong 6
bruh the ratio of dislikes is insane, kinda thought this would happen tho. bad timing idk espescially for the fuckn artist dying
He ranked this the same as tattle tes by sixnine is he good?
Ya’ll know this is just his opinion right?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgwPxFUUg94&amp;t=115">1:55</a> that&#39;s the point b***... sory.
Damn he hates this guy
he gave ksi a higher score..
Re-review painfully needed!
How do you listen to the album, make a review on it, edit the video, and then still have the audacity to post this. Like at some point you had to have doubts
can’t believe you don’t like this album.
He should not be considered a credible music critic after this awful review.
His biggest L
No offense melon but this review fkn sucks
🚨FAN BEHAVIOR ALERT🚨
fan behavior
hating on u
butch
ugky
shut
ded rn
Time to get your ears cleaned mate
terrible take
Bro this guy rlly said lil pumps first album was better than this one lmfaoa
I love fantano but like this is his biggest L and MBDTF is right behind it
Fuck you for this Anthony.. this album was way better than you gave it credit for.   R.I.P. Mac Miller
This a terrible opinion, been a minute since i watched it but goddamn bro what the fuck
Yeah this review is shit
Fuck yourself piece of shif
What this comment section teaches me: Mac Miller fans are crybabies
Fuck this I&#39;m switching to twitch
Anthony. Cmon
anthony, you have never been more wrong
I could do a better job lol end your career you are bad at your job
Shocked
Mac Miller was not that good, get over it
this just makes me question his circle review and if he was being honest
how did this man not like self care
Worst review ever
Ion even like mac and u wrong 😂
will never forgive him for this. still one of the worse reviews, along with carefor me. I&#39;m gonna unsub now
is u dumb
Literally this whole project was a masterpiece in every sense of the word. The beats are not bland. They’re ridiculously tasteful.
wow i’ve never heard such disgusting disrespect of a beautiful body of work. circles and swimming were companion projects so for you to sit here and say that swimming is a 3 while circles is a 8?? swimming has to be his best work to date and packed full of deep emotion. i’m just floored.
i’m sorry the divine feminine is BORING?? you got a dislike before the review even started
You didn’t even listen to the album on god
This is his worst review ever this album is way better than a three a lot of people can agree with that. this ain’t it Fantano
To this day, this is the worst review Fantano has ever done IMO. Even when it came out I had pretty much felt it was really unfair
dude are you delusional
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgwPxFUUg94&amp;t=165">2:45</a> tho...
This album is amazing and one of the best from 2018. How do you listen to this and not appreciate the production? How do you not feel something on Come Back To Earth or Ladders? How Sway!?
I’m glad everyone else is also mad he didn’t give this a 6/10 😁
<b>Checks the likes and dislikes</b><br>&#39;Ohthony Notano&#39; indeed.
Came back to make sure I had disliked this
2018: *Fantano complains Mac&#39;s album wasn&#39;t particularly sad.<br><br>Two years later, cries his eyes out in front of camera listening to posthumous release.
I know its all opinion, but in my opinion this is one of Melon&#39;s worst ever takes
Happy birthday swimming
POV: You&#39;re fucking soulless
To me self care shows the dichotomy of drug abuse (in a well articulated way i might add). The first beat is very hypnotic and conveys a sense of being stuck or going in circles. It&#39;s the constant state of being numb. Which is probably how mac was feeling at the time. The second half represents the moments of enlightenment that you get from being high. Or possibly that state of floating in oblivion. It feels like walking amongst the clouds and is quite pleasing. However this is no substitute for reality because eventually the high ends and we&#39;re back to what ever situation made us get fucked up in the first place. Some people get stuck in this state of oblivion and end up deadbeat , on the streets, or ODing and in Macs case we see what happened
this is honestly his weirdest review in terms of criticism
Never seen a worse YouTube video in my lifetime
Bruh did you not even listen to the album? Jesus 😂. Self care along is a masterpiece
This and the MBDTF rating is prolly his worst ratings ever
Care For Me<br>Because the Internet<br>Swimming<br>You arguments are contradictory on these three amazing albums.
JESUS CHRIST HE GAVE THIS A 3?
This is the worst review sorry
Now how do you have 2.2m subs?
2 years later and this review still fucking sucks
You’re literally the worst
Everyone is complaining about the 3 while I’m still wondering how the hell he didn’t think Self Care was one of the best tracks
36,000 dislikes and it just got one more 🖐
You’re not edgy bro. Being a hater doesn’t make you cool. Your opinion is straight aids.
This dude couldn’t be anymore of a corny lame hater. Take those stupid glasses off punk.
you fucking suck
this has to be fantanos worst review by far
Just another reason why this dude is garbage....
This album won a Grammy
<b>This video has been demonitized based on community guidelines</b>
Man.. I get it sounds corny first listen, but the more I listen to this the more I love it.. I can&#39;t help but tear up during Come Back to Earth
your ears clearly work different than mine
how did you not like perfecto
Did he just say Mac&#39;s vocals sound like Lil Xan on 2009, arguably the most beautiful song on the album ? Man, we ain&#39;t listening to the same album.
Y&#39;all know it&#39;s just his opinion, right.
I must say I didn’t like this at first.....Now this is my most played Mac album...<br><br>This needs a RE-REVIEW FANTANO!
Bruh you got an IQ of -10. Like, this is one of macs best projects. stop hating. you got a music degree or like ?
Lmao all the fantano fans mad 😂😂 funny how you all hate everything Eminem but this album review you cry over.<br><br>Come on y’all keep the same energy: this is obviously a trash album because it got a 3. Anthony fantano is music so it’s obvious this a garbage album
Please delete this Anthony Fantano...
i still hate you for this
Anthony if you’re reading this , you review albums too quickly , an album like swimming needed to be digested for atleast a couple care rides , pick and choose those albums before you regret a review :(
Honestly just delete this video. FUCK the needledrop for this.
wahaaaat
What the fuck
Fantano you desperately need to listen to this album again.
One of the most impactful/inspiring albums I&#39;ve ever heard, but music is subjective. Idk about this one tho
I don’t know if I’ve ever hated anyone more than you. Your taste in music is absolutely trash with this review, no wonder you’re a nobody.
6ix9ine had the same score on his newest album. He must be trippin
Yeah, this is your opinion, but fuck your opinion :)
Lovely ratio hahahaha
U suck
Horrible, Horrible review.
I respectfully disagree on most has being said in this video. The album has been released on august the 3rd and this video has been released 7 days later, probably recorded 5 maybe 6 day after the album release.<br>I really think that this is not enough to really feel the weight of this record. <br>It really is an album that needs to be listen and listen and everything that seemed rough, boring or uninteresting will make more and more sense as a whole.<br><br>&quot;Came back to earth&quot; the execution leave so much to be desired? Really? That track is a tiny &quot;masterpiece&quot;. Why expect any super vocal experimentation when we know Mac is what it is. That is a soft warm track that doesn&#39;t need anything more. Not to mention the chords progression which is totally dope.<br><br>And this is the opinion of someone that doesn&#39;t even listen to rap music.
God this review is fucking horrible dawg
fuck off for this review
So happy to see this like-dislike ratio.
still haven’t forgiven melon for this .
came back here to say he gave tattletales the same rating
This dude likes 1000 gecs why are we valuing his opinion
you bitch melon
hey guys anthony captano here
I HATE MAC MILLER
Wtf is this
Just saw this for the first time. Mac Miller is my favorite artist and this is my favorite album of all time!! I’m unsubscribing and never using fantano to get opinions on albums!!! Wtf is this
Honestly the worst review of any song....i only came back cos I remembered and got pissed you gave this a 3..
He gave this the same score as taddletales, that is all.
He ranked this .... With 69s ............<br>....<br><br>Wtf are u smoking
Keep in mind this dude thinks deathgripes makes good music
Buddy youre a fat fuck good for nothing who just got lucky with subscribers
Who else is here after Anthony gave takashi new album the same score as this album..
Disagree disagree disagree
The ratings on this video are definitely well deserved.
Ayo this isn&#39;t funny ayo
how do i delete someone else’s youtube
This got the same score as 6ix9ine’s TattleTails
<b>*Fortnite*</b>
Bro seriously this album is not a 3/10
I don’t like you
Fantano is right on this one, y’all just love to boost up artists that have passed away
This album a 11/10 idk what melon was smoking during this review
Fantano thinks 6ix9ine’s new record is as good as Swimming. Make sure to dislike on your way out.
this got the same score as 69’s album
you’re really dumb.
You are so fucking out of your mind. Smh. A classic. As a day 1 Mac fan ..
Okay, its time for a re-review
easily your worst opinion in your life
Talk about bad timing.
Anyone else here 2 years after his death day wondering htf Fantano have this a 3???
WHY IS EVERYONE HATING ON THIS REVIEW MELON IS RIGHT THIS TRASH ASS ALBUM IS SO BORING AND FORGETTABLE PEOPLE NOWADAYS DONT KNOW WHAT IS A OPINION
Lmao I never dislike videos and I just had to here
fuck off mate
This aint it
WTF, How Can He Give This a Negativte Rating?
should i consider this review fantano speaking ill of the dead?
yikes
yeah you really fucked up on this review tbh. it’s a great record but it’s a grower.
we need a swimming redux
I can see how Melon hates this album coming from a bad previous experience but this album coming from finding it in 2019 (post death) is amazing truly and it’s a surreal spiritual experience tbh. <br><br>But also we have differing tastes and I’m not a critic so 🤷🏻‍♂️ I mean.. 2009 is trash and you liked it? 💀
Fuck this
Happy birthday swimming ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I think he secretly regret about this
bruh wtf
Im speechless.
Melon, I love you, but fuck you
Came here for my annual dislike.
he did not just seriously compare Mac on swimming to lil xan on xanarchy 🤦‍♂️
This review. It’s NOT GOOD
You reviewed this as if it this was a hardcore hip hop LP, take it for what it is and you can see the beautiful music Mac made this is at least 8/10 you sir, are fried.
happy 2nd birthday to the album that saved my life :)
This review is what happens when you review an album before listening enough

Happy birthday Swimming! An album ahead of its time
no 💯
2009 is a classic song. cannot believe he trashed it as much as he did. can’t disagree anymore.
i will never forgive him for his shiet opinion
Swimming is his BEST album. Is this a joke?
“Emotionally vacant” .... this is the most emotional album I’ve ever heard.
This is biggest L ever
I just had to come to back to see if he really gave this album a three. Lmao at the guys that take this lemon seriously 😂
I came back just to see if i still have this video disliked
2009 is one of macs best songs
Tantano a lowkey Mac hater
So XXXTENTACION is better than this?<br><br>MBDTF: 6/10<br>Swimming: 3/10<br>Whats Your Pleasure: 9/10<br>Ugly Is Beautiful: 7/10<br>Im Wald: 3/10<br>Weight Of The World: 4/10<br>KIDS SEE GHOSTS: 10/10<br>Carrie And Lowell: 7/10<br><br>i&#39;m officially unsubbing
This is his worst review EVER. He gives Circles an 8 and Swimming a 3??? I personally liked Swimming better than Circles, both are at least a 7, objectively speaking.
The only album on spotify that I liked all the songs, huh guess you have to genuinely know what depression is to understand it. All the songs you feel what he went through, sadness, turmoil, peace, chaos, it was his interpretation of what he was going through and I&#39;m pretty sure anyone who has gone theough sadness can relate with the album. Maybe he is viewing things from a technical stand point, but regardless this album makes you feel a certain way. Mac is drowning and he is learning to swim, the ambience around his songs can be proven with it. It&#39;s a heroes joruney, I disagree this album in my heart gets a 10/10
im so glad everyone else thought that the dislike button was so powerful
i’ve never wanted to physically assault anyone this much in my entire life.
decent 9
Sometimes I agree with this dude but why does he have the right to be so critical? Any musical background at all or is he just saying what he likes
fuck you fantano
Fantano gave a 100 gecs album 3 more points then this, nuff said.
Is this the most disliked Review?
I think people should keep in mind that the 3/10 was his opinion and his tastes are different to yours. So don’t go in here thinking that he is going to listen to the songs from your perspective, but from his. His opinion does not equivale to the “real” and “deserved” 10/10  from your point of view. Have some respect, he is only human
Everyone is being kind of a dick to Anthony but for him saying “What’s the Use?” is the example of some songs on his album that have good beats is kinda stupid. For me, “Ladders” is by far the most jazzy and has more “beats”
Damn I liked this album
2009 is so heart-wrenching because I really first listened to him around 2010 or 11 and it just takes me right back to everything. Mac has been gone the longest and it still hurts the most of all these late artists. RIP all the legends
I feel like the dislikes are from dudes who felt obligated to live the album bc he died
Damn. The dislike ratio is pretty crazy
Cannot believe there is a Lil Xan comparison in this
damn just the fact that the description is the same astounds me , but thats how it be sometime
Yikes
Swimming is an extremely musically intelligent album, I’ve never disagreed with you more
This rating pisses me off to this day
Lil pump 7/10<br><br>Swimming 3/10
Still his worst review all time
Yo this is so dumb Fantano
There hasn’t been a better album since Swimming. And tbh it might be the greatest album ever released. Period.
can you re-review this?
In my top 3 most hated videos on the internet
I just found out about this review and  I don’t think I can trust your opinions now.
You&#39;re high on some crazy shit man...
The more I listened to it I liked it more overtime. I didn&#39;t care for it a whole lot when I first gave it a few plays. It&#39;s fuckin GOOD
I love you melon but this is a fat L
Holy shit I just noticed how bad the like dislike ratio is
tri poloski
This is one of those times when I understand Anthony’s reasoning but still completely disagree with him entirely.
I like you Anthony but fuck you
This is bs. Fantano clearly didnt give this album a proper study and he reviewed it anyway for views. His criticisms weren&#39;t specific and he contradicts himself several times. Bro the singing ain&#39;t even different than the singing on circles. How you gonna say that what&#39;s the use has underwhelming production?
FUCK outta here lmao
i hate this video so fucking much i really cannot explain it
this is the most disagreeable review for me, and not because he died.. i feel like a lot of people disliking this are doing so because mac died, which is expected, i&#39;m pretty sure your lil peep album reviews got bombarded after he died too... but his come over when you&#39;re sober project did kinda suck. swimming however was a fantastic album, probably mac&#39;s best.
Terrible, terrible review
Swimming is great album FOREVER!!!!
Unsubbed, felling friends to unsub, disliking all past videos
i took no time to dislike this video.
I haven’t had the urge to punch someone and make them stop taking this bad in a while. Wow. Fuck you to mate
Man i never thought you could hate ur own race
This is the Battlefield Earth of your reviews
I still can&#39;t believe he called mac miller a &quot;degenerate wigger who got what he deserved&quot; jesus christ
Rip Mac Miller his last 3 albums were so good and chill
And he gave 8 to billie eilish
We all know you only gave Circles a 9 because it was the popular thing to do and you wanted to win people over. It makes no sense why you would shit all over him in this review and praise him in the next. Very fake and off putting Anthony.
His last 2 albums will be classics. Honestly it’s one of his best work.
This album is amazing.
Easily the worst music review of all time. Maybe even the worst EVER
FUNNIEST VIDEO IVE EVER SEEN GOOD ONE
Just damn
This is the album that introduced me to miller. I couldn&#39;t disagree more with this critique
I feel attacked
I&#39;m glad we all agree this review was shit and swimming is an excellent album
This was your opinion on this amazing album? Why do people look to you for music reviews if you have views like this
This aged well.
“Y’all know this is just my opinion, right?”
Fantano’s worst review ever. Even with 2 MBDTF 6/10s
This will forever be your worst review
This album is Mac Miller&#39;s Some Rap Songs.
Yeah looking back at it I can say that melon most definitely killed this man
Beautiful review🥰🐐
man, this album saved my life.  He was trying to quit a drug addiction just like Mac and all the typical ones he addresses on the album are so brutal
Worst review of yours I&#39;ve seen, sorry
Man stop killing people.
Melon must’ve listened to a pirated version.
IDK why everyone is surprised with this being a 3 but circles being an 8. Mac himself said his lyrics and music are going to be underappreciated until after he dies. Just listen to Salamander from 2013. even if the song is not as serious overall, he still has some legitimate problems he states in that song.
This new Anthony Fantano review, it’s NOT GOOD
31k dislikes 7k likes.. ur killing it bro! Keep your irrelevant trash opinions coming!
This review should disqualify any credibility Anthony ever had. This review along with The OOZ and Carrie and Lowell.
trash review bro
The only Fantano review I’ve ever disliked
came here just to dislike
this was the only review where I disagreed with fantan0
And dark side of the moon was a bad album... You&#39;ve lost all credibility. redo this review
You&#39;re so wrong.  Id like to find a YouTuber that reviews rap but isn&#39;t a fucking asshole and dumbass...  I mean fuck off
Does anyone at all remember what the like/dislike ratio was before Mac died? I&#39;m sure it was unpopular at the time but I feel like there&#39;s no way it was this bad. People shouldn&#39;t be disliking the video just because the review is negative and he died, it sucks he didn&#39;t like the album but it&#39;s nothing personal.
Te odeio
you listened to the wrong album anthony
Yeah this is fucking stupid
Your opinion is wrong
Like everyone else here, I strongly disagree
COMO LE DAI UN 3 A SWIMMING HERMANO K ONDA
This review just ruined fantano for me. To see him talk so much shit on this gem of a project and then turn around and cry over good news for the views. Smh
He needs to redo this...
Honestly how the fuck does anyone listen to this guy
this is the same dude who shed tears on camera after Mac died. take this L you bum!
THIS VID HAS A SHITLOAD OF DIslikes is funny i also disagree tho anthony u fucked up ily tho
This is a modern class album I’m not even that big of a Mac fan and I still think is amazing
saying &quot;mac miller sucks ass&quot; for 5 minutes straight isn&#39;t a review, god damn melon.
I think people are getting the idea that people are saying the review aged badly soley because Mac passed, but its really just because this was a shitty review. I love Anthony, but never have I disagreed with a musical opinion more. Anthony truly just didn’t like Mac at the time of him releasing this album, and its sad to see that it took Mac passing for Anthonys opinion on him to change.
The modern age MBDTF Review
Youre hoenstly such a piece of garbage. Fuck you dude
You shouldn’t be allowed to listen to music if you watch the needle drop
this review… it’s NOT GOOD
Jesús Christ clown
To this day I have no idea how Anthony couldn&#39;t piece together the context that this album came out of. Mac had broken up with Ariana grande, which was obviously a huge part of his life as they had a friendship ever since they both started making music. He had gotten back on drugs, a problem that he had been struggling with for almost 7 years at this point. The album sounds fake because it is, he was making music about how he wanted to feel not how he was actually feeling. When you make happy music when you&#39;re sad the two emotions cancel each other out, leading to a feeling of no emotion. I know half of these points were only confirmed in hindsight, but to be honest I think we all had a feeling that all this shit was happening. Idk it just pisses me off to see someone so smart like melon not see the very obvious point of the album
By far your worst review of anything
This is the first video of yours I&#39;ve ever seen. All I can say is when I first heard Swimming it smacked me in the face. I&#39;ve never been on more of a different page with someone musically in my life. Still respect your opinion though, you&#39;re entitled to that.
dis album was ass
I listened back on this album and I really liked it
Bruh this is the worst review ever
dude what the fuck, is this a parallel universe or sum, this review is whack
This review is a example of how pretentious cynicism can backfire into your own face once contexts enters the fold.
still one of the biggest Ls, melon. a shame.
The writing and production on Swimming were brilliant, the listener can truly listen to it front to back without skipping. <br>Mr. Fantano needs to take a puff and reevaluate.
yeah sorry melon, you are a man of knowledge but clearly you must of had your stereo system plugged into the wrong aux input. This album was truly blissful to listen to. also, you are just gonna brush over SELF CARE. Anthony if you ever read this, please give it another listen.
redo this one
Fuck you fantano
Fact he said it was &quot;emotionally vacant&quot; shows me we didn&#39;t hear the same music.
he can have his opinion, this album just wasn&#39;t for him. that being said, you did watch the review, everyone should have braced for the worst.
i´m going to stop whathing this channel....
You are incorrect
PERFECTO WAS HIS LEAST FAVORITE SONG JESUS CHRIST FANTAMO
More personal? Dude hasn&#39;t put out an unpersonal album ever
Love you fantano but WOW you really missed the mark on this album, couldn&#39;t disagree more on your opinion here :/
This shit aged so awfully.
i know you didn&#39;t like the album but you didn&#39;t have to kill him, Melon.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgwPxFUUg94&amp;t=99">1:39</a> why this review sucks
“The beats are consistently lifeless” then two sentences later “generally the beats are pleasant and occasionally pretty” like bruh thats a huge contradiction
Bruh and i thought i was the clown here
This album is a strong 8 to light 9. Idk which album fantano heard
A THREE?? I THOUGHT HE GAVE THIS REVIEW A SEVEN.. A SEVEN!! WHAT THE FFFF?? A THREE?!
You are so disgusting
This is worse than his mbdtf review, aged sooo badly
this was his worst review yet, came back to make sure i disliked
I feel like fantano missed the point of the whole album
Bruh 2009 is the best song in that album
Dude is straight up talking out of his ass
The album was shit
One of my favourite albums...
Fantano you fucked up
I say do a redo. I like the album. I thought it was soulful and funky. Okay man isn&#39;t the best singer but it&#39;s not a deal breaker. I enjoyed the album and made my own swimming in circles playlist. The pairing goes well
This ain&#39;t it melon... Swimming deserves a hard 6 light 7 AT LEAST
No. Bad. Disagree
It is more than year after this review and i still don&#39;t know how Melon gave this album 3/10. To be honest i agree with DAMN. and 7/10, i wasn&#39;t mad when he gave 6/10 for MBDTF but now i&#39;m a bit dissapointed cuz this record is 3/10 for Anthony, when Circles is 8/10 lmao, idk why but it&#39;s a bit lame for me when records that are that much similar have that much different score, that&#39;s all from me i just wanted to wrote my thoughts here.
the fact that this has the same amount of dislikes as the MBDTF review is really saying a lot lmao
Melon is a literal murderer<br><br>X<br>Mac<br>Linkin park<br>Lil peep
bandwagon much???? you gave this a 3 but circles an 8??
LEAST FAV TRACK : PERFECTO<br>What?
But he loves circles ☕️🐸
currently un thumbs downing so i can re thumb down
This is the worst review in the history of reviews
This album was an amazing evolution from Mac to a more mature and introspective genre
this is wrong
I&#39;ve liked most of your reviews - this is by far the worst. Couldn&#39;t disagree with you more.
L
I&#39;m ducking angry
delete this pls
I’ve never seen so many people who can’t handle an opinion.
I get wut u mean by saying dat it is emotionless but I think that’s exactly how it should’ve sounded just the lack of motivation. <br>And I think that he wanted to present a feel of emptiness with this album cause he can’t even get sad about some things no more. <br>-Just applying to that album <br><br>Sry If I have explained myself poorly I tried
Come on fantano
Normally your album reviews are pretty spot on, but this just isn’t that. This isn’t his best work, but it still has worthwhile pieces that you neglected or nit picked at small details
One of the few Melon reviews where i just have to go &quot;wtf are you talking about&quot;
Completely discredited.
this is trash
Here after the Circles review: Its funny that Anthony gives Circles an 8 out of 10 and Swimming such a low rating when the two albums are literally companion albums. Mac kept the same jazzy type beats and instrumentals, the low raspy singing tone, emotional lyrics as he did on Swimming with Circles. But now all a sudden Anthony praises this style of Mac and sees Circles as a way to express macs pain and emotion, but that’s all he was trying to do on Swimming. I know it’s not genuine though, I’m sure if Mac was alive Anthony would of rated Circles a 2 or some shit. Shame.
I feel like Anthony put a high standard for Mac and that’s why he rated it so low.
this is more outrageous than mbdtf
YOU RE WRONG MELON SWIMMING IS 2/10 AT BEST
inb4 swimming shows up on his “10 albums i changed my opinion on part 3”
You are a very bad man.
this guy gave swimming a 3/10 and then gave circles an 8/10. .literally. part of the same project. had to come back check to see if I was tripping.
This and MBDTF are your worst reviews. Still love you though Melon
“I feel like Mac keeps working outside of his strengths and shows no effort to fix the problems his last record showed” <br>This just sounds like trashing on someone trying to take a risk to do something different instead of respecting it. Atleast Circles woke you up to the true meanings of his direction with his music because truthfully, I think Swimming in Circles WAS EXACTLY HIS STRENGTH. I MEAN GOD The talent to be so complex with sound through emotions...
Isn&#39;t it weird that Anthony disliked this album and then a month later, Mac Miller is dead?
Are you going to review Circles?
Holy fuck my brain can’t even comprehend how someone who listens to music could objectively give this album a 3...... youre talentless.
you just sound like an asshole here
Wtf this dude is fucking crazy. Probably never struggled a day in his life. That’s why he can’t relate to REAL emotions. Sure Mac isn’t a perfect singer... it’s about EXPRESSION. This album is one of my favorite of all time. Dealing with addiction issues as well I find it so relatable. A real masterpiece. I hate this guy. This album was nominated for a  Grammy so he’s obviously wrong. Lol music reviewer my ass
I don’t know mate, you missed the mark on this one 😬
but somehow mbdtf is the review that is most hated. INTERESTING.
How this man listened to “come back to earth” and “2009” and equates it to being locked in a torture chamber I will never understand
This has not aged well. Rights to cry about Mac revoked.
You fucked this up Anthony. I swear if you fuck up circles, you’re gonna fuck me up. Fuck you Melon.
Worst review since house of balloons
thought u were wrong about 2009 but i went and listened to it hahahaha noooooooooo
Its kindda annoying to think that mac might have seen this stupid review
if he doesnt redux review this post-circles i SWEAR TO GOD. i dont think i would even judge for changing post-humous, i just want to see you admit that you are incorrect
Literally this video could ruin your credibility I think you need to re listen
Mac Miller sucks
This review has aged so badly on so many levels.
please review this again
No effort??????? He’s one of the most passionate and hard driven rappers in the rap game.
This is easily the worst review he’s ever done
Don&#39;t know if I can wait until 2028 for a redux review on this one.
You’re fucking dumb.
Fantano be like the more adjectives I use the smarter I look
This was just a bad review, it&#39;s just seems a personal thing for him about Mac&#39;s style on his album that he dislikes and just doesn&#39;t give a chance, he doesn&#39;t even talk about each song or something
Just listened to the album... damn I’m sorry that you weren’t able to connect to it. :/
because the internet, my beautiful dark twisted fantasy and Swimming will forever be your most controversial reviews.
Nah
yall saying he hates his music,,,<br><br>have u ever seen him cry during a reaction<br><br>watch good news reaction 😞
You gave this a 3 out of 10 and now you&#39;re crying to his newest song gtfoh
Wow I can&#39;t understand how someone would give this below a 7
Just have to be the first one to come out and say you are full of shit bro. You shitted on swimming’s so hard but then Good News comes out and you think it’s beautiful when both albums COMPLIMENT each other, you are fake as fuck hope those fake tears don’t get you shit
He&#39;s probably gonna change his score. Sometimes when he develops an opinion on someone, it&#39;s hard for him to be open i noticed.
Wow forgot this was this low how can you like good news and then hate this album they are very much one in the same
is this your most downvoted video or nah?
I think its funny... hes hating on this album so hard but then on the good news song review he crys.... FAKE AS FUCK! UNSUBED...
Fuck this guy. Macs the dopest artist to ever walk the planet.
I would love to see Anthony react to the lyrics now after hearing Good News. I never truly understood the meaning of Mac’s words but I feel him now more than ever. I feel like swimming deserves another chance. <br><br>And no, I am not mad at Melon. I just want him to approach Millers work with a clean slate.
must be regretting going in so hard on mac now.
I’ve been watching Fantano for the better part of a decade and I wholeheartedly believe this is easily one of the worst reviews he’s ever released.
Let’s not forget he gave Lil Pump a 7 but gave this beauty a 3
I wouldn’t blame Fantano for this review completely because it’s clear he couldn’t connect with the mood its trying to set. Because Mac was clearly not in the best state of mind while making swimming it comes across as very moody and understated as a whole which I guess Anthony couldn’t vibe with. For somebody in a state of mind closer to that of Mac at the time (ex: a student feeling like the world has nothing else to offer), this album is a masterpiece.
A couple minutes in and I quit watching... just take this video down. It’s an absolute master piece
This is why Mac killed himself
TIL THIS DAY ill never understand this review
I mean.....songs like 2009, ladders, and come back to earth alone are master pieces!!!! 3??? I am listening to 2009 on almost a daily basis. I tear up each time. I feel and hear every single word. Maybe you need to listen to it again? Like really listen.
within just over a year Anthony is now crying over his music
It bothers me to my core that you had all this negative stuff to say about swimming, but now that he’s dead you’re gonna praise his newly released song like it doesn’t have the EXACT same feel and sound.
Oh my God. He killed Mac too.
only video I&#39;ve ever disliked
Guys hear me out. HE HAS AN OPINION! The fact mac is dead doesn&#39;t mean melon has to love the album.
from hating this to crying on the Good News track review
This review alone proves your opinion really isn&#39;t worth listening to lol. You do make some good videos sometimes though in your defense.
Time for a REDUX REVIEW of this alongside the Circles review.
You need to do a redux of this project ASAP
He reviewed Good News and loved it. It&#39;s very much like the vibe of Swimming, this guy is just trying to get on this wagon of sorrow for the guy. Not a true fan, just someone looking for clicks.
This hasn’t aged well since Mac got his ass crying on the “Good News” review.
Who&#39;s here after the good news review
I disagree
everyone saying he only cried during &quot;good news&quot; in order to make up for this review is idiotic. he does not care if you passed away or not, he listens to the music and rates the music alone, which is why he was critical of both peep and x&#39;s posthumous records, even after being critical of the ones they made when they were alive. just because he gave mac a bad review, he didnt feel like he needed to make up for it in his new review. the track just genuinely resonated with him.
If you hated this for the reasons you did, how can you say you like Good News and have it being you to tears
worst review ever, also that &#39;Huge Fan Cries to Good News review&#39; was just to make up for this ass video, you clearly dont like this sound that mac produces and theres no way you just love this new song if you made this review. u a walmart shoplifter u lil bittt
you’re just fu cking wrong
Who&#39;s here after he cried to Good News? 🤔
Dude, I listen to a lot of your reviews and most of the time you make spot on observations and articulate them fairly well. You&#39;re also brutally honest which is what a critic should be, but I cannot stress how much you totally missed this record. <br><br><br>&quot;No vocal presence&quot; / &quot;coming up short musically&quot; / &quot;no effort to improve upon the weaknesses his last album showed&quot; <br><br><br>Jesus. Listen again mate.
Came just to dislike because, YOU&#39;RE WRONG! Good day.
after his review of good news, i think anthony now understands the appeal that swimming has had to so many people. I feel if he redid this album review he would rate it significantly higher
Now he made a review on his latest in 2020 and he&#39;s crying about his song good news and u said he was on a spiral to doing worse music now you appreciate him and its to prob to late because its problem the last you will hear from him but it doest matter to you since you say he&#39;s going on a spiral to do bad music you start to really listen when its already to late.
2020 and still you&#39;re talking bulshit
Who&#39;s here after the Good News Track Review?
RATIOED
Swimming was a fucking 8 don’t @me
I bet he regrets about that, if ya checked the last review on “good news”
This is your worst take of all time melon
And this gets recommended to me right after I see the &#39;Good News&#39; track review.
Here after melon crying over Macs latest song “Good News”. RIP, Mac Miller. You’ll never be forgotten.
I honestly think Fantano just didn’t like mac miller. He never gave any of his projects the praise they deserved. How do you give post Malone a 7 and swimming a 3? What the f*ck melon.
who else came here after seeing melon cry
You are so wrong, sooo wrong. Sorry, you don&#39;t have a clue about music
The needle drop thinks he can do better, screw you u young ass bald ass old man. He’s a legend, you are not
You&#39;re entitled to your wrong opinion.
When Self Care isnt even on your Fav Tracks list I realise that this review is a utter disappointment wth Anthony
idiot
Fuck you anthony.
Interested as to see what his thoughts on Circles is going to be
This guy must be deaf
Mac Miller overdosed after watching this video
Where’s the redux for this? You trashed this album bro
Needs a redux
Hey chief gonna just let you know right now we dont want your review of the new album okay sweet thanks
Worst review done yet.... wow. This album is great.
THIS IS THE CORRECT SCORE WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT
My first dislike ever. Using it well
I just listened to this and I almost fell asleep. I don’t remember the last time I’ve been bored listening to a record. 2009 sounded promising at first, but then immediately fell flat as soon as he started singing. Not good, imo.
You honestly are garbage
A 3 are you fcuking kidding!!! Hahahahhahahaha. This album in no way is under a 7. My opinion 9 but your wrong fantano.
This album was at least a 5. A 3 is pretty harsh, but I agree on some points.
Fuck you
ok this has to be re reviewed mr
Yikes, a 3? I respect your opinion, since you’re incredibly knowledgeable. I do have to say though, your worst take probably ever.
he just does not like Mac&#39;s dirty feet, boo fucking hoo not cool Antnee
Holy shit Melon get fucked on this one
it was trash get over it fucking crybabies his death doesnt make it less garbage
emotionally vacant ? wthhhhhhhhhhh man, unsuscribed
“The beats on this thing are consistently lifeless, spacey, and bland”<br><br>“Generally the beats on this thing are pleasant, occasionally they are showstoppingly pretty”<br><br>What are you talking about?
bruh you fucked up at this one
this review still baffles me
PERFECTO AS LEAST FAVORITE TRACK
This guy dumb Af
On his Swimming ALBUM Review, <del>Mac Miller</del> <b>Anthony Fantano</b> continues to work outside of his strengths without improving at all upon the obvious weaknesses of his previous album review.
In my own opinion I just disagree with your review ik that you don’t care BUT I do . I thought that swimming was a masterpiece like what most of the people down in the comment section said I thought that the album put you in a bunch of different emotions but it makes you have a up lifting feeling I guess you could call it but it also has a lot of feel good music it doesn’t sound boring it sounds full of soulful music and this is the only album that I’ve hear of Mac Miller i lived under a rock the first song I hear by Mac was self care and just hearing the full album I thought it was good music what do u think
Dude this album is nothing like you’re calling it
this is literally a hate channel. this guy just fucking hates everything.
Still the only time I&#39;ve ever disagreed with you. But damn do I seriously disagree
nobody liked that
🖕
daily reminder that fantano was totally wrong about this
This guy rates music but doesn’t like music
I’m confused...
I just came back to watching fantano recently and rewatching this video made me remember why.
MAC was at his best in his most recent two albums, you&#39;re crazy
Jesus....the comment section is triggered asf. Wonder how fantano handled this situation because they can&#39;t take his opinion on this album and it shows by the like and the dislike bar.
I respect your opinion but it’s dumb
How do you impress this needle drop guy dude.
You’re opinions are terrible
Melon&#39;s clowning with this one
I Fucking Love Swimming. All of it. Front to Back. Nonstop. Sorry Not Sorry.
first time watching, and last time watching you
lot of hate going on, not my type of rap music, his music is mature rap.
I’ll never value your opinion again
I felt the same way the first time I heard this album. Swimming didn&#39;t hit me until I was ready to hear it, and then I realized it was one of the most beautiful pieces of art I&#39;ve ever heard. Mac really communicates so many things through this album. Listen to it while you&#39;re very present and maybe use some psychedelics, and this album will really speak to you. Mac is a Legend
I fucking love this. Fair honest review with some humor. Perfect!
aint no way you were being fr on this one, say sike rn
Fuck you - that’s all
I&#39;m 4 songs in and I&#39;m very bored. I actually liked Divine feminine despite it&#39;s clear flaws. This album is definitely worse.
This album sux
I came here expecting me to hate this no good fatass baby and his review
Man for a music reviewer, you have to admit you have a lot of terrible takes
I LOVE this album but I respect it
You’re bugging
This was and still is his best album
Damn, I was expecting a light 7
People think Mac made think album cause he thought he could sing well aren&#39;t very smart. This is an album he made for himself. Not for anyone else. Y&#39;all the reason he started taking drugs in the first place. Not enjoying the music for what it is and comparing it to others.
This dude is a fucking clown
Guy is such a hater. He doesn’t even touch on the entire concept of this album.
I gst that you didnt like the album but you didnt have to say this is the reason he deserved to die
Literally all of mac millers albums are so good. I love fantano but this is his worst reviews ever
This makes me hate you. Imagine giving Kids See Ghost a 10. Fucking idiot.
Sorry Fantano with all due respect you are wrong for this review. This album was a piece of art created by an amazing beautiful soul. You probably didn’t enjoy it because you can’t relate to have suffered.
Swimming should have won Rap album of the year
Fuck you.
Dont hate the Melon bcuz Mac is dead OK for me its Not a 3 but a 5 its Not that good
I never thought I&#39;d say this but your subjective opinion is objectively wrong. You should listen again and if your opinion comes out the same consider yourself an idiot.
Even despite his death, you were definitely in the minority on this one
Deathony Noteano here.
I just dont understand this guys job. Why do people care about anybody’s opinion on music?! MUSIC OF ALL THINGS! It’s all subjective. His opinion is just that...he’s not “better” at listening to music than anyone else. Dudes essentially a fraud. Don’t let people tell you how to listen to music
Lmao wtf
Whaaaat. This album got me into Mac Miller!! This is one of his best works!
The main reason you guys find this album so good is because of his tragic death
youtube royalty money going down the drain in front of  your own viewers&#39; eyes. you hate to see it.
wow this comments section is sad
Ltony Ltano
bruh really???
Fuck you
I&#39;ve never disagreed with you more
wtf
Jesus Christ you fucking killed him dude
Only thing I agreed with the whole video started at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgwPxFUUg94&amp;t=331">5:31</a>
You should run it back. With a few listens and focus on the lyricism, this album is really good. A heart-breaking cry for help with nice instrumentation that deserves deeper consideration.
I have never genuinely got upset over one of your reviews before this. All i can say is you are wrong. Very wrong.
100% agree, this album was trash
this review didn’t age well
Does Anthony like any good music?
God you are out of touch buddy, just fuck off
Moby looking ass bitch
You’re a loser bro
I respect your opinion, but fuck you. I hope that was respectful enough, Anthony.
I hate you
I agree. I found this album to be pretty bad. I wasn&#39;t a fan of mac miller and this just sealed the deal.
How dare you
Looking back on this shit melon. You were waaay off the mark.
You&#39;re wrong for this one
I agree with this review, wish he gave it a lower score though. Hate this fucking album
Your opinion is wrong
I wish I just had a list of the records he rated higher than this one, it would be a comedy genuinely. Cardi b is obviously better than Mac guys!
b r u h 🤦‍♂️
You probably think this video has so many dislikes because Mac passed &amp; people are backlashing.<br>Nope, you&#39;re just wrong on this one Melon.
I hope Melon thinks about this heinous moment in his life and reflects on how shitty his opinion was. How dare he disrespect such a fantastic album like that
fuck you bitch
Mac Millers voice is so goddamn annoying and a great majority of his songs have no sort of substance.
bruh you have no idea what youre talking about
Your opinion is wrong
All of you hipocrit melon dick riders need to stop with the <b>oH yOu DiSAgrEe wItH HIs RrEvIew sO Ur a BuTthURt fAnboY</b> <br>Like I&#39;ve seen the same 2 guys bashing every comment disagreing with his Anthony&#39;s review or defending Mac (@Donnell Michoch &amp; @Labedincoln) saying that people don&#39;t know what subjectivity means while literally atacking people with deferent opinions.<br><br>There are reasons to believe that this is a poorly made review<br>1. He comes of very biased against Mac disregarding his song writing and delivery as depressive and booring  and disregarding his singing as just whining without providing reasoning<br>2. He literally contradicts himself saying something along the lines of <b>the instrumentals are pleasant</b> at the start of the review and later on saying that the production is lifeless which just ACTUALLY MAKES THE REVIEW SEEM LESS CREDIBLE<br><br>while I do DISAGRE with people saying he is a trash reviewer and has 0 credibility and I do agree with him having the right to provide us with his opinions we also have the right to expres our own<br>While I do understand that he generally doesn&#39;t like this sort of mellow emotional music IN MY OPINION he just provides a lot of shallow critiques on this one without backing them up and just comes off as if he&#39;s biased towards Mac and is overly exagerating the flaws of this project while ignoring or minimizing it&#39;s strengths
Worst review yet.
Different belief systems cause a lot of conflict between people. Yes this is just a review but people are getting angry because of beliefs and this shit bothers me because Swimming and its Lyricism, saved my life, and helped me find peace in the face of suicidal thoughts and depression. People are going to be angry and thats ok cause its human nature and it’s their own opinion. Good thing people can think freely
Beats are lifeless???????
I&#39;m not saying this because Mac is dead, because lots of people tend to glorify a dead artists albums or songs, but regardless of his death, this was one of my top 5 favorite albums of 2018. I could listen to this on repeat from start to finish without skipping any songs. I thought it was amazing because it&#39;s more or a personal album instead of an easy mac with the cheesy raps album. Melon definitely missed the whole point of it. R.I.P. Mac Miller
whack review
Damn, he rated a bts album better than this? Whack.
My first time disliking a youtube video.<br><br><br>Dude you suck, fuck you.
Easily his best review
You’re NOT GOOD
&quot;Y&#39;all know this is just my opinion, right?&quot;
really hope niggas didn&#39;t hate this bc he fucking died
Yeah man you really have to give this one a re-listen. Not to say you&#39;re not entitled to your own opinion but 25k to 7.3k speaks volumes, and I&#39;m going to tell you right now it&#39;s not just because he passed away. The album really got into his head and what he was going through. I really feel like as an artist Mac grew with me from that goofy kid to the point now as a generation we&#39;re all coming into our 30&#39;s. I know the album syrupy and the first time I heard it I wasn&#39;t sure how I felt about it, but I really think you should keep this one in mind for a Changed My Opinion video.
this aint it buddy
So i see a lot of people hating on this review. Ppl coming back to “make sure they disliked this”. Just because someone passes away doesn’t automatically make their album great. It just shifts your perception
i saw the flanel and disliked
This song is the gift of god himself to humanity you fucking cantaloupe
LIFELESS BEATS? THE FUCKING BEAT SWITCH ON SELF CARE GAVE ME LIFE
So I was here when this review got out and I&#39;m here again, a year after, and my dude 3/10??? are you for real real? Never listened much of the Millers earlier stuff since I didnt see whats the big deal about his music, but this shit is something else. I dont understand what were you listening to to give it a 3.. your opinion, I know I know.. Just wanted to say your opinion here = trash. bye
I knew who Mac was since K.I.D.S. Liked that track enough when it came out that I kept an ear out for him over the years. Definitely wouldn&#39;t say I was a fan, but then I caught his Tiny Desk performance and was blown away by how much he had evolved. What a shame he passed away, I think he was just getting started. Swimming is definitely his masterpiece and he can be proud he left the world a true peice of art. Well done Mac.
Your regrets look like reviews you shouldn&#39;t post
i thought the album was fantastic, i really felt like mac had finally discovered his sound. youre reviewing this album before really listening to it. cus if you had really listened and understood the subject matter you would never have been this cold
Someone having their own opinion on an opinion based channel... That&#39;s crazy man!
Shut your fucking mouth you sleepless potato looking ass
I disagree, I thought it was a great album.
He saying &quot;y&#39;all know this is just my opinion right?&quot; Idgaf that still doesn&#39;t justify how dumb you clearly are. Definitely out of touch with good music.
Dude look like Humpty Dumpty. If I ever see this guy in person I&#39;m smacking him straight across the face and breaking your glasses on God. Mac wouldn&#39;t want that but fuck that this is straight up disrespectful and simply false.
Clearly you just didn&#39;t like Mac cause I can&#39;t think of any other logical reason to why you would say all that about this album. Must be a little Ariana Grande fan boy. L.
R u fucking kidding me
Fuck you, Fantano<br><br><br>Fucking idiot
How did your career survive this review
if you&#39;ve watched melon for a while, you should know he doesn&#39;t  like this kind of music. Doesn&#39;t mean its bad, but its not for him. hes out here giving his own opinion and your all crying over that. just make your own vid talking about how much you love the album, anyone would respect that (except for you people apparently)
I often wonder if Mac Watched your reviews
This album was a masterpiece. If you didn&#39;t cry at the end of so it goes, you have no soul
Funny how Melon is describing exactly what&#39;s special about Mac&#39;s voice and then goes on to say there&#39;s nothing special about his voice...
You&#39;re wallpaper. You&#39;re tacky and I hate you. This album is incredible, front to back. Go listen to Radiohead.
rip lil peep :&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;/
How dare you he&#39;s dead bruh this is his very LAST album and doesnt that mean anything to you pepple would die for that album
no one would give a shit if he hadnt died
man what the fuck is this review, this album is EASILY, A 9. EASILY. this is his worst review ever
how has the video not been deleted. i can’t find a single comment where someone agrees with him.
this is my first and last video of yours
The fact is you constantly were aware that you did not enjoy mac&#39;s music from past reviews. You&#39;ve given his work, that he put his blood, sweat, and tears into a bad name and constantly dismissed the effort he was putting in to make beautiful music and also sharing his experience to help others. If you do not like an artist or their music, please stop reviewing their music. 5 projects later the same outcome, you&#39;re being greedy in your own personal gain and sacrificing someones brand and well being. Please enter positive energy into the universe, i&#39;m all for constructive criticism and helping others progress, but when you&#39;re slandering and making a profit off of it, that&#39;s plain wrong.
Underwhelming instrumentals WHAT??!?! This album has the best instrumentals of 2018. Sometimes i really wonder what you look for in music man😒 my review of your review 🚮 /10
Lol let Kendrick have dropped this though, would&#39;ve easily been at least an 8/10
delete this mane
I still think you’re fucking insane for the 3/10 fuck you
Still don&#39;t understand how this got a 3...
Fantano dropped the ball on this review. Mac did the music he wanted to do on this album and did it well. Why are we not putting this review on blast? Fantano is click bait?<br>Fk this dude making money on shTtng on albums. Good luck Maattthew. <br>You really made yourself look 👀 good huh?<br>Fk that. <br>Show your support for Mac’s way out.
People are just butthurt about this review because he died.  Like, chill, people he&#39;s not a god, he&#39;s just some rapper.  Have you stans not learned anything from XXXTentacion? XD
no, even after the emotions over his death are gone its still common sense that the album was pretty good
I feel like a lot of people are just mad solely because Mac Miller died sadly. The album definitely is good but was 1000% slept on up until he died and everyone was like “:( I was always a fan” just like when lil peep died or nipsey
Linkin park: “not good” (dies) <br>Lil peep “not good” (dies) <br>Xxx “worst album of the year” (dies) <br>Mac Miller “3/10” (dies)<br>What’s going on melon? 🤔
Easily worse than the DAMN review. I dont get how you don’t understand this album fantano
<b>Only album I&#39;ve listened to over 50 times all the way through.</b>
I feel like Fantano gives good artists bad reviews to make his melon head feel good
you’re a pinhead
Worst music reviewer ever...
I agree this shit sounds like some mid at best
Fuck this review
I still listen to swimming 🌊 an I came back to make sure I disliked your opinion RIP mac
i hate to say it but this is easily worse than the MBDTF review
litterally just trashing him the whole vid, barely a review
This is the dumbest thing fantano has ever put out
Dude has no idea what music is lmao.
As soon as the one minute marker starts.  You contradict yourself several times and made bland opinionated statements that have no back up claim.  I’m honestly convinced you didn’t even listen to the album
Imma start calling mac “Mac MiLer” cause fantano took the L
I reported this video
my beautiful dark twisted fantasy 2
Can&#39;t disagree with you more. You&#39;re wrong on this one buddy
do actually fucking like music...i don’t think i’ve seen any positive reviews other than tpab, which don’t count that shit legendary but shihtt bruh you such a drag tf
This piece of art got a 3 but Gucci Gang got a 7 excuse me what the fuck melon
clown
This is dumb as shit
You suck
why?
.
Melon def not a stoner XD my boy mac be fillin my head on this indica shit all day
I concur
This did not age well
You killed him you moron
Fuck off
Bro are u dumb
You know fucking nothing.
Your opinion has no merit
He can give a bad review it’s sad he died but it’s his honest opinion do you want him to just lie? That’s stupid stop being butthurt
Ive never heard someone talk so much shit in 5min , Im angered. Im going to like this vídeo.
no
L I F E L E S S
Fuck you
what a terrible review, my god
You got to be open minded, his style is unique and lyrically he’s great with some dope beats and yes he’s not the best singer (which he admits) but i would not dare compare him to lil xan come on bro
Anthony you sometimes make me happy, but also sometimes i just fucking hate you
sorry had to use my alt account to dislike again.  clearly you were fighting with your girl or some shit while listening because you&#39;re tweaking on this one
1010
Is this Cringe?
Jesus. This comment section.
Am I the only one here that agreed with him? 😭
Dude... what
Just the idea that So it goes and self care aren’t “liked” is sin worthy
i respect your disagreement.<br><br>unsubscribed.
I like your music taste but on this video with every your word my heart hurts more and more, strongly disagree on this
One of the best albums i ever heard ,i&#39;m unfollowing you cuz you pissed me off before in some of your previous reviews but in some cases i understood your jugement but in this one you tripping hard .
The only reason y some people are disliking this is bc Mac passed away. Passing away doesn’t make your music better.
Thats nice.<br><br>I&#39;m gonna go listen to the whole ass album for the 75th time
This is so completely dishonest man... like I know it’s your opinion and I’m really trying to hold back how much this review bothers me, even though it shouldn’t. This album consistently delivered incredibly memorable tracks with fantastic production and incredible writing and word play. Calling this album a torture chamber is a complete insult to the tremendous amount of work and emotion behind each and every single track. Like fuck man no attention to the lyrics? Like at all? Such a bad review, completely biased. <br><br>Rip Mac I wish we could’ve saw your next project.
how tf you gonna swimming a 3
Generally agree with you but wtf were you smoking on this one?
Nobody liked that
I respect your opinion but this is my favorite album
I didnt listen to Mac at all until after his death and this album is genuinely great at what it does. I dont know if Anthony was trying to see something that wasnt there or hoping for a different sound but I think Mac did an amazing job on the production of Jazz and Hip Hop and it&#39;s album title fits so well throughout the record as he explores different themes and emoitons to conclude himself in a state of moving on yet reflecting. One of his worst reviews yet in my opinion because I think Mac had truly started to rebirth himself as a character until his untimely death.
olha, oh cabeça de batata do caralho, eu odeio te
He&#39;s definitely wrong bruh
HOW SWAY?!?!?!?!
Fuuuck you dude. Fuck this review
The comment section is so childish. Le the man have an opinion.
Bro you don&#39;t know rap 😂😂😂
are you smoking crack?
Sheesh, you’re reaching here buddy
I don’t like you anymore.
Almost read every comment trying to cleanse myself from the hate of this review
wut is this even. I turned on youtube and started cleaning and was like &quot;This fuckin guy is just dishin out on mac?&quot; lmao no thanks this album changed my life.
Sorry but you didnt nail it on this one.
I think melon just lost his yellow flannel and doesn’t wanna admit it 😂😂
Please re review this.
Yeah man I usually agree with you but this album was really good in my opinion<br><br>3/10 is appalling it’s ur opinion but shit a “wet blanket” this album was anything but boring, and you can tell you didn’t listen to the album enough, sucks when you get such a in depth review of someone you like aka Kendrick compared to someone who’s music you’ve never enjoyed seemed like you listened to the album a couple times said this sounds sing songy and sat in front of the camera
I bet you listen to car alarms for fun
We need to re-review this @theneedledrop
No one realizes he rates on an enjoyability scale lmfaoo
fuck you
Fuck you
Ooooo nonono ma melon man, you gotta start looking at certain albums for what they are, my dude. Mac’s depression and condition at the time just flew completely over your head before you reviewed this album, I think looking into an artists current setting is an interesting step towards making more empathetic and fair reviews. Try again bruh
I just went back and listened to the beginning of 2009, when at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgwPxFUUg94&amp;t=140">2:20</a> Anthony said it felt as if he was in a torcher chamber, and how he was &quot;squeaking&quot;... I&#39;m sorry melon but ur opinion is indeed... Wrong
Delete this. You goofy fuck
Music was his escape. This album is great, your dad.
3/10?!? the fuck is wrong with your head?
Slap yourself recording this review and uploading it.
i srsly dont get how people like swimming
I mean he didnt even review it was like he was just trashing it def his worst review
Glad to see the people in the comment section universally agree that this man is wrong on this one. Swimming is a masterpiece
fuck you
I just wish more people liked this album. Keep rockin Melon Boi
I have to say , I never agreed with you on anything and I think that most people don&#39;t so really you have a terrible ear and your reviews are pointless
Somebody cancel this idiot
you didn’t even mention the lyrics which were the strongest and most important part of swimming what’s wrong with you ant?
this review makes me question why i watch these reviews
man, this was so clearly a review done at a real busy period for Fantano, putting out 5-minute long videos and listening to an album a couple times before sitting down to write the review. this feels like a first impression of a real grower of an album. compare this to the DAMN review and it becomes clear when Anthony&#39;s put a lot of thought into his criticisms and when he hasn&#39;t. big L
This just showed up in my feed on the 1 year anniversary of swimming<br><br><br>Mac is this a sign
dude really listened to this in spanish
worse review yet lmfao. we must of heard different albums
why hasn&#39;t Mac Miller made a new song yet??
I think you seriously need to get your ears syringed 💉 and YOU need a reality check 😠
What you consider “to blasé for words” has gone platinum.
Fuck You I Genuinely Hate You. Review That:)
Yeah this ain’t it, album is great
Jesus Christ this review is awful. You are so fucking pretentious.
...
You killed the man!
Please re review this album<br>With the context of Malcolm’s degrading mental state and eventual death in mind ❤️
Everyone in the comments only listened and enjoyed the album after he died. They didnt give a fuck b4
I get that you didn’t like the album but you didn’t have to kill the guy
It&#39;s been 1 year since the release of this album &amp; you are still wrong.
RIP Mac Miller :(. I will listen to this album, Swimming. We&#39;ll see what I think. but people REALLY shouldn&#39;t harass Anthony for not liking this album that much! 3/10, red flanny. He didn&#39;t know Mac would die soon. He doesn&#39;t have to like this album. I may disagree or I may agree with his review. we&#39;ll see.
i agree
sorry man but you’re straight up wrong about this one. This album is amazing, and absolutely should’ve won best rap album at the 2019 Grammys over cardi b’s trash album the title of which I can’t remember bc she makes shit music. once again politics get in the way of good music winning awards. Fuck the Grammys and double fuck cardi b
Couldn’t disagree with you more. I was a fan of you but this is a horrible review and you should listen to it many times again....
bruh that like ratio.
Get fucked, this album is a classic
WRONG.
Anthony doesn’t dabble in the realm of drugs/substances; he doesn’t identify w/ the aura of everything.
Hey guys, Smokingthony Cracktano here with another garbage review
Your probably the worst critic of all time
Bruh what?
I don’t agree with your statement on how “it’s not a good album because white people arent good rappers”, however, I respect your opinion.
I also think the things you go through in life will sway your opinion on music and sometimes it becomes more than just music to you.. my point is that Anthony did not go through anything to relate to the album so it’s trash to him
I only watched to see what he gave it but a 3 man damn it def deserves more than that
Lol this comment section is fucked. This albums not that good stop letting his death blind you
You’re an ididot
The only other time I’ve disagreed with you this much is with the Dance Gavin Dance review smh
Love you melon, I rly do... but ya done fucked up here. Nothing lifeless about this album. You rly unnecessarily come at Macs singing. I can’t rly see what u hate so much about this album... like at all. It’s an absolute vibe, and I just don’t think you caught that vibe.
fantano killed mac
Uhh maybe uhh maybe uhh just maybe... you got bad music taste?¿?
Damn look at the like to dislike ratio. RIP Mac (and Fantano&#39;s credibility)
Beyond deluded
He gave it a 3. BRUH
Stop making reviews, because your taste is trash. I cant believe you have 1.8 million subs.
This comment section is cancer lol.
I&#39;d like to say nothing that the other comments haven&#39;t said before, but just reinforce the fact that your opinion is wrong.
I think you are wrong the album manages to deliver a good message whilst not sticking to just his ordinary sounds
fantano just ain’t great at reviewing albums from sad people
I feel like this album fits a vibe that you can&#39;t get from a whole lot of albums. 8/10.
Tbh you guys wouldn&#39;t say shit if he wasnt dead.
His voice isn’t very good so I can understand his singing critique, but the instrumentals are great
I had never been a fan of Mac Miller, except for &quot;Donald Trump&quot; when I was drunk and partying in high school and college. To be fair, I didn&#39;t know a ton of his music, but what I did hear, I didn&#39;t really care for. This album changed that for me. He&#39;s incredibly talented, and I think his experimentation had a positive effect. His maturation is also evident throughout his career. Again, I had never been a fan, but I&#39;m very sad to know that he&#39;s now gone and I could have potentially become more of a fan through time. He was definitely headed in the right direction with his music. Also, Cardi B did not deserve album of the year over Mac.
i thought it was a pretty good review, but when you gave him a 3 because he was dead that&#39;s was kind of weird
IGNORANCE THE ONLY BLISS
Tbh needle i disagree with your whole point of view about mac except but I can see where you are coming from but this album is easily top 5 albums of the year no cap
But it was better than 90% of everything that came out other than taboo and DiCaprio??????????
4/10 to this day ‘ <br>agree
People really subscribe to this clown ass nigga?
no. this review is NOT GOOD
Not suprised.. he shit on Faces as well which is the GOAT.
It’s cuz he died
You didn&#39;t understand the depth the album had
Sometimes I like to come back to this review just to see how wrong Anthony can be
Worst review ever?<br>This or MBDTF
21k dislikes i-
I get that you are allowed to think whatever you want but........ Screw your opinion this album is the greatest thing
This is a bad review
he was saying goodbye.
I personally would like to punch you in the face ❤️
How can someone be so wrong about something
I do not respect this guy&#39;s opinion. soooo wrong.
Look at that ratio
I disagree with you
Great video Anthony, you have very good points<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Unsubscribed
Sorry bro you’re wrong
tfw melon contributes to killing Mac Miller
Thanks theneedledrop I hated everything you said
My respect has just faded away in 1 minute of this video.
bro the production is so fucking good on that album. Compare it to his contemporaries that year just plane trap beats.  I just don&#39;t understand how melon couldn&#39;t enjoy the substance and thoughtfulness of the album as well as production bars order    fuck tnd bruh stoned
4 for 4 on the kill:bad review ratio
This dude shat on XXXTentacion&#39;s 17 as well, which, in my opinion is very similar to Mac&#39;s. I guess he just is a psychopath who cannot feel emotions, depression, can&#39;t explain it any other way. Because both these albums are really dope in my opinion.
You suck
This is a horrible review...sheesh
Lol at the like/ dislike ratio
Man fuck you. Your opinion is wrong this time
This review was shit my dude
Fuck ur shit channel
This shit was worse than the MBDTF review
Not even because he’s dead, this was a garbage review
the like/dislike ratio on this video speaks for itself
Honestly, this review is straight facts, and listening to the album around 15 to 20 times, I find it funny that people can look past the fact that his singing sucks. Some of the excuses in this comment section are funny as shit though
“Emotionally vacant” this review was conceptually vacant.If you truly believe it was emotionally vacant,you misinterpreted the whole album.Having a trap beat over whack ass lyrics is emotion now compared to putting true feelings and reason into something..biased internet stereotype is my review of your entire channel.But,just my opinion.
Im going to be honest. Everyone&#39;s opinions change after a rapper dies. I can personally say I know so much people who didn&#39;t like the album when I would play songs but now that he&#39;s dead it seems like everyone is just now, starting to enjoy his music which I don&#39;t think is right. At least Anthony is able to be honest... Am I right? Everyone had different opinions!!! Mac miller changed for the better in my opinion though. 10/10 has and will always be my favorite album
Fuck you
WHAT
Forget MBDTF. THIS is his most unfair review ever.
Anthony is literally worse than ISIS
Emotionally Vacant?? Fantano, he&#39;s talking about addiction. Just bc u dont understand, doesnt mean its lifeless
HIS LYRICISM IS GREAT AND HIS PRODUCTION HAS MOVED THE INDUSTRY
Was just making sure I had disliked it
This review is trash bro. How can you not feel the emotion behind it?
Mac Millers swimming is an evolution.  If you&#39;ve walked along his growth of an artist and fall from humanity.  Feeling the music
Lol damn I bet if I listened to stuff you enjoy I&#39;d throw up
You’re wrong I hate you, fuck you
Melon....I love your opinions.  You have introduced me to great new artists.  But, on this one you are totally wrong. MAC  FOREVER  !!
Blandthony I made sure to unsubscribe to your channel as your opinion has proven to be useless with this review. Bye.
Yeesh, shouldn&#39;t have picked this vid as my first review by this guy 🤣
oh and i unsubbed..
Please shut down your youtube account and stop giving shitty opinions... your ears are obviously broken...
I actually agreed
I like the fact that you got more dislikes than likes overall and it’ll never change for a fact. Fuck your opinion, truly you suck at reviewing music albums take the L again. Regardless if this came out before his passing. Do your fucking homework on every artist you review their work on in order to fully understand the progression and actual meanings behind  every projects they drop. You don’t do that....keep a hat on because your bold head is too blindly.
Like everyone says, your opinion is to be respected but I do believe this album deserves either a new review that incorporates the emotion Mac Miller was trying to express or a head on bash and commentary on how it sounds to someone who listens to music for simply that: the music. The thing about this review channel is that it pays attention to the instrumentation and innovation of the music presented in the artists’ work. But when it comes down to my own personal admiration and love for this album, it needs a look into the album’s lyricism and goal, which to me is to express the flood of emotions Mac was swimming through before it finally became too overwhelming. Opinions are opinions and while I generally agree with Anthony, I find it hard to understand this one.
Album is dope. Youre a donkey
fuck this bald prick
DAMN that&#39;s a lot of dislikes.
Whaaaaat swimming was amazing!!!!!!!
Taking the biggest L for this one
Let’s hear your album kid
Sorry, but I think im gonna just unsub, he is an artist, your an asshole with a worthless opinion
Wait did he just say the beats are lifeless and spacey and bland but generally the beats are pleasant and show-stopping pretty but are like wall paper wtf lol
I&#39;ve always been a fan of Mac. Great rapper with some great songs, but I&#39;ve never enjoyed any of his projects until Swimming. Easily his best work, and one of the best hip hop albums of 2018.
This review gained my respect
Fantano afraid to admit his wrongs.
Fuck U Melon.. This Album Is Beautiful !
.... but this allbum is masterpiece.
This album is so good, but i respect your opinion
look what you did.
Forget MBDTF this is the worst fantano review. Easy 8 at least.
Aw man I don&#39;t know if I can respect your opinion anymore. I really think you got it wrong here
Dude really doesn’t know Mac Miller or what that album meant. That’s crazy. Just delete this.
Y’all talk about mbdtf getting a 6/10 but how tf did swimming get a 3/10
WHERE WERE YOU WHEN YOU REALIZED fANTANO WAS A COMP[LETE CLOWN? I WAS RIGHT HERE!
this is crazy cuz swimming is my favorite album, like it was pure art
You just don&#39;t understand,  Mac is one of the greatest to ever do it.
wtf
What. The fuck
This was a Incredible &amp; Beautiful Album. I no longer value your opinion on music.
Wow this review is trash and makes you sound completely incompetent. Check your ears dude, this album is beautiful
Brutal.  My review of your review: try again, please?
Ladders is such a great song
feet
Whoa... this one went totally over your head dude. Sorry you didn&#39;t understand it.
FUCK YOU
You’re not just wrong, you’re stupid
This is your worst review by far
Jesus Christ look at those dislikes. Imagine disliking a video just because someone had a different opinion to you
Yeah fuck you for this Anthony
Here after the Mac Demarco review.
so it goes is a beautiful song
Could not be more wrong. Wow.
ok after his death this album is so amazing, and even more meaningful
<b>nobody liked that</b>
I understand it’s his opinion but the album is at least a 6/10 for me.
A lot of followers doesn’t mean you can say everything!!!! Your opinion is just wrong!!!!!! Don’t compare him to lil xan!!!!!!!! You should overthink your way of rating something and don’t call your opinion a review!!!
i dont know how to feel about this
Ah yes.. the one review where not one of your points made even a little sense.. and I’m glad I’m not the only one who thinks that. This record is an easy 8/10 and is aging really well.
First video I&#39;ve ever watched from this guy, now it&#39;s my last...
Melon goes rarted Mode
I expect this review from someone who&#39;s a virgin.
Mac Miller... forever 😔
It seems fantano just hates good albums like serously
still cant believe u gave this a 3 u absolute fucking moron
Smh 3/10 come on
People suddenly started to forget what opinions are with this video, lol.
I&#39;ve been watching a lot of your reviews and usually like them, but I have no idea what you were thinking on this one. Swimming is a fucking fantastic album. You need to revisit it with fresh ears, and a deeper understanding of the man himself, and his artistic message. The music and beats are innovative, and are the tip of the spear in the evolution of modern hip hop, which apparently you haven&#39;t caught onto yet.
How the fuck does he give faces a 6, GO:OD AM a 7 and swimming a 3 when all are at LEAST an 8.
this album review... it&#39;s NOT GOOD smh
honestly delete this holy shit
Just wishing this guy would put out a project for he himself would just say it’s trash.
what the fuck? dude you&#39;re usually right but you&#39;re telling people that Mac can&#39;t sing? I don&#39;t think his intention was to SING, he was simply expressing what was in his head and he&#39;s speaking... he&#39;s not singing.
This man clearly goes off from what he likes to listen too, Mac is clearly a lyricist, talk about that will ya
Ive never disagreed more
Delete this embarrassing video
A 3? Okay your opinion is no longer relevant
Mostly everyone disagreed with you on this one. This album is gold
Are you sure you reviewed the right album?
Wow you&#39;re a robot if you didn&#39;t enjoy this.  Quit trying to be a rotten tomatoes critic. This album was full of soul. Ya fuckin robot. U didnt understand it and this was the fist full mac album I listened too
The album means so much more now that he&#39;s dead. He knew that all the peices would come together  once he was gone.
I’d rate it an 8.
???Melon???
SWIMMING - decent 3<br>TRENCH - strong 8<br>???<br>I think you&#39;re the one trapped in a moody emotional rut. <br>Go listen to kids bop, fam. It&#39;s perfect for your palette.
Worst Review Ever.
i like you and your channels. but, you make some odd choices some times. swimming gets a 3. j cole records are lucky to crack 5. but post malone gets a 7? wtf, anthony.
Thinking about this review 8 months later still triggered. Waiting for this one to show up on &quot;10 times I changed my opinion on an album pt. 3&quot; Melon WHY ARE YOU LIKE THIS
You put hip hop in a box and can’t see outside of the new wave trash music that’s popular these days.
I’m sorry. Underwhelming instrumentals? 😂😂😂😂
Big dumb
I respect what you have to say. But did you actually listen to what&#39;s the use or self care.
love you fantano but you&#39;re wrong, plain and simple.
BOOOO
<b>We need another person to review music not this guy</b> 🤮
YOU&#39;RE A TERRIBLE HUMAN BEING!
bro, no
This was Mac’s magnum opus.
People like Mac because they like seeing a white guy do O.K with other artists musical leftovers. Any bit of music worth listening to on this album was straight up style ripped from other musicians but done worse
This. Is. Just. Wrong.
You consistently have the worst album reviews on YouTube
You’re bad at having opinions
I certainly like the tiny desk concert version of 2009 more than the studio version.
You are incredibly pretentious.
Boi
Fuck you
I genuinely feel like we listened to different albums, cuz the Swimming I heard was passionate, dissonant, soulfully depressed and at moments cheerful. Like you just casually brushed over how incredible Ladders is, not even mentioning the horns or the great bass riff or the lyrical journey that Mac takes us on. Lyrically it’s one of his best records yet. I’m shocked. Different strokes different folks I guess.
This has to be one of his most disliked videos lol
This shit makes me sad I love your vids but did you not listen to his lyrics? Even shawn cee listened the man made the beats and produced with no features he didnt deserve this I loved it even when before he died I actually cried hearing about his death
this is why i lost my faith i you man. i don&#39;t know how you can hate this man.
Fuck this guy
Came back to make sure i disliked
Yeah fantano you&#39;re stupid af...you come off as biased towards you&#39;re opinion on Mac. I feel like a bully or an ex gf from your past use to love mac so no matter what you&#39;re always going to see him in a negative light. Go fuck yourself.
You’re such a shit reviewer lol this is the same guy who gave Faces a 6, you’re horrible 😂😂😂😂
Your fucking tripping Anthony
Why?
Fat L for Anthony. The singing wasn&#39;t great at some points. But with a vocal coach this album would of been even better. Other then that. The lyrics are deep, diverse, inspiring, and so much more. 2009 is an amazing track btw. You are dumb af for that one and are criticizing it way to much. For Mac to come out with an Album like this with so many fresh emotions and demons he was still dealing with. This album is fire. You are wrong about so many things. I would agree with some of the singing not being that good. But only in Self Care when he says &quot;we gonna beeeee good&quot; or does any other ones like that. The 2nd half of self care is so good though. I&#39;m sorry it isn&#39;t extremely autotuned like everything else you listen to most likely but its raw and genuine emotion throughout his lyrics and the way he expresses it. I enjoy it. And either way there is a lot of songs on here that don&#39;t have singing. If some then it isn&#39;t as bad as u are trying to make it out to be.
This album is amazing wtf best album of our generation you on trash fuck em all
you didn&#39;t have to kIll hIm pahantano
YOU BALD MELON FUCK
I respect your opinion but for a critic you really need to know your shit man
MELON, WHY?
This person third eye welded shut SMH..
came back to tell you youre a weeaboo fuck you❤️
Why Mac Miller fans so fucking lame. They don’t want to hear criticism because they ‘other worldly god’ is actually just mediocre and bland. Just because he’s dead doesn’t mean I can’t say his music was just garbage and nothing special. His legacy will be that he died and these fans will also beat the dead horse and tell anyone who criticises to kill themselves.
This review is some bullshit, best rap album that has come out in a very very long time. No effort put into this review at all, you can tell because you only cut it into 5 minutes and didn’t even bother to investigate in depth as to the meaning of the lyricism and the mood of the album. Of course on the surface you can say all those things about the album in terms of mood and music and his “flawed” vocals that are actually quite beautiful honest and real, which completely ties into why the mood and theme of the album. It really makes me think this is a completely ignorant and spiteful review of a insanely beautiful piece of work considering you have put no effort into showing any good side to this at all. However your entitled to your opinion of course, I just don’t think you opened your mind enough to the album to make a fair critisism based on the things you are saying here. Because they do not check out
this is is a permanent stain on fantanos record.... this album is a masterpiece
whenever melon reviews someone really negative they end up dying
I won’t see the video, only disliked.
SHAME ON YOU
One month later from this he took his life
I didn’t like this project at first, this shit grew on me. great project
anthony, youre such a douche. its unbelievable
Bad melon rude melon
I see red flannel and I don’t like it
Golly gee that&#39;s a like to dislike ratio we have here.
Im gonna say this. Before he died I loved this album.... I dont understand why he hates it so much...
Honestly I listened to just ab all of him albums (yes after he passed away, that’s how I heard of him lol) and honestly this was my favorite. The instrumentals are great, his lyrics are good and I like his cadence.
Wonder how many dislikes this video had before he died...... 🤷🏼‍♂️🙈
Proof that nobody cared about Mac until he died, smh 🤦‍♂️
a 3? did u listen to it?
Im triggered.
Stfu you bald little bitch.stop reviewing artist with your shity vids cause you&#39;re reviews are so bad it kills people
Why is this everyone&#39;s least favorite review, it doesn&#39;t suck, a reviewers opinion should be respected, whether you agree or disagree. And I enjoy this album, some of you are stupid.
Ok but you wrong tho
He just rated Lil Pump&#39;s Harvard Dropout higher than this. How.
trash
I don&#39;t agree, I liked the album and the singing is between him talking and singing to me. I also like his style and I can relate to the album. Taste of music is subjective though.
i actually don&#39;t disagree with many of your points here but the score was too low <br>it should have been at least a 5/10
wow after hearing his review of macs swimming album i’ve come to the realization this guy has NO CLUE. thanks for exposing yourself to me as a. moron with an intellectual way of talking. dude you’re so off on this review. this album is so good and it’s a instant classic.<br><br><br>or maybe you have to go through hard breakups, addiction, and depression in order to understand mac. Mac is the only reason i’m still alive today.<br>his music got me through some dark days.
😂😂😂 a fucking 3, you done fucked up boi
Fuck you melon this hurt more than mbdtf. You&#39;re hating on a dead guy
Melon criticizes Mac’s singing but turns around and praises Cudi on KSG. Fuck outta here. I love you Antnee and think you’re a good at what you do but I really just don’t agree with this review.
Your opinion is fucking wrong
your music perception is just bad...
the nomination for the grammys proves that u suck at this review
Hot take: Swimming is more listenable than DAMN. Yah Yah, Yah Yah, Yah Yah!
Yo! Was going to let you know that this was the worst thing i&#39;ve ever watched on the internet. I then soon realized that even describing it as that doesn&#39;t do it justice as to how bad it actually is. This is literally the worst form of media I have ever consumed, so for that... congrats Anthony.
Man, I hardly ever comment on anything, but this review is so off. Also, I normally love your reviews and think they’re accurate to a degree, but this shit off. Best album of 2018 and IDGAF what anyone else says.
This man clearly is VERY close minded and ignorant af. Like bruh! Swimming album is so damn good! It&#39;s very cohesive and has very deep and dark vibes to it and I love that.
Let&#39;s make this the most disliked video of 2019
Fantano I respect your opinion BUT<br><br>You missed the point of this album completely. <br><br>Swimming is an album that digs deeply into Macs mind and self healing it’s a journey through his thoughts and feeling. It’s an honest portrayal of his emotional state. <br><br>This album wasn’t supposed to be melodic, up beat and in your face. <br><br>This album was supposed to be a real perception of his low points. <br><br>This album is creative, sensual, real and personal. <br><br>This album was great and it was Grammy worthy and I’m disappointed you missed all the highlights of this beautifully put together album.
I have never seen a review i have disagreed with more.
You don&#39;t know what your talking about...
he&#39;s gonna abduct you for this review
You know it&#39;s gonna be a bad rating if he wears the red flannel
...
Horrible review, absolutely dreadful. Come on Melon bro, this is your worst rap review since My Dark Twisted Fantasy.
It got nominated for a Grammy your a joke
Okay I will not lie before Macs death I liked the album in the manner of me being a fan and wanting Mac to continue making music. However after his death, his pain on this record became extremely apparent. Macs emotions really were in the foreground of this album.
Baldy
Delete this
Wow. Iv never dissagreed eith you before. Guese there is a 1st forever
What an airhead
123
Grammy nominated album asshole
Love you Fantano, but this album is amazing and this is your worst review in my opinion
I really enjoyed this album. I still do. And I was surprised to see what you rated it. But everybody has a different idea of what music should sound like. I find my views often differ from yours but I enjoy being able to have different opinions on different things.
I like the album. I have to disagree here. Mac Miller was an incredible musician and you see plenty of that also on this album!
What do you know about music you fat fuck, its a modern classic.
Wow 😯 You give a 3 rating? Ladders is a fun and funky track! 💀
got a miller lite ad on this video
This review gave me jaundice.
haHA he dead now
You should stop reviewing bro
Bruhhh.
This is his best work bruh you trippin! <br><br>you are literally trippin!<br><br>this is a review of the define feminine album, let it go!
When your opinion is just wrong.
At this point, Anthony doesn’t deserve the first amendment.
You should stop reviewing music brah, you don&#39;t know what you are talking about HAHAHA!!!!
You know, he killed himself due to drug addiction soon after making this album, but suicide is something emotionally vacant artists do so this album is trash.
Have this it’s 18,000th dislike
To be honest this review is trash but still of quality.
This man just hates Mac I have never heard him say one thing good about him
you lost all credibility after this review🤷‍♀️
Fantano is tripping when he spoke about 2009. RIP to my favorite artist growing up and will be forever
People didn&#39;t even pay him dust when he was alive and now they&#39;re complaining for this review saying that the album is great... Get over it, this album is probably his worse. Dying doesn&#39;t make it better.
This was my favorite album of 2018
One of the worst reviews you’ve ever done.
I give it at least 5/10<br>Just cause they are dead doesn’t mean they deserve a high score <br>same thing for other artists that passed away
It&#39;s crazy how much someones experience can differ from your own. You are saying words, I know what each word means, but it just doesn&#39;t seem like your talking about the music that I hear. Lifeless beats, moany singing, boring.. I cannot see how anyone could feel that when hearing these songs. I think his best songs ever are on this album. I wasn&#39;t a fan of his earlier music and I know it differs from this &quot;dark rut&quot; you say he is in. But some of the best art comes from dark places. Though a  lot of the content is dark the music/ vocal delivery has a lot of soul. A far cry from his monotone delivery through the Faces mixtape. I see a lot of artistic progression here from him. It is sad we won&#39;t see him grow further. To me this album was his first masterpiece. But hey, opinions...
take this bullshit review down because you sound like a fucking idiot
STOP KILLING THESE ARTISTS
Delete This.
You needa listen to this again dude it&#39;s easily my album of the year
R.I.P. Mac Miller, just keep 🏊‍♂️🏊‍♂️
I actually liked this album and it was my first time hearing a Mac Miller album. But I still love your reviews.
I still cannot believe you rated this so low but hey. I can majorly enjoy a record on repeat daily while you dislike it and that&#39;s alright :) Jk heck u melon wtf were u thinking
I think you lost all credibility you had with this review. This was one , if not the  best album of the year.  Nothing to do with his death. But you give lil pump a 7, lil yachty a seven, and this 3?? Are you out of your mind? I understand you are a nihilist, and a complete insensitive guy, that dislikes anything that isnt superficial like travis scott album, or fucked up like death grips, but come on man. The last Earl sweatshirt album was terrible, the guy was rapping while throwing up and popping xanax, and you gave a mind blowing review out of that. Mac last album , is full of funk, deep lyrics, unusual instrumentals, clearly a lot of effort doing something different and evolving musically. Violins, thundercats bass, jazzy flows, different approach to themes like depression , suicide, addiction, love etc. Always evolving. But a guy like lil pump who just says the same word 10 times on a shitty trap beat gets a seven lol. He actually writes his lyrics, not like Drake for example. Drop of them drugs Fantano, for real.
Imagine thinking Playboi Carti and Lil Pump is better than this
Mac melon
Not only is this a horrible review but the way he says Mac Miller forever at the end is so fucking creepy given xxx, linkin park, peep circumstances. <br><br>Swimming is a classic tho
you’ve gone too far this time
Jesus, what the fuck is wrong with you
Generic comment about how Anthony is so wrong on this review (even though he isn’t on this one), and that the album is actually good because Mac Miller died a month after this review came out
Couldn’t disagree more with this review, wasn’t even a real hardcore Mac Miller fan.
People only trully &quot;loved&quot; this after he died just like with Linkin Park. Nobody cares till they die or they&#39;re such try hard fans who can&#39;t take any criticism of their favorite artist.
i love every mac album even Divine Feminine except this one, just sounds so bad to me.. r.i.p mac, i&#39;ll always remember you
WOW HE SHITTED SO HARD ON THIS GUYS ALBUM!! It was one best of year
No.
every song is amazing listen.
I honestly have no fucking idea how you could not like Swimming. But everyone has their own opinions and preferences and I can respect that.
I hate you, you&#39;re the greatest and I love you, FUCK YOU ANTHONY.  I have mixed feelings with you, I truly do.  It&#39;s because of shit like this.  We all make mistakes though.
Worst review of 2018
This chubby fucks DOES NOT KNOW hip hop 😤😤 album is very dope
Love you dude but I don’t think you got the message of the album
You’re a fucking idiot
That &quot;mac miller forever&quot; at the end really got me.
It’s crazy how people can’t take other peoples opinions
Anthony, you need to re-review this album, seriously I feel like you missed alot on this one
&quot;Two or three shades less comatose than lil xan.&quot; I&#39;ve never watched any videos of yours bro, so I just have two words for you... FUCK. YOU. Did you even listen to this album? I really don&#39;t think you did.
I definitely disagree. It manages to be unique, and lyrical while maintaining pop sensibilities. Strong 7 for me. With the cultural impact it&#39;s had so far it might be a future classic.
Never have I disagreed with your musical opinion more.
This is definitely a biased review
Just delete your page, your the worst your the worst. Dont roast anything else. Please dont cry.
Your not reviewing anything. You are roasting for views.
Still waiting for u to slam the new  21 Savage album.
What Mac Miller should I be listening to? GOOD AM? <br>Cause ya, I don’t really like this record.
bro you dont know what you are talking about
Bro your tripping
I cant really relate to any of ur oppinions but ok
ur wrong bro ur so incredibly wrong
Lol this video on that youtube rewind dislike level
This was garbage. You are garbage. Fuck off.
you called a melody cute youre argument is no longer valid
you should stop posting after this coz you don&#39;t know what music is
fuk u
this aint it chief
It was good b
Why do I get the feeling your the only person out there who is dissatisfied with “Swimming”?
me reviewing your review: NOT GOOD
OH NAW<br>Edit: it&#39;s a 9 melon admit it
The thumbnail is 10x more funny now that he&#39;s dead.
This needs a redux asap
damn, can&#39;t always be right I guess
Hey guys read the bottom of the description
Mac milar
U trash
Best produced album of the year.  You’re wrong
You are trash
You&#39;re wrong, and fuck you
damn those dislikes though
This is absolutely not it chief
ladders goes hard
You get the award for most naive musical commentary.
Another huge stain on your dwindling career
this is straight up cruel man
Decent 4 for me
This album is fucking amazing.
Wtf
anthony, you sound like a jealous hater. and i love you. but god, the amount of hateful bias you displayed on this video is really unbecoming of you.
What the fuck were you listening to
This is one of the worst album reviews I’ve ever seen, and I’m a huge fan of the melon man. Absolute garbage
Great review Melon, but I think you went a little too far when you compared Native Americans to the common termite.
Most garbage review
Couldn&#39;t disagree more, this jam rocks and you suck
My momma told me to respect every opinion. That&#39;s the only thing b/w you and me rn. <br>Swimming is easily &gt;7 IMO.
Fuk u
My God... you hate lil peep, x, and mac miller... you have a terrible taste in music. Open your fucking heart. Everything is not supposed to be rigorously “perfect”. If people listened to you, then music would become robotic. Just fuck off sometimes.
You may be the worst music reviewer on YouTube my man
Melon: “swimming is a bad album, hands down”<br>Mac Miller: <b>fucking dies</b>
Your opinion doesn’t matter if it’s wrong
This review kept me from listening to this album for so long and I hate you for it
Ur insane melon
I just think Anthony straight up didn’t like Mac.
i fucking hate you
&quot;silly&quot; small worlds. Excuse me. This was a piece of art.
i remember mac miller. hes that white kid that was stealing 50 cent lines on a mixtape. lol fuck him.
GRAMMY NOMINATED ALBUM AND YOU GAVE IT A 3... HOW THE HELL ARE YOU THE BIGGEST MUSIC NERD? FUCKING CLOWN ASS DUDE
You&#39;re fucking wrong. I respect every other opinion of yours even ones I&#39;ve disagreed with but this is an absolute mockery of a beautiful album. I don&#39;t understand this at all. Seriously what the fuck Melon, what the actual fuck.
Did you really have to kill him though?
Gotta delete your channel after this review chief
I’m sorry I think ur an excellent reviewer but this is completely wrong. This may not be his best album but it’s absolutely incredible especially when u take into account the events going on in macs life during the creation of this album. He went through a lot of pain and was moving on. So he expressed it beautifully on this album and for u to say it’s a cheap attempt at trying to push to the r and b pop crowd is completely ignorant.
Fuck this guy
I am by no means a Mac fan, but the album blew even me away. Check yourself Fantano
dislikes are more than double the likes... yea you suck dude lol
Tran-Sition! Did you give this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it? you’re the best you’re the best who should I kill next right next to my head I have the death of lil peep go check it out Mac Miller, red flannel Forever!
came back just to make sure I disliked
Melon gave this a smaller score than the new 6ix9ine, wow
Coming from a Mac fan, after not being a huge fan of The Divine Feminine, I don&#39;t blame Anthony at all for this review.
Lost a lil respect from me on this one
I made an account just to leave this comment. The most disrespectful review I have ever watched. You sir, do not deserve an opinion.
i refollowed you....came and seen this....now im ready to block you....i really don&#39;t know why you&#39;re as big a source of music criticism as you are...when you&#39;re so clearly biased to a certain sound....
Everyone commenting about this getting a Grammy. <br><br>Y’all realize they have a pity nomination for a dead man, ya?
Gave a grammy nominated album a 3 Lol ...Good job melon
You wylin this album is a great moody album
Your fucking stupid
No fucking way you compared the mother fucking goat Mac Miller to fucking lil xan. This is my first video and you highkey wrong. Your act
Yea...no. I disagree. Just sounds like an attack on creativity/creative freedom. It sucks to be an artist just to have someone shit on your outlet to make sense of life in general....
Great review melon. It&#39;s your opinion man.
Lmao gave a Grammy nomination a bad review.. bum
melon is just lemon spelled inside out
Let&#39;s make this the most disliked video in his channel
Fucking hater fr
You have lost credit in my eyes wow
IF YOU WANT AN ACTUALLY GOOD REVIEW ON SWIMMING: there’s a video called “the importance of swimming” and it’s incredibly well thought out and analysis each song. melon here is a bald headed fuck who doesn’t know what he’s talking about
LMFAOOOOOO ANTONY HAS NO TASTE. you killed him lemon
He won a Grammy ...hmmm . Just let that sink in as you realize your reviews are wack
For someone whose reviews are normally insightful and objective, this one seemed to have a lot of personal angst attached to it. And now this album has been Grammy Nominated for Best Rap Album....Hold this LLLLL Blandtano.
Wish they took you instead of mac. You just an uninspiring bald fuck who knows nothin about hip hop stick to reviewing alternative albums you ugly fuck.
What a terrible review,  completely missed the message Mac was trying to portray in this album
You aren’t a music nerd. It’s hard for someone to review music when clearly they’ve never lived a real life you can relate so you won’t understand you can’t listen the way we do. I genuinely feel sorry for you. Once again please stop speaking as if you’re OPINION is FACT it’s not it’s YOUR personal OPINION....
I feel like everyone disagrees cause he died lol
You’re a fucking idiot
Come on man, What&#39;s the Use is a jam dog.
REST IN PEACE MAC MILLER
Oops, that’s gonna be funny when Anthony has to recant this bullshit review when swimming wins album of the year next week..
Yeah, i can’t watch you anymore after this one man.
this album review was almost as bad as your hair line
obviously its all an opinion... but I couldn&#39;t disagree more... I love it because mac was coming to finally starting to understand himself
You&#39;re a loser bro
Delete your channel bro. You don&#39;t know good music.
9.2/10
You are one sad fuck. You have no talent and all you do is give your opinion on something that you wouldn&#39;t be able to ever do in your lifetime
Nothany Smartano
You suck at reviewing you bitch ass bitch
This album is great no lie
You a bitch ass nigga
<b>MELON KILL SHOT</b>
Everyone mad that Mac died
Wow the disrespect is real
You&#39;re gonna change your mind later
Jesus. I don&#39;t think I have ever agreed with one of your reviews but I just keep coming back. I think I have a problem.
Your reviews are terrible. Two thumbs down your asshole.
your opinion but my opinion is you have  no ear for talent. its called being original.  it must suck to not feel passion
you literally don&#39;t know what good music is... this album is pure gold. SMH!
you are a shitty person it really hurts you listen to it once tops and it shows how disconnected u are and how u don&#39;t know real music just like how you listened to fbz and hated it u are disgusting and I love all humans but u rlly disgusted me
Damn I listened to this album for the first time last night, i never listened to mac properly before, its one of my favourite albums now, all of the songs are so beautiful imo
You’re a fucking dumbass.
Best work i&#39;ve heard from Mac so far RIP! Guess peoples taste buds are clearly very different!!!
I got to your YouTube channel. Did not want to open nothing bc you looked so lame. Then I open this Swimming review. I don&#39;t get how society gets this dumb boring bald guy 1 million dummies followers. Damn
This guy is one of those critics that thinks he&#39;s the best but really he&#39;s a moron
u suck
Easily on my top ten 2018.
Yea but those dislikes though.lollll. this album was great. Reviews are pretty bogus and shouldn&#39;t be watched. I just watch to see his ridiculous criticism. Listen to what you enjoy. Dont look for other peoples opinions. Peace be to mac.
That wasn’t the point of the album ur a idiot
Fucking melon stop killing everyone&#39;s favorite artists with negative reviews!
dead or not, this was mac&#39;s best album. Shit is fire. i dont know why he buggin&#39;
This dude doesn&#39;t have a soul !!
3??????????? ? I really like your opinion on music but I have to disagree big time and I&#39;m not even a big mac miller fan.  He&#39;s tracks and vibe  hit home.
I respect your opinion but this was easily one of the best albums I have ever heard in my life this is a 10
I use to feel that your uneducated music criticism of all genres was stimulating, refreshing and surprisingly good. But I can&#39;t watch your reviews anymore. Somewhere down the line you became less objective and more subjective and doing too much reviews. That&#39;s bad art criticism. You like what you like is acceptable but not professional regardless of making a lot of money doing this. You have your followers or stans and that&#39;s great, but you review stuff and give low ratings for stuff that you shouldn&#39;t review due to your preferences. Having multiple reviewers works better, like pitchfork because each criticism is left to a person who is submerged in their own field of music and more apt to break down an albums constructs. You just shouldn&#39;t try to review everything because it&#39;s apparent you have too many subjective opinions. You talk smart but reviews outside your interests and giving such low scores reveals how out of touch you are within certain brackets of music. This album is sonically better than most hip hop currently to be put in the 30% range of quality.
Sorry but this is the best album of 2018 and it’s not even a question. Rest in peace Mac.
This guy&#39;s ears are fucking broken
HE CANT KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH IT
Damn Every time an artist who Fantano reviewed their music before they died  their annoying fanbases come and leave dislikes and hate comments.
you fucking suck
This album is great u r trippin
Bro I just gave out my FIRST thumbs down ever on YouTube and that shit went to you! Congrats...the first negative bs that came out your mouth I scrolled right down to comments. I can’t finish this video.....this album was straight fire🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Lullaby raps with an emphasis on lull.
you have no ears
the disrespect
fuck you
wtf ure horrible
Melon, are u stupid
that dislike bar knows whats up!
Don&#39;t need some hipster telling me what music is good or not. Hard Pass on his reviews. First and Only time watching this channel.
So wrong. Great album. Glad we disagree cause the album makes me happy and your opinion makes me sad
If you say this is bad you have no fucking clue what music is at all.
Rip mac 10/10 for me. Fentanyl kills.......
Smh you should just delete this video.
the zodiac killer strikes again
fuck you bro this disrespectful
Fuck you
stop fucking killing people
Im a huge fan of fantano. Worse review yet. The album dope. Not even on no fan shit. Its great music.
R.I.P. Mac  <br><br><br><br><br> FUCK MELON
Couldn&#39;t disagree more with you, MELON. I wasn&#39;t a big Mac Miller fan until Swimming. Actually I still don&#39;t consider myself a huge Mac Miller fan, but I&#39;m a fan of this album.
Fuck you dude, Mac was one of the greatest to ever do it. No one else in the rap game that did it the way he did. He saved an enormous amount of people through his music. You fucked this one up. This is disrespectful man. Really is.
Still waiting on the REDUX REVIEW FANTANO
Did you just compare Mac to Lil Xan? This is a bad review. Sorry dude, but you are way off on this.
I disagree so heavily wow
You have to be in a specific mood to really enjoy this album
How can you not like this album?
You need to do another review on this dam it!!
This review is shit. Your reviews are shit. Tunnel vision, you don’t understand abstract music.
Your reviews ain’t it chief
Anthony must’ve had a bad day this day. Like holy fuck any listener who heard this album knows it’s worth. It’s one of his best. I’m so confused with every opinion Anthony gave. Fuck he slaughtered Mac
A 3 though?
I stopped watching your reviews after this one. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23discredited">#Discredited</a>
I normally respect Fantano&#39;s opinions but this one just doesnt fly. <br>With each album he released Mac matured, in sound, lyrics and production.<br>And Swimming was obviously a call for help. RIP Mac. 🤘
came back after tabby&#39;s video just to remind myself how uninformed were u tbh
His worst review. Ever. Easily.
Terrible review mustache man
the lyrics on this album are beautifully human i disagree
This guy is such a blowhard. I&#39;ve always thought his videos were monotonous and self important but with this review he&#39;s completely confirmed his uselessnes.
does anyone else feel it is odd that Anthony comments on current events usually yet has not mentioned Mac Miller&#39;s death at all?
This was a good album
i’m still waiting for Anthony to own up.
&quot;Mac Miller forever&quot;
Damn I was hoping you&#39;d like this album cuz it became one of my favorite albums as of the last decade in my humble opinion. That&#39;s also because I thoroughly enjoyed the beats on this album and the vibe of it never left me feeling like I didn&#39;t get enough. Hopefully you&#39;ll revisit this with a different opinion
You have no taste in music if you didn’t like this bum
You&#39;re crazy, for some music aficionado, you don&#39;t understand the album? You&#39;re points were way off, you didn&#39;t even remotely try to think what Mac could&#39;ve been thinking while writing these songs. You decided to make lazy, unfocused conclusions about those songs and they made you look profoundly dumb. You know you fucked up when everybody in the comments isn&#39;t even defending your opinion, instead they&#39;re laughing at you and not everybody in the comments is a Mac Miller fan.
I really like this album, I feel like Mac really found his own style on this album. I don&#39;t care about the weak vocals, I feel the raw emotions he puts into his music. Devine Feminist was indeed really boring and bland, but this is not like that at all. I rate a strong 7
Was wondering why this had so many dislikes...<br><br>Then I saw your score
You were def wrong bout this album
This man has zero taste
love your opinion but i love this album wish i found this when he was alive R.I.P Mac Miller
Fuck you
You are a garbage reviewer. 🖕🏼
I called the chief <br><br><br>she said <br><br><br><br>this ain&#39;t it
wrong
I respectfully disagree sir
Your just a dude. Mac was and is an artist. He had more artistic ability in his pinky finger then you have in your entire body. Throwing shade cause Mac made millions off &quot;trying to hold a tune with water in his mouth&quot;. Your a fucking loser
I think the likes and dislikes on this review say it all. Poor analysis
This dudes reviews are always a pile of horse shit. What a God damn hater. If he thinks everyone&#39;s music is so terrible, why doesnt he release his big hits and top the charts? What a worthless channel.
So mad I just took a listen to this album months after mac died. I have been listening to this album non stop and I think its genious, then i stumble upon low testosterone fantano bashing someones hard work and wonder if this added to macs drepression. Thankfully I look at the like/dislike bar and see that cuckthony fantano is yet again wrong. RIP Mac.
fucking ridiculous, LIFELESS???? BLAND????? jheez man the fuck kinda review is this..... generic face and monotone ass voice here criticizing works of art
You hate every Album I swear
Lmfao! go home melon!! u gave lil pump the unoriginal trap rapper a 7/10 but this masterpiece a fucking 3 like what?! and RIP mac miller he a legend.
You&#39;re coming up short as a reviewer...
fantano? talking completely out of his ass with half assed opinions and half baked takes that don’t really mean anything because he already made up his mind before listening to the project? no way.
Ppl don&#39;t ever understand what goes thru a drug addict&#39;s head
I think this was a personal album. I don&#39;t think it was intended for the mass appeal
This Album was the best album that dropped this summer. Stop hating this shit was heat and you can tell he is a top 5 rapper. Rip 🕯
Fuck you
Stop reviewing music. You’re terrible ...you have less talent then a homeless testicle. You are pretentious....do you know how to play any instruments at all??
You have your opinion and I have mine. <br>My opinion is that you have no taste
his blood is on your red flannel, Fantano.
this guy really needs to lose subs cause literally every album he says is trash is in my humble opinion pretty good I just think Anthony is trying to be cool in the sense that he&#39;s such a music snob he tells us Albums that are great aren&#39;t really good. I don&#39;t sub to him but ive had 3 falling outs with him and that&#39;s this Mac Miller album, the weeknds album starboy and the new arctic monkeys album all which I thought were great albums but for him to think ALL were bad come on man I feel like he&#39;s the kid in class that thinks everything is trash and thats what makes him &quot;cool&quot;
&quot;The beats on this thing are consistently lifeless&quot; and &quot;generally the beats on this thing are pretty pleasant&quot; seem pretty contradicting. You really made this review about Mac as a person, shame on you, shame on you
you sound stupid this album a classic
Far too harsh. Almost sounds as if he has a grudge against the late mac. Hardly a good word to say or any acknowledgement of the fact the album was mostly received well.
This guy talks like he invented music.I want to see you make music and see how pll react to it.
You sir are on <b>fucking</b> crack. This is hands down his best album and the growth he showed on this record is amazing. I get ur trying for the Simon Cowell thing but man other times I just think you&#39;re deaf.
You’re <i>way</i> too harsh on most albums. This album is dope.
Shut yo Potato head looking ass up lmao Macs album was fucking filthy. Passion in every single song was clear. Lyrics were relatable and complex in a lot of the songs. This album covers many issues and struggles we all go through. Good vibes and sad vibes, this album has both. I don&#39;t wanna judge cause I respect others opinions but come on dude this album was definitely better than what you tried to make it out to be. Sit down. Got a million followers and you feeling some type of a way. You may be a critic but you definitely aren&#39;t a good one giving this gem that bad of a review.
Everyones so used to travis scott beats and drakes bangers. I think you are misunderstanding this album. It&#39;s filled with real instruments, melodies (some of it without auto tune), and word play. This is by far one of the best albums of the year. Mac was always going for longevity of his music. This music will stick around longer than a lot of other rappers music. rest in peace Malcom
it was supposed to be rough. That&#39;s the beauty of it
The most I’ve ever disagreed with you
ive been so touched by the whole album lately, especially considering..
This is such a good album. I&#39;ve listened to it about 1,000x.
OD didn&#39;t killed Mac, this review did.
When God created the artist, he created critics with the scraps that were left.
Unsubscribe from this moron how many videos has it been now, the dislikes keep stacking. This dude doesn&#39;t know what hes doing anymore. Especially on Mac.
You’re a Lou Reedfan and you can’t see the brilliance in Mac? This album was ahead of its time. You’ll review it years later on how much of a classic it was shmanthony
You’re an idiot. While everyone is entitled to their own opinions this is just garbage. A 3? You gave Lil Pumps booty ass tape 7 and for you to give a REAL artist a 3 is honestly a joke. I know you haven’t listened to Mac obviously. I listened to him for 8 years and this is easily his best album. IF you listened to GO:OD AM and The Divine Feminine (not his best project) you’ll notice that SWIMMING is a mixture of both albums and even some of new Mac. This album was very well produced and if you didn’t like the beat selection you clearly missed the bigger picture on the direction where the album was going. You didn’t have to like this album Ofc but you didn’t have to disrespect it with an absurd rating. What did you listen to it once? How could you not capture all the effort and meaning depicted into this album. You honestly disrespected his singing that’s just rude you can just say you ain’t like how he sings without adding your tasteless comparisons to what he sounds like.
Stfu this album was good
Wow. Swimming is a very very deep and touching album. I have no idea what you are talking about. Disappointed this time.
Fuck You.
This album was too good for you to have done this
Trash review get your ears checked
You don&#39;t know Mac at all if you say he didn&#39;t evolve, have a shitty day
I feel sometimes Melon doesnt expirience music anymore, cause his always so focused on reviewin and analyzin the content that he dont let himself stop thinkin and start experiencing the music and let himself flow, instead of approving or disapproving each detail the music that an artist transmits
I like your videos Melon but this time i gotta say this, dont listen to this pretentious Melon here, that album is pure gold go listen to the whole thing yall
All these trigger fanboys in the comments lol.
He can&#39;t keep getting away with it
This review is wrong. I feel like he just cannot feel any vibe.
You lose all credibility with this one my guy. Terrible review. God awful
Dude said the beats are bland.. lmfaooo what a doucher
I fuck with Suicideboys... but how THE FUCK ARE YOU GONNA GIVE THEIR NEW ALBUM A 6 BUT THIS A 3?! ARE YOU A FUCKIN DUMBFUCK? Fuckin tool dude
You are a fuckin tool my guy holy shit
Dude Divine Feminine and Swimming are fucking masterpieces... What the fuck do you hear?
That&#39;s like ur opinion man
Stfu you suck, who tf are you
YOU. DONT. KNOW. MUSIC.
10/10 album of the year. My opinion.<br>Fav tracks - Hurt Feelings and Jet Fuel<br>Least fav - NONE
I absoultely loved this album easily one of my favorite albums this year and of all time, I&#39;d give a strong 9 out of 10
I love this album haha
The Red Flannel Curse: Fantano gives the album the red flannel and the artist will die within few months.
The like to dislike ratio just sums this video up perfectly
Guess he was ....moody rip
This guy&#39;s review sucks. This album was genius
You gave Syre a 4 but you gave this a 3?
I thought it was probably his BEST album. RIP MM...
everyone&#39;s butt hurt lol
This guy blow in from stupid town?
Your bias is showing, Melon.
Y’all know why I came here
I mean this in the most simple of terms, you have absolutely no musical taste nor appreciation for hard work and talent.
15k dislikes to 6.3k likes lmao
fuck him i fucking hate that mator looking ass nigga
Omg the ad and the start of the video
Unsubbed
Wow man this review is pitiful, there&#39;s so much soul in the album and I&#39;m not even saying that because of what happened. The music is really fucking good, the transition from rapping to singing is awesome (IMO). Hate on his singing fine, but how could any fan of music say the instrumentals on this are underwhelming? Thundercat&#39;s bass line on What&#39;s the use is a dam groove, the horns on Ladders, John Mayer on Small Worlds. I love the album, your review doesn&#39;t change that, I&#39;m just baffled how you could say the instrumentals are underwhelming when they&#39;re practically the brightest spot of the whole project.
Dam. Amazing album. This review has not aged well at all.
Dude I’ve never been so triggered, if you have no understanding of his music you shouldn’t be reviewing it
This man killed Mac and idk what to think
People are only disagreeing with you because he died. I get it you want to pay respects to miller but cmon now
yikes, how do you enjoy anything ? without criticizing and analyzing everything, you must be pretty fucking sad in real life
Mac Miller is one of my favourite artists and I highly disagree with this video but just because you disagree on what he’s saying, doesn’t mean the video is of bad quality and deserves a dislike, it’s sill a good video
L
Hi I&#39;m from the future. You&#39;re gonna regret that rating
On this review, sort of like the Lil&#39; Peep one, you just sound old. I get flashbacks to all the bitter old metal dudes who used to mock my tastes in nu metal as a teenager.  Which, to be fair in a lot of cases was ridiculous, but in the end I think they were worse.  I&#39;ve never wanted to be that guy as an adult.
I’m completely and utterly confused by this review, is this a troll or something?
Why do people get so mad when anthony doesnt like an album you like? Its not like it affects you in any way, he might not like swimming but i absolutely loved it and thats fine, if everyone had the same opinion life would be boring af
This guy hates every album I like. Music is subjective and it&#39;s kinda stupid to give a review of it. This album was great.
Every rapper that gets a negative review from melon lately dies. Damn. Who is next in melon’s line of indirect slaughter?
Can someone tag me in positive reviews this guy has made.
When this vid came out I stopped watching cuz I got so upset and now I’m leaving again.. only made it to 1 minute &gt;:( stinky melon
I respect your opinion, but you&#39;re wrong and I hate you
boo anthony, boo!
damnthony savagetano
Nope
I have given this album a listen. I loved it. Real critics gave it a 78 on metacritic. RIP MAC. We will never forget you!!! What a great talent.
This is not a pissed off comment. But maybe this newer scene of music is not for you.
Where the yellow flannel
When the melon gives you a bad review so you gotta overdose. feelsbadreviewman :(
everyone hates u
Hey guy, your review is shit, it doesn’t make any sense, you better off going into the woods, cutting an oak and letting it fall on your bald head
You clearly don’t understand his music, which is ok.. but only real Mac fans know how far he’s come and how well put together his sound is. To each their own I guess, but I felt so much emotion from this album because I can relate.
He just don&#39;t like shit no mo
Hi everyone, Killthony Spreetano here
Guess I&#39;m one of the only guys in the middle on this. I liked this album. I thought it was pretty good. But it wasn&#39;t his greatest album. I completely disagree about the production. It&#39;s pretty obvious from the tone that he was going for a more minimalist approach with the music. But what I agree with Anthony on is Mac&#39;s singing. It&#39;s really not that great. It&#39;s been years and he didn&#39;t get any better than it. That being said, I liked the themes and lyrics on this one. But again, not his best.
Yo, I like you, but this video hurts your credibility.  I know music is subjective, but you reduced it to a tiny portion of haters.
&quot;Effortlessly&quot; lol
Fantano this is an amazing album. You suck man.
youre a dumb ass bro not being meaning but mac is a genius
oh boy.
I would&#39;ve disagreed with this even if you didnt kill the poor guy, melon
Anthony Fantano. Mac Miller. Forever. :(
This album actually improved posthumous. It really brings out the bitter in the bitter poetry. ~Stolen youth
You&#39;re actually a trash reviewer. I can&#39;t wait for you to fucking disappear.
WHAT????
First time I listened to the album I would’ve agreed with melon but it’s better the more you listen. Every time I listen to it it sounds a lot better. I don’t agree with this melon, do an update.
I disagree 100% with your analysis. The lyrics laid out in this album contain some of Mac&#39;s best work. If anything, Swimming showed us how much Mac evolved as an artist lyrically, with his ability to express some of his struggles in a truly beautiful way. Any critic with logic would appreciate how nearly every song on this album had deep meaning and purpose- both constructed intelligently and gracefully. <br>Every song was well-thought. Mac being able to communicate his problems vocally in such a unique way just really makes me wonder how some wannabe critic could bash the album that horribly.<br><br><br>And btw Mac did not &quot;miss notes&quot; as you mentioned. Terrible review.
Unsubscribed melon head. The fact you find this albums production boring but praise something like Death Grips, you have the same taste in music as a high school teenager going through their goth stage.
Annnnnnd unsubscribed
If he liked mac’s miller’s singing this would be an easy 6 or 7/10
fuck you you piece of shit
he said mac is getting worse wtf bro mac been getting better everytime who taking these chances like mac no one
bro mac better than kayne
how is kid cudi nd kanye weak ass get a 10 but mac a 3 this album harder than the kids see ghost
This album will be considered a classic
Its a breath of fresh air compared to the other rap albums that have been coming out <br><br>It’s a honest album<br>It doesn’t come off fake like a lot hip hop art who are constantly putting on a front. Or just out to put out a catchy song.  <br><br>I respect your opinion though
I usually agree with your opinion on hip hop albums <br><br>I guess this one just wasn’t for u you<br><br>Music is great has good message and a great step forward for mac
This album is amazing !
You buggin this is EASILY his best album.
Unsubscibed for this Melon............... ur opinion sucks, seriously. Growth.  Even Jon Mayer said it was a quantum leap in artistry wdf.
personally i think you should stop reviewing rap albums. the only rap artist you praise is Kendrick.
ok i respect this guy and his idea of a youtube channel of analyzing music but holy shit he has a different opinion than me. like i respect his opinion bc it’s JUST HIS but holy shit every album i think is  good he says it’s shit like wow
Why does it sound like you dubbed effortlessly at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgwPxFUUg94&amp;t=113">1:53</a> lmao
Holy shit a three😥
Mac&#39;s strengths was smoothly integrating jazz/funk instrumentals with his own rap. I haven&#39;t heard anyone else like that. He can&#39;t change how he sings because that would betray how he felt IMO. I had this album on repeat before he died and I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be on repeat for a long time after.
I thought this album was great
Fuk u
Man ppl actually watch this guy I understand opinion but jeez man this was a great project
We are all witnesses of the melon
Top 10 Killers Who Got Away With It
Album of the year
Melon strikes again
Swimming was the first Mac Miller project I heard from start to finish. It was just on in the background but after a couple tracks really stood out, I sat and gave it some real attention. Enjoyed it enough to get another couple listens right through, then to get me to listen to his discography. Genuine shame he&#39;s gone.
You gave 5 minutes to this album compared to all the other albums you give 10 minutes to. You really didn&#39;t care about the album for sure. Not to mention you might realize now that his then current mind state was reflected onto the album, this album was full of emotion and you dismissed it as bland. 10/10 apathetic review, shouldn&#39;t have even bothered reviewing given the lack of effort to digest the music.
He should&#39;ve worn the red thing for astroworld
I respect your opinion but this really needs a re-review.. obviously it’s more impactful now since he’s gone but this album has a strong message and is highly relatable for many people... the musicianship is there and he has made strides as an artists. Obviously I’m bias because ima fan but I’m obsessed with being moved my music and his album does it for me. RIP Mac
Damn it melon head
I disagree wholeheartedly, R.I.P Mac.
Fantano writes his reviews on a death note, that’s the only explanation
who the fuck are you but another whiney bitch on the internet with a doctorate in whining. STFU
And everyone is blaming Ariana.... <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>He can’t keep<br>Getting away with this
I agree with 90% of your reviews but not this. I haven’t felt this type of emotion from the “maturation” of a rapper since 808s and heart break. I believe feminem was all over the place but eventually chiseling his sound that lead to this album. This album has a unique sound instrumentally and vocally that no other rapper can do right now.
<b>THE WORLD IS SO SMAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLL…</b><br><br>Goddammit, it was so mundane and boring. I&#39;m sorry. His death does not make this album any less lifeless.
Fantano is a turd who doesn&#39;t know the culture or shit about music
4 artists now killed by the melon
RIP Miller Mac
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgwPxFUUg94&amp;t=112">1:52</a> what was that?
congratulations
This review won&#39;t age well
Why did u kill mac miller lil peep and x. You didn’t have to do that
Mr Fantano...I have agreed with almost everything point you&#39;ve made on most reviews since I started checking into your opinion...and I have to say...I refuse to even listen to this one upon hearing that you gave it a 3...which even if he hadn&#39;t died and caused his album to have a deeper impact on me...I would not have even closely agreed. Sad that you may have turned people away from it
Guns don’t kill people. The red flannel kills people.
Yeah, you&#39;re pretty much the only person who didn&#39;t like this album, man.
have some respect for the dead, man!
pls stop
What the fuck you killed him!
2009 is a masterpeice WTF are you talking about?? Anthony Hatertano..........
Your reviews suck big time! How about someone review your reviews? 1 out of 10 for this review.
ouch.. wtf
This album is about to win a Grammy lol ...Anthony has become a Joke let the fame get to him
Cursed flannel
Fantano speaking facts Mac is overrated trash and we shouldn&#39;t pretend he&#39;s some legend because he died. He was a fucking addict, in the ground where he belongs.
if he didn’t die y’all wouldn’t be mad. this video came out before he died
Who the fuck is this guy?? Never heard of him. Real Hip-Hop critics praise Malcolm&#39;s work while geek Krillin here is talking straight out of his ass on <b>Youtube</b> Lmaoo who ever takes fake Rosenberg seriously must be just as retarded.
totally disagree - really enjoyed this album even with its imperfections.
This album is good af
What is wrong with this guy? 2009 is one of the top songs of 2018 and you said it made you feel like you’re in a torture chamber? Wtf...
Nah you dead wrong, shit was fire
You cursing all my favorite artists god fucking dammit Melon
Horrible review. You say you gave it a chance but you actually didn&#39;t. I urge you to listen again and redo this review. Literally 14,000 + people disagree with you on this one.
Chester, peep, x, Mac, I’m calling lil xan next
I usually agree with fantanos reviews.. I’ve repeatedly listen to this album (not being a Mac fan). It’s an amazing album
He&#39;s hating on 2009... you don&#39;t like Mac Miller do you? R.I.P Mac Miller. You were a true artist and you are appreciated on a deep level man.
Voodoothony Flanello
FUCK YOU MELON.
you gave him a 3 and he died (nah like seriously RIP young Mac u will be missed)
Anthony Fantano AKA The Red Flannel Killer strikes again...<br>RIP💔💔💔
OHHHTHONY FUCKHESDEADTANO
review your fav mac tracks/ work or something would be cool
every single time
FUCK YOU
Oof
I think out of respect this should be taken down.
Someone listened to it sober 😂<br><br>On the real tho, you can&#39;t feel the depth of his &quot;understated bars&quot; if you haven&#39;t battles addiction. You can&#39;t vibe right to this tape without THC (at the very least!). <br><br>This tape aint for squares. It&#39;s for those of us with  the same demons. Or those who got their shit together but still use substances and can atleast relate to where he is at somewhat.
It&#39;s almost like this album was meant to be heard as a parting gift. I only listened and saw the vid to &quot;self care&quot; and felt this direction was new. As if he was going to be reborn again. I fully dove into the album after his death and it feels like he&#39;s directly speaking to us and walking us through his true emotions. I probably wouldn&#39;t have the same understanding or appreciation if I caught it earlier. His spirit will live forever thru this album.
I hope you hear this album now and it haunts you.
Isn’t “working outside of your strengths” exactly how you “show effort to improve upon weaknesses”? His albums have been changing so much and I enjoyed watching his evolution and think this was a gem of an album. I am so thankful to get to experience it because what a gift he has left before such a tragic departure RIP
This shit aint funny no more
YOU DID THIS TO HIM LOL
Really. This review is unbelievably whack and superficial. You can clearly see that Anthony does not know shit about Mac, especially what he was going through. Listen to the album now and you will understand. <br>Rip
this solidifies my opinion that this guy is trash (I&#39;m not talking about Mac)
What a sad guy. Just so hateful about so many things and people.
You really are a pretty lame dude
Bro you literally just hate white rappers because I feel like deep down you wanna be one or something. This is honestly a ridiculous review lmao, and it’s everytime like this with white rappers u sound mad honestly.
Damn what if Melon killed Mac..
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgwPxFUUg94">0:00</a> Anthony&#39;s reaction when he found out Mac passed away.
You&#39;re hip hop reviews are trash
The album is actually nice.
You killed another rapper
I loved this album and the I thought the beats were a good balance of art and being bland, giving the whole album’s timbre into a pastel pink. i loved the vocals (adding to the original statement that the vibe of the song fit perfectly). but hey, that’s just my opinion.<br><br>rip mac.
Eh disagree w/ ya here Anthony. I thought this was solid. Nothing amazing but definitely not a 3/10.  Good review as always though!
😬 I think Anthony is a murderer 😬
People listened to the album after he died and liked it because it&#39;s genuinely a 6-7/10.
Album was a solid 7/10.
Mac miller will always be the greatest
This album was great asf... Rip mac..
Genuinely don&#39;t know why anyone gives a shit what you think
i don’t even know why i come to your videos.
your reviews are so fucking bad &amp; biased I already know what kind of shit you will automatically rate high or low based on the distinct sounds of em 😂😂😂😂
oof
You have blood on your melon coldthony heartano.
SETTLE DOWN Fantano <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23chooseyourwordsmorewisely">#ChooseYourWordsMoreWisely</a>
The red flannel needs to be stopped
I&#39;m glad the like/dislike ratio is better than this review .....
Wow he&#39;s got a really bad history with bad album ratings and death, coincidence?
Anthony claims another victim
YOU&#39;VE DONE IT AGAIN
Wtf melon
How does this guy have so many subs?? He doesn’t seem to know much about good music. I’d like to know what music he does like...
Still havent addressed his death on ur channel fucking sad
Woat reviewer
the comments are everything i expected and more HAHA
i dont know about that chief
ay remember people this man gave 7 to Gucci Gang by Lil Pump
The day I unsubscribe to this trash shit You be saying. I came here thinking Anthony probably got something good to say about this great album that Mac Miller he just put out. But No No No. dammit Anthony u need to retire
I think most people could appreciate that this is a well produced album with a lot of depth and artistry. Yeah we get it, you don’t rate his voice/singing. That still shouldn’t afford the album such an unbalanced amount of vitriol. I mean let’s be real, you gave Astroworld a 7, and this album a 3… Travis Scott’s entire sound “borders on parody”.
10/10 review it again<br><br>10/10 review it again<br><br>10/10 review it again
<b>Curb your enthusiasm plays</b>
Why do i keep watching you destroy my favorite artists and albums
Anthony you killed mac miller!!
Wtf you gave this a 3 wtf ??? A 3 dude im speechless and no not because he died. This album was very good and refreshing
Serialthony Killertano - RIP Mac 😞🙏
This man has to be stopped. HE&#39;S KILLING EVERYONE!!!!😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Wrong
Think you’ve this one wrong Notano.
This tool talking about cringe. Has he ever watched one of his own videos?
I loved this album...im starting to wonder about you fantano....hmm.🤔
This the first time I’ve ever had to dislike a fantano video. What the fuck Melon
This album is honestly amazing to me...
Fingers crossed <b>drake is next</b>
You fucking kill him, Anthony. Jesus, chill out. Just one year without killing someone.
&quot;Oops I did it agian&quot; - Anthony Fantano
I don’t understand this review. Perfecto was my favorite track and I loved this record. The first review from Melon where I’ve truly disagreed with his points. 8/10. Miss you Mac.
This album isn’t bad at all
Damn forreal? i didnt feel that at all, man even before mac died i thought this shit was straight fire. The lowkey almost sad tone, the jazzy vibes, just damn. not once when listening did i think for a second this was lackluster. Sure the old mac is forever fire and the rapping in unbeatable, but everyone goes thru changes, and this was a good change i think. RIP to mac tho, that shit hurt
DEATH NOTE!!
Fuck this guy whos a NO talent youtuber
Someone call the fucking cops.
Most people liked the album except him, I&#39;m SHOOK
Genuinely I feel like your metal and rock reviews are good but hip-hop and RnB seems to pass you by.
After listening to this whole album giving it a 3 is just wrong.
You are way off on this review again like most Mac Miller albums over the years. You can&#39;t possibly process this great album one day after it had dropped.  This album will live forever!
I think it’s time to get rid of the red flannel, melon.
times fantano was right
Ted Cruze was just a rouse<br>The mastermind Melon used him to confuse<br>The fact that he attacked and left behind clues <br>The fact that he is the true zodiac and ain’t finished too <br>Watch out for his bad reviews because a 3 or below means he’s coming for you
Yhea you tripping the album is so fire.
Burn Red Flannels not NIKES lol, <br>R.I.P. Mac Miller ♥️🙏🏾🙏🏾
Feels like you&#39;re losing your taste man
why couldn&#39;t you have given queen a bad review so nicki died instead
Goddamn the red flannel has no remorse
Just here to say fuck you 👍
you really killed him with that review
Has this pussy ever givin a good review? Cuz ive not seen a single one
I Don’t Understand Any Thing He Likes Anymore. R.I.P Mac 🖤🐐 A Fucking Legend No Matter What Anybody Says! 🎶
he is always biased melon
you&#39;re sick fantano, leave bad rappers &amp; musician alone melon!!!!!!!
Do you like any music?
Not sure why we all still watch these
2009 is a beautiful song...
Maybe review a Donald trump speech in that Flanny. Might do a lot of Americans a favourn
I think you messed up this review bud
Can&#39;t believe that garbage Kamikaze got a 4 and this got a 3
DUDE STOP!
your terrible
WOW. This dude is a lame.   2009 is his best song and the album is his magnum opus.
Wow those dislikes
you know nothing about music just fall off,
Don&#39;t think I&#39;ve disagreed more with a review of yours Melonman.
he kill.
Anthony, you&#39;re starting to slouch. Are you okay?
No man should be this powerful
Maybe a redux review of this album will lift the hate off your shoulders.
how can this dudes rude opinion be considered an actual review? This man is so goddamn simple, shits on ab-soul, mac, and eminem. I get the em hate whatever but the other two are lyrical &amp; musical geniuses, incredibly underrated, and wise beyond their years. You&#39;re really telling me gucci gang was a better project? and that he sounds like lil xan? lucky you talk all your shit behind a camera and not to any artist themselves.
Jay Rock is not safe
He strikes again...
Anthony why did you kill him
rip
Use the red flannel on your next lil xan review.
You’re out of your mind. This album is a classic.
I really hope when I become a rapper you never review my album
This is my second fav Mac album
the mass murdering melon claims yet another life.
I don&#39;t know what you smoking, this was a great album. I think I&#39;ll rely on Shawn Cee for reviews now.
fuck you and your pompous opinions
I dislike this guys opinions so much
Did it again melon
It happened again
Just don&#39;t pretend this album was ever good just cause Mac Miller died. It was still terrible.
I&#39;m not a big Mac Miller fan. Never got into his previous work. But I always thought the kid had heart in his work. Nonetheless, I&#39;m about to listen to &quot;Swimming&quot; because the news of his demise mandates a re-listening for me. 3 still seems pretty low man. Damn!
That&#39;s another dead artist at the hands of Killthony Deathtano
go fuck yourself
R.I.P. Mac. He was too young. I loved him and all of his songs. It&#39;s a real shame he died. Also, STOP BLAMING ARIANA GRANDE!!!!!!! IT&#39;S NOT HER FAULT!!!!!!
&quot;Deathtony Notetano here. The internet&#39;s busiest Grim Reaper...&quot;
Hurt Feelings, Self Care, Jet Fuel, Conversations pt 1 all good songs. <br>Most albums dont even have 4 good songs. Yeah his singing is like getting fisted in the ear but ignore that and its a good album
The macabre morbidity of this is palpable.
They are not worthy so they die
Wow this is actually weird, who’s next?
Depression + Red Flannel = death💀💀
YOURE REVIEWS FUCKING KILL PEOPLE
I know the album wasn&#39;t good but he didn&#39;t deserve to die
Deathany notano
I&#39;m hear to see all the Mac fans shitting on the review, especially after his death.
Fuck yourself
How could u give this album a 3 ?!?! It isn&#39;t perfect but a 3 with a red flannel isn&#39;t what this project deserves, man.<br><br>Rest In Peace Mac miller 😢
Deathony Notetano
ffs why does he get shit for this?
Killthony Artiststano
A new super villain has been on the rise
The red flannel is bad luck
I saw the red shirt and knew. Its getting kinda close to not being coincidence
Alright hes about to review the suicideboys new album boys so pray to god that he doesnt give them a bad review because they could be next.
When you say his moany voice sucks but people like trippie red sound worse but you prefer it??? Fantano makes me question music preference a lot.
Anthony Fantano in: <br>How To Get Away With Murder
U killed him.
Fuck you melly.
Rest in power Mac
i think these reviews actually play some kind of role in someone&#39;s depression
I swear to fucking god
AGAIN!!!!!
this mans actually killing people jesus christ
Asshole😔<br>RIP mac
This Album is in no way bland
There’s blood on your hands melon
Ok serialthony killertano. <br>Daily reminder that this man gave lil pump a 7/10.
&quot;LET&#39;S ARGUE: The Red Flannel Is An Evil, Sentient Being&quot;
Hmmm.  I dig this album.  I wasn&#39;t too familiar with his work until sadly after he passed.  &quot;2009&quot; is beautiful.
Everybody making a joke out of macs death over this video needs to shut the fuck up seriously
i&#39;ll take that as a light to decent 8, thank you very much
Rip
You are not the real melon. You are a gmo clone melon made by the Illuminati. The real melon was sacraficed
Dude you&#39;re a freaking idiot
I really liked this album this was the only video from Anthony I disliked when it came out mac was one of the last actual artist in rap he talked real shit but it&#39;s just his opinion right?
ANOTHER ONE
This post right here officer
And the prophecy fulfills itself once more. The streets now run red with flannel.

I give the man props for this album. It got me bopping all night when I heard it first last night for the first time. For some reason, I wouldn&#39;t even have given it a shot had he not passed. RIP MAC.

I appreciate that Anthony has an opinion on music and that he’s willing to share it, but DAMN... Anthony’s taste in music is absolute garbage. Like the worst.
Get rid of the red flannel, this shit is giving me PTSD
I fucking hate your opinion, lil bitch
How many more artists need to die under your reign?
This is a pretty trash review to be honest. This guy is just saying he doesn&#39;t get it for 5 1/2 minutes. Lost some credibility on this one
melon claims another soul from god’s clutches
Nigga killed him
Why, melon? WHY?
Fantano does it again?
this is actually getting a little creepy...
Stop killing rappers man I really liked Mac :(
Rip
Bet you feel like a fucking shithead right about now
I swear I&#39;m calling the police<br>Rest Easy, Mac...you won&#39;t be forgotten
Sigh<br><br>Dammnit Fanthanos...
Anthony god damnit please stop before someone calls the cops
You couldn&#39;t be any more wrong.<br><br>This was his best album.<br><br>Anthony we literally only keep watching because you&#39;re a meme.
You keep claiming that these artists are just jumping on the emo rnb trend and are not really executing their emotions in a believable way. Guess what, it&#39;s getting as real as it can now.
Again, seriously?
THE DEATH COUNT STANDS:<br><br>XXXtentacion<br>Mac miller <br>Chester bennington<br>Lil peep<br><br>STOP GIVING RAPPERS BAD REVIEWS MELON IM SERIOUS
Arrest this man already
Fantano claimed another soul
i’m actually starting to believe that melon is killing these poor artists
This shit is so fucking heartbreaking.
I’m so confused on how you review albums. What is your criteria? I understand this is your opinion, but as a prominent figure in the music scene you do somewhat shape peoples perception of artist and their music. If it weren’t for your bad review of TESTING, I probably wouldn’t have gone back to listen to that album and realize how wrong you were in your review. This album is the most introspective Macs gone into himself. I can’t think of any better way he could’ve done it. Please listen to the music instead of skimming through it because I highly doubt you listened to the whole thing.
He’s only gone and done it again
God damn it Melon
WHY&#39;D YA DO IT MELON?!!
fuck you fantano
Fantano hates experimental artists. He likes the post Malone’s who make sh*t music that all sounds the same
YOU FUCKING KILLED HIM
Grimthony Reapertano here reaping another soul with my red flannel again ughhhhhhh
Anthony FanThanos strikes again
Please, world, i beg of you - don&#39;t ever let TND review my music. I want to live.
Do y’all think Drake might be next?<br>R.I.P. Mac
Don&#39;t do this shit to Fantano, people. He is nowhere near at fault for Mac&#39;s death. Mac OD bc there was some problems that he couldn&#39;t solve in time. He has always taken bad reviews of his music and turned them into better and better music. Ultimately, I&#39;m sure making Swimming and receiving overrall good reviews left a good taste in his mouth.<br><br>Here&#39;s what I would say to Fantano, for future reviews: you can be critical of someone&#39;s art, but please don&#39;t be cruel about it. Someone shitting all over one&#39;s creation can be such a blow...<br><br>Also, open up a bit to puberescent emotion and new ways in which artists express themselves. There&#39;s an emotional side I think you&#39;re not seeing in these young artists&#39; music.<br><br>Keep up.
Melon, you did it AGAIN! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23burntheredflannel">#BurnTheRedFlannel</a>
He before all of the R.I.P Mac comments
Please do your next Russ review with this flannel
Putting a dislike on this video as a tribute to Mac even though I respect your opinion Ohthony Nothano, RIP :( And put that red flannel away, that shit&#39;s evil and it won&#39;t stop until the rap game is dead !
This didn’t age well.<br><br>RIP Mac
Cover identity :Music reviewer<br>Real identity :Assassin
I guess this was secretly a NOT GOOD
IF I MAKE IT IN THIS RAP GAME PLEASE SPARE ME , MELON
STOP GIVING NOT GOODS AND USING THE RED FANNEL
rereview
The only thing more rediculous than this review is the thought that this guy had any friends growing up...
I actually start to believe the curse like everyone else
Anthony FanThanathos
Murderer!!!!! 😱😱😱
Dude do the world a favour and give Nickleback a red flannel review
This was melons final warning for artists, that make bad music. Please forgive them almigthony fantano, they&#39;re doing their best to please you!!!
Another one bites the dust...
Killed another one.
He needs to keep harvesting souls so his teeth stay at the top of the game.
Red flannels kill people
Hail Lord Fantano
THIS HAS TO STOP!
YOU DID THIS YOU MELON-HEADED FUCK
Dammit melon it&#39;s all your fault. On August 9th too my birthday this world is too weird...
WRONGWRONGWRONG<br><br>It&#39;s pretty damn good. Bro.
Review Trump’s tweets
I hit submit to soon, but swimming, just like faces, captured a state of mind that I don’t think capable of appreciating. I think listening to drowning hours of music you don’t want to listen to has stripped you of the reason people listen to music in the first place
If you get a score under 4/10, you have to be extremely careful.
Anthony, I think we need to do something about this... Your kill count keeps climbing.
You are pretentious. You can only relate to sound/baseline lyriscim and not emotion. I’ve been watching your videos for years, I’ve ever only disagreed with your Radiohead album placing and your overhype of DAMN.
Burn the red flannel
You did it again Anthony, Stop It!!
Melon claims yet another soul...
Rest in Power
R.IP Mac Miller🙏🏻 your album “swimming” was masterpiece to me. Thank you 😭💔
The red flannel is worse than the Madden curse.
Okay we get that you didn&#39;t like the album melon, but did you really have to mix Mac&#39;s drugs with bullshit to make him overdose ? I don&#39;t trust you with my drugs anymore, guess I&#39;ll have to find another dealer :(<br><br>RIP Mac :(((
The melon strikes yet again
you did it again
The Melon strikes again
Look what u did
Overthony Dosetano here claiming another victim
3/10  and the third shitty MC dead in less then a year coincidence?????
Eminem&#39;s next calling it now
RIP MAC WE LOVE YOU
RIP, MAC I FUCKING LOVE YOU, LEGEND.... TOP 5. DON&#39;T FUCKING @ ME. iM ON MY LAPTOP OR ELSE THERE WOULD BE FUCKING BROKEN-HEART EMOJIS......... OH MY GOD I STILL CAN&#39;T BELIEVE THIS IS REAL.... WHY!!!!!!!!!!  PS. Look at your fucking &#39;like&#39; to &#39;dislike&#39; ratio. THAT&#39;S how you know you are completely wrong. Mac is a fucking legend, put respect on his FUCKING NAME.

<b>HE CAN&#39;T KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH IT!</b>
Dude fuck you. I like you but I’m so sad right now so fuck you
The red fannel is sated for the moment.
anthony killthanos strikes again, how you have more body bags than <br> satan ? rip mac miller
FANTANO KILLED MAC MILLER
Nah man, I would&#39;ve given this a 7 at lowest
Wow, Antny. Really?
melon man strikes again
That red flannel is definitely cursed
Yuh must be giving the FBI a lot of money to get be getting away with this again.
Burn this fucking shirt of yours, you&#39;ve done too much damage.
Damn fantano you really ripped into him before he died...
YOU DID IT AGAIN <b>MELON CLAIM ANOTHER SOUL</b>
Anthony just hit a quad feed
You can’t keep getting away with this Fantano
I love you Anthony. But I disagree. This album was a step forward for him compared to his last. Sad to not be able to hear more
Ok Melon 4th Time
Fuck you
No more red flannel. Please I wanna enjoy NEW LIVING music
Lil Xan and Eminem are next
ARTISTTHONY KILLERTANO HERE
Melon strikes again....
AGAIN MELON?
The red flannel is cursed...
Trump Curse Confirmed
What do you have to say now
Did melon find that red flannel in some forgotten basement of some cursed antique shop?
Notice how every other publication praised this album but you just had to try to be the hipster you are and be different huh fuck off. RIP Mac Miller critics will never understand artists because they have no idea what putting real artistic thought into something and executing it to perfection takes but yet you praise artists who don’t even try on their songs I can’t even take you seriously anymore. This album is s 9 out of 10
This niqqa needa stfu and play the song
Damn melon you hated this album
The red flannel of death
Wasn&#39;t his best project but he had great albums and mixtape
Rip mac miller
Once is an incident <br>Two is a coincidence <br>Three times is a pattern<br>Four times is a rampage<br>Stop the slaughter, Melon
Who came here to see the shit posting literally right after you found out he died? Dang.
SOMETHING WRONG<br>I HOLD MY HEAD <br>MAC GONE <br>MELON DID IT AGAIN
You happy now?
The melon curse continues?!?<br>I don’t understand
Fantano please! What have you done???
FBI HERE HE IS THE MURDERER HE KILLED PEEP HE KILLED X AND NOW MAC
W H A T  H A V E  Y O U  D O N E !
Pray for Eminem!
R.I.P Mac don’t agree with this review personally
... Lil&#39; Peep, bad review.<br>Deceased.<br>XXXTENTACION.<br>Bad Review.<br>Deceased.<br>MAC MILLER NOW?!?!
Antwan the murderer Fantano
Anthony&#39;s 5th kill !
Another bad review killing a man. Thanks asshole
god damnit melon
Eminem is next
What&#39;s tough about people who review things like music is that the reviewer just has no idea of the intentions of the music they produce and release to the public. Your comments about the album is nearly spot on with what Mac intended and it seemed to be that he got his point across well. Which would make it a good album. This has little to do about the death of Malcolm but you are basically bashing the album because he isn&#39;t, nor is the music necessarily happy. I think you should do a better job reviewing the artist you review, by getting to  understanding the meaning behind their music. In this review you bash Mac for feeling a certain way, and that&#39;s stupid.
the red flannel is truly a curse
Obviously he didn’t expect Mac to pass away so suddenly, and he’s most likely upset about this as much as everyone else...R.I.P Mac Miller
anthony hates white rappers
I&#39;m not just saying this cause the guy died but I feel like anthony was wrong about this one. Even though I think everyone has different taste so all his reviews are subjective I think he&#39;s being a bit harsh about the emotional lyrics and instrumentals. I think that kind of emotionalism scratches a pretty relatable itch for a lot of people going through rough times. I&#39;m not really a fan of mac or even rap in general but when I was a teenager elliott smith really helped me through a rough time and I feel like even though mac isn&#39;t elliott his music can potentially have the same affect. I&#39;m not a huge fan of his voice either but I guess you gotta work with what you&#39;ve got.
Fuck melon and his dirty red flannel. Murderer
The murder is getting out of hand, Melon. What the fuck did Mac Miller do to you?! THE KILLING HAS TO STOP!!!!!!!!
You fucking psychopath.
Welp you did it again Melon
RIP Eminem. He will be missed
This is actually suspect
Nerf the red flannel pls
Millennials aren&#39;t killing it, mellonials are

Is it just a coincidence that Linkin Park, XXX, Lil Peep and now Mac Miller have all died pretty shortly after your negative reviews.
Fuck you melon
Fantano has taken another victim. Why aren&#39;t the dumb cops investigating the connection between the deaths and the scores  Antnee gives for their albums? RIP Mac Miller
Such a garbage ass review<br><br>The albums great as fuck

jesus fantano you killed anotha one
<b>HE CAN&#39;T KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH IT</b>
Chester, X, Lil peep, now Mac. Melon is really Thanos right now taking out our favourite artists 😢
Fantano always brings the heat.  I honestly had never heard of this kid before but no one deserves to pass away at such a young age.  I will give Fantano credit tho, he never holds back on what he feels like is mediocre music no matter how popular the artist.  This kid will def blow up tho now that he&#39;s passed away, artists always have that romantic allure post-death.
FUCK YOU ANTHONY FUCK YOU
HOW DARE YOU MELON WAS IT REALLY THAT BAD
Melon claims another soul
Another One
i think at this point Fandango officially qualifies as a serial killer
he fucking did it again
Rip Mac Miller, thanks for all the music you left for us

WHY DOES EVERYONE HE RATE BADLY DIE? RIP MAC MILLER!
Agree to disagree I guess.
Bro wtf is thisssss
Mac should just go full Larry Fisherman. I like him when he does that.
but his Tiny Desk concert was great.
Does this guy ever like anything? All he does is trash every album he reviews.
Not trying to get too philosophical here.... but booooooooooooooo
well that’s just like your opinion man
Omg I found the video to make everything you say now invalid
Has he ever given mac a good review?
All these comments suck, he makes good points. I just really love this album.
I knew there was a reason i never clicked on your videos<br>U say a lot of words that make it sound like you know music and shit but honestly u havent the slightest idea but big ups for taking ur time to record edit and upload ur videos im not an asshole so i do respect ur review i just know we will never agree with music and wont watch another one of ur videos
You have no idea mac is one of the best ever your tunnel vision is jokes
what album does this nigga actually like? lol
Lmao L everyone liked this album, youre just an arianna grande stan
3/10 is a bit much. I have pretty much the same opinion as you but I probably would have given it a 5/10 or 6/10
mmmmmm no
btw everyone should check out shawn cee, he makes much better reviews and actually gives albums a chance
anthony hates white people, too much white guilt inside of him
I was/am a big fan of mac&#39;s watching movies and really liked his self titled album/mixtape after that, which doesnt stand up too well now but at the time his lyrics of drug use and abuse made me like him. Ive been waiting for something else from him that I enjoy and swimming is that something. ive been listening to it pretty much everyday since its come out. i really like that instrumentals, macs unique voice, and his lyrics. some lyrics are deep and soulful, others fun and witty. i just like the album. glad mac is back and hopefully hes doing well in his personal life. Id probably give the album an 8/10, cant think of any outright bad songs, 2009 or small worlds being my favorite. it was awesome listening to small worlds on the tiny desk concert or whatever that series is.
also self care god fucking damn
this album was sick, and the like/dislike ratio confirms what i was thinking
You’re a biased trash bag
im gonna have to disagree with all of u, silly melon
this dude just seems like he wants upbeat music, every music is beautiful bruh, n mac did a good job. not even one song was bad
YOU DIDNT LIKE 2009?! WTF BRO
This album is beautiful
I think Mac peaked at Macadelic, that mixtape is still the shit.
“underwhelming instrumentals” mans does not know how to appreciate detail
Sometimes you’re just really really wrong Melon.
I don&#39;t think fantano dived too deep into the actual meaning of the album, the meaning of the lyrics, the clever wordplay, and the whole story just the names and spots the tracks of the album hold. In the start he talks about how&#39;s he&#39;s struggling then you have a couple tracks where he describes his way of &quot;swimming&quot; in his issues, just the whole album has alot of deeper purpose. The tracks really aren&#39;t bad, I enjoyed alot of the deep end in most of the instrumentals especially but even though it wasn&#39;t anything to write home about (except self care and hurt feelings those instrumentals are amazing) the lyrics more than often carry the decent instrumentals. Personally it all culminates to album of the year for me I&#39;d give it a perfect ten most notably because I will not forget this album for years to come. I do not think this album is truly a 3/10 in even the most specific eyes of the most critical reviewers.
Du hast doch nen Knall bro
10/10 on this album. If anyone else is going through an emotional state of unsureness and emptiness. This album lands on it. This heartless fuck doesn’t get how deep an album is because he is just a critic. Watch the episode of South Park with the yelp reviewers. This guy is a douche like all of the other reviewers. Not because I don’t agree with your opinion or disagree for that matter. But because you only care about stupid critic shit. Put yourself in Mac Miller’s shoes for a moment. He is struggling with drug addiction and he lost his girlfriend because of it. And a girl he actually loved. But yet you only care that it’s “mopey” or “boring” put your feelings in a real artist shoes dude. I’m not even band wagoning this guy. I didn’t care for the album before or even the album before his previous one all that much. But this one hit home and to a lot of people. So fuck you snd your review.
you HAVE to smoke weed to like this album
Yeah uh<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>This ain&#39;t it chief
I&#39;m really gonna have to listen to some well-reviewed albums to see what I&#39;m missing
i know people have different opinions but i generally feel fantano is biased against mac
You’re a nerd
You randomly come up on my feed and every time I click on a video I regret it. You’re an amateur with a camera in your house
Wish I could give this 2 thumbs down.
WTF is he NOT smoking!!! Thank you Mac Miller, for an album you can chill out vibe alone to. This review is trash!
Great album
I&#39;m shocked people liked this album but glad to see that it has an audience because it wasn&#39;t for me; however an album that sounds like inertia would be amazing!
I have never in my life disagreed with a review as much as I do this one.
<b>Best Review</b>
Fuck Anthony fantano
ima keep it real witchu chief, this the dumbest shit you&#39;ve said n i luv your reviews
Damn it’s not that bad. I liked it
..... the dislikes lol
Youre a fuckwit, dont forget it.
Flannel szn
Fuck u baldy
Hurt feelings, what’s the use? and ladders are all timeless tracks lol you’re lame if you think otherwise.
This is my least favorite review of yours :(
It&#39;s good to see that this review is getting the dislikes it deserves.
I’d give it a 9 I loved it. It was peaceful and soothing. It has a light hearted feel to it.
self care surprised me a lot. very positively.
More like a 3/10 dislike ratio LOL
Didn&#39;t really like it that much either. Not really a fan of Mac Miller but i definitely would&#39;nt give it a rating that low. It wasn&#39;t awful.
MBDTF review part 2
What! This album is super dope. I&#39;ve got to disagree with you on this one.
3/10 macmiller<br>7/10 ariana grande<br>Add them together and it couldve been a perfect 10/10<br>:(
This nigga really out of his mind
Goddamn those dislikes
Does this guy like any music? Every review I see, it&#39;s negative. I&#39;m not the biggest Mac Miller fan but I really enjoyed this album
prefer his old stuff
Nobody thought the singing was the focal point of the album. It’s the vibe.
First TND review i disliked.<br>I agree with anthony like 90% of the time but i am 100% this review was extremely strong-armed.<br>Look, i get that the substance of some of the songs on the album isn&#39;t super engaging and some of the vocals could&#39;ve been comped better.<br>But a 3/10???<br>I mean a 4/10 is shit and it&#39;s not even a 4/10.<br>It&#39;s weird fantano would give GO:OD AM a 7/10 when the two albums are pretty comparable in quality.<br>That being said i think neither of them are 7&#39;s. GO:OD is more or a 6 and Swimming is more of a 5 maybe 4.<br>3 seems WAAAAAY too low for this album especially since self care, and it&#39;s quirky production, itself could bring the album up to a 3 on its own.
its a 6.5 or 7
If you want a real review, check out Shawn cee it should be the 2nd one YouTube recommends
You obviously do not understand Mac Millers artistry and development as a person. He’s a very talented guy, I’m not sure what your expecting from him.
gave:<br>blue slide park a 5<br>watching movies a 6<br>faces a 6<br>good am a 7<br>divine a 4<br>swimming a 3<br><br>how sway
You don&#39;t know shit. Swimming was a great album.
I feel like you didn&#39;t even try to like it, you just went in with the mindset that calm and relaxing = boring
@anthonyfantano you are drunk and you just lost a subscriber. Opinions are cool and all but this album was not bad. I lost respect about a year ago or two ago when you last posted a review on another well known artist. I actually thought you knew what you were talking about.
This album was great??? Tf
The album reminds me of a more subtle version of Calvin Harris Bounce Vol 1. In a good way.
...
Wow!
He can&#39;t swim
Mac finally put all the glorifying drug use to the side and for the first time talked about life and relationships. He is maturing as an artist and a person and it&#39;s cool to see. Hate that you hated it, because I wanted to hate it and I just couldn&#39;t.
I haven&#39;t liked any of his previous work but this album gets a fair bit of play in my system. Really surprised with your score (but am I really surprised?)
Might wanna rethink this one
Wtf you really lost your mind on this one.
I can&#39;t believe we still have to talk about Mac Miller
wow this review was fucking awful. just bc it doesn&#39;t ride the current trends :/
nope. nope.
Really surprised to find you dislike this album so much. Respect your opinion as a critic and connoisseur (only found Death Grips because of you), but I&#39;m on the opposite side of this album from you. (7~8/10 front to back)<br><br>Heard it for the first time last Friday and I&#39;ve had it on repeat through the weekend, bout 4 play-throughs. Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;m a big fan of spacey chill beats (some of them have a Nujabes feel to them or one of those Youtube streams that play lo-fi chillhop beats), and I guess you could describe the vocals as droning, but I loved them. I could do without the annoying Jet Fuel track, and the outro song was missing something, but I knew this was a new favorite of mine after those first three songs. Honestly, I think those first three are enough to judge whether you&#39;ll be a fan of this. It&#39;s funny you compared it to rush hour traffic, cause that&#39;s when I first listened to it and it really chilled me out and made my drive more relaxing.<br><br>Not gonna dislike for having a different opinion, but I defathony disagratano on this one, melon.
You know what? I entirely disagree with this review, almost to the point where it angers me. That being said, I mildly respect your opinion.
You guys are hating but you know its his OPINION right? Like you can like it but its just not his thing. I personally liked the album but I&#39;m not bitching because some guy on youtube didn&#39;t like it too.
Not a good review. This album by Mac is just another progression of his work with meaning and new sounds. His current style can seem a little mundane but it&#39;s his lyrics and composition that I believe fit well in this album
damn death grips really sound good to this guy
What the fuck
it&#39;s not a 3 and u know it
We need more dislikes. Come on bois
Bad review
Video hasn&#39;t even started and dislike ratio tells me everything I need to know 😂<br><br>You know this is just his opinion right?
Ding dong. Your opinion is wrong
I am not a HUGE fan of Mac Miller. But I do like a bit of his stuff n respect him as an artist. Old stuff was fun n cool to cruise to. This new stuff... This sounds like he&#39;s really maturing n coming to realization of how to take responsibikity for his emotions. This is the first album of his I didnt have to pick n choose what I like. I thought this album was solid.
8/10
bruh WHAT
Is it just me or Anthony pronounces &quot;appreciate&quot; oddly
I&#39;d say light 6 on this album. Thought it was cool.
why are you so mad lmao. youre gunna regret this one if you dont already
Lmao when people couldn&#39;t see it was a shit album so they spam the dislike button in annoyance
Listen to &quot;Dunno&quot; and tell me that shit a 3/10????
I’m glad this video has more dislikes than likes but your opinion is yours and I get where you’re coming from.
He really fucking gave it a 3.... wow. Not eating another melon for the rest of the summer.
i liked it idk
Clearly Mac didn&#39;t cut the check
<b>I Disagree With You = Bad Review</b>
Yikes, just straight up got this one wrong.
Very good album..wings is an awesome track!
you haven&#39;t a fucking clue what you&#39;re talking about here.
It’s ridiculous how people are so angry over this review. It’s his opinion! He’s not saying you shouldn’t like the album. He just personally doesn’t like it. Seriously, let people have their own opinions!!
It was good bro
I have concluded after this review of 3, that Anthony shops at Super Weenie Hut Jr&#39;s. Not amazing, but no way a 3 let&#39;s be honest
‘Yeah I thought your reviews were pretty good till I watched this, unsubscribe. Compared him to lil Xan fuck out of here.
Gotta disagree on this one too cheif
prob one of the best albums to throw on and spark a joint to
Sleep
Love you Melon 🍉💗💗💗💗
It&#39;s EASILY an 7.5/10<br>8.5/10 in my opinion<br>I am thoroughly confused on how anyone in the world can have such a detailed review with so many negative points about this album?? Not to mention, just a few of the many great aspects of &quot;SWIMMING&quot; are; Originality (because I mean come on let&#39;s be real,  the majority of trap rap/the popular category of rap and or hip hop sounds way too similar way too often and the lyrics are basically exchanged from different bars, to different parts in other songs, mixed around a little more, for all of the songs to be about one of three categories. Drugs, Money, and Women. What average, genuine, real human being can relate to that shit? It will never seize blowing my mind. I mean I understand some people enjoying the beats/party vibe/etc. aspect of trap while being at a party or whatever but, to sit here and tell me that hits you on a deeper emotional, where you relate to what they&#39;re saying, and just feel that shit deep in your soul then, I don&#39;t know, I guess I have some mental illness that I need to address or I&#39;m the dumb one... (;), The Progression and Maturity of an Artist (especially with Mac Miller, has been a real pleasure to watch. From his K.I.D.S. mixtape, to Watching Movies with the Sound Off, Faces, and now Swimming. I see his maturity grow in his lyrics from album to album. Yeah, certain projects will take one step forward, two steps back because no one is perfect but, the overall progression of his has been 100% real, genuine, and to be with someone you&#39;ve never met through their art, through certain phases of their life is a real pleasure. I mean if you enjoy the majority of what they do. As you can probably tell, Mac is one of the very few artists that I&#39;ve been with from the beginning and for the most part, I have very much enjoyed his work. Also, with myself being just one year younger than him, I can relate to him even that much more. I was 17 when KIDS came out and it was just high school kids doing high school shit. Having as much fun as you possibly can with your friends. To now, being an adult for 6+ years and having a certain individual making music that&#39;s very much relative to your life and not just about money, bitches, and drugs THE WHOLE TIME. For example, falling in love, death, addiction, failure, trauma, depression, anxiety, etc. That shit means so, so, so much more to me when I can RELATE TO IT on an emotional level.), Relativity in the Lyrics/Meaning (this really goes without saying, unless you don&#39;t understand basic English vocabulary, then yeah this is about to be a run-on sentence going no where. lol. Like I&#39;ve said before, maybe it&#39;s just me, maybe I&#39;m missing something, maybe I&#39;m right, maybe I&#39;m wrong, I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m just going to state what I believe from my mind and my heart because music means that much to me. I know there is trap songs, mainstream rappers, with thought-provoking, relative, genuine lyrics but, finding that genre and that artist together consistently is almost equivalent to finding a needle in a haystack in my opinion.) Now I have to say this, I&#39;m not hating on you or anyone and their opinion which you are more than entitled to. I guess what I&#39;m trying to get at is possibly, what are you or whoever reading this is searching for if you really think this album is a 3/10. Basically, saying this album is garbage. My mind is seriously blown twice in a row in a very short time span, knowing someone can genuinely have that as their opinion. hahaha. I believe after a 2nd or 3rd listen, truly giving it the chance it deserves, with a complete open mind, that the score would be raised quite drastically. Another quick thing to mention, I&#39;m not a biased Mac Miller fan, I&#39;ve tried following so many artists through the progression of their careers and Mac is one of the few still working that I follow, so I&#39;m a bit passionate about this dude&#39;s work. Wiz Khalifa, Tyler The Creator, MGK, ASAP Rocky and J. Cole is almost there (still on the fence with them), Schoolboy Q... I still heavily fuck with Mac Miller (obv), Earl Sweatshirt, Ab-Soul, and Da$h (with just a handful more not mentioned). I&#39;d like to end this rant with... In the end, what you believe is what you believer when it comes to art, music, etc. and that will lead you to your opinion if you wish to state/present it to whomever. I just simply wanted to clear up this huge misunderstanding and maybe possibly get some answers as to why someone would give this a score so low. I&#39;m not hating, some people review art, film, music, video games, electronics, and whatever for a living. So, it just presents itself to have obvious debates. I did bite my tongue from saying the typical YouTube hater vulgar language, and the &quot;I KNOW EVERYTHING, GOD GRANTED ME INFINITE WISDOM AND KNOWLEDGE OF EVERY SINGLE THING TO EVER BE ABSORBED BY THE HUMAN MIND, FOR JUST ME AND ONLY ME.&quot; Real ones know Mac is one of the best making music currently, and SWIMMING is a GREAT album. Definitely not perfect but, I am more than happy with this and will be for a long time to come. <br>COME BACK TO EARTH,<br><br><br>with that review dude...
Here the melon head is unfortunately really wrong. I couldn´t stand Mac Miller, never listened to him, but in my humble opinion  this is definitely <i>the</i> album of the summer 2018.
I don&#39;t get it man, this is the second time you&#39;ve just completely missed the point of a Mac Miller project... you said Devine Feminine was him sounding lovesick which was completely the opposite of the case, and here you miss the fact that the ENTIRE point of this album is that he is returning from a dark place. He was drowning, now he&#39;s swimming, and by the end he&#39;s out, and starting to get back on his feet, that&#39;s what the triumphant instrumentation at the end of So It Goes is about.<br><br>The album is supposed to sound melancholy because it&#39;s him working through a funk or depression. And Mac&#39;s beats are perfectly complementary to his rapping style, it&#39;s one of the best things about his last 3 projects has been impeccable beat selection.<br><br>I usually see some of what you&#39;re talking about in these reviews but you&#39;re dead wrong when it comes to Mac Miller, it feels like you just don&#39;t like mellow rap, I mean Astroboy was an entire album that might as well have been 3 songs as similar as everything was, and incredibly aesthetically boring, but it was high energy so I guess it&#39;s ok...<br><br>Next thing you&#39;re gonna tell me that Buddy&#39;s album wasn&#39;t FIRE.<br><br>The only thing you got right is that he&#39;s not a great singer, but he does ok in most cases.
This album was better than Astroworld, why you playing yourself?
Post Malone a 7 and this a 3..interesting.
Swimming is a great album
Wow this dude sucks at reviewing, this album was great. His opinion tho
This is a great album
LOL. 11k
Everything he&#39;s said about him is everything I&#39;ve had a problem with when it comes to Mac Miller
I disagree with, but respect your opinion.
This review seemed lazy like you didnt really want to review this album but your opinion is your opinion, my opinion is this is his most cohesive album with the way it was carried out through the whole album he&#39;s basically coming back from his self destruction and telling you how he feels and becoming a deeper artist this album in my opinion is some of his best work 2009 hit me hard because I have felt the same way before but the entire album is just cohesive I thought it was an 8/10 to me
No offense but you are a fucking idiot dude

Review “ Trial By Fire “ by Yelawolf
Man really made a traffic related pun in the first two minutes of this video and expects us to take him seriously.
YOURE TRASH<br>A ROTTEN MELON<br>DELETE THIS VIDEO<br>&gt;:O
This review is not a fair representation of Macs album. Previous reviews are just as biased and not very analytical. This guy is clearly anti Mac Miller, and can’t appreciate artist development, symbolism, or themes.
The only reason I can tell from this review, is that the only reason he doesn’t like this album is because of macs voice... which is weird? Because that would be like saying that bob Dylan is shit because his voice was horrendous... yet Bob Dylan is widely accepted as one of the best of all time? He gave Cudis album a 10, and as many comments stated... Cudi has beyond sub par vocals... and that got a 10? I’m addition to that, if we are on vocals... he just review Travis and YG and both are so auto tuned it sounds like vocals being thrown through a garbage disposal, and the messages is absolute shit. So vocals mean what to him??? I still can’t fathom how he gave Faces a 6, and good am a 7... faces was his best work, and was so incredibly well put together. This guy just hates Mac. This review is beyond biased and complete ass.
Everyone is entitled to there opinion but your wrong on this one, album is a banger
This why Shawn Cee better.
You don&#39;t feel the soul and just humanity in the album dude your lost
And that&#39;s a wrap on Fantano. Somewhere along the way he&#39;s totally lost his ear for Hip Hop. For further proof, see reviews of: Rejjie Snow - Annie, ASAP Rocky - Testing, J.Cole - KOD, and on the other end of the spectrum, Ye.  At least he got Denzel right though.
It&#39;s a good album to chill to but yeah, It does sound like Mac has water in his mouth on some of these songs
Lmaooo who pissed this fuck boy off?
Nonsense. Your ears are broken, this albums incredible.
Idk I think it&#39;s a great album, what&#39;s the use? is my favorite and I love self care, hurt feelings and 2009
Well damn, first time I saw melon head get more dislikes than likes, I think he knew what was coming to him.  Ha
This dude is dumb asf.
You&#39;re trippin
Ah man, I respect your opinion but I wholeheartedly disagree with it. You sure you didn&#39;t go in to this album with your mind made up?
I definitely don&#39;t like Mac&#39;s singing either. Shit is kinda trash.
3/10 seems a little harsh,  I kind of took the album showing his mental exhaustion and not really knowing what to do with himself. Thank you though, for giving your honest opinion on the album.
Are your ears retarted
Fantano hates white people.
yeah that&#39;s a no from me
This better be atleast a 8
lmao so many haters on this video mac miller sucks ass deal with it
so EFFORTLESSLY.
bro how do you delete someone elses video omg
A 3... a fucking 3 how about you go a review some songs from an anime because you clearly have no sense in music
I didn’t know he did reviews without listening to the album
I think he’s just trying to piss us off on purpose...this album was great
&quot;I&#39;m an early 20&#39;s white boy and I am TRIGGERED by this review&quot;
I couldn&#39;t disagree more with this, I thought Swimming was a perfect album for when you&#39;re in that kind of vibe
Ur wrong
MELON YOU TRIPPING
Had to shoot my nigga a like lmao, album was fucking boring as fuck
I’m really enjoying this shorter videos
c&#39;mon dude a 3 what the fuck.
You Mad This Album is Great.
I have to say I’m a Mac Miller fan and I personally like his voice.  Faces I consider a highlight of his career.  I liked this album though not as strong as his others like WMWTSO.  It’s definitely much better then a 3 if I’m being fair it’s a 6ish
You are ass and swimming is a masterpiece
I love Mac and I love Anthony. Gotta buy the album and give this video a like even if it contradicts everything I know
You&#39;re wrong
7/10 <br>i liked it
Thought the same but the album grew on me
But he never runs out of jet fuel...
He hates on Mac so unnecessarily... The divine feminine was a masterpiece, and swimming is groovy af
effortlessly
DUDE!!! EVERYTHING SOUNDS SO MONOTONE! and bland :&#39;( GO:OD AM was mac miller&#39;s peak
Yeah you wrong on this one....
what
First review I disagree with
If I ain&#39;t in your top 10, you a racist (Mac Miller, 2014).
You are wrong. This album is fire.
fuck you
I agree
He&#39;s making the music that he wants, I&#39;ve never heard such a close minded person reviewing music.
I feel like you let his bad songs bring him down a lot more then his good songs bring him up. <br><br>Thought, I see your critisism is mostly on the album experience, so I respect that opinion/rating. <br><br>I def skip some songs, but the bangers are dope as hell. There are some hard 1s on the album, and some hard 10s.
i actually enjoyed this album.
agreed swimming was awful
bro i listened to travis scott album for 2 days straight then i put yhis on and fell right to sleep.albums like nyquil
It&#39;s really not that bad, I&#39;m sorry. Like, I literally can&#39;t even understand where you&#39;re coming from with this. I&#39;m actually just confused. The album, especially the singing, are just not as apparently bad as you make them out to be.<br><br>I mean, I know you don&#39;t give a shit about other critics&#39; opinions for the most part, but damn nigga this shit has a 78 on Metacritic for a reason.
you know mac saw this review good job melon
fuck this guy
I give this reviewer 0/10
This ain’t it ..
LMAO look at the dislike ratio. U wrong this time Melon
i respect your opinion, but its wrong.
Couldn’t disagree more
Critique the night Lovell album red teenager melody
Nice try to edit your mistakes in the video lpl
Totally disagree man
I want to like your reviews but almost 85% of the time they’re complete ass..
Yeah hate to say it but ever since watching movies he just keeps getting worse with each album.
Really just seems like you get paid to be a “critical” critic of albums after listening once or twice. I don’t understand how you can review any album after 1 or 2 listens.
I find it funny how many guys complain when stans complain about him disliking a female or pop artist album and it’s “his opinion” but when he dislikes a male rapper’s album, it’s immediately a problem. Lmaoo the double standards.
You should do a review on Ace Hood: Trust the Process and/or TTP2. Ace mad slept on and they are two great albums/mixtapes.
When he said &quot;Ohthony Notano&quot; I&#39;m like uh-oh
Great album, I can&#39;t understand ur opinion
Fuck you.
Why is everyone so butthurt? Mac Miller is trash and is irrelevant for good reason.
back for your neck boyyy
sometimes you really have some shitty oppinons
I’m not going to even going to watch this based on the comments. Mac Miller has transcended his beginnings, why do I even want to know what the busiest music hater has to say anymore?!
Horrible and I haven’t even watched yet 3/10 whaaaaaaaaaaaat
oldheads seething LOL
I kind of get what you say but idk, this album hited me so hard no idea why
How does this panzy fuck have 1.5M subs.
This review... its uhh...<br><br><br>NOT GOOD
This was my first and last time watching his review<br>3/10!!! I guess most people don&#39;t really have a soul these days 😯😯😯 you did Mac an injustice there,<br>That album was an easy 7 or 8 imo.
Everyone hated WMWSO when it dropped too, mac is constantly dropping music before it&#39;s time
you have to be sad to enjoy this album tbh
I understand its your opinion, but your opinion is wrong. This album is a bop bruh. One of Mac’s (and 2018) best album.
Fuckkk you
i dozed off twice listening to it
It feels like you came into this album with a negative opinion already, and didn’t really give it a chance. The quick review that bounces around without actually going in-depth about it kinda shows. Idk man, I thought this album was pretty good.
Wow this is disrespectful lol
Can’t be right about every review
THIS MUSIC CRITIC HAS AN OPINION ON AN ALBUM THAT DIFFERS FROM MINE!!!! GRAB YOUR PITCHFORKS EVERYONE
It’s a no from me
beautiful day for a big buzz buzz
Best Mac project to date is between FACES and MACADELIC
There’s a reason why you have twice as many downvotes as upvotes. Maybe listen to it again man. I respect your opinion when it comes to these album reviews, but I think you missed to mark on this one
Melon looks like he needs some sleep in this review
completely agree with you, although a 3 is a little harsh. i wouldve gave it a 4 or a light 5
yet again anthony giving good unique albums shit reviews while giving mumble rap generic beat fetish bullshit 8/10&#39;s. This album was an easy 7/10, and for me personally a 9.
Ur my boy but youve also never been more wrong about anything i wish i could downvote you twice on this one
This was a garbage review
this guy is trash
for the time being, this is my favorite mac miller album.
Where is Rolling Papers 2
He’s right doe. What the fuck are people getting on him about?
You suck
Bitch wtf is this ????? Are you serious ??????????????
damn i thought it was a good album what the heck melon
Yeahhhh. I know everyone is entitled to their own opinion...but yours is just not right here.
I disagree with you, Melon. That is all.
Channel’s a decent 3 tbh
Bruh
Thanks for trying to convince me that I don&#39;t like hearing Mac Miller&#39;s singing voice. Do you consult vocal experts or is this from your musical training? I feel like you don&#39;t even know what to enjoy anymore. Or if you enjoy anything.
Fair enough it&#39;s your opinion but this album for me was beautiful. lyrically amazing. His flow was brilliant. Production was smooth. All in all a good listen which touched home.
Yeah ant man, idk about this one. Plus a 3 is unfairly LOW. This album definitely takes a minute to grow on you. Try and give it a few relistens in a week and you&#39;ll wanna take this back I promise. Small World, 2009, What&#39;s The Use, Jet Fuel. They painted a nice little headspace of where he&#39;s coming from right now. I think Mac is sounding better than ever, you just gotta let it simmer
I honestly really liked it in some parts, I loved the beats and they were almost jazzy at times which I thought was really cool. His singing was agreeable, in the sense that it was pretty bad, but his flow stays good and some of the songs I thought were beautiful.
I think it’s at least a 5 probably higher
making fun of his vocals like cudi isnt a legend
My guy.......you lacking on this review, love you though.
i liked the album for the reason that it puts me in a lethargic mood
You hate everything he drops lol
Loved the album
Enough dislikes will make him change his opinion
This ain’t it chief
L
Lmao dislikes more than likes lol take that L
For once I really disagree with you, this album is beautiful to my ears. You are correct about the maturity aspect, I just think he&#39;s getting better. And his singing is not great but I dont think it&#39;s bad either. I think the only song I don&#39;t like on this album is what&#39;s the use
Will you review “Life’s a Trip”?
Lol Mac Miller fans in 2018. Let this guy get wiped off Hip Hop. His music has been boring ever since he stopped trying to appeal to high school teens. He sucks now, move on. If you&#39;re a Mac fan in 2018, fuck off.
i thought this album was like a solid 6. i kinda like his moody tone, and some of the moody beats. i also like the slightly more hyped up beats, like on Ladders. his vocals are kinda weak at points, and some of his beats dont work, but thats about it.
I disagree with your opinion but I respect it nonetheless. Some people in this comment section don&#39;t understand, but if you genuinely don&#39;t like an album you genuinely don&#39;t like an album. I don&#39;t think Anthony is going to listen a few more times and have a revelation, and that&#39;s ok. He&#39;s not giving the cosmic rating on this album, he&#39;s speaking his mind.
Nah, I love you melon, but this really ain’t it.
haha nice dub over there at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgwPxFUUg94&amp;t=112">1:52</a> &quot;Effortlessly&quot; you cheeky guy. Had to double check to make sure I wasn&#39;t tripping
Love you anthony🖤
at least a seven, a strong 8 in my opinion
Man I had no idea Mac fans were so annoying<br><br>This album is average at best yo
Let us know how bad Trippie Redds album “Life’s a Trip”.
Wish I could double the likes on this video
I give this review a 1/10
This and the Carters review were misses, IMO, but that&#39;s why they r opinions
Yeah your sleeping on this album melon boy
😒 no. This album was good.
Change your name to Contrarian.
Who gave this idiot a camera?
I disagree
Yikes that was a little intense on a album that really wasnt bad for me I really enjoyed this album not his best but not bad really but a 3?
Oof
The instrumentals didn&#39;t grab me on first listen but I gave it 3 plays and began to dig the groove.. I think he&#39;s out of touch and OBVIOUSLY only listens to records once and makes a full review based on initial listen
Fantano was that kid in school who got bullied once for getting an answer wrong in Math class.
Mac miller is asssssss
He did this strategically to motivate Mac
Opinions are like assholes, everyone has one and Anthony&#39;s always disappoints
bruh you fucking crazy to give it a 3
The like to dislike ratio on this is scary. I guess that’s what you get for being a critic.
I really enjoyed the album, I think expecting this album to be exciting is sort of like expecting a kanye album to be mellow. There are so many beautiful songs on this album that I can&#39;t understand such a low score. There are weaker tracks but overall I thought this was a well put together album and enjoyed it immensely because of how mellow it it.
Not gonna say shit, but i disagree with your score.
Stop all dis white on white hate
I know this a subjective review and all....but you just wrong, Melthony Ontano, this album slaps
MBDTF minus 3/10
nawh.
Is this serious?
I’ve never been a fan of Mac Miller but The Divine Feminine is one of my favorite album of 2016. In my opinion Swimming is not as good but it’s better than a 3 lol
someone&#39;s salty as fuck lol.
Did any audio nerds catch Anthony Dub his voice saying &#39;Effortlessly&#39; at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgwPxFUUg94&amp;t=111">1:51</a> ?
Lol Mac Miller sucks, why is everyone surprised now?
Fuck this score, Shawn Cee gave it a 6 which I think is fair. Anthony only got one pair of eyes jus sayin
Everybody knows this album is a masterpiece. Mac is to deep. Look at them dislikes breh lol
Hurt feelings was a dope song but havent listened to the whole album yet
Emotional Heat 4A Cold Generation by JIL, a NYC psychedelic electronic soul group
This and Divine Fem are both great albums in my opinion.
Kanye West is my favorite artist and you gave Ye a 8 and this a 3? This album is better than Ye.
I disagree. I completely vibe with the entire album. It is definitely one of the most underrated albums of 2018.
Nooo Sir.
Im not a music critic. But I personally enjoyed and connected heavily with the album.
Listen to this album from the perspective of a person going through times. It will blow your mind.
It may be objectively bad but I find his singing weirdly bad enough to be interesting. I also think that &quot;emotionally vacant&quot; is exactly what I like from this album. My favorite albums of his have this sort of apathetic and distant feel to them. Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;m attached to the artist but I really love this album. Much better than Good AM and Divine Feminine.
GTFO. That&#39;s definetely top 5 2018.  Biased AF.
im not mad, just very disappointed
How you gonna rate Astroworld so much better than this? Like they are both average but come on.
godamn, people be disliking for his opinion and a very valid and backed up one at that.
This guy has never went through what hes going through.. When he does, he&#39;ll appreciate it.
that was harsh but you’re kinda right lol mac fell off
This review is a W
Did he even listen to the album...??
I agree 100%! Don&#39;t listen to them melon! 🤣
I hoped more from you...
Alright, I guess I gotta respect your opinion like I&#39;d hope you respect mine. With that being said I think you really trashed on this album like you have on the Devine Feminine. I know you don&#39;t just listen to an album once and give it a score, but you should try and give it another shot, this time keeping in mind what Mac has been through and what he&#39;s trying to say in conjunction with what The Devine Feminine was about.
Wowwwww. Wowwww. This review is bad.
That Moment when Anthony gets BTFO by his viewers
bruhhhh this shit got me triggered
Yikes
Naa this review is not it
Lmao “underwhelming instrumentals” Am I the only one who thinks those are his strongest asset ?
half baked review
mac could have featured artists with better singing voices if he wanted to, but the album is supposed to be raw, emotional, personal, and real. Pay attention to his message and focus less on petty things like &quot;i dont dig his singing voice.&quot; This is a shallow review. Mac is easily one of the best lyricists in the game and that is what should be focused on.
&quot;This guy&#39;s head is smaaaaaall, sike it aint&quot;  &quot;he can suck my baaaaalls, till he faints&quot;
I 100% disagree but i still love you.
Horrible review.
Seems like the word &quot;boring&quot; for you people just means &quot;not fast, not loud, and not obnoxious&quot; <br>Not everything has to be in your face over trap beats about blowing money, doing drugs and fucking bitches.  69, yatchy, and uzi vert aren&#39;t &quot;boring&quot; but they still suck ass and cant play actual instruments.  They arent boring but they&#39;ll never last as long as &quot;&quot;boring&quot;&quot; people like mac miller, j cole and logic...so i really dont understand the internet when it comes to describing differently types of music.
Mac Miller Stinks. I guess I&#39;ll be on of your few &quot;likes&quot; melon
WTF
Mac Miller has never been good, soooooo ya
How the fuck do you like astroworld and not like this?? This sounds like what a review for astroworld should’ve been.
Album was great melon just has shitty taste
Ok but Astro world should’ve got a 3/10 too
mac miller is trash lol
Yikes, i actually really like this whole project lmao <b>shrugs</b>
Y’all know this is his own opinion, right?
7/10 for me
This dude routinely slurps up anything Brockhampton drops (BH is flames don’t get it twisted), but the guy who they stole a huge part of their sound from drops an amazing RAP album and he gives it 3/10 lmaoooooo ok pal
All the white people who&#39;s favorite rapper is Mac triggered hahahha
This isn&#39;t even a review this is just hate.  If you&#39;re going to criticize music at least be constructive. 0/10 Review. Unsubscribed.
I miss agreeing with the melon.
yeah well, it&#39;s just ur opinion, right?
I almost always disagree with the Melon, but this time I disagreed so much... that I decided to subscribe
Damn a red shirt and only 5 minutes of a review? Mac Miller is a more passionate artist and deserves more than this Melon.
Nah
I disagree with this review. Your opinion does not affect mine.
You&#39;re insane
Please review Trippie Redd&#39;s album.
this album is good bye
I love Mac Miller. I have a Mac Miller tattoo for fucks sake. But this album sucks. Programs was the best track, and it didn&#39;t even make the cut. I&#39;m so disappointed. Mac you are a rapper. Stick to your day job. Larry Lovestein should be an after school activity, not the paycheck. Sheesh. I miss WMWTSO and Faces and GOOD:AM looked like he was really making progress in the right direction, and then DF I gave him a pass cause there were a handful of decent tracks. But this. BUT THIS. damn.
Bruv, fantano is lost
This along with blackface and MBDTF will be his most hated reviews because they are straight up inaccurate. I know it&#39;s opinion but he really overlooked those albums
You’re smoking rock, this is tied for best album I’ve heard this year, streamlined, beautiful Sonics, confidant flow, you’re full of nonsense right now. Easy 8
all the girls that have mac miller tattoos plz hold this L
I’m convinced that he doesn’t like anything considered “chill” or more “straightforward”. Not enough noise for him.
Your opinion is wrong. <br><br><br>Is this a publicity stunt?
Totally agree. This album was complete trash. Mac didn’t go hard once and the beats are completely bland and boring. I wish Mac would actually try rapping again. The dude is not a good singer and needs to realize it.
Did he just compare MAC to......???? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgwPxFUUg94&amp;t=165">2:45</a>
Review Life’s a Trip melon gimp
A three is a bit exaggerated but I hate this album it all just blends together as a bunch of boring schlock also I&#39;d like to point out that he literally says &quot; Y&#39;all know this is just my opinion, right?&quot; its at the bottom of every description ppl its not a fact that this is a good or bad album, tis subject to opinion just like any other
I was feeling a 6 or 7. A 3? Cmon now
Id call this 7/10. Idk what melon talking about
Do people really take this person seriously?! <br>It’s like he has beef with mac miller.. his opinions aren’t backed up by anything. <br>Whatever reputation he had before shouldn’t exist now.
Yeah no this is an L.
Honestly I think anthony just hates slow and chilled music? Might be wrong but he always seems to call songs that aren&#39;t trap bangers &quot;boring&quot;
It was a trash album why is this getting so much hate?
RIP Mac Miller, the Melon strikes again
<b>Melons can&#39;t swim</b>
Hey Melon.  I really enjoy the album, but at the same time I have been listening to Mac since KIDS and have liked most everything he has put out (besides Delusional Thomas).  Whatever Mac puts out, I will find a way to like.  The album comes across similarly to Ye in a way for me, because there is a very personal attitude reflecting Mac&#39;s journey back into some type of balance in his life.  For Mac lovers, they are really going to appreciate this theme, but if you don&#39;t much care, then it is a sleepy, boring album for you and I get that.  Similar to Ye: it is very much about Kanye&#39;s personal struggles and who he is as a person, but as Melon has said, it is going to be overlooked by many who aren&#39;t diehard Kanye fans.  IMPORTANT:  Ye is way better than this album, I am not comparing them on any level other than the way the artists express and explore themselves. Thanks for the content Melon
It was supposed to be spacey and bland. Look at all the white on the album
As Calcucesta would say &quot;Re-Reveiw&quot;
It’s a Mac miller album guys calm down
Review the Tyga album
So his singing in self care is cool during your weekly track round up and has you excited for the album but then when you hear it again it sucks???
&lt;— me jamming out to macs swimming album cuz it’s that GREAT
are you fucking kidding me melon
I’m sorry, but Mac hasn’t been good for years... Watching Movies, and Faces are really the only 2 good projects he’s dropped. faces for me being a classic mixtape and one of my favorite mixtapes of all time but everything else is boring and not worth more than 1 listen....
Look at that ratio, 3 is a generous score for this thing
So many salty people. Drake stans weren&#39;t this salty with Drake&#39;s album review.
This: ain’t it chief
What did Mac do to you my guy ? Did he touch you ? Piss in your cereal? Sleep with your girl ???  You seem mad for some reason
Sorry Melon. You missed the ball on this one. This is a fantastic record
Bad review, 8/10 fuck you melon
Heavy criticism from this giant man baby.
My man Anthony Bullshitano stop get some help
Can we pls talk about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgwPxFUUg94&amp;t=112">1:52</a> and why there is suddenly a like of reverb. Whole video sounds like it&#39;s recorded in a bathroom except that snippet.
Honestly this guy is biased against Mac
I hate that you define an artist by their strenghts and say oh well thats what they should focus on. Artists grow and want to evolve, musically mac probably doesnt wanna rap as hard as he used to. Thats why hes attempting now to make that transition into r&amp;b because its what hes into. You shouldn&#39;t stone him for making the music he wants to make just cuz it doesnt go over well with you
subbed just to unsub
so it goes beat was so refreshing what are you talking about?!?!?
I had a lot of respect for you until now
I give this review a strong 1 big fella
Are you kidding me?
You can&#39;t give this a 3 but praise Joji&#39;s vocals every two fucking seconds.
issa opinion
Fader:  <b>we got em boys</b>
personally really enjoyed the new album
Did him dirty like Saba 😂😂😂
This is a lot better than you give it credit for!
This album was awful I absolutely agree, why is everyone so butthurt
Yup
Mac Millers always been bad on god
This was definitely at least a 6/10
alright its time for queen.
Well... I would kindly have to disagree sir. I believe the truth behind your dislike is in the sound and tone of Mac&#39;s voice, because to me it most definitely has a unique and interesting quality. He carried this album SO well and will be making my top 5 list of albums this year. To call it blasé is quite strange, as how can an album so blasé keep listeners coming back for more whilst thoroughly enjoying it?
Boo you stink
&quot;Traumatically boring&quot; LOL
review new nicki minaj album, Queen. hopefully the rating score will predicted 5/10 or 6/10.
Fuck off.
I&#39;m just glad Testing has a higher score
Everything before the word but is horse shit.
You’re smoking crack man
It was ok imo. 6/10
“Overall, I didn’t really care for this album at all”<br><br>He sums it up as if he didn’t just shit on the album the entire video lmao
I didn&#39;t even listen to the album or Fantano&#39;s review, but if Pitchfork gave a higher score (4.5 points higher) on a pop/rap album, something&#39;s up LUL.
This album is trash but I disliked simply because of the ratio
Well imagine Mac Miller on tour singing like this then you&#39;ll understand what&#39;s wrong
lol tysm for giving this album a bad review
Nothing makes me happier than guessing through the entire video what Anthony will rate the album and getting it right at the end
Listen to it relaxed, sitting back while it&#39;s playing on a stereo system
The dislikes speak more than the comments do. I thought this was a 7/10
Well I have definitely enjoyed this record more than I thought. It was my first Mac Miller record I&#39;ve heard. I really enjoyed it. Understandable why you didn&#39;t enjoy it. I thought all the instrumentals were 10/10 but I can understand why you might not like the singing. You listen to a lot of this kind of music so maybe you wont feel as fresh as it does to me. All in all, it was a good honest review from you. Thumbs up.
gotta say he bores me as well
Swimming Was swimming in Shit<br>While this Video is swimming in Dislikes.
I thoroughly enjoyed this review lol 😂
Hm. Something bad happened here
COMPLETHONY WRONGTANO
Disliked after I saw the number of dislikes
I thought this album was fucking fire.
true, the album is trash
Lol another dope artist Fantano dislikes for no apparent reason. You didn’t approach this project with fresh ears and it’s apparent.
This guy is smoking dust , this album is slept on heavy! He gotta good album here, I like this better than Travis Scott.
I’m I the only one who didn’t like this album at all.? Or I’m I crazy like Anthony?
Idk why people disagree so much with this review, like I have disagreed with mr melon but like this album was actually so boring and Mac can’t sing. It wasn’t a good album
I have a habit of checking the score in the description before the video even starts. Sorry :((
<b>rereviews in a rereview video</b>
Has he ever dropped a worse review than this?
Once again, melon and I definitely have different taste in music, if this is a three. But keep up the good work, I guess?
Boo
WORST TO BEST: Black Lips
My guy likes to call himself a music nerd but can’t even properly explain  signal processing or complex composition. all I hear is Anthony trying too hard to impress himself talking about “execution” and how it isn’t there. gtfo
Is everything okay at home?
He&#39;s not wrong
I&#39;m commenting again because this is just so wrong and I&#39;m gonna need you to retract this immediately
Eh, I don&#39;t really agree with your reasoning for the score. I imo it&#39;s a 7 at worst, and a low 8 at best. It has its flaws for sure, but the production is what makes this album. It&#39;s extremely well produced and the somber music clashes well with the funk, which is an odd combination, and yet it flows.<br><br>It isn&#39;t exciting or bombastic, and the lack of features hurts the replay value but it&#39;s pretty cool.
The beat on &#39;What&#39;s the Use?&#39; is maybe the best beat I&#39;ve heard all year! Dam-Funk meets Pomo with a Thundercat bassline is something I thought I could only dream up. You missin&#39; the plot.
This was easily the best drop of August 3rd this shit was absolute flames . This shit was mad crazy beats , flow and lyrics .
Jesus Christ people! Let the man have his opinion! If you like the album, good for you. But that’s not a good reason for actively hating on this video because he doesn’t validate your fucking opinion. No one is right or wrong. Seriously people, grow up!
I’m bout to go to Shawn Cee for all my music reviews, at least you see him giving the albums a chance. Easily a top ten hip hop album this year. How many times did you listen to this album once? You just hatin on Mac bro that’s all it comes down to. Much more reputable sources of music review pretty much unanimously gave the album 4/5, a B rating, 7/10. So you fucked up on this one melon head at least some music critics don’t live up their bald ass heads and shove me up their asses while they’re listening to albums. Watch him give nicki Minaj’s album a 7/10 even though over half her songs are gonna be about her ass. You’re starting to lose touch bro beans
Bruh, absolutely not. This is just incorrect. I&#39;m angry with you man, I&#39;m upset
I don’t agree with this at all
That like to dislike ratio is tough
This ain’t it chief
this album was mad boring
For Christ sake, review Nipsey Hustle&#39;s &quot;Victory Lap&quot;
death grips new album waaaaaay worse than this
Biasthy Nopetano. Respect and mostly agree with 90% of your material, but i think you swung and miss on this one. Its really hard for me to wrap my head around the fact that you rated this so poorly compared to how you rated Astroworld in the same time frame. It seems that you’re taking a dive into the mainstream. And that is lame, Melonhead.
you are incorrect
Just wrong
Stop reviewing rap bro 😂
Great review mac miller is straight ass 😂😂
hes gotta be trolling
I disagree. Still love you tho
Astroworld got a 7 while Swimming got a 3?!
really 3/10 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
You are really far off on this one man. This album was great I have no idea why you hate on Mac so much.
This album was boring.  What made Mac a viral success in the first place was how upbeat and fun his music was.  If he came out with an album of songs like Programs, it would have been way better to balance out the lifeless monotony of his Ariana Grande album
Some decent songs, some not decent songs. 6.5/10.
We needed a whole album of songs like Programs
That’s quite a dislike ratio. Oof
Yet deth grips gets a “10”
You gotta listen to the lyrics of this album robothony sheeptano just like majority of this summers big albums. Have a great week 🤙
How can you disrespect someone with real music, melodies and lyrics and then praise Travis Scott who never says anything on any song, has nothing insightful to say and uses auto tune nonstop, you are contributing to the downfall of hip-hop music
I have a question mr. fantano. Do you give albums another listen for leisure or just to hear it again even if you did not enjoy it or do you listen to it and just not listen to it again?
this review made my stummy hurt
Take the L with this one Melon. This album hella smooth and hella good. Light 7/10.
Ouch
kinda agree w this 🙃🙃🙃
Sorry dude idk what you were listening to. horrible review man
White people mad as fuck about this score lol
This aint it... L
I didnt know Mac Miller had stans like that
NEPHEW DELETE THIS
Easy 8/10 u don’t get hoes that’s why you can’t relate.
this album was good mann. macs talented not one noted
Delete this video.
Worst thing I ever saw and I didnt even watch it.
Again I disagree with Anthony on an album I enjoy
stick to memes...nerd
Something tells me you don&#39;t know how to swim buddy
yeah. you&#39;re wrong
Maybe Fantano didn&#39;t like this one, but it&#39;s definitely a better album that The Divine Feminine. This should be at least a 5.
What music do you listen to when you workout
It&#39;s his opinion, why yall so mad? Yall came here for a review
Guess what? I&#39;m not listening to music that&#39;s not made for me. That means most hip hop....  The &quot;N&quot; word is used so often.... it&#39;s bad for ears from outside the culture..... it&#39;s toxic actually.
Now I am in no way commenting this because I like the album a lot, but I genuinely feel this is one of your laziest reviews. To the way you bounce around talking about the different tracks to your very vague explanations of why you don&#39;t like the songs, I think you could&#39;ve spent an extra minute or 2 to refine your own thoughts.
ain’t nothing decent about a 3
No
from since melon does not hope i&#39;m doing well?
I disliked the album because of his dirty ass feet on the cover
The red flannel of death uh oh
I actually agreed with melon and thought it was trash don&#39;t @ me
I loved the tiny desk concert. It was amazing. The album is slightly over produced. 3/10? Wtf. The Melon is off this year.
This is the equivalent of me reviewing mayonaise, I fucking hate it and i&#39;m not open minded to it, why do you need my opinion on it?
gotta love how people say the review is bad as soon as they disagree with him.
How is this worse than DAMN
The worst tragedy since the MBDTF review
i know its like opinions or whatever but i honestly cant see how people think this is worse than astroworld. astroworld is a hypebeast album lol like its like cool at best and i love travis
Bro white people so triggered you gave this a bad review lmao chill out and go listen to some Russ
Saltony fantanal, u missed the point completely
This video was a weak 3
Imagine getting legitimately triggered over a music review
Awful
didn&#39;t mention the expansive production quality that went into this :/ fuckin sounds so good man
I liked this album
Cant wait for the Nicki Review
I agree with all your points but I don’t think it justifies a 3 it should be around a 5.
I feel like you before you listened to this project you already had a preconceived notion of what is was going to sound like therefore nothing was going to impress you. And comparing Mac to Lil Xan!?! Blasphemous
3/10 really
There are some real weanies down here. My condolences on the comments, Anthony.
Mac sucks such a boring album
Blasphony Sintano reporting today, evilly condemning this angelic masterpiece of art as a 03/10?! Shame, Shame, Shame! More like 03.00/03.10<br>Disliked; will check back in 6-12 months when the Real Anthony gives his &quot;at Second Listen Review&quot;. [I still love &amp; agree with 95% of your stuff.].
Boooooo
Well this is a really bad review
<b>sees red flannel thumbnail</b><br>oh boy<br><b>sees like to dislike ratio</b><br>OH BOY<br><b>checks score and reads comments</b><br>O H B O Y
god you’re such a dumbfuck
This man on crack, swimming betta than astro
@theneedledrop sir u r a complete moron sorry not sorry i don’t believe you should even be reviewing music if you can’t appreciate good music that is meant to be for people to vibe with it’s obviously different and meant to be mac evolving just like any other artist does such as donald glover and a more serious and obvious bon iver change is good but this album is great so there’s my 2 cents ya bum . <br>p.s. furthermore the fact that u rated astroworld higher than swimming shows that you’re not musically gifted nor intelligent good day sir .
This album was trash
3?? Wtf
Mac mumbles when he sings on this album. I give it a sleep/10
I expected a bad review from the melon man but this was a suprise
THIS AINT IT CHEIF. <br><br>I was feelin a strong 7-8 but whatev
At least I’m not the only one here that actually enjoyed this album haha
&quot;Farty&quot;
Eh dude like I think your music knwolwgde has degraded
Swimming was better than Astroworld. Like if you agree
is that a SUB 4 review score I see? good on ya Anthony, glad to see that it wasn&#39;t a NOT GOOD.
100% disagree. This album was fire.
i love you melon but i really dont think you gave it a chance. i like how youre not afraid to go against the majority of other reviewers but your points on this album just dont resonate at all.
YOU’RE WRONG MELON YOU’RE WRONG😡😡😡
I don&#39;t agree but I&#39;m not gonna dislike. I respect your opinion but honestly I love the album I gave it a 7.
Further proof this guy has no clue what he&#39;s talking about. Why is he so popular?
I feel like people still don&#39;t understand the fact that this is all his opinion. You can be mad, happy, or etc, but it is his opinion

wth.. can&#39;t rlly trust ur opinion anymore after this one :/
Hmm the best rap album since illmatic? Thats a no chief
Whoa dislikes!
i give this review a light to decent 1
this might be the worst take ever lmao
damn a three i would give it a good 5 at least but 6 might be asking to much
damn lol
oh dear :(
Where’s that nostrum grocers review
damn man this was at least a 6
Damn I disagreed with his review but the dislikes are not necessary. He gave his opinion on it and that’s his job. Not every one of his opinions is gonna match yours.
I just realized Anthony cuts every time he pushes up his glasses and now I can’t unsee it
i agree with mr. fantano
Review “Another Light” by Red Vox
Mac Miller fans are literally retarded.
homie didn&#39;t put shoes on before taking the album cover, nobody needs to see them dirty ass feet. 3/10 is deserved.
Review Queen
Melon Miller
Dropped the ball on yet another one. 10/10
Mac miller hasn’t made a good song since like 2014
I only enjoyed a handful of songs on the album but I don’t think it should get a 3. I was expecting it to get a 5 at least. I personally would have given it a decent 6.
Melon head
Wheres the IglooGhost review
Never got the whole mac miller meme. Mediocre at best and have been since his start. Expected rate for this talent-less hack.
This album is actually pretty good and deserves a 6/10 in my book.
Angry Melon
full of shit
Mac Millers tiny desk tho 10/10
Yo. Sir melon head. I knew you was a clown from the day Royce dropped and you refused to review him. Then refused to give him shade in your yuno review segment. But shitting on Mac also just proves it. I hope you enjoyed your following because all that water in your melon head is clearly fucking with your brain.
Yeah I didn&#39;t really like this he Sang way too much
Wow melon I get you didnt like the album but when you said Mac Miller is the human form of diabetes that was uncalled for...
this has got to be the worst trade deal in the history of trade deals
Meh. Don&#39;t agree with yah. But it&#39;s what it is.
Did we even listen to the same album Anthony?!  I gave this a 7.5
yikes
oof
Wrongtano should look at the comments the people b lovin this shit
YOURE A FUCKING IDIOT
Mac Miller - Swimming Redux review now.
this rlly ain’t it :/
Melon breath. Review the new Louis Cole.
I see red flannel I dislike.
People are angry about the rating you gave him, and I agree it wasn&#39;t at all what the album deserved, but I feel that&#39;s a silly thing to be angry about. What is reasonable to be angry about, however, is how poorly articulated the reasoning is. This was a weak review. Give the album another listen.
He&#39;s kinda right, macs latest projects have been bland asf. Atleast GOOD:AM had some bangers and originality.
Didn’t know opinions could be wrong until now
This is actually a great fucking album, so
Why so mad<br> it&#39;s review<br>Hé dont like<br>Its oh kay
Anthony Fantano can&#39;t swim confirmed
Look up the artist Dax
Damn I really didn’t like this either and thought you were gonna change my mind
You’re wrong
Wow. Seriously convinced he’s listening to a different album
Sorry man this just feels like you didnt listen to the same record as me
I love it when the melon has a spicy opinion on an album that idgaf about
hahaha miller fanboys triggered as fuck
I do strongly disagree with this review
Gosh dang. I came here to have someone agree with my own opinion NOT to hear someone else. I disliked this video because you don&#39;t think like me
Fantano mad because Mac has a hairline
top ten album this year..
It’s funny, because I thought of Tyler, the Creator’s maturation when listening to this album, too. I get where Mac’s trying to go, but Swimming was blasé. I don’t feel like there were any truly interesting, fresh moments like on Flower Boy. But...I did love Mac’s recent Tiny Desk.
Mac Miller ain&#39;t &quot;creaking&quot; his way through his verses like Lil Xan...
dude he really didn&#39;t even sing that much on this album. what are you talking about? lmao. you said literally a single sentence about the actual rapping, on a rap album. wut...
You have shocked me lately with your surprisingly accurate reviews of travis, denzel curry, YG, kanyes album&#39;s and many more but I have convinced myself this one is just for fun because this is a great album
You’re bugging I love this album. It’s meant to be mellow and chill
why did you need to dub &quot;effortlessly&quot; 🤔
<b>WRONG</b>
delete this review
Fantano on that crack again
He says it’s just my opinion but a lot of people take what he says to base their own. You gotta understand what kind of power you have. You can’t tell me this album is shit with those weak points
Mannnnn cmonnnn
Review the new ski mask the slump god ep called archive
I agree. Honestly this album bored me. Yes it could be that I&#39;m not a Mac fan but I gave it a fair shake.  However in the most case the instrumentals felt dull and Mac genuinely didn&#39;t interest with only a few high points
Love you. Hate the review...
You should revisit this in a couple years and give it a one
I used to really enjoy your reviews because they came off as genuine and well thought out. You came off as nothing but snobby, egotistical, and lazy with this review. I couldn&#39;t even tell if you actually listened to the full album??? Sorry man you lost my subscribe. Hope you figure out how to do things better.
here we go again
You can tell by the way you reviewed this that his music just isn’t for you. You could’ve said that instead of dumbing down his music or album. The record is amazing it just wasn’t for Anthony at all
&quot;Effortless&quot;
I love seeing all the pissed off comments
Good video, unique perspective. I personally give it a 4. Not his best work imo.<br><br>Some of these commenters need to not take his reviews so seriously and/or as a personal attack on them or the artist in question.<br><br>You&#39;re allowed to disagree without making a scene over it.
Oh my fucking God have i never disagreed so hard with egg
That&#39;s gonna be a no for me dawg
you are lame melon , stop trying to be music god
If Lilliam Pumpernickel released this exact same album you&#39;d give him at least a 7/10. Racism.
lol i knew he gave it a low score within the first 4 seconds of the video. &quot;ohthony notano&quot;.  well if this album isnt good then im off to go bump astroworld for like the 9th time.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgwPxFUUg94&amp;t=255">4:15</a> sounds like you had expectations for Mac that he didn’t meet so you just don’t like the work because he didn’t sound the way YOU wanted him to.
boy if you DONT
Great review
you always go hard on mac man...
<b>effortlessly</b>
you&#39;re back in the dog house melon
Torture chamber? Nazithony Germtano
I think the likes and dislikes on this review speaks for itself. Love this guys reviews but he&#39;s wide of the mark on this one. It&#39;s a heartfelt, emotionally raw album. Fantastic album.
Anthony your opinion is NOT GOOD.
mac miller is good
nb4 he kill himself
I thought I was the only one that felt this way about this horrible album
Everybody still sleeping on Taylor Bennett tho
You&#39;re just mad because he&#39;s got his bare footsies on the cover aren&#39;t you fantano ; o)
Damn that was harsh, I thought it was just as good as Astroworld, where Astroworld was the peak of hallucinations, SWIMMING was deepest point of the comedown. This review kinda sucked.
FucK your opinion
This review is a strong 4 to a light 5, not the best cadence and not  displaying a Lil B cd instead of a vinyl is in poor taste
Worst review you have made this is a great album
It&#39;s his opinion how do people say &quot;I disagree&quot; it&#39;s his taste no matter what you think
You&#39;re probably not gonna read the reviews on this one considering the like to dislike ratio, melon, but I believe you&#39;re right. We&#39;ve seen Mac Miller put out successful and full albums and it just seems like this one is lacking slightly. I, personally, love this album because it gives me a lot of solace but there seems to be something missing. It&#39;s like Mac is almost too high.
damn that lik 2 dislik ratio
Delet dis. Ples.
Gotta disagree with this one chief
D I S A G R E E 😡😡
please review foxings new record Nearer My God PLEASE!
lame review.
I think your honesty is becoming one of your vices. I agree with you.
Half shook
this ain&#39;t the one chief
why do white people want so bad for a white rapper to be good?
This is it Chief
yes anthony fuck him up. cant stand mac miller
Jesus Christ Melon, you fucked up, buddy.
That Tyler comparison was perfect. I was thinkin the same when I heard this album. It&#39;s almost like a poorly done version of what Tyler was doing on Flower Boy
I&#39;m gonna respect that this is his opinion and I&#39;m not gonna hate on it. But personally i think this is my favorite album by Mac and I love seeing how he has evolved over time and I&#39;m glad his head is clear now
Antoine, listen to me. Let Cal review from now on, cuz your melon looking ass doesn’t have ears if this is a 3/10
It was painful to listen to your ignorance and lack of awareness. This review is fucking tragic
This melon has gone bad. We need to throw it out.
Lol guys chill this is his opinion
Oouu, them dislikes. This one aint it chief
Fuck you dude👉👌... This album dope
You&#39;re clearly a Mac Miller hater, Fantano. For real, this might be your worst review ever. strongly disagree
Melon the type of nigga who cries himself to sleep at night because he&#39;ll never reproduce
ur wrong
You are a fucking idiot. Dear god you have such a strong bias against Mac Miller. How can you Beyoncé was musically perfect but mac isn&#39;t. God you are a just an edge lord hoping for more views.
I understand that you are mad at Mac for stealing your girl. But dont take it out on his album!!!!
damn, all the mac stans in the comments are real butthurt.<br><br>This album sucked, mac has been going downhill since watching movies
Anthony <br><br><br><br>=<br><br><br><br>Sellout
A 3???? It looks like u have a personal vendetta when u put a score that can’t be justified at all by the standards you’ve set.
This album is great. Fuck you melon
Review Life’s A Trip
You guys are so fucking dense. It&#39;s just his opinion, we sub to watch his OPINION.<br><br>That being said TESTING should&#39;ve been at least an 8 and you all should&#39;ve seen that video as a sign of the end.
Yea you fucked this review up hots
Come on melon it’s a 1 and you know it
I saw the red flannel and hit the dislike before I watched the review.<br><br>Then I watched the video and un-disliked it.<br><br>To dislike it again.
This is the second 6 on MBDTF

REDUX REVIEW TOMORROW
QUEEN BY NICKI MINAJ
.lmao u guys r ridiculous
Review Ghost City by Delta Sleep
I do agree on the moaning singing sounds, but this was an utter shit review... sounded very biased at times
Abolute bullshit LMAO , this album is one of his best one yet. The instrumentals are jazzy and funky and Mac flows over all of it , it&#39;s a feel good album and actually one of the first albums this year I didn&#39;t want to skip a track at all and I flew through the album without knowing. You&#39;re review is a MISS ME/10
Lmao the like ratio
Damn Mac Miller fans can&#39;t handle different opinions
Why are you still reviewing mac’s music if you barely give any of it above a 5
Man people really don&#39;t like this review. Kinda cool though that Melon has fans who don&#39;t blindly support him even when they disagree with him.
We don’t have to like the album just because we feel sorry for him because he’s still broken hearted over Ariana while she’s engaged<br>That being said I haven’t listened to it
How is Astroworld better than swimming? Shut the fuck up melon you’re rotten today.
I disagree 🤷🏼‍♂️<br><br>Edit. Rip Mac <br><br>Still disagree<br><br>Loved this album
RIP Mac Miller, I&#39;m calling it now.
Jet Fuel is niceeee
big pot stirrer
I&#39;m giving your review of this album a NOT GOOD
can you review life´s a trip by trippie redd? luve your videos &lt;3
This album was garbage..
I really enjoyed the album especially the feature of thundercat thats all that really matters that I enjoyed it. but I must ask the question. What you smoking?
i CaN aPRUSHIAtE...
I liked the album
mac is trying to go soulful, and I want to see where it goes. Idk it&#39;s not the best stuff, but he&#39;s trying and developing.
Remember when you didn’t give The Ooz a ten
Massive L for Russ
Hello. <br><br>You&#39;re wrong. <br><br>Goodbye.
Swimming was leagues better then astroworld. Bad review
Boo tano
This isn’t correct
Bad review
Disliked after looking at the rating
Nigerianthony Scamtano
Noooooooo
Daaaaamn that dislike ratio tho
bad melon
Imma keep it real with you chief. This ain&#39;t the right number.
Anthony you should do an EMINEM Worst to Best Video!
<b>EFFORTLESSLY</b>
never understood much of the hate for fantano besides this video
I think this is the worst like to dislike ratio I’ve ever seen on a melon video.
It&#39;s good overall and great as background music for self wallowing
Youre not wronng but youre not right
When you consider that MBDTF is twice as good as this album this review makes sense. Although ASTROWORLD was mostly filler garbage dont @ me
Review choker’s album
Y&#39;know what? DIVINE FEMININE WAS GOOD
I strongly agree, incredibly boring album
FRIGG U FRIGGTHONY FRIGTANO
I don&#39;t have an opinion on this album one way or the other but I gave this video a like just to try and offset it. Sorry people arent accepting your opinion, the internet is great isnt it?
Honestly I can&#39;t dislike a video for thinking different thoughts about an album, I can, however, appreciate the different views in opinions between you and I, as well as between the split in the audience. It just means we all have different likes and dislikes.
This is a fantastic album
I do agree this album was kinda bland and every song leaves you wanting more, but youre trashing on this way too much like how are you gonna give it a 3 😂 and then you&#39;re gonna give astroworld a 7???? Fuck outta here guy idek what you&#39;re talking about half the time, you tried saying that Birds from Travis  was trash, when me and everybody I know agree that&#39;s his best album and now you&#39;re singing praise for astroworld which was very overhyped and very underwhelming. Yea you could argue swimming is bland, but none of the music is bad so i just dont see how it&#39;s worthy of a 3
Small worlds also isn’t good
You need to listen to this again. You clearly didn’t listen enough. I know you’re usually on point but you need to relisten. Take a step back and realize what Mac Miller actually made
I give this review a light to decent 0/10.
Mac Miller last 4albums have been trash
Perfecto was bad
MY REGRETS ARE JUST LIKE REVIEWS I SHOULDNT SEND
Self care schlaps idc
People here are so ridiculously salty. If you hold his opinion on such a pedestal, then you’re guaranteed to disagree with him at some point. Why don’t you just enjoy the album quietly and respect the fact he didn’t enjoy it?
Anthony Fantano is just jealous there’s a better looking bald white guy out there
Macandme fantano
i love it when fantano triggers his audience. feels good man.
I get not getting a great score but sheesh
Mannnnnnn I understand not liking Mac&#39;s vocal style but how could you hate on the production on here
Yeeaah.... nooooo bro... nooo :/
3? Damn
Nothing will be as good as faces
damn more dislikes than likes
This mans Antonio Fandango been replaced with a clone that promotes trap rap over original, soulful music like my man Miller right here
Jeeeeez. Deafheaven and then this. He’s really rustling some jimmies lately.
It&#39;s weird so many people are against Fantano here, a three is super harsh only because this is definently better than the peice of shit called Scorpion; that being said the album is really mellow and blends together a lot, i find it a good album to have as background or for vibing and would probably give it around a 6 but when you try to really dig into it it&#39;s not overly complex or new, still worth a listen for some people though. But Anthony has legit reasons for himself not liking it and that is fine as well.
ouch. still gon hit
That’s a lot of dislikes chief
Bad review, bad melon
Hey, guys. He disagrees with us. Let&#39;s mass dislike his video for having a different opinion!<br>:/
I agree
I did not dislike this album, but I do want Mac Miller to get back to some bangers
This score only means that Mac’s demise is imminent
I mean do you even understand the album? It’s about being “okay” and disconnected from the world after his break up. How is that emotionally vacant. What do you want him to do, be a frat rapper again?
Pretty beats and decent lyrics spoiled by severely uninteresting vocal delivery. His style sounds like a hybrid between two songs on Pink Season. The tone of d i c c w e t with the accent of White Is Right. not sure I&#39;d give it a *3*, but it sure as hell ain&#39;t good.
Melon, please review The American Dream by Trophy Eyes
naww this aint it
Hahaha this guy. Just listen to the concept and context of the project. The production is undeniably flawless and he stays on topic during the whole album. His lyrics are vulnerable and self aware with some nice wordplay and analogies. Its his state of mind at the moment and he delivered it perfectly. You can really feel it. Its your opinion that you dont like the emotions hes bringing. But you just cant deny the quality of the project when you  listen to it with an open mind and objective view.
I don&#39;t get all the comments saying he&#39;s wrong I literally just listened to this and he is actually right.
Is it just me or does he seem overly angry for no reason in this video? Who pissed in your kale salad, melon?
Hey nerd, you’re wrong!
One of the first reviews of yours I’ve blatantly disagreed with. The album isn’t perfect by any means, but it has some strong points imo. Definitely didn’t comprehend your 10 on kids see ghosts.
We all know this album deserves at least a 6. I usually dont care about the score of an album, but this was Mac&#39;s best album since Faces. I guess you haven&#39;t gone through a break up. He is moody and kind of doesn&#39;t care because he is trying to make a break up album, not trying to win the girl over. Very introspective album, but no bangers equals a 3 out of 10.
Been following you forever Anthony but I stopped trusting your opinion around the Damn review anyway lol
Dude, you only have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgwPxFUUg94&amp;t=333">5:33</a> runtime? For an album this deep? Did you even listen to the lyrics?
The revving farty synthesizers
Guess this is the new &quot;you gave MBTDF a 6?!&quot;
Lmaooo this man HATES white artists. Come on Melon. Look in the damn mirror.
Tbh I&#39;ve never warmed up to Mac Miller and now you have put my feeling into words. Cheers bro
I DEFINITELY agree.
I really dont know how to feel about this album. I think it has very interesting aspects on songs like come back to earth, perfecto, wings, ladders and 2009 but the generic trap influences as well as the bland lyrics, coupled with awkward vocals on many songs just make me wanna puke... also some songs just feel way too long.
Completely agree, I can&#39;t stand Mac Miller&#39;s voice, sounds like a frat boy with dip in his lip. He&#39;s fucking terrible
This album is trash the comment section needs to chill out
I respectfully disagree
Fuck u melonhead
(I actually agree, Mac Miller sucks)
What an embarrassing review lmao
Everyone laugh at the ass blasted fans and their shit taste
Disagree. Should have been a <b>NOT GOOD</b>
Good Review
COME ON MELONN!!
Damn I didn&#39;t expect any review of yours to tank worse than MBDTF lol.
How you can listen to this and give it a 3 is beyond me
Fantano just doesn’t like stoner music
Appreciate your work dearest melon but this is a hard disagree for me
You are such a clown. You have absolutely no<br>idea what your talking about and you just proved it. Your a fucking moron.
By looking at all the dislikes, I guess things didn&#39;t go so swimmingly as people hoped.<br><br><br><br><br>I&#39;ll leave.
This is so sad, can we ban Sadboi music???
Great review Anthony, but I don&#39;t really understand how the story you told about the time you shoved a disc copy of &quot;Bookworm Adventures: Deluxe&quot; into a child&#39;s throat is related to the album
Nah fam.  This review&#39;s a miss with me.  I respect your opinions and will be coming back for more, but damn.  I gave this thing an easy 8 out of the second listen through.
I think Miller&#39;s voice for me is like Kid cudi&#39;s humming for you
Melon why do u hate White Rappers so much ? Always Shitting on Logic and Mac  , You hated ems Last Projekt (hahaha) and then there&#39;s g-Eazy....
Very bad review Anthony, you should have greatly stressed that this is your opinion. You took a hard L on this one.
Manthony Boytano GOOFED this one up
Not my fave album i thought mac was at his best talent wise with macadelic, watching movies and faces
This ain’t it cheif
This is actually the first review I disagree with
It&#39;s just one hipsters opinion at the end of the day
You still haven&#39;t reviewed anything by big baller b
Fuck offfff
It’s Starting to seem like Fantano appreciates entertainment more so than artistry or Rap I thought Scorpion was mediocre but not bad music but this album I felt was innovative and Mac Was in his bag 🗣
Wtf Anthony are you kidding me
IMA BE REAL WIT U CHIEF
Yobro how come u never reviewed the iceberg by oddisee last year?
You&#39;re fucking trash that can&#39;t understand good music
Im probably biased but i think mac millers singing is good and i think hes doing a good job of mixing rnb with hip hop and rap
You’re gonna relisten to the album later and have a different opinion
BOOO YOU DONT LIKE THE SAME ALBUM AS I DO BOOO!! YOU’RE NOT CONFORMING TO MY MUSICAL TASTE!!! BOOO! DISLIKE!
I don&#39;t care that you gave it a low score everyone had their opinion but idk how I felt about the explanations you gave behind it.
I have finally disagreed with Melon
Everyone in these comments complaining needs to get a life. <br><br>Oh no! Someone with a different opinion than mine?!?! What shall I do? Better dislike the video and leave a pointless stupid comment about how I disagree. That&#39;ll show you melon!
“Y’all know this is just my opinion right?”
Is this what J.Cole fans felt when he didn&#39;t like KOD? Lol
Review&quot;Lifes a Trip&quot;
agree, the album was pretty bland
Anthony doesn&#39;t understand music that isn&#39;t on the clout hype train anymore.
<b>sees red shirt</b><br><br>Fuck<br><br><b>clicks video</b><br><br>NONONONONONONONONO
Nothony TASTETANO HERE
This album is a 8/10 for me. Jet Fuel is an amazing song. Great album
Yeah, you&#39;re fucking wyling for this one Melon. This album blew YG and Travis Scott&#39;s records out of the water. Strongly Disagree here for once.
At around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgwPxFUUg94&amp;t=80">1:20</a> you absolutely trash on the beats and then praise them in the span of like 10 seconds ??
Supreme Blientele
Glad i unsubbed 6 months ago ur a fool
Dumbest melon in the game
I&#39;m with you on this one, Melon!
Glad you weren&#39;t afraid to tell it like it is. So many mac fans in the comments sad because you didn&#39;t give them affirmation for their shitty taste
Tony, you know Mac Miller is white, right? I don’t know why you felt it necessary to call him the N-Word 14 times right at the start of the video
6.4k dislikes. wow
Do trippie redds new album life&#39;s a trip
light 7 for me. been on repeat for a week, couldn&#39;t stop playing it, bcs I prolly have mediocre taste?? DC tho
Is he in a juul? What a visionary
Your the big goobs
fuck this review
Fuck you melon
Damnn you did my boy Mac pretty dirty lmao. Honestly though, even with me being a diehard Mac fan I can see the reasoning behind the rating of this album. I wish Mac would stick to his strengths of rapping, but not everything about this album is garbage. Jet Fuel is an amazing song as well as Perfecto, Hurt Feelings, and Wings. Come Back to Earth was also a great intro. I do think Mac needs to try a bit more when it comes to his vocals or just stick to rapping though, as he can seriously put out some bars which I haven&#39;t heard from him in sooooo long.
Look like the overwhelming consensus is this album deserved much more credit than macthony milltano gave it🤔
I think this is one of your most outrageous reviews in terms of fan agreement. Everyone seemed to love the album. Me included.
All these normie crybabies!! We all knew Mac Miller&#39;s music was about as bad as every other lame trendy rappers Jpeg forever
Careful Anthony; you&#39;ve triggered the 26 year olds that vape and occasionally smoke wax
I love ya tano but i give a  disagree/10 for this review
Most of these Comments are just a review of a review... Its HIS Opinion So Chill.
Stop reviewing hip hop. You don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.
Oh no Fantano doesn’t have the same opinion as me. REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
The video was honestly wack to me. Nothing stood out at all to me.
How dare melon has a unique opinion, all his opinions must perfectly line up with mine. I watch melon to make myself feel good for liking albums he does, not to hear his honest thoughts about the album. I&#39;m so insecure that if someone doesn&#39;t like an album i like, i take it as a personal attack.
Wack. Willfully opinionated view. Never change.
You just hate on Mac basically and it&#39;s kinda lame. You praise KSG when their singing is without doubt sub-par in a lot of places yet critique Mac hard when his singing is arguably equal to or slightly better than some of what we see in KSG... Which you gave a 10... I agree KSG is a strong 9/10 but you&#39;re kinda just hating on Mac for other reasons than his performance. Hence why you have such a large amount of disdain for your awful reasons and completely obvious bias.
No way. 3/10? Bugging.
While I respect your opinion you&#39;re also judging an entire album by his singing which is only 10-15% of the entire thing. Not to mention the production isn&#39;t bad, it&#39;s just safe and not experimental which is completely different. Saying you don&#39;t like the tone of the album is fine but your only other two criticisms barely even feel valid. 3 is far far far too harsh, 4/5 would have been fairer imo at least. <br><br>Idk about this one melon boi
Agreeeeed!!! Haven&#39;t listened to the album...
Highly disagree with your review this was a very good album and man you got so much aggression towards to it and it was my favorite project of his by far
I knew what was up when the video was 5 mins long
How are people giving this album a 7/10 or even a 8/10? Sure, Fantano might have been too harsh with the 3 but this album isn&#39;t higher than a 5 imo. The instrumentals were typical and mainstream, and each track is really tiresome to listen to. It was really hard to sit through the entire album. All in all it seems as though Mac tried too hard, till the point where he fucked some of these tracks up instead of making them sound great. While some of the instrumentals like the one on Wings sound pretty experimental, one should note that not all experimental music sounds great or is commendable.
imma keep real with you chief , no
I&#39;m glad reading through the comments I&#39;m not the only one that disagreed. Personally I like Mac Miller of kilter singing, and the mix of funky vibe and quality beats appeals to me at least, I would have given it at least a 7 or 8 out of 10
his singing contributes to the overall &#39;vibe&#39; of his music, maybe he doesnt have the best voice ever but he uses it well and achieves what he is looking for
dope ass album, smh
All I wanna say is that you&#39;re being inconsistent with your judgment on several aspects of this album in comparison to other recent reviews. It almost seems like you wanted it to be bad, or kinda wanted to show the &quot;music plebs&quot; how bad it <b>really</b> is. The album didn&#39;t even vibe well with me and I&#39;m not a Mac Miller fan,  but I feel it would be disingenuous to call it bad. Good production, decent lyrical work, some interesting highlights in a generally chill down to earth album. I&#39;d say it&#39;s more like a strong 6 to a light 7. <br><br>PS the lil xan comparison was embarrassing<br>Y&#39;all know this is just my opinion, right?
yeah, no.
Wait until you guys see him put this on his top 10 worst albums of the year lmao
MAC MILLER SUCKS. Or at least this album.
Dude did you even listen to this album?
Foh dude. I give Swimming a strong 9/10. I do appreciate what you said about Come back to Earth. To me the whole album  sounds like that. Its not something u turn up to. Its spiritual
You’re a dickweed
Everyone has there own opinion but looks like the vast majority of ppl have a different opinion to melon on this one
Lifeless? Come on melon. Re-Review this in a few. This is a pretty good album
I think he&#39;s fucking dissing on purpose but fuck you dude you&#39;re trash. Macmiller2020
a melon talking shit for 5 min and 33 seconds
Big no on this and your Astroworld review.
I agree for a change, loved self care tho
You literally hate every white rapper lmao
whaaaaaat?*???
I never really got too much into his music but damn I was honestly thinking about giving this album a listen...nvm.
Melon you’re starting to lose it
popular opinion - YOU SUK
I FULLY AGREE WITH THIS REVIEW!!!
I’ve always been the guy to be like “well yeah but it’s his opinion” but this is a WRONG OPINION
Your review is a 3/10
Can this possibly defeat the MBDTF controversy!?!?
He has never liked Mac lol I don’t get it
The professional critics all love it, you just tryna be different or smthg. L.
I give your review a decent to strong 4
MAC IF YOURE READING THIS ITS TOO LATE
Anthony, I usually disagree with your reviews but I still enjoy watching them. But this review my man was straight bs, i couldnt understand any of your arguments
Boooooooooo
Trash as review from a nerd that don&#39;t no real music
The dislikes LMAO
Yeah Im going to have to give this review a solid 1/10
TURN THAT 3 UPSIDE DOWN ITS A 3 NOW
diagree with this review and your critique of his last album...still respect your opinion i just disagree..respectfully.
nah
That&#39;s a lotta <b>damage</b>
Well, that&#39;s just like your opinion. 😅
This is where I draw the line Anthony u done messed up
White people so mad lmao, mac Miller is basically lil xan for old heads lmao
dumbtony baldtano
I don’t respect your opinion. Dont @ me, period
Ye i mean, this album sucks
I wish he start rapping like he did in faces
U dumbthony fucktano this album is pretty fuckin good
Simple Mac miller just can’t fucking  sing I wish he stop
Me and Choo Jackson fin’na smash yo car 😤
Im HAPPY this has MORE DISLIKES than like 😂
Yeah I a Big Mac miller fan but he thing he Fucking Drake now lol this is is worth album
you just hate Mac and youll never see his true art. L FOR THIS REVIEW
Im glad everyone thinks this guy is an idiot for this review
why do you hate Mac Miller. Damnthony Youtano
Damn I actually enjoy this album, it makes good background music.
what the fuck the production on this album is insanely intricate. You don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about you fucking durian fruit.
Wait wtf these dislikes. People liked this album???
this album made me a miller fan, that shit is beautiful, it ain&#39;t trying to be revolutionary, it ain&#39;t trying to sound complicated, it&#39;s an emotional album, his voice sounded awesome and it is really far from being emotionless , the fact that it isn&#39;t extremely sad in its tone is a perfect representation of how mental illness recovery works and how it not just a sad/happy state, mac tried exploring the in-between, and as someone who suffered from mental illness for a long time, I find his lyrics and his delivery to be extremely relatable and quite representative of the mental state he is trying to portray in these tracks. this album isn&#39;t trying to be AOTY , but a personal yet relatable exploration between the disenchantment and sadness miller felt , his road towards recovering from that , and the impact it left on him even when he felt better. i personally find this to be his best project and i can&#39;t wait to hear more from this guy , it was a very pleasant surprise.
Better than Astroworld
i liked it but i could see what youre saying
Ya’ll know this just my opinion, right?
Y’know what? Who hurt YOU ANTHONY ?!? <br><br>Everyone called that you’d rate this low as fuck after the Travis album dropped. Smh my head
One of the most boring albums I&#39;ve ever heard that also happens to be pretty decent
HOW THE FUCK DO YOU COMPARE MAC TO LIL XAN BOOOOO 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻 LOOK AT ALL THOSE DISLIKES
It’s confirmed Fantano hates sadder side of music this review is garbage
If I particularly cared about mac miller or this album I&#39;d feel like the melon and I have different opinons but I wouldn&#39;t start breathing heavily and smash that dislike button
Maturity Trajecto here
I AGREE. I’m with the less popular opinion on this one, this album lacked soul and could’ve been a lot better than it was. I like Mac Miller, and I think he is talented and instrumentally has potential, but I refuse to say I liked this album just because it’s Mac Miller. If this was a no name artist y’all would never even heard of this joint.
People hating on an opinion and are shocked to find out that Mac Miller just isn’t that great. That’s the only DAMN that should be here.
melon finally gets it right
incorrect opinion king...
Replace this score with Astroworld and you got the REAL REVIEW
IT&#39;S MBDTF ERA ALL OVER AGAIN
Huh, I thought the album was good. But I&#39;ll respect Melon&#39;s opinion here.
Damn Anthony you sleeping 😴
what is wrong with you melon
Is he high? I thought this album was great. Easily an 8/10
I did not like this album, at all.
Come on Melon... listen again.
Yo he’s shat on albums I’ve liked several times, praised albums I didn’t. No two peoples’ tastes align perfectly. Just like, relax lmao.
I thought it was pretty good
y’all know this is just his opinion right? so many people butthurt 💀💀
Is this that Post Melón guy??
Astro world&#39;s was trash
mac&#39;s best projects are 1. Faces 2. Delusional Thomas 3. WMWTSO
I actually really agree with what he’s saying
Funny how people think a &quot;good review&quot; is one that reflects their own opinion exactly. <br>I&#39;m pretty sure the point of a review is to hear someone else&#39;s opinions, as opposed to validating your own. <br>Keep &#39;em coming, Melon.
HUH???????????? 3/10????? NIGGAAAAA TRIPPING DAWG and u gave faces a 6/10???? yeahhh we out
Angry white boys everywhere, I see.
F
5 MIN REVIEW MEANS HE HATES IT CLEARLY BUT TRAVIS SCOTT GETS A 18 MINS REVIEW...APPLAUD THE FUCKSHIT.
Yeah, the production on this thing is great but mac just doesn&#39;t have any singing chops to compliment it. I like the concept but he needs a vocal trainer or something
No
B I A S E D M E L O N
lol mac miller fans not havin it with this one
I normally appreciate watching even the reviews I disagree with because you make well made arguments, but this just some lazy bullshit 😴😴
It deserves 3/10 just cuz of his nasty feet  😩😷
Damn the dislikes deserve it 😂😂
7-5-3 nice numbering anthony
Astroworld = 7/10<br>Swimming = 3/10<br><br><b>????????????</b><br>Edit: RIP Mac. Ive been listening to you since 2012 and your music meant so much to me. I appreciate all you&#39;ve done. &lt;3
Travis Scott uses a machine to make him sound barely listenable on an album: 7<br>Mac Miller uses his actual talent and lyricism on an album: 3
“The beats on this thing are consistently lifeless, spacey and bland” <br><br>5 seconds later<br><br>“Generally the beats on this thing are pretty pleasant”<br><br>Come on Anthony, overall it seems like you gave the album a good listen and didn’t enjoy it but I really don’t understand the 3. There are some excellent cuts on this album IMO and I have to disagree with you about Mac’s singing. I think it does have an unconventional charm, especially on tracks like What’s The Use or Small Worlds.
What&#39;s the us? Ladders? Self Care? Jet Fuel? So many great songs with fantastic instrumentation. Haven&#39;t met anyone who dislikes those songs yet
E F F O R T L E S S L Y
Redthony <br>Flannelo?<br>Oh no
Please review ‘68 - Two Parts Viper!!! Some of the best post punk of 2018, you will love it!
lol i agree actually. only like 3 songs off it
I love these controversial reviews 😋
Get roasted panthony, people rlly disagree hhhhhhhh
I feel slightly offended by this but I respect your opinion. I hope you&#39;ll eventually come back to this after a couple listens to reevaluate.
this review is a disgrace fantano &amp; u should be ashamed
This album is shit and you guys know it
FUCK YOUUUUUUUUUUUU
Hahaha this album is trash
The comments found out Anthony has been smoking crack..... compared him to Lil Xan really ????? Fuck this guy
Agreed didnt like the album
Nostrum Grocers.
This album was beautifull
Overrated and overdone. Tired of these low effort releases.
The growlers review? New project out
Album didn&#39;t really have any staying power for me personally. I listened to the album. I thought it was okay. But Swimming just doesn&#39;t have any songs that I just <b>have</b> to listen to because it was on my mind or something. You know? Like....you know that feeling where you hear a song and that&#39;s suddenly all you listen to for a while? This album wasn&#39;t it for me. I don&#39;t think the albums rating deserves a 3/10. But I don&#39;t think it needs to be higher than like a 6/10 either. But that&#39;s just a opinion.
Jesus Christ MELON HAS NO MERCY for mac😔
Kamasi Washington - 6<br>Deafhaven - 5<br>Mac Miller - 3<br><br>Oh boi
Damn 6k dislikes huh
I wasn&#39;t a fan either... faces/ watching movies was the best era of Mac
why do these hipster mac miller fans think that the opinion of a middle aged melon is the end of the world
I wholeheartedly agree, this shit is boring trash
Effortlessly
Nononono, this album is so good :D :D
Thank you. I&#39;m so sick of everyone saying this awful album is good.
fuck you Fantano
ok so who dropped the Melon? hands down one of your worst reviews.
The album is not amazing but Shawn Cee did this album more justice.
The album was great, you wrong
WAT?!
Nope
Anthony could fart on a mic and it would be better than this album
Y&#39;all know this is just his opinion, right?
damn Fantano, taking the L.
OK then not giving this album a listen
How dare you melon
Ease up guys, it&#39;s a fair review. Describing the album as mediocre is generous. I&#39;d describe it as a sack of shit but, Regrettably, there is no sack.
Gotta agree with Melon, album is a bore-fest with no personality and emotion. Instrumentals sound sound very basic and Mac&#39;s singing/mumbling sounds terrible. Only a few interesting tracks 3/10.
Bappity bap bap <b>BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO</b>
I really liked this album. It&#39;s way better than a 3
Let&#39;s Get that melon boys
I feel like this was too short you could&#39;ve delved a little deeper into the album (Especially the clever lyrics and wordplay he drops throughout the album). Even though I respect your opinion, I really enjoyed this record. It just stands out especially in 2018 where Hip-Hop is very generic, lots of stuff sound the same. Maybe you&#39;ll like it as it ages if you&#39;re even going to listen to it. Personally I loved this album, some features would&#39;ve been great but I get this album is very introspective and personal for Mac.
ur best review
Ass review
I disagree. But respect your opinion.
youre like that old english teacher that really hated that one kid in class and just picked on him or her for their work more than the rest.
Absolutely fucking not m8
Really loved the album but I’m not going to shit on you and dislike the video because you gave your opinion we are allowed to have different views and I understand some of the points you were making even if I disagree wholeheartedly with them
Pretty sure you just hate Mac Miller , literally never given him a fair review
review trippie redd&#39;s new album &quot; life is a trip&quot;
what the fuck dude.
&quot;Y&#39;all know this is just my opinion, right?&quot;
Loved this review Melon I hope Mac Miller stans lose sleep over this
melony disliked the divine feminine, which was a better album, idk why yall were expecting him to enjoy this
The video has more thumb downs then thumbs ups, nothing more needs to be said.
nah bru nah
I wasn&#39;t planning on listen to the album because the last one was really bad but that dislike bar changed my mind. Melon ain&#39;t lying, y&#39;all fanboys just easily swayed by Miller&#39;s heartbreak lyrics and thursday night jazz. This is definetly not worse than his last project but this ain&#39;t it, chief.
Do life&#39;s a Tripp!!!
You wrong for this
Hold on I&#39;ll get the popcorn
I absolutely love the track ladders
One of the VERY few times I disagree with Fantano. 7/10 imo
I thought most of the album was good :(
I like this, but totally disagree with you .
Melon, your opinion is <b>e v i l</b>
This ain&#39;t the one chief
Is there a white rapper that anthony doesnt hate?
D I S A G R E E
did he just
You fucked up. Unsubbed
Hey melon ;) hope u r well
you tweakin cuh
This was very good album I think it’s better than astroworld . Anthony fantano doesn’t know nothing about music he the type of guy that listen to metal
:/
This man so angry
So lil pump was rated better mxm..
I always respect anton&#39;s opinions but he just comes off as annoying and like a douche in this review lol
Melon after watching this I&#39;ve come to realize that music is not for you. You&#39;re tone deaf and you approach music with an objective mindset, while music is an art form which is obviously subjective.. why don&#39;t you close your eyes, plug in some earphones, listen to the whole album and experience how the music makes your mind and body feel, instead of skimming through the album as quickly as possible so that you can make a shitty youtube video and earn money...
Fuck you for this one Anthony
What&#39;s going on in your personal life fam? Take a break if you&#39;re too stressed out to review a decent album. You seem so damn angry and for like what? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgwPxFUUg94&amp;t=275">4:35</a> was a brief moment of clarity. This review honestly seems more like a weird justification for you to vent  your stress sideways on youtube or something. I very seldom dislike a video but here you go Lthony Ltano, you can hold this L and do with it whatever you&#39;d like. Cheer up butter cup, 2018 has been rough but its gonna be okay &lt;3
Your opinion is shit and you should feel bad Melonhead
oof the like/dislike ratio
This aint it chief
I respect your opinion
Trippie Redd review!
Dislikes to likes ratio says it all. Find a new line of work idiot
Lmao y’all fanboys so annoying. gtfo nobody wants you
I enjoyed it more than Good AM but not as much as Watching Movies (We don’t speak of Divine Feminine).
Usually can appreciate all your views based on your excellent delivery and lanes of explanation. Here it feels personal biased appears far too heavily. Loved the album 7.5+ to me. 2/10 review/video.
melon how could you :(
oh no
I loved it. 7.5/10
<b>RED ALERT</b>
Lol this is a fucking hilariously bad review. BIG L for the melon
Fuck u bish issa good album
<b>FUCK</b> why are there so many dislikes. Mac Miller is trash LOL
Melon , ya triggered the &#39;Alt-White&#39;
I think Mac Miller smashed melons wife and he salty about it
I thought this album was amazing and I&#39;ve never  liked anything mac miller before
😡😡
I wish you could&#39;ve critiqued his bland word choice; this bruh was using the word &quot;fall&quot; way too many times like c&#39;mon bruh pick up a thesaurus.
Your just wayyyy off base here.. :( so wrong
Well, that&#39;s like your opinion man
It’s like you hate me :v jk nice review i liked it but okay. I hope you enjoy more some smash mouth melon. You edwardo squirdwardo. I hate you :v how dare you not like something i do how dare you. Flex tape
lol yeah fantano becoming more of a joke with each hip hop review
damn, mac miller fans out in force
Ouch
FantaNO
:(
Review “till death call my name by nba young boy”
Ok
Melon! Review TT - LoveLaws
Lil Pump a 7
Dont Agree
This album fucken gorgeous. Melon wtf is good rn
Ur on drugs
I don’t think it’s some mind blowing album, but a 3/10 is ROUGH. It’s kind of bland in spots, but I’d argue and could easily argue, this album is better than Astroworld. I’m not gonna dislike the video or shit on you, but I just think it’s not deserving of a 3/10.
I&#39;m convinced that he only gave it 1 listen. I get that he doesn&#39;t like the singing, but the lyrics are the best i&#39;ve ever heard from Mac. This is the most he&#39;s ever had to say and Fantano just completely ignored it... And it&#39;s not like the whole album is singing, it&#39;s mostly just the hooks.
He really does not like him..
You fucking gay, it’s a really good album :(
3/10 WOW
DING DONG YOUR&#39;E WRONG
HOW DOES LIL FUCKING PUMP GET A 7 AND MAC GETS A 3????
Melon doesn&#39;t understand super underground rappers like Mac Miller.
mac got whacked
He’s the only famous person I’ve seen hate the album so far
This review is wrong. You are wrong.
im never going to watch another one of your videos. unsubscribed.
fehhh fuck fou fandango
Idk man i feel like you should have at least mentioned his recent break up in this video to at least partially explain why part of this album is the way it is.  I feel like 5 minutes was not enough time to really explain his project in depth. :/ not saying it was his best project by any means but i dont think you gave it the credit it deserved.
This album is great.  Have you listened to it?
mac miller is wack hes shitty poser macklemore
why did you have to give it to em?
Macs album was dumb boring
that&#39;s a correct score
He says it doesn’t sound sad and sounds emotionally vacant as though thats a bad thing. I think the title “swimming” is basically saying “this isn’t an album about me being sad, its an album about me carrying on despite the currents surrounding me” maybe being emotionally vacant is an emotion all its own
love the channel but! definitely disagree  with this one
I’m a Mac Miller stan but this album was incredibly shitty. Everyone who disagrees is delusional. The only ok songs were ladders/2009 and Macs flat asf voice were the worst parts of those songs. This album is basically unlistenable
MY CHEST
This is a 3/10 while astroworld was a 7?.. This is a joke, I like Fantano as a person but his taste in music is quickly losing all credibility imo
Kinda agree.. I had to relisten to find a song to save
So astroworld a -3?
gives mac a 3<br>gives tyler an 8<br><br>calls beats boring<br><br>lmao what
This album is not bad at all. Excellent background music for driving or just chilling. I always saw you as a very credible and reliable source as a music critic but this was disappointing and disrespectful.
Damn that dislike to like ratio. You know it&#39;s just an opinion right?
Underwhelming instrumentals? 🤦🏼‍♂️  I thought those instrumentals were fire.
Woah, I wonder how long the like/dislike ratio will last before the Melonheads come in to defend their Lord. I think this is the first time I’ve ever seen more dislikes than likes on a Fantano video, which (imo) is well deserved. This album was at LEAST somewhere above a 5. <br><br>I’m giving this review 3K likes out of 5K dislikes<br><br>EDIT: HOLY SHIT. For perspective, this review is ONE POINT above Eminem’s Revival. FUCKING REVIVAL. The album that had the audacity to contain the line “You got buns, I got aspbergers” ONE WHOLE POINT.
I feel like you’re off base on this one melon,  ‘what’s the use’ and ‘Ladders’ don’t fall under moody not sure we listened to the same album it feels light years ahead of Macs last piece TDF. Also the beats on album were a solid 10!
&quot;I&#39;ve never seen an artist who sO EfFOrtLeSsLy&quot;
So I feel like you actually like the album but this is a scheduled curve ball you have to throw at us to keep us interested 😂
LIFELESS AND BLAND YOUR FUCKING DEAF
Antonio Fernando hates white people
Melon more like Nolem amirite?
y&#39;all mad 😂😂😂😂😂😂
WRONG. Fucking loved this album. Mac has come so far as an artist.
I made macs beats ! Jk I&#39;m not sad all the time lmao meme
Damn the internet doesnt agree with you, check the likes
Instrumentals are underwhelming yes, but this is what his fans wanted IMO.. he grows up with us.
You really missed this one. I give this a strong 10/10 dislike :)
FUCK YOU MELLON TRAVIS AINT A 7 AND MAC AINT A 3
he did it again
You tripping this album is great
Hahaha those dislikes tho
You&#39;re so biased with your reviews
Im glad to see many other people enjoy this album as much as I do. It’s dope and chill af
astroworld album of the year and thats FAX nothing else is topping it idgaf
I’m feeling a light 2 on this review
smh...you’re trippin
Shut the fuck up U Melon
Watching Movies with the Sound Off is still the only Mac album I really like (live performances w/ The Internet included).
contestant for album of the year for me
Anti Whitetano
Melon ur mom gay!!!!!
I really enjoyed this album. 9 /10 for me peraonally. Some of the beats are so experimental yet the best thing ive ever heard
lol im triggered
do life&#39;s a trip next
God is a melon
This dude just compared Mac Miller to Lil Xan...
Ohthany Notano. <br><br><br>Lemme get my popcorn
Ariana cheated on Mac with Melon confirmed
I once played a mac miller song in the car and my friends asked if I was gay
Now where did I leave my crack sock
The first half of this album was so cringe man
Lmao “BeTtEr ThAn A s Tr O WoRLd” yea okkk...
THIS LIKE TO DISLIKE RATIO GODDAMN
The fact that anyone likes Mac Miller to begin with is really sad enough by itself so idk why the omments tripping. Mac Miller taking Ls
Please please review Its a New Day Tonight by Micheal Rault
Holy shit that&#39;s a lot of dislikes melon
Fantano the type of nigga that puts blue cheese in his ears
Least a decent 5 melon
Noooo melon say it ain’t sooo !
Holy Mackle-Melon, those dislikes!! Is this the most disliked Fantano vid, I wonder?
Nah, you got this wrong.
NO MELON NO
Dude this album a solid 8 or 9, thought you’d give it a 6 or 7, then I saw the red flannel so I thought 5, then got 3. Whack
Review some metal please
THIS ISNT LIFE’S A TRIP MELON
Just keep the down votes coming forreal. This should legit be his most down voted vid
Took Fantano a week to release this? Shouldn’t have bothered bro
I liked it. Vegeta was denied a better power up in dbs. Strawberries are better than almonds. Ramen noodles are bad but if you have money so what?
I don&#39;t get how you can criticize the vocals so harshly when you are into punk and some indie rock that has so many technically terrible vocalists. I understand you not enjoying his voice, but you talk about it like it&#39;s objectively bad and not pleasant to listen to when obviously there are people who love his singing. This review just felt like you didn&#39;t give the album a chance and went into it with the mindset you were gonna hate it. I usually respect your opinion when we disagree because you tend to back it up with good reasoning, I think most of what you said in this video was bullshit. Still love you though melon!
I actually agree for once
I was expecting a 5 at least. But yeah, not his best project imo.
I respectfully disagree
love you but gotta fully disagree with you on this one :( howd you give it such a bad review
Review G-Mo Skee&#39;s album Chaly and the Filth Factory
this ain’t it bruh album fire
I use to be a big mac Miller fan but the last two albums haven&#39;t been good in my opinion. His singing just isn&#39;t good and he has more potential rapping
Look at all these fanboys crying 😂😂
A C R Y I N G B A B Y
This album was way better than Astroworld, Melons tripping again smh
ROFL AT THESE PEOPLE SAYING MELONS OPINION IS WRONG christ you have one of the most unloyal fucking fanbases. I loved the album myself, and personally you are totally at right for having an opinion to em, I just wanted to hear your take on it, your opinion is your own. God damn you people are plastic
This ain’t it
It’s a7
lol no.
This was leagues better than astroworld. This was it, but you just ain’t no chief.
I think this was one of his top albums. Blue slide park still GOAT for Mac but damn, 3/10? What&#39;s going on Melon Head.
He should have atleast broke the tracks down
It&#39;s not that bad. It&#39;s way better than the last album
Damn everybody in the comments is disagreeing with this review, is this Melon&#39;s first L since MDBTF?
Self care and 2009 are some really great tracks. 2009 being pretty high up throughout his career
Melon rates albums based on enjoyment value so he enjoyed the album 3/10
<b>BOOOOOOOOOOOOO</b>
wtf melon
Sponsored by <b>Ariana grande</b>
Haven&#39;t seen this many whiny crybabies under one of your reviews since Meshuggah....
Cool, here’s a dislike.
Review Nova by RL Grime
i don’t know he sounds like an upgraded lil peep which isn’t saying much
Yeah you’re buggin melon ...
Hi everyone WRONGTONY WRONGTANO here
This album was genuinely ass I thought everyone else felt the same way lmaooo
how in the world can you criticize mac&#39;s singing for being &quot;moany&quot;, wheezy, and off pitch while praising Cudi for the same thing and giving KSG a 10? I am perplexed, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever disagreed with a review by you more
Divine Feminine was great, this was also very good. Invest in Q tips Mr Fantano !
it&#39;s a good album but c&#39;mon a 3/10? It&#39;s a 7/10 in my book
I&#39;m pissed
I give your glasses a light  1 you fuck
take that mac stans
He couldn&#39;t be more wrong! This was an excellent album! And seeing more thumbs down on this video than thumbs up almost prooves it.
I don’t know why anybody watches this clown
im glad i got to watch the evolution of mac miller. you tripping on this album rating. solid project beginning to end. -park
I agree with the sentiment (but 3 is a little harsh). Wish Mac would go back to Making Movies style
yeah this a no from me dog
When Mac iller does better than Eminem 2/10, thats still a W.
F*ck you melon I loved it.
Generic popish rap vibe music = Album of the Year for commenters
damn you&#39;re tweaking
FUCK OUTTA HERE MELON. IM GONNA DROP MY OWN DAMN REVIEW AND GIVE IT A 9/10 JUST TO SPITE YOU. YOU LITERALLY ARE MAKING ME WANT TO SPEND HOURS AND HOURS MAKING A VIDEO ON THIS ALBUM AND TALK ABOUT HOW FUCKING NICE IT IS. also ill talk about astroworld too lol
While I respect your opinion, you can see that more than half of the people that left feedback disagree with you including you. The album wasn’t supposed to be hype or really loud. He was telling a story and trying to get a point across and he wouldn’t have been able to do that if this record wasn’t “moany”.
Mane losing credibility by the day with me... 😂 I’m not sayin this album is a world beater but I can tell it’s better than Astroworld if not that on par with it.. the same reason he hate this album is bad is the same reason Astroworld suck.. lack of evolution of their sound. Both artist has became stagnant..<br>I still love the content mane 💯
Anthony just doesn’t like Mac lmaooo DF was good, especially Cinderella, and Swimming was good too, definitely a 7.5, it could’ve been an 8.3 imo if there was more dissimilarity between the tracks  bc on their own they’re great, yet together they pull each other down a bit, which made me feel like there was lacking a bit of something.
Disagree
not gonna lie, fantanos very much wrong here
This album is sooo boring.
I agree I couldn’t get pass two song and got bored went back to astroworld
Farthony Synthstano
HOW THE FUCK ARE YOU GOING TO RATE THIS LOWER THAN YG’s SHITTY PIECE OF GARBAGE DOO DOO. FUCK OUT OF HERE
I love Mac Miller’s music a lot, faces and good am are definitely my favorite album, and swimming is pretty solid in my opinion, but I can see where Anthony is coming from, with it being sorta of underwhelming, but for me the positives of this album out weigh the negatives, but opinions are like assholes, every ones got em
Holy shit Mac Miller&#39;s vocals are really that bad and boring. Good lord. How can anyone forgive this shit? Oh man. Anthony getting hate for spreading the truth. Oh fuck. All these gorgeous, wasted beats. Fucking hell.
Melon, good review! Mac Miller is a bad singer and empty lyricist
I never dislike videos, but I had to toss this disrespectful piece of trash a dislike
The album would’ve come together much nicer if Mac swapped his singing parts for some features with better vocals (eg Frank Ocean would’ve been fantastic) but a 3 is harrrrrsh
Jesus, Mac Miller is the white J. Cole. Absolutely zero energy. Like come on, these are some great beats you&#39;re wasting. At least put a feature on so we can actually be entertained. This album is basically ASMR in musical form. So easy to fall asleep to.
yo i massively disagree
delete this video bro, you’re bugging
Ahhh its been a while since a the dislikes doubled the likes
This review is a 3/10 lmfao.
L
Y&#39;all know this is just my opinion, right?
holy fuck people hate this video
Im sorry, but i dont agree at ALL. This album is beautiful and i was impressed with macs effort, for real, this is a solid album and a great stepping stone on his discography. COMPLETLY DISAGREE WT FANTANNO, straight hating imo. Swimming on top of 2018 right now!!!!!!!!!!!!! Knocked it out the park
i loved this album dude, i totally disagree with you...
Thought I saw a tongue ring in there for a sec..
Melon I usually love you but fuck you for this
Clown review. Delete
I’ve listened to 100+ albums so far this year, and this album is top 3. I can totally acknowledge that Mac is not the best singer but for some reason I still really enjoy it when he sings. I can’t really explain it. I would rather listen to Mac sing than Adele. I realize this doesn’t make much sense but it’s how I feel. I could listen to Adele for example and feel absolutely nothing, despite knowing she’s technically brilliant. Mac really made me feel deeply on almost every song on here.
I think you need to re listen. The beats are fire
Your hairline is is moany  pitchy and <br>Garbage
This melon bitch smoking dust
Put together some instrumentals son.
&quot;I can&#39;t keep getting away with this&quot;<br>~Anthony Fantano, after having gotten away with it for the literal millionth time
Idk, its an ok record but definitely not 3 bad.  Those 3 singles were hot.
So I guess he didn’t like westside Gunn’s project because it’s been out for a minute now and he hasn’t reviewed it yet
I think you got the scores for Astroworld and Swimming mixed up Melon..
Harsh
5/10 should been enough <br>album is chill
Go listen to the death grips
what did mac do to you
Nope
Pussy
I disagree with a lot, but thanks for the we informed, contrarian opinion.
Melon, I’ve agreed with you a lot this year when you went against the grain, but damn. This really ain’t it.
for once, i strongly disagree
I knew this would be fun when i saw the flannel lol
More dislikes than likes says it all
YOU ARE WRONG MELON, WRONGGGG
Oof
I feel like this album was purely for Mac Miller fans to understand and enjoy and anyone outside of that won&#39;t... Coz this shit absolutely ridiculous, swimming was the best album to come out on a day Travis dropped his overrated shit and I&#39;m a Travis fan, but Astro cannot be given a better review than Swimming 😐
You really hate Mac man lol
I could understand that maybe you didn&#39;t like the album, but your explanations as to why are pretty lukewarm. <br><br><br><br><br>In my humble opinion, this album was AT LEAST a 7/10. Sprinkled throughout the whole album he had tons of interesting music concepts in songs, and the project reminded me a lot of The Macedelic Mixtape (another highly underrated project of his).
come on man It&#39;s at least a strong 5
I&#39;d put it at a 4 just because of how incredible the production is but I agree with all of your points, I wanted to do math homework instead of listen to this album
Sometimes melon makes me sad
Preach the truth melon lord
Just plainly disagree
Opinions =/= hate<br><br>Some of you guys need to chill out, fr. I don&#39;t agree with this review at all either, but for those that are labeling his opinion as &quot;hate&quot;... Just chill out lol.
Dude. I gotta say.. I couldn’t disagree with you more on this one. Seriously feel like you missed it🤷‍♂️
It ain’t perfect but I don’t mind
review NEW TONY MOLINAAAA
I agree lmao fuck the bandwagon Mac isn&#39;t doing shit
Thank you this album was fucking trash
Lmfaoooo
Anthony got shit on in the likes
Woah
Yo we gotta buy Mac&#39;s album to apologize for this video.
Wow this is a horrible review, he did an amazing job with this album.
nah this ain’t it
Dude you&#39;re dead wrong on this one
Horrible review
Imma keep it real with you chief...this ain&#39;t it.
This was a solid 7 to 7.5
Oops Just remembered I&#39;m allergic to fucking melons
You are buggin
Boring ass album
nah, this ain&#39;t it, melonthony.
Wrongathy wrongtano
I fucking love self care
You losing it bruh
I knew he was gonna give it a bad score but dammm I was still shocked lmao but tbh I still prefer GOOD AM ,
i mean you&#39;re wrong but whatever
im glad the comment section is unified
WOWOWOWOWOWOW melon watch out you just fell off
You’re wrong on this one dude.
ouch that hurt
Album was straight garbage lol
Yo melon I respect your opinion but you&#39;re tripping if you think this album is that bad. I honestly can&#39;t stop humming bits of Come Back to Earth and 2009. There are beautiful moments to be found on this record, you just have to give them a chance.
ur wrong melon ur just wrong
It was a beautiful album 8/10 gotta disagree with you on this one chief
This album is definitely on mine AOTY list lmao this was super good
U n e x p e c t e d
hmm i liked it. But i really just had it on in the backround while doing work
Those dislikes tho
Self care is the only song by him I&#39;ve ever heard, and if I didn&#39;t know better someone could straight up tell me that Mac Miller is a mumble rapper and I&#39;d have to believe them
This thumbnail says a lot, actually
sometimes you’re just wrong
C&#39;mon this album was enjoyable smh
he hates Mac
Mellon has just never been a fan of Mac
This aint it chief
cmon melon youre just doing this to spark some controversy now bro how are you gunna give stay dangerous a 5 but this a 3 no way in hell this is on the same level as 69s mixtape this album was sick
Godthony Womtano
NO MELON.... JUST NO
From looking at the likes to dislikes... I can tell your opinion is trash melon
Agree
album was bland af, i used to be a fan of mac but he hasnt had a decent project since Good AM IMO. this sound like a singing album for a nigga that never listened to music in which someone actually sings before. dude needs some vocal lessons or something
Lol everyone is over here telling melon his opinion is wrong. And I totally agree with them.
So happy so many of you agree with me and disagree hard with him. Hes so far off. I MEAN FAR OFF
Dude you are so far off on this one dude. Its embarrassing.

You might just be a Mac hater tbh
I respect people’s opinion and all but the dislike button is there for a reason
Feels bad having to drop a dislike on this channel for the first time but.. you fuck wit Mac you get the cheese
How does Lil Pump get a better score than this.. LOL
What a dumbass. This album was amazing
This ain’t it chief
I plan to get &quot;Faces was just weed rap&quot; printed on toilet paper so I can literally wipe my ass with your objectively incorrect opinions instead of just figuratively.
I love that you put out reviews like this knowing they&#39;ll be unpopular because of the stans or because the audience of an album are a bunch of passionate sheep. Album was trash.
i couldn’t disagree more
Ooooooof that like to dislike ratio isn’t going to change melons mind
You are a piece of shit human being for this
To all you Mac Miller fans who legitimately like this unseasoned chicken breast of an artist, thank God you don&#39;t review music for a living.
Disagree
I have never disagreed more to anything than this you are out of your mind
nah bro . nah .
deserved atleast a 6 wtf melon man
Never realized how hurt mac fans can get over the truth until now 😂
Wrongthony Scortano Month
this album was great melon i have to respectfully disagree with you
Must of had a rough night before listing to this; I&#39;m not gonna hold your opinion against you Melon; but give it some time it might grow on you..
obviously its an opinion, sure, but I just couldn&#39;t respect when you said that the Shanghai Massacre of 1927 was warranted. I mean really, do better melon...
Swimming is a beautiful and personal piece of art. Your losing relevance and trying to boost yourself through controversy. This is Macs best work to date, besides Faces in my opinion. But remember, y&#39;all know this is just my opinion right?
I LOVE U FANTANO BUT UR FUCKIN BUGGIN
thank God melon isn&#39;t included in Wiki reviews
damn i cant believe this
lmao i only come back to this review to see how bad the like dislike ratio gets
Wow u are lackin
Wrongthony Wrongtano here
Damn heavy disagree bro, respect ur opinion tho
A 3? Bruh you&#39;re heavily trippin on that score. Atleast a strong 7
I listen to this all the time since it dropped. I love it. Melon you’re getting close to the edge.
Bruh y’all for real? The album may not be as low as a 3...but it’s not higher than a 6... it’s so fucking bland. Only a couple bright spots
Booooooo... BOOO STUPID MELON BOOOO
it&#39;s a 7/10 for me
Yeah, I think you are wrong here man. Mac is great.
damn i love your reviews but this is definitely not a 3. seriously at least a 6. at least. this is a great album.
It was aight, idk if it deserves a 3 but the first half was pretty good.
Absolutely fucking not fella. this ones incorrect
Damn dude, I wasn&#39;t even a huge fan of it but I respect it. A 3/10 is just unreal.
Lol yeah ok 😂
I’m so glad this video has more dislikes than likes
This man just called Small Worlds “silly” smh
Unsubscribe!
Mac becoming such a good rapper and then singing terribly instead is like Usain Bolt shot putting.
This album is Beautiful.   You&#39;re trippin
Dang dude, I actually enjoyed this album. Shame.
Wrong wrong wrong wrong
Hilarious, I can’t agree more...macs gotta step it up
Oh no.. Red Flannel !
Fuckethy youtano
yikes L<br>this might be mac&#39;s best album so far u trippin melon
Red flannel, this gotta be a 3
DAMN. 7/10, this like to dislike ratio is wild
Mac Miller was speaking from his heart on this album and even if you can&#39;t relate to what he was saying I respect it and think this is one of his better albums he&#39;s put out.
This is a garbage review
B I A S
3 × 3 = 9
Fantano really dislikes Mac&#39;s singing so he really dislikes this album.<br>I really like Mac&#39;s singing so I really like this album.<br>Everyone has their own opinions.
Better run melon, the natives are getting restless
Heavily disagree. Wtf is this review. Review again
THE DISLIKES I CAN&#39;T
3 MBDTFs out of 6
Jesus the dislikes are lethal on this 💀💀💀
Albums fire fuck outta here
Deafheaven and now mac?? That red flannel is a fucking killer
Listened to macadelic like 1000 times listening to this album .5 times feelsbadman
What the fuck?
L
Nah, you get an L for this fam
Trash review, not a mac fan but I enjoyed this
Shallowthony Reviewtano here.. the internet&#39;s laziest music nerd.. here to give another shallow review because I&#39;m too busy trying to find out where my mustache went.
HOW YOU GONNA HURT MY SOUL LIKE THIS??
blasphemy
Lol mac Miller fans wildin
Well I asked for it . I blame myself
You do one this is his opinion, right?
I think if he kept the same tempo and style in the second half as he had in the first half of the record, like the funky beats and just the general groovy style. I think it could’ve been a solid 7 to a light 8.
so much more enjoyable, fun, interesting and groovy han that astroworld shit for example. can&#39;t believe that crap is glorified.
NOOOOOOO WROOONG
No
I liked it tho
I thought it was boring too
I really dug the production on this album actually.
you talked about Mac&#39;s pretentiousness but guess who came off as a pretentious douche instead? that was the laziest video i&#39;ve ever seen from Fantano.
Unsubbed
Oh wow. A 3??? Yeah man I’m going to totally disagree with you on this review. This album is definitely a decent to light 7 at least.
o cara passa o vídeo inteiro chamando o Mac Miller de pretensioso da forma mais pretensiosa possível. uma das críticas mais preguiçosas que já vi na vida sobre qualquer coisa.
I disagree
Mac&#39;s best project was Faces. Fight me
You didn’t even mention how good the lyricism is throughout the project.
No
Melon you done messed up
You are out of you’re mind it’s supposed to be smooth like water
You&#39;re wild for this. Good album. 7/10
Melon, I formally do not agree with your consensus on this album. Please confirm my opinion. Tell me what to like so that I may feel like my objective rating is justified.
You are actually tripping this time
Uh oh, people don’t like your OPINION guess they better dislike and leave hate comments.
Well....... this is dissapointing
This review is one of his worst of all time. If Father John Misty and Death Grips did a Christmas collab album, he’d give it a 10. Mac makes a very fluent and cohesive piece and he shits on it because Mac moans too much.
Ok stinky rotten melon!!!! While doesn&#39;t feel very original and the vocals can get tiring at parts, I really enjoyed a lot of the songs of Swimming. It totally caught me off guard. Genuinely enjoyable and replayable album. Nothing less than a 6/10 imo.
Nicethony Threetano shoulda given a weak 2 for how sad this album is as a whole in the music industry.<br><br>Imagine drowning in a tank of clear molasses, and outside that tank are good albums you could be listening to, that was my experience trying to make it through this whole album. It&#39;s upsetting how needlessly smothering the bad and muffled EVERYTHING is in this album. The only talent Mac brings to this album is the ability to speak semi-coherently as he wears a ball gag.
No way bro cannot agree with this one
I don’t understand how this gets a 3/10 but lil pump’s basic ass got a 7/10 😂
If Death Grips released this album it would have gotten a 9
i  agree. i used to love mac millers music but everything after faces was not good. i was a little hyped after the single he droped but then as i listen to the album i got sooooo bored.
couldn&#39;t disagree more
I give it a 7.5/10 tbh
LOL Mac Miller fanboys are worse than J.Cole &amp; Drake fanboys
Nahhhhhhh this Macs best album yet. Solid 8 no doubt
Wow this video have more dislikes than likes. And rightfully so
Cmon bruh....
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, 3?!
could this be another dark point in melon&#39;s career?
You missed the whole point of the album
I knew you were gonna hate the singing on this, that was gonna be no surprise but damn you just cheated him on this one. I&#39;ve never watched a review of yours I disagree more with and I generally agree with most of your reviews and if I didn&#39;t, I could understand where you are coming from. This review? I can&#39;t even grasp an understanding. It almost hurts me to allow myself to respect your opinion on this one.  I wish you would&#39;ve at least gone into more detail of why you felt like it is a 3/10 <br><br>You really must be off the goop today. IMO it is around a light 7/10
I like the album
Honestly if you gave Astroworld a 7 (which I agree with) then this deserved at least a 6, absolute lowest score 5. I respect your opinion but damn
Wow it&#39;s almost like people can have different opinions
You fucked up Macthony Miltano
R.I.P.
I don&#39;t understand you people. You want his unbiased opinion, but then you slander him for it and dislike the video when you disagree with it. His verdict isn&#39;t stopping anyone else from liking the album, it&#39;s just providing a different point of view. Grow up lmao
i can honestly say nothing fantano said in this one was correct but it’s all an opinion
Great review, but can you stop STARGAZING from ASTROWORLD <br>And Come Back to Earth and start Swimming.
I&#39;m usually within 1 or 2 points of reviews, but this time I heavily disagree with you. I think this is the first time you have made points that I didn&#39;t at least see your point of. I enjoyed this album quite thoroughly.
I didn&#39;t expect you to be so hard on this album. Though you are right on many points, I&#39;m surprised that you didn&#39;t focus on the positive aspects of the album, especially considering you&#39;re so fond of the kids see ghosts and ye albums, which are also very personal and contain half decent singing
FUCK YOU MELON :((((((((((((((((((((
Santigold
Bruh you so backwards sometimes lol, this album 🔥
Wow, that like/dislike ratio hit me like a sack of bricks, but I agree with y&#39;all. This album isn&#39;t super spectacular but it DEFINITELY isn&#39;t a 3/10; I think Shawn Cee&#39;s score was pretty accurate: a 6/10 - 7/10. But then, this is coming from a guy who disagrees with <b>a lot</b> of melon&#39;s scores... I watch him for the commentary and to be introduced to new music, not really for his taste.
I have never disagreed with you so much on an album. You just hate mac miller. This album was good.
This is why melons don&#39;t deserve ears.
Go fuck urself
he didn&#39;t even listen to it
Fantano ain’t recovering from this one
Disagree completely but everyone&#39;s got their own opinion so it&#39;s cool
Macthony Millano here
You really thought this was it huh?
I can see where ohthany notano is coming from but in my opinion every time Mac puts out another project it’s better than the last.
You’re washed up, Melon. I give you a 3/10.
Not liking an artist&#39;s voice is such an unfortunate, but completely valid excuse for not like their music as a whole. If you&#39;re a fan of Mac Miller&#39;s singing (like me) then this album is so fucking good, but if you&#39;re not, I could completely understand someone like Anthony not liking this album or divine Feminine at all.
This ain&#39;t it m8 this album is tight
this is almost worse then when you gave The OOZ a 4
This album was really boring for me. I think you have to be in a certain mood to listen to it because it’s just so bland tbh. Some decent instrumentals but the songs sorta just mesh together and forgetful for me
How do people still take this fool seriously? 3/10? This fucking guy is stupid and I get that it&#39;s just an opinion but holy shit I&#39;ve never seen such a stuck up, pretentious prick before. Stop giving this shitty ass viewer attention.
Daaaaaaamn!!
Am I delusional? I really really liked mac miller’s last 2 albums. I think melon is 100% wrong about this album and the last. How can you call these instrumentals flat??
the moment I liked the album I knew he was going to throw it into the trash
Goddamn how&#39;d this get so many dislikes
album was ass i agree with ur opinion
Meanwhile YG&#39;s shit album getting 5/10
I dont have a problem with opinions but its dumb when he treats his opinion like its a worldwide fact
(hannibal buress voice) WHY ARE YOU BOOING MELON? HE&#39;S RIGHT!
Beware gentleman, a storm is coming
Astroworld got a seven but this a three.......what
THOU ART WRONGFUL MELON
So like i been following Melon for a little over a year now and i still dont understand what that sound is in the beginning and why he puts that sound in
Unfortunately I don’t believe this review properly looks at the context for which the album is written. The running themes across the album of flying vs being grounded, swimming vs drowning, and acceptance of what he has done vs where he is now are all ignored here. I think it goes far deeper than this being an attempt at being “syrupy alternative R&amp;B.”
I honestly feel like you hate Mac Miller. I respect your opinion, but how does one hate this project as well as faces
I dead ass thought this was gonna top astroworld :o
Review boy in jeans by Ryan Beatty
You are TWEAKING oss
I don&#39;t generally like/dislike videos on YouTube... I generally stay neutral. However, I had to dislike this review... It&#39;s almost as if because Mac isn&#39;t doing what you think he should based on a box you&#39;ve constructed for him you gave his project a overly negative review. I really enjoyed this project, and clearly many, many, many, many, (did I say many?) others have... I cannot fathom how you gave this project such a low score but hey... like you always say: &quot;Y&#39;all know this is just my opinion, right?&quot; I am aware, so it&#39;s all love and I respect your content... but your review gets a light to decent hell naw from me Anthony. Tran...sistion.
Ok it’s not THAT bad. Like a 5-6
Really can’t agree with you here melon, thought the project was a solid 8/10. Not a big Mac Miller fan either. Not feeling it melon, not feeling it at all.
melon is probably going to give the new lil pump album a strong 10
brah is yall musician?
Melon head getting off this whole time
u high fantano
Even WMWTSO had great tracks he could perfect an album with
love u melon
agreed what happened to GOOD AM
You buggin with this one, melon.
Melon!!! what are you smoking?!?!?!
I usually agree with you a lot, but I disagree on this. Wasn’t really into the Divine Feminine but I fucked with this joint. But whatevs keep melon like a felon.
YOU LEAVE MAC ALONE
You messed up.... Again
Damn melon the first mac album i heard since macadelic and you give it a 3/10?
The way you come across in this entire review is pretentious asf lmao. Respect your opinion for SURE but likeee you don&#39;t have to be like that :/
Big L
I am not. Nor have I ever been a Mac Miller fan....but this album was dope. You’re buggin
it&#39;s true it&#39;s all true it&#39;s not good
Melon imma need u to delet dis
I disagree with you completely
God damn
The Flower Boy/Swimming comparison make so much sense. Where Mac’s ‘revelations’ meant that he wanted to own every component of this entire album to deliver his big idea, Tyler recognised that he needed help. Can you imagine if Mac got Rex to sing on self-care... god it would be so much better
I agree with the comparison to Tyler the Creator&#39;s maturation process in his musicality, but the review for the album as a whole seems unreasonable and I think you just miss the always stoned drunk as fxxk Mac
I wholeheartedly disagree :]
I feel like someone like Anderson. Paak over those instrumentals would give a performance waaaaaay better than Mac miller did. (Edit: I thought the production was actually pretty good this album’s a 5 imo)
Will you review trippie redd’s “Life is a tour” when it drops?
C’mon man lol
I give this review a 1/10 and this album a 7/10
melon you don&#39;t know about heartache, it&#39;s both your strength and weakness
Lol the butthurt
Brutal.
I was disappointed with this album, kinda wanted another watching movies with the sound off type album
The album is good... gorgeous instrumentals.. I personally enjoyed macs vocals, especially on 2009... I didn’t like this album first listen, but it grew on me a lot.
HOW MUCH DID PETE DAVIDSON PAY YOU MELON?! HOW MUCH?
bahahaha mac miller is trash and this record proves it, finally agree with melon. Oh and Astroworld is album of the year.
You tripping on this one Mellon
Was not expecting him to be so harsh. I pretty much forgot about Mac since Watching Movies but this album is great.
Y’all know this was just his opinion right?
It&#39;s to bad because that track Carnage came out with ft. Mac Miller was fire 🔥
man I love mac but melon is so right <br><br>faces part two tho<br><br>that&#39;ll be a ten
I dont agree with Melon often but i gotta say he hit the nail on this one. Mac isnt trying anything different than we haven&#39;t seen before, going into swimming it feels like he didn&#39;t have an exact direction for the album at all. Alot of the tracks sounds similar with the spacey beats with his similar singing pattern. The album had zero to no substance whatsoever and failed to have more diverse songs like Divine feminine. This wasnt it chief.
r/im14andthisisdeep
Why&#39;d you Mac Miller fans click this video????<br>You saw the red flannel!<br>It&#39;s like making a whole album obsessing over a girl, and getting dumped instantly. What did you expect??
Incoming triggered sorority girls
Lol no
ur actually a piece of shit
This AINT it
I’m sorry Anthony but...<br><br>Your opinion is W R O N G
A 3 nah u outta pocket on this, it&#39;s at the minimum a 6 at the average a 7-8
Thanks for forming my opinion on this album Anthony even tho I haven&#39;t listened to it
I usually agree with melon, but this one was a 8 out of 10 for me
It&#39;s the red flannel. Oh no.
Melon.....
confirmed: melon hates jews
Nah you way off on this one my man
Nigga what credentials do you have beside your head lookin like a bongo drum
Sadly I didn&#39;t like this Album by Mac. He&#39;s my favorite artist but man, I can&#39;t get with his last 2 albums, but even TDF was better than this. But Good am and WMWTSO are my favorite. I wish he&#39;d go back to actual rapping, but if he&#39;s happy with his life then I can&#39;t truly complain.
Melon... you are wrong. This was 7 to light 8. Listen to it again
Confirmed fanty gives emotional albums low scores bc he&#39;s never fallen in love himself
Controversial already. Wow. I think that&#39;s a new record
Nigga
review the new iglooghost
It&#39;s weird because I liked what I was hearing on the first listen but I haven&#39;t really gone back to it
Sometimes you gotta agree to disagree
oOOF
I liked this album although most of the songs didn’t grab me as some of the tracks such as “Self Care” did. tracks that I do enjoy are about half or so of the album. I think the more moody and open feeling tracks such as “2009” bring me back to a simpler time and I personally connected with it more then expected. The more commercial tracks such as “Ladders” didn’t grab me as much but for the few songs that did, it really hit me in an emotional standpoint that I can’t help but to replay over and over. I do agree he needs work in the overall album but Mac I believe has come along way from the frat boy we all got to know in “Blue Slide Park” and hope to see him more frequently in music today. The personal aspect is something I personally look to more then a head banger track that will leave my head after a week or so. Speaking from someone with emotional struggles, I can’t help but feel a stronger pull to someone who is coming from a dark place and learning to smile and enjoy living life again as Mac has shown through this album.
It seems like most of the comments like the album
You know when it&#39;s red its bad
You’re trippn
i waited for this review just to be let down by melon. Strong record Decent 7/10
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgwPxFUUg94&amp;t=100">1:40</a> farty
fantano took the L
Love the album
ima keep it real with you chief, this aint it
Old Navy called, they want their flannels back
Fantano is trippin&#39;
These scores are so unpredictable holy shit. Swimming was great tho you trippin melon!!!!
How do people still like this man&#39;s reviews I&#39;m not a Mac Miller fan so don&#39;t call me butthurt for a bad review but he only gives good scores to sounds he likes if he doesn&#39;t like a certain sound for example calling Earl&#39;s music to depressing sounding he will just give it a bad review or give a good popular album a lower score to gather attention
L
Yo you keep trashing this album imma have no choice but to beat ya goofy ass
Its not very often I get seriously upset over a score but seriously?
Jesus that was harsh<br>I thought it would net at least a 5
There was a comment on the AstroWorld review that pretty much deciphered what his flannels mean. <br>0 to 5 is the red flannel <br>6 to 7 is the orange flannel <br>8 to 10 is the yellow flannel.<br> Not wrong so far...
Dislike to like ratio tells the story lol
Totally agree....this album is weak...I really enjoyed faces and watching movies type Mac
This opinion is hardcore wrong
Honestly thought swimming was a pleasant improvement over divine feminine, but i respect your opinion fantwan meltano
Melon hates white rappers
So lil pump. Lil Pump. Gets a 7/10. But this gets a 3? I’m amazed.
Mac Miller is boring period
at least a 6 bruh
A 3 ???? A FUCKING 3 !!!! Smfh unfucking believable you bald headed Melon fuck
No nooooo nooo nooooo noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo fuck no
it’s <b>REAL FLANNEL HOUR</b> boys
This album is pretty dope lol
I require a pray for the wicked review.
This ain&#39;t it chief
This is the first time I deadass feel Melon is literally trying to hate this album. Is this some YouTube analytics shit?
Nah this ain’t it
interesting, i really liked it
Wow this was the review I disagree with the most, of all of your reviews. Previously, it was Doris.
Damn. I’d give it at least a 6. I’m enjoying it.
So you can review Mac Miller but not Charlie Puth... okay melon
Absolutely no way this album is 3/10 you hack
Review alien boy EP by Oliver tree
I like about halfway thru this when he just starts ruthlessly dragging it
What if you wanted to get into heaven, but God said, &quot;nahh, remember when you gave Mac Miller a 3/10, nephew&quot;
Yikes
Mac miller raps like he got a cigarette in his mouth
Melon, I think you switched the scores between this album and Stay Dangerous and published the reviews anyway
Sooooo basically Mac nailed the kind of vibe he was going for on this album
MELON  HEAD you are insane for your opinion, I&#39;ve only listened to two songs off the album and even I know this is at least a 5.<br>You clearly are a hater cause he got that grande pooty tang
I found this project to be very pure and focused. I appreciate that Mac embraced his chill side and didn&#39;t force bangers or sounds that were outside of his current state of mind. Felt connected to him here. I don&#39;t see how someone could hate this THAT much.
MORE DISLIKES THAN LIKES IM SORRY MELON
Lifeless, spacey, bland? 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
Ok. I&#39;ve calmed down. I SEVERELY disagree with you on this one. It&#39;s one of the best hip-hop albums this year. NO way is it a 3. Not in the slightest. I&#39;m sorry. First dislike I&#39;ve ever given you.
Imma kill my self
ouch mane.... that&#39;s kinda stiff.. fair play though
You hurt my feelings, Antwan. No better than Ariana.
I have not been agreeing with melon recently. Ye is straight garbage. This album is solid. Astroworld is at least a light the decent 8. Damn is the same imo.
I&#39;m glad this loser is finally getting called out
I wasn’t a big fan of this album but a 3 really a 5 or 6 fits a lot better imo
I don&#39;t agree melon. I don&#39;t agree. It was therapeutic. Leave this soul alone.
this aint it
U tripping
Fantano being wrong as usual
He hates white people with a full set of hair obviously
Been a fan for like 7 years now, this is his worst album imo. And the divine feminine is right under that. Only song I liked off of Swimming was the first song
Fantano hates white/lightskin rappers
I’m confused
I&#39;ve been a Mac fan since Kids, have to say didn&#39;t care for Divine. However I do think the new LP has improved his sound for me since and has as much enjoyment as Taboo by Denzel.
Also is Mac’s music was never immature. It was more fun and care free. If getting older and maturer makes you a little less fun and happy more so content. Then shit , i dont want no parts of it.
I don&#39;t know if this is it, chief. <br><br>Didn&#39;t have to say that a white man&#39;s 3 is a black man&#39;s 7, didn&#39;t really know where that came from.
Gonna have to disagree on this one. I personally loved the album
The masses seem to disagree Anthony
Melon with another 10!
I think the melon is rotten
Trash review smh
People who say this is trash are people who do shit trap beats lol these dudes can’t understand anything else apart from cold necklaces and gold Rolexes
FUCK THIS BITCH ASS REVIEW. SWIMMING IS FUCKING FANTASTIC!!!
A three is pretty savage. Especially from a Melon
It&#39;s reviews like these that make me wonder if you legit listened to this album. How the fuck is this album effortless and bland? I&#39;m sure Lil Yachty deserves a better rating though...
The like ratio ?!?!
There&#39;s nothing about this record that&#39;s &quot;emotionally vacant&quot;, after years of watching your reviews, this is the first one that just makes you sounds like a douche.
Melon&#39;s gon catch some heat for this one.<br><br>Edit: Fuck sake the dislikes lol
been downhill for mac miller since Faces
WHAT IN THE MOTHERFUCKING SHIT IS THIS!?!?!? BOI THIS ALBUM WAS AS SOLID AS MY ERECT DICK SO IT GOES, WINGS, JET FUEL, COME BACK TO EARTH, CONVERSATION PT.1 AND SELF CARE ALL FUCKING RIDE LIKE A TOP NOTCH PROSTITUTE. PUT RESPECT ON MAC&#39;S NAME.
NOTHONY NOTANO. THIS IS WRONG
Do skinny vegans think Melon is Swole? He’s not. He can’t lift. His traps are a 2. His delts are a 2. His pecs are nonexistent. His lats are a 2. And overall I’m feeling a light 3 on Melons lifting progression.
Had to do it to em
This is so biased dude... he disliked the album because he doesn’t like his voice. Imo, if you’re a music reviewer you can’t review something based on what you like!! Disappointed Anthony, you’ve lost my respect.
I tried to listen to it but it was too slow
Pretty bad album imo
WHAt
Mac Stans out in force<br><br>Not a single song stood out. At least Divine Feminine had Dang!
Nah
no
HURTTHONY FEELINGSTANO
I&#39;m sorry melon, this ain&#39;t it. It&#39;s a 7, not a 3.
DAMN😂 a fuckin 3 <br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ruthless">#Ruthless</a> <br>Jawn was solid
I felt like u listened to this album at a  complete surface level experience and payed no attention to the themes, ideas lyricism and cohesiveness of this album, but i can agree the singing could have been better. I&#39;m not a mac miller fan but i enjoyed this album more than astroworld
Melon has never liked chill music
boi if you DONT review Nostrum Grocers<br><br>i&#39;ll jv3 you with my Dedede
Confirmed that Mac is gonna die soon I guess
4 points too low
It was better than Astroworld tho!? 💁🏾‍♂️
Are you fucking delusional Fantano?
Oh na bro take this review back and change flannels cause this was actually amazing you 4 eyed melon
I&#39;m a fan of Mac&#39;s work, for real, since his early projects... but Swimming is just &quot;ok&quot;, it doesn&#39;t deserve a 3, but it&#39;s not as good as people are saying. I really think that Mac&#39;s singing skills are bad, so it doesn&#39;t help the album... Watching Movies and FACES are still his best projects in my opinion
fuck off melon
I couldn&#39;t disagree more with everything Fantano said about this album.  I give it at least an 8/10
this is what people said was better than astroworld?? lmaoo
this ain’t it chief
oh boohoo alexa play Pete Davidson
But u gave astroworld a 7 u fucking belon
Fuccbois are PISSED at this video lol
Mac has always been trash, why is this surprising to anyone
i dont know shit about this record but seeing the like/dislike ratio i guess its pretty good
Wack
Come Back to Earth, Self Care, Conversations pt. 1, Jet Fuel ⛽️ . Melon is bugging for giving this a 3.
Weeeeeeeak review
Missed the mark with this one
I thought Mac’s singing was good tbh
Let&#39;s ageee to a degree
I loved this album
You know when melon puts on the red flannel he&#39;s about to suplex an artist into the ground
I don’t get you melon. 3 out of 10. Really?
Nah this ain’t it chief
You really trash this, but dickride Post Malone because he name dropped you... sellthony outtano
I&#39;m sure it sounded great stoned when they recorded it
Harsh melon
Go back to reviewing obscure progressive death metal albums Tony
My regrets look just like reviews I shouldn’t have made
I have never commented before but I cannot disagree with you more. I would say it’s a 6-7 but no lower. <br><br>I didn’t like TDF at all just as you didn’t but Idk, this project seemed to carry a strong feeling straight through the entire tracklist, even in the songs I didn’t like a lot
I WAS EXPECTING YELLOW TF?
This ain’t it brodie
wtf delet this melon
FUCK YOU
I think 3 is really harsh even for melon
damn yikes
You gay as heck
First time I disagree with you bro, this album was good. It’s chill with simple good beats. Something not trappy in a world where drake sounds like trap and Travis dropping astroworld
Melon hasn&#39;t been this wrong about an album since Stoney
bruh what.
I’m creating more accounts to downvote this video
Damn. Not a huge Mac fan but couldn’t disagree more on this one. “Bland” beats? Really?
This was a 7 Melon. A 7.
Melon, I’m sorry but you trippin
This project is at least a 6 in my opinion
Always hating on my boy mac
Mac Miller sadboys are in full effect
what the fuck dog
this album was beautiful from start to finish. I rate this project a 9/10.  you should review Marlowe (L&#39;Orange &amp; Solemn Brigham) - Marlowe.
Oof... The melon speaks truth even if hurts :&#39;(
review my dog snoring
You’re telling me this was worse than the literal pile of shit that was YGs new album
<b>O O F</b>
Damn RED FLANNEL always in for that
I think this will go down in history as one of Anthony&#39;s most controversial reviews, right up there with House of Balloons and MBDTF
Melon enjoyed that lil pump and smokepurp song but said this album is bad.. bruh
Dawg.... THIS IS MY FAVORITE MAC MILLER ALBUM OF ALL TIME!!! Melon is about to be sliced open for this one!  Smh 🤦‍♂️
Bitch fuck Mac Miller this album was trash, great review melon!!
This album grew on me as I listened to more and more. Anthony has told about some albums that he hated at first but like now. I feel like this will be the case with this album
Can&#39;t believe you&#39;ve done this.. Actually I can but is it really that much worse than YG&#39;s joint? Bruh
Idk how you can say the beats are bland. Idk man.  You&#39;re fucking weird.
NOOOOOOOOOOOO MELON YOUVE GONE TOO FAR THIS TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Jk you’re wrong tho (for the most part)
The most absurd review I have ever heard
one of fantano’s worst reviews of 2018.
Y&#39;all can&#39;t be serious this shit was ass bruh mac needs to go back to rapping faces and kids are hands down his best projects
Start doing something else with your life please!!
I quite can&#39;t put my finger on it, but I think Melon doesn&#39;t like this one 🚯🍈
I haven’t heard the album but judging by the dislikes I’m guessing Melon fucked up
Love you melon, but this ain’t it chief
Is this the new Stoney album for the melon?
Damn this review is an L
My predictions are impeccable lool
ouch.. at least give sweetener a 10 to create some drama
His label didnt send you a check so you give him a 3, nice.
I see the points you were making but it ain’t a 3. Definitely had more potential than what was given
It wasn’t that bad
Not feelin this review tbh
lol.....it did WORK. just not for you
L for people that thought Astroworld would get this score or lower looooooool Mac Miller trash
Melon be swimming in those dislikes
Usually I laugh at how triggered people get when u give a shit score but now I&#39;m the triggered one
I’m glad this album resonated with a lot of other people as well, I enjoyed it
Damn, hugely disagree with your opinion on his singing. Disappointed with the seeming surface level commentary on that facet. You just seem like you&#39;re saying is bad because it&#39;s bad. You say that he doesn&#39;t have a quirk to make his singing interesting when you just call all his quriks &#39;bad singing&#39;.
I think it was bad but not that bad
Nah chief
We all hate you today melon
C&#39;mon meloné, this was at least a 6/10
This is some MBDTF shit
You buggin
I&#39;m not even a fan of Mac Miller but this was a solid album.
Wack filler most boring rapper!!!
SOOOOOOOO overly harsh. This album is Macs best one yet imo! FU dude
More dislikes than likes... whoa
Ennthony Uitano
How Astroworld get a 7. Melon Illuminati confirmed.
I agree with your criticisms but I enjoyed the album and thought it was at least a 6. Wish Mac would have harnessed the darkness because I loved his more moody albums.
Wow the dislikes 😱😱  people seems to not agree with you 🍉
This is the most I’ve disagreed with melon in awhile. He might not like the sound but there is no denying that this album was at least okay. I personally thought it was solid. Sonically sounded good and Mac Miller had some good flows and introspective songs. Super disappointed but agree to disagree.
No
I liked that album tho
This ain&#39;t it, chief.
Fuck off fantano :( solid 6.5/10
this ain&#39;t it chief
Definitely not your best review.
I fucking love this album
The two white artists Eminem and Mac Miller both got a 3. Fantano is so blatantly racist smh...
If Divine Feminine didn’t come out he would of gave it atleast a 6. Unfortunately prejudice won here
I was half expecting him to compare it to The Ooz.
how? this really was a very good album showing him growing and evolving. his execution was amazing.
Ok this review was pure ass cheeks
can finally hate this album now
I agree 100% with Anthony.. Divine Feminism and Go:od Am were incredible projects and he gave incredible Scores.. But let&#39;s keep it real Mac&#39;s heart wasn&#39;t in Swimming Mac is better than that, he should&#39;ve gave Blood, Sweat, And Tears in this project... So we forget who the fuck Pete Davidson is..... But it wasn&#39;t this Album✌🏾
Know what, ever since your faces review, I knew you’d always have this little bias toward mac miller. I respect your opinion, but shit man do I ever pity you for not feeling the soul this guy emits.
Worst part about this review is that he takes absolutely no time to break down songs he doesn&#39;t care for in-depth. Rather he just starts making generalized statements bashing every aspect of this mans style.. boo Melon!
:(
3/10 review here melon
i disagree <b>angry face</b> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>however, i respects the mellon&#39;s opinions and will defend him on them because I am a good human being and would rather listen to someone&#39;s opinions and understand them than shut them down. <br> praise cheez itz <b>prayer hands emoji</b>
&quot;revving farty synthesizer&quot; the like to dislike ratio says it all melon.
this video make me wanna peel my skin off
I was feeling alone when everyone was praising this album. Glad to see that someone agrees.
Ima keep it real with you chief, this ain’t it, thought this album was his best 7/10 for me
Have you ever been more wrong?
3 the fuck
I saw the red flannel and got sad
This guy has a very punchable face.
Bit
Wtf y’all sleeping
Cmon bruh this album is so beautiful
You&#39;re actually tripping 😵😵😵
u hate on him just cause he&#39;s black melon
Idk, although the points you bring up are completely valid, for me at least they add to the charm of the album. Mac&#39;s taking it as a snapshot of his life right now, between accepting his past relationship ending and the wake-up call he had with that driving accident amongst other things he&#39;s been going through. Yeah, he can&#39;t sing for shit, but I enjoyed the parts when he does cause I feel that&#39;s him being raw and truthful with his music. He could&#39;ve gone for a more varied production like he used to, or gotten people to feature for singing and hooks, but it wouldn&#39;t have been right, and a different message with the album. Idk where he goes next with it, but I thoroughly enjoyed this album
yeah this an L
This melon&#39;s getting sour ):
Idk y i kinda like macs off tune singing in self care
hes right, the first track was cool but wow it took a nosedive after that lol
wtf
DISLIKES SAYS IT all <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23swmimming">#swmimming</a>
Smh melon
Is this is it chief?
Melon you&#39;re bugging on this one.
Melon drops the review! and damn a 3 can&#39;t wait for the drop bought the pocket Tee &amp; DL for it keep doing &amp; rocking w/ the reviews lémélon!
3 is heart breaking but he also gave FACES a 6 when its arguably on of the greatest mixtapes ever made.
Damn, I thought this was a great album I’d give it like an 8
I was excited about this record after hearing self care, but over all i didnt think it was as bad as melon said, id say more like a soft 5
A 3! A fucking 3
3 is generous vro
I relate to Mac miller in a lot of ways and because of that I am a huge Mac miller fan. I understand why people wouldn’t like the album but it’s great for me
my beautiful dark twisted fantasy review part 2
This album will always be amazing to me
this shit was trash thanks for validating me. talk your shit melon
Mac just got FLANNEL&#39;D
I just can&#39;t agree... This album is so great. It sucks you don&#39;t like his singing.
Ariana may have stomped on his heart, but melon CRUSHED his heart.
uh oh melon insulted a white rapper, this isn&#39;t gonna go over well
Confirmed Ariana grande leaves Pete Davidson for the melon
I&#39;m genuinely surprised you gave it a light to decent 3. Your opinions on music end up surprisingly lining up with what I was thinking before I get to your review, but lol not this time. I thought the album was at least a solid 6-7.
didnt think so many people would disagree i thought it was pretty boring as well
As a fan of Mac I think I can get passed his voice but damn Anthony can’t let Mac try to sing he really tries lol. Still a 8/10 I can relate to Mac miller too much.
goteem
Ladders is a jâm
Majority of Kids See Ghosts (if not all) was abnormal, unnecessary sounds with hardly any vocal dialogue and you gave that a 10 because of its “depth and message” behind each of those songs despite how poorly they were delivered. You state that Miller has understated bars but don’t provide examples unlike Drake’s verse on Sicko Mode on Astroworld which you didn’t like but still liked the song regardless as a whole (Drake says he’s taking a Xan for a flight trip but not for the night, wow such lyricism). If anything, this album should’ve gotten at least a 5-6. I feel like it’s an extension of TDF since it doesn’t have a true enough identity to differentiate itself from TDF.
He brought out the red flannel, melon going straight for the jugular
Lmao this is so wrong
white on white violence
DAVID BOWIE WORST TO BEST.
Mac miller is wack
Switch the scores for AstroWorld and this album and we have a winner
aww little cry baby mac miller fans, you fucking losers
Vegans smh
2009 is the best song on the album I like how his voice sounds he sounds hurt . It’s a 8/10 for me
Oh jesus I see red<br><br><br>No matter i love this album
Chief I swear to go THIS IS NOT IT
This deserved a 5.
Bitch
Y&#39;all know this is just my opinion right?
This is the first time that I can think of that I’ve watched a review I’ve strongly disagreed with you on. Not gonna leave a dislike or anything, just odd that it was this album you ended up hating so much
Respectfully disagreeing with this review. It’s a very heartfelt album with great songs, ‘2009’ being one of the best songs this year in my opinion.
more like mac filler amirite
WTF
So far you’re the only person I’ve seen that hates this album. I enjoyed it for the most part
Oh wow you didn&#39;t love what&#39;s the use?!? Stupid melon 😡
This is the first time where it feels to me that anthony didnt gave an album a chance at all.
switch the scores from swimming and astroworld
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgwPxFUUg94&amp;t=111">1:51</a>
Holy horrible review, this album was solid
Nah you wrong on this one melon.
So true i dont know why he is trying to go out his strengths...wiated 2 years for this album and like 3 songs i actually like while 2 I like bc I&#39;m just such a biased fan. He really let me down with his last 3 releases...in fact his 2 best songs ever havent even been released . I&#39;ll see if i can find the snipbit and I&#39;ll link it here ...trust me if you hear this snipbit you&#39;ll see why i was So disappointed in macs new direction .... *update I found the link
Really thought this would be your favorite mac miller album :(
Why don&#39;t you just admit that you hate white people, melon
&quot;outside his strength&quot; <br><br><br>daaaaamn
BREAKING NEWS:<br><br>Another popular rapper turned up dead last night after popular Youtube music critic “Anthony Fantano” gave yet another red-flannel death review
I&#39;ll disagree when I find the will to finish the album because that beginning is so drab and boring (I wish he would&#39;ve taken his time on it, like out the door I can hear it could be better). I doubt it&#39;s a 3 though XD
yikes.
The lack of enthusiasm on this album is definitely to be noticed. It&#39;s like Mac Miller is just saying &quot;meh...&quot; throughout the length of the album. Not literally but that&#39;s the attitude.
god damn when i saw that red flannel i was so shocked
off gas with this one chief
Damn bro that’s a little tough don’t you think? I mean this is at least <b>atleast</b> a 6 for me
lol wot.
The white boys will not forget this anthony
I got soooooo tired listening to this album this rating is perfect
This ain’t it chief
no
Fucking Review Westside Gunn - Supreme Blientele
Melon I love you but your very very wrong
TERRIBLE review.
This score is what Astroworld should have gotten
L
I didn’t love this albums. I didn’t dislike this album.. I did how ever somehow feel attacked by this video.  You crazy for this one
dang..<br>i still love it 8/10 for me
at the very least i think it was a 5.. AT THE VERY LEAST
just because the music isnt “exciting” or “energetic” doesnt mean the music is bad. theres no way this should be a three.
I agree tho, makes sense. Like 4 songs in I was like, &quot;wtf is he saying, sounds like he&#39;s mumbling.&quot; only Self Care was somewhat decent
so WRONG HOW CAN U BE SO WRONG
oh shit the dislikes
Mac miller was never good
sorry fam, you missed it
well, I didn&#39;t expect that......
I haven&#39;t listened to the album cause his feet in the cover are gross
Wrongthony Wrongtano here
you are on dum my man, you are truly off the goop on this one.
saw the red flannel and never insta-disliked anything in my life
I’d take this album over astroworld everyday of the week
Have to agree with him here, this project is the musical equivalent of a wet blanket soaked in lean.
Huge huge huge fan of mac ...i agree with the rating ....
This was a solid 7 at least
He gives Pump a 7 but this a 3...Why is this guy relevant again?
melon don’t give a f... kicking a dog while it’s down
oh yes melon
I thought melon was not going to like Astroworld. WRONG <br><br>I thought melon was going to like Swimming. WRONG
Mac is wack
Brb imma go down to the post office to send out the L to your PO box
Swimming is easily Mac’s worst album yet
this album sucked thank you
This guy has obviously never been dumped
Anyone knows the name of the albums back there?
Oof. Another MBDF video.
how dare you melon!!!!!!
Shit, this like ratio is about to be baddds
Mac’s simplicity is what makes him great to me... Nothing deeper than the surface, just listen, relate, and relax type of music.
Can we get a F for Peggy?
He gave it a 3 to spare him from Peep&#39;s fate. It was really a not good
One of the funniest comment sections in a while
I have a feeling that you just don&#39;t like R&amp;B
Forgive him Mac, the red flannel makes him angry
I always messed with Mac&#39;s music, but this album was pretty underwhelming, maybe I need to re-listen if so many people think it&#39;s great.
Awww, little mac miller fans mad? Fuckin pussies
excuse me melon, but this review is incorrect
Naw your wrong about this needle. Swimming is the album of the year
Excuse me what?
Get that melon checked melon boi. It&#39;s a solid 7/10.
Did you know that with enough momentum a kangaroo can do a front flip?
Ligthony Matano
I liked this album, he conveys almost no emotion around emotional beats. Like he cares so little about grand things happening around him. It might not be what he was going for but I still enjoy it
Now Mac is gonna die somehow... Fantano keeps killing these huge artists!
Fuck you melon
jk but with this I don&#39;t agree :l
Should have been a 7
I usually agree with your reviews but this one is off melon this album was amazing, raw and honest. Gotta love an artist vulnerability. Doesn’t deserve a red flannel 👎🏾
that&#39;s why you do the little tap on a melon before you buy it.. u done goofed
Holy shit more dislikes than likes I’ve never seen this
melon, you’re a smart guy, but you’re an idiot. deserves 7-8
Though I liked the album, I agree with the Melon in the sense that I think everyone will forget about this album in less than a year. The sound isn&#39;t really bold at all, but it&#39;s definitely enjoyable.
This ain’t it
Big wrong

Totally disagree. 7.5 out of 10
this is very correct thanks for keeping it based tony
no u.
Dude fell off and just can&#39;t... cannot handle it
Damn, i didn&#39;t think it was that bad
I&#39;m sorry but self care is actually an insane song,  decent gets boring at times but higher than a 3 maybe 6
i actually like macs singing
I just can’t get though a track his moaning type of singing
I really think it’s a 7. I enjoyed it
this ain&#39;t it chief
wow i would at least give a 7
Between this and the Saba review it really shows you have no taste in rap music. Back to listening to lil pump you fucking bald fuck boy.
you’re simply just not a mac miller fan and need to make that clear, you have a huge influence on music and you are part of the reason mac is not as respected as he should be Faces is not a 6 this is not a 3 watching movies is better you need to give credit where credit is due, you’re just disrespecting mac!!!
i dont know thicctano i liked this album because it didn’t make me feel emotion or like, hype. it kinda is just what goes through your mind after a break up or when you’re feeling down. i like that because it’s what i do all the time. think a lot. i’m feeling a decent 7
I really fuck with this album, this is the first review I strongly disagree with. Definitely an album I&#39;ve gotta be practically sedated for, maybe that&#39;s melon&#39;s issue.
Melon an Arianna fan.
Nah, I ain&#39;t letting this slide
melon wyd
WRONG
It hasn&#39;t even been an hour yet and just look at those dislikes.
This melon’s fucking tripping
only review ive been upset with. and astroworld got a fucking 7
i think you really missed it on this one. this is a great work of art which is very tight conceptually and musically. the theme of the project is growth and the music compliments that very well i dont understand where you are coming from on this one.
wow OK hatethony whitestano
This album put me to sleep lmao
God damn it, Melon
then eedled rop
This is great music for when you want to fall asleep
You were on par all year and you do THIS?
&gt;:(
Okay this is fucking unacceptable
this hurts.......i&#39;m about to put a 7 on an album u rated as a LIGHT to DECENT 3
damn im not even a mac fan and i thought this was great... yeah his singing isnt amazing but to me it works
this and astroworld should switch scores
that like to dislike bar tho &lt;/3
Looks like Red Flannel season is coming again
EHHHH, wrongthony wrongtano here
Small world is the only bad song on the album. What is wrong with you.
That 3/10 is cheesing Mac
White frat boys are shaking right now.
Fuck the Infinity gauntlet, the Melons red flannel is more savage
I love it when melon does something that gets disliked to hell because i can read all the butthurt on my screen it&#39;s awesome.
This review makes melon drowning
Idk I thought it was better than Astroworld
NO FUCKING way you gave this a 3 LMAO, this is EASILY a strong 7
Cmon man..
It&#39;s Deafhaven all over again.
Got the Dislike bar jumping melon!
Wrong
It was at best a 5 but I feel a 3 is a bit to harsh
No
With all due respect melon, but this is wrong. I thought it was a beautiful album, and 2009 is one of Mac&#39;s best songs. The hate on this project is undeserved
ok why are you acting like it wasnt 8/10
this project was so good, so disappointed in you melon
Way too harsh
damn fantano i thought it was a dope record
F
Wholeheartedly agree. Mac Miller phoned it in on this one. He should&#39;ve just made a Watching Movies with the Sound Off 2.
Ok melon I watch a pretty heavy amount of your vids, I usually agree with you but these are the main ones you let me down on off top:(pause)<br>James Blake - the color in anything <br>Mbdtf - Kanye <br>Damn - Kendrick <br>Blank face - schoolboy Q <br>Mac miller - faces <br>And now Mac miller - swimming
oh no melon you really fucked up...but what&#39;s new......
This is a hilarious review... but you’re wrong! C’mon!
This ain’t it chief
You lyin ass melon bitch
Had to rewatch the Kids See Ghosts review to forgive you, because this ain&#39;t it, fantano.
Dammit melon you went too far this time, you need your goddamn hearing checked
LOL
Dont care about this one this album is solid
Mac Miller fans going on a stampede in the comment section😂😂
Wow melon you’re a bitch for this one
another shitty review
Mac Miller is buns
K... not a 3 so
this ain’t it chief
L
you’re getting clowned for this one MELON
are you kidding? A 3/10? I understand that it’s your opinion but what? How is the singing excruciatingly bad?
God damn it melon
This just ain’t it
Illuminati confirmed. <br>If Mac ain&#39;t in your top 10 then you are racist.<br>By 3/10 he ment he&#39;s his 3rd favorite rapper, right behind Lil Yachty and Pumper.
nah this ain’t it
Too harsh smh
It already has more dislikes than likes lol this album was pretty OK I guess imho
<b>effortlessly</b>
Apparently I&#39;m in the minority of people that think this album deserved its 3.
He looks so mad LMAOO
I disagree with this one, but good stuff.
But woah the dislikes
I knew he wouldn’t like it but damn i still was hoping he would
Did not see this coming.
I thought it was one of Mac Millers best works, really enjoyed the album
Sheesh, Mac Miller&#39;s fans are letting their feelings be known
This ain’t it melon
Saw this coming, anyone else?
Fair review but I think this is harsh.<br>What’s the use? Has got me back into jazz rap after Vapourwave saturated it all. Not in a bad way tho 🙃 for me 6/10
no
y u no review Jazz Cartier
Thanks for putting this one up. Been waiting for you to review this. I gotta disagree with ya tho. I enjoyed this album quite a bit. 7.5/10 for me.
This aint it, chief
I give this video: Light to decent dislike
This isn’t it chief
small worlds is a gem. i actually liked this album quite a bit.
Dang people really are split on this project I guess. I’ve never really been a huge Mac miller fan and haven’t listened to this yet is it even worth trying out
This has gotta be the lamest dude on YouTube
Damn lol
youre actually deaf
I think it has to be a 6 or 7, yeah, the album is this common form of indie music, melancholic BUT, more than half the album really, REALLY works.
Oh come on now. At best this album was a 7. You can&#39;t shit on it this hard it was a consistent and well delivered project it was just a little too mellow and long. But that doesn&#39;t merit a 3
ACCURATE REVIEW I got to the 3rd track of this album and couldn&#39;t go any further cos mac miller&#39;s nasal whiny voice is the most cringeworthy unbearable shit I&#39;ve ever heard
fuckin hell anthony are u on drugs. at least a 4 come on
nah, melon
Trash tier review
Nah, this ain&#39;t it, Melon.
Res flannel and the 13 year old lacrosse player in my heart is screaming.
Nah chief, this ain&#39;t it
clown
You have to be fucking kidding me
Damn that ratio<br><br>Don’t know much about Mac Miller, haven’t heard him since 8th grade like 7 years ago, didn’t know he had such a. Following haha
Ooh this gone be a good one😊
Youre so over the top when it comes to mac miller What did he do to you melon!?
You jealous of macs hairline huh?
I automatically like the fact that the melon is wearing the red flannel...
Well I liked it
Ok this needs to stop, you’re telling me this is worse than Scorpion????? You think this album is on the same level at 6ix9ine’s recent release??? Smh
WHAT THE FUG
WRONG
I&#39;ve yet to listen to the album, but the res flannel hurt me a bit lol.
I DISAGREE VERY MUCH MR. MELON BUT ITS OKAY I STILL LOVE YOU
Wish I didn&#39;t click on the video, misread it as Mac Demarco
Why the hate he just stated his opinion
One of the few times I disagree with you on a record. I felt that this record was a wonderful comeback for the artist after his issues with Ariana Grande and his pretty terrible ideas in the past. While it doesn&#39;t pave the way for much, I still find to Swimming&#39;s credit that Mac holds a concept well throughout, and honestly I thought most of it was well thought out and pleasing to the ear. Like Come Back to Earth for example. Honestly I&#39;d say this album is like a 7 for me.
dude what
Fantano confirmed Pete Davidson in a melon mask
Lol what the fuck melon
I’m not too crazy about Mac miller, but I thought the project was solid forreal
It’s been a while since your put a video with more dislikes than likes.
I like being able to see the thumbnail, and by the color of your shirt I can tell that the album is trash XD
He can have a personal opinion on it and his review guys it&#39;s okay just because you enjoyed it and he didn&#39;t doesn&#39;t mean that he doesn&#39;t know shit about music it doesn&#39;t mean that he is expired y&#39;all are just being haters he wasn&#39;t even talking shit he was just laying out why he doesn&#39;t care for it and that&#39;s okay why don&#39;t you all make a music review Channel
guess i cant like this album anymore ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
You outta your damn mind melon, this at least a light 7
Put that mid down
<b>Mac Miller is the white and less interesting earl sweatshirt</b>
Stupido melon
If you liked Swimming like I did this should just prove that if Melon doesn&#39;t like something that doesn&#39;t make it bad, it&#39;s just his opinion. It&#39;s all subjective people
Bouncin on my boys dick to this ASMR
Lmaooooooo Mac Miller fanboys are the worst
bald moron
I feel like I’m the only one who actually agrees with Melon on this one. I gave this a 4/10
Ohthony Notano is correct.
I hope this isn&#39;t foreshadowing of Mac Miller&#39;s demise. Melon please don&#39;t hurt him, not Mac :(
<b>this ain&#39;t it chief</b>
You’re crazy melon. Not a 3 album
Dem dislikes tho
Il don&#39;t know How you do that melon, self care is so beautiful
I like Mac Miller&#39;s new album
Mac Miller is the jack Johnson of rap.
I don&#39;t dislike your videos melon. This time I&#39;m making an exception.
Smh how could he have rated this worse then astroworld 😪
oh god the dislikes
Damn melon got it wrong
As soon as I saw the red flannel... I knew what was coming.
Finally, tired of people jacking off to this album. Strikes me as Lil Xan-esque
Oof the like to dislike ratio
That effortless edit at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgwPxFUUg94&amp;t=110">1:50</a>
Melon fucking boomed Mac
i liked swimming way more than astroworld....wth
he really compared mac miller to lil xan at one point... the DISRESPECT is UNREAL
So basically you don’t like his voice?<br><br><br><br><br><br>Other than that you described a very mature and consistent album. <br><br>I don’t understand you, Melon.<br><br>I know it’s your opinion, and I will still continue to listen to this album and be excited to see him live in a few months, but I hope at least some critics give it the attention I think it deserves.
strongly disagree..
That npr was fire. Fantano falling off
I thought it was at least a 6/10
A Lil Xan comparison? That’s just wrong Melon
Ok so I hate ladders and what&#39;s the use but in defense of this album I find it to be one mac&#39;s most vulnerable. I like how it&#39;s not a break up album but more of a getting my life together album. So it goes is cool cuz it&#39;s like him saying that he will go on regardless of all the fuck shit that happens to him. hurt feelings and jet fuel are bangers while perfecto, wings, and 2009 show us everything he went through without it being cheesy and I&#39;m also a fan of the dreamy production. I guess if good am is the &quot;wake the fuck up album&quot; swimming is the &quot;I don&#39;t wanna wake up but I have to&quot; album and I appreciate it for that.
I stopped this review to listen to Swimming.
Only knew Mac Miller from The Way from Ariana Grande
idk bout this chief
Put some pants on Anthony!
WRONGTHONY WRONGTANO
Nah you wrong for this one melon
Bad opinion
This is easily the most I’ve ever disagreed with you on an album but I respect your opinion
IGLOOGHOST please
The only other time Melon killed mac this hard was when it was made by Kraft.
that dis/like bar&#39;s about even
Fuck you Anthony , astroshit is a seven, stay dangerous is a 5 , and u giving swimming a three 😑
I&#39;ve never really heard anything by mac that turned my head enough to consistently listen to his shit. I decided to listen to this one and thoroughly enjoyed it. This album has made me a mac miller fan.<br>Decent 7/10
I really liked the album I give it a 8/10
Thank you. This album was so weak. Glad I&#39;m not the only one.
I actually really enjoyed this project, but I respect Anthony’s opinion
A 3? Sorry, Anthony, but I think you got your score confused with the amount of time it takes a Mac Miller fan to go rage.
DAAAAMMMNNN Melon! A 3? I respect that you&#39;re speaking what you feel but that&#39;s crazy to me. I gave it a fuckin 8! Either my reviews are too nice or you&#39;re getting to be bitter. haha
It should have been a winter release
sad mac
mac miller is truly awful and i don&#39;t understand why people like him.
You are wrong
LOOK AT THOSE DISLIKES DUDE
You just don&#39;t like Mac Miller I think. The only album I regard you genuinely liking (if you did at all) was Watching Movies. Hey man, everyone sticks to their own as it should be, but I disagree so much here. Production was really good, and the bars were solid.
The FUCK? Damn I was expecting at LEAST a 6
Macthony Cheesetano
This isn&#39;t it chief
This album is beautiful wtfffff
i havent seen the score but im guessing its a 4 because of the flannel
What the hell is wrong with you
Damn the like to dislike ratio.
i just wanna know how Stay Dangerous got a 5 and this got a 3. disrespect
Welp, time to the dislike ratio to explode
I think Mac Miller would be better as just a producer than a rapper.
Wow I didn&#39;t think many would be defending mac lol I thought it was pretty good
You gave this a 3 and astroworld a 7... Yeah you&#39;re on fucking crack melon
Damn, man. you&#39;re off on this one.
not the red flannel 😔
I&#39;ve got to disagree wit this one, the album is amazing and so genuine.
This was a solid 7
Idk wtf melon has against mac but the divine feminine was great and this album was decent...his criticisms are just objectively untrue
I’m just not sure what is boring to you or what isn’t sometimes
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgwPxFUUg94&amp;t=322">5:22</a> Oh we will MELON MAN
uh oh
Wow I really do not agree with this one melon
This album a good piece of work. Not a good review , he made a good album start to finish, the sound is cohesive. That’s the point
<b>E F F O R T L E S S L Y</b>
?
Y&#39;all know this is just my opinion, right?
Oh no not the red flanna...
oof melon, this one hurt
Thank you Mac, very bad!
I dont feel like this album was impactful enough to recieve anything bad or good. its like a weak 5. like vanilla icecream, just like... eh.
Mac Miller fans LOOL this guy has done nothing to push the game further he isnt anything special nothing but mediocre
You are wrong!!
Proof that fantano don&#39;t know shit about music.<br>Edit: All y&#39;all can eat a dick cause this video got more dislikes than likes

This review triggered my emotions in a bad way. I waited 6 days for you to review my 2nd most anticipated album of the year for you to just shit on it. I&#39;m genuinely disapointed with you and your taste of music Anthony.
Disagree. I think Mac&#39;s previous album was a cool direction but definitely fell short and was boring. Swimming is his best project in my opinion. You seem real hung up on the singing and maybe that&#39;s hard to get past but I thought as a whole it was solid except the last track.
Once again I must disagree with the mighty melon. Can not say this review was a surprise though
I was expecting a 4 but eh 3 also works
LOOOL
Bruh Mac Miller is cringe
What a horrible opinion
I actually really liked it but I can&#39;t say I wasn&#39;t disappointed as a lot of the tracks sound the same and not really different from his last album but I thought it had  a good vibe to it
BREAKING NEWS : Ariana payed MELON to score miller&#39;s album 3/10 <br>ALEX JONES got shut down for revealing it
This is the same guy who named Minnesota and Hi by Hannah diamond as top 10 singles of 2016. Same guy who gave the Weeknd HOB a 3, Malibu, Blonde and DAMN a 7. Gave lil pump a 7. Lets not act like he&#39;s with it just bc he gave TPAB a 10...
<b>&quot;Y&#39;all know this is my opinion, right?&quot;</b><br><br>READ NIGGAS READ
Melon you’re gonna pay for this one
Racism
This album sucked, legit made me fall asleep
Waiting on Mac and Post to drop their duo album so everyone can jump on their dicks again
Well after the last mac miller review this is not a surprise. Love both albums tho
Whiteboy fans are pissed
I&#39;d give it a 8/10
You’re literally horrible at giving music reviews please stop
Noooooooooooooooooooooooo
nah this is like an 8
Really got this one wrong oof
🔴🔵🔴 RED FLANEL ALERT 🔴🔵🔴
This is the first time I&#39;ve actually super disagreed with you
You just don’t like his voice and flow mate. It is a really great album, deal with it.
oof.
But this album is minimum a 6 tho<br>but yknow, something something subjectivity
You son of a bitch melon
Shawn Cee about to pull up
You barely explained why you don’t like it.
OH BABY
Fuck You Melon
review Autechre
I mean faces was his only project that was actually great. Wmwtso was alright but not great. This album put me to sleep and I didn&#39;t even listen to the feminist divine.
This ain&#39;t it chief
The white boys are going to riot in this comment section.
Fanthony Tanotano here
this was way better than astroworld. Melon is a fucking racist
i still love you tho melon man
do we really have to ignore the fact that he’s wearing a flannel in mid-summer?
shouldve been a not good tbh
anthony in hater mode
almost as comatose as lil xan...<br>7/10 kendrick, melon. you killed him here.<br>can&#39;t disagree with ya though
Anything you rate a 3/10 i enjoy the fuck out the album
One of your worst reviews yet lmao
swimming a 3 but trashcan world got a 7?? wtf melon
Your opinion is wrong
I thought it was a decent project not mind blowing or anything but not a fucking 3 lol
damn it be like this I guess... i thought you would like ladders at least :/
Nah this ain&#39;t it
worst album review on youtube
Mac’s my favorite rapper and I had pretty high hopes... I sadly agree with this review though
Macthony Millertano
Fantano really is becoming more and more out of sync with what makes good music and letting current trends dictate his opinions now... Disappointing when he used to give such unbiased analysis
This ain’t it chief
Finally
Supreme blientele????<br>Why you never review any Griselda shit???
A 3? come on this wasnt that bad lmao
Wowwwww this was such an amazing album lmao should’ve gotten an 8 at least
Why would melon give his own album a 3...
This one broke my heart melon.. why you gotta do it to em Anthony?
A 3? Well damn
Wack Miller...... Pass.
Ahhh no
This is, officially, the first time I have seriously disagreed with you, Melon.<br><br>(Edit): Somehow this review made me love the album more. Not sure I would have even said I loved it before. I feel for you, Mac.
what the fuck dude
the divine feminine was my introduction to mac miller and i thought it was great, and i reckon swimming is even better. i really enjoy mac’s style of singing so i guess it’s just a love it or hate it thing. really love the use of synths on some tracks and the general sound of the album across the tracklist.
THROUGH SILVER IN BLOOD CLASSIC REVIEW
Pretty shocked melon gave it an 8
totally agree, holy shit was this album boring
This aint it melon
Mac Miller fans gotta be the most sensitive people out there
Red Flannel...!?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgwPxFUUg94&amp;t=112">1:52</a> &quot;eFfOrTlEsSlY&quot;
I loved it
I think if you&#39;ve been a Mac fan since the beginning and grew up listening to him this album is incredible. A lot of strong feelings
You ain&#39;t shit
oof
Idk about this one melon
Gotta say... yeah... not in agreement. <br><br><br>Liked the feel and sound of this album and I thought the instrumentals were groovy and fun.
Wasn’t incredibly into this album but a 3 seems pretty harsh imo
Damn, hit my nigga Mac with the red flannel
This isn&#39;t a perfect album BUT IT&#39;S NOT A 3 WHAT THE FUCK
ik this your opinion, but come on a 3
Completely disagree. I thought it was okay on first listen, but after going through it a number of times I have come to really love it.
Oof
Unpopular opinion: Melon is right on this one like always
Dislike
Finally, Fantano found the balls to give negative reviews again.
its cuz his white innih
he gave TrashtroWorld a 7
Honestly I&#39;m a huge Mac fan and its true. This album was a step backwards, especially sith the singing
You didn’t have to be racist
Why does Mac keep on trying smh
Strong 8 light 9
Oof
i disagree, bitch
What’s The Use is the is only decent track and I wish he would just RAP like he used to
Melons can&#39;t swim
my disappointment is immeasurable<br>and my day is ruined
The internets album was ass btw a 3.
Hey everyone, Anthony &quot;REMOVE RANDOM CRITS FROM THE GAME, VALVE&quot; Fantano, here
This ain&#39;t it chief
Dislike ratio is already tipping lmao
review luna human melon
macs safe for now<br><br>-Rip mac
Swimming in that <b>3/10</b>
WRONG WRONG<br>A THOUSAND TIMES WRONG ANTHONY
this ain’t it chief
RED FLANNEL BOYS
U thought u were slick with that “effortlessly” dub huh melon
Mac miller, more like wack miller. Amiright??
This album for what he was trying to do is be sad and for most part he does it pretty good I&#39;d give it a 8/10
incorrect
Well I guess Astroworld was really the best album that dropped last Friday
My Heart hurt when I saw that Red Flannel. 😥
<b>NOOOOOO NOT THE RED FLANNEL</b>
Mac Melon
If Mac dies....🤨
I liked mac miller when he first came out idk if he&#39;s gotten worse or I was just dumb lol
Damn now people gonna discredit this masterpiece cuz this fuckin dude gave it a 3
IF I AINT YOUR TOP 5 THEN YOU’RE A RACIST
Review the spice girls or I&#39;ll tell everyone you&#39;re a misogynist
Tbh this album was kinda.....yeah a 3......
Bro a 3... a 5 I can take it but a 3 my bro ...
Woohoo
This melon has lost his brain seeds
RIP
MELON HOW COULD YOU!!!
Melon reviews: The Finding Dory Soundtrack
Jet fuel is the best song on here
If kendrick was on 1 song it would be a yellow flannel vid
It is Light 7 <br>Maybe strong 6 but 3<br>Wtf
6
Wtf son :/
Mac Miller’s album is better than astroworld and shits on YG’s album to me.
3 POINTER
nah this ain&#39;t it melon
surprising
Astroworld has a fucking 7 dude
review mark dice
You gone have to take them melons else where
I havent been able to stop listening to this idk what you’re talking about man
Fuck u bald melon head men i like it and this time i wont take your opinion
thought i was the only one that didn&#39;t like this
imagine being a mac miller fan lmao
BAD MELON! NO!
What&#39;s that cover art on the right of the background? The one with the &quot;Good Bad Not Evil&quot; on it? Is that a poster for a future video review titled &quot;Black Lips&#39; Evil Bad: NOT GOOD&quot;?
For once I decide my opinion on a record before I see Anthony&#39;s review and we still end up having the same opinion.
i have depression
LOL a 3???? LMFAO are your ears broken melon???
Hey Bighead
I agree with most of your opinions are you albums but this album for me was just amazing
A 3??? A FUCKING 3? WHAT THE FUCK?
Whats the thing that keeps me breathing? Is it money fame or melon? Gah Damn
I respect your opinion, though I heavily disagree
13O1 HOW TF D1D TH1Z GET A 3/10 ZMH
Man I really liked this album. I think Mac isn’t a bad singer either. I gotta disagree with Melon here
MACTHONY MILLTANO
Nah i gotta dislike this one melon, the album was great imo
i already know he doesnt like it based on the flannel and the dislikes
this is NOT it dawg
RED FLANNEL. <br><br>R E D F L A N N E L.<br><br>F     U     C     K.
OBLIVION YAYA
Nah chill lol
REDTHONY FLANTANO
Astroworld&gt;Swimming &gt;stay dangerous
I disagree
Hold up, you though yg&#39;s album was better? Put me in that coffin with Mac. I&#39;m dead.
Highly disagree
3/10 is definitely not what it is but whatever
When will a red flannel ever mean a positive score?
I think 3 is too high, tbh.
Is this really worse than stay dangerous?
OHTHONY NOTANO
Fuck Mac Miller!
No no no no no no
fuuuaaa
You need to do a worst to best on Queens Of The Stone Age
hoo boy
OMEGALUL ASStroworld is a 7/10 but this is a 3/10
Trash review.
Over 100 Dislikes without anyone watching the video...
i found this album to be his most enjoyable lyrically and aesthetically to me. kind of the opposite of what you said. honestly its a 7/10 for me.
I wouldnt be surprised if this beats House of Balloons for your most disliked video ever. How the fuck do you give this a 3????
Nothony Descriptiontano
Mac melon
How dare you red flannel this
3/10 is fucking bullshit. I could see 5/10 but 3/10 is just biased. I’d say 7/10
HIT THE DISLIKE IF YOU LIKE
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgwPxFUUg94&amp;t=333">5:33</a> - shortest review 2018?
Dingedy dong<br><br>Your opinion is wrong
Mac miller is such a dull white rapper why listen to someone like this when you can listen to someone like EL-P, lil ugly mane, Evidence, Cage and Slug. 3/10 really harsh score I would personally give it a light 5/10. But yeah this is pretty fucking bland.
you gave ‘Die Lit’ by Carti a 7/10 but Mac Miller who dropped a better project than Astroworld in the same week a 3/10. WOW.
Who was the first person to call Anthony a melon?
?
Wtf melon???
Ooof
This ain’t it chief
if mac miller was blacking it would be called trying to swim
So you&#39;re telling me HOPSINS fucking album is better than this
Damn!!!
Reving f a r t i ng synthesizers
Mac melon
God damn this is a bad opinion
What the fuck.
How&#39;s this worse than astroworld?
Damn, I really enjoyed this album, I guess I don’t anymore 😪<br>Thanks Melon
I thought it was ok
Yeah. This shit sux.
I can not... pronounce appreciate
This hurts
Freshthanoy Contento
DISLIKE SQUAD REPORTING IN
I thought one of the genres was Pop Tart at first.
Come on, Melon. This was better than YG’s album
<b>I expected a red flannel.</b>
Why did Melon have to do that to Mac
Anyone else just straight up disagree with this and the Divine Feminine review???
Arianthony Grandtano
Booooooooo. Mac killed it
nah, this album AOTY material
You deranged melon you&#39;ve done it again
This isn&#39;t surprising at all but still fuck you
dang man! i knew it was going to be a low as fuck score when i saw the length of the video lmao. Melon Savage
the fuck
L bro this album was a dime
how you get a lower score than drake?
I get that this album can be sorta boring and maybe not have the best vocals, but 2009 is fucking fantastic - I find the rest of the album decent, but not anything mindblowing. I’d say 5/10, but that’s just me
Wow Melon, you are wrong with this one...
So all those trolls last Friday that said YG and Mac Millers albums were both better than Astroworld.<br><br>STROKE MY CACTUS🌵
He really went down hill man ..
Wasn’t that into this at all
Mac is back i gotta give it a listen!
You’ve really done it this time
Not his best album but I’m glad he still make music after his Addiction problems
Swimming in watermelon juice
damn, nice
THANK YOU THIS IS A FUCK YOU TO EVERYONE SAYING THIS IS BETTEr than astroworld RED FLANNEL
Ooh watch out it&#39;s the fanboy dislike crowd
I think people aren&#39;t gonna be happy with this one.
OH SHIT HE GAVE IT  A 3
what the fuck?
WRONG
He’s asleep on the album cover. What did you expect? A drug party? I can’t agree with the one, Melon.
That feeling seeing the red flannel.
DAMN. the red flannel, not a good sign
Wait what he still makes music? What?
Damn I knew he’d hate it but i didn’t know he’d be so hard on it. I really enjoyed this album however.
Good review except that 3 minute recital of your hatred of &quot;n-words&quot;
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! NOT THE RED FLANNEL!!! ANYTHING BUT THAT!!!! PLEASE MELON!!!!!!
First it was ariana now melon why ya&#39;ll keep breaking my boys heart.. damn
Opinions are opinions but can&#39;t believe the fact that both Carti and Pump got a higher score
WRONF
OOF
No need to call Miller a wigger, Melon.
You know, for a moment there, it actually looked like Mac was going to be pretty damn good. I still listen to songs like Fight The Feeling and Red Dot Music to this day. A damn shame he&#39;s TRASH!
NEW TERM FOR 3’S = MAC/10
😕
Notification gang gang!
this is plain wrong
He gave it a 3, melon being racist
THIS ALBUM WAS SO GOOD MELON
Mac Miller gets a 3/10 but Miller Mac gets a 10/3? You&#39;re better than this Melon
who wanna come over to my house for sleep over i got a Dreamcast we can play Tony Hawk Pro Skater
Lmao 3/10
Honestly I don’t even know what I was expecting.
This ain’t it chief
nicki album gonna get a strong 5 to a light 6
I could argue with you, Melon, but...<br><br>“What’s the Use?”
Just because Melons can’t swim 😂
This melon is expired
I knew you&#39;d hate it
I can’t think of a clever melon pun or twist on his name 😕
NO U WRONG SHUT UP MELON
Swimming in red
Anthony, hit me up. I wanna talk about some things with you. I have vision but need advice. Thank you.
Damn, the red flannel for mac miller. Rip
Very nice! I like!
Wrongthany opiniontano here
Red flannel
