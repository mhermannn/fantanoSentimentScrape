LOLLL i love how serious you were about this but c&#39;monnn shit&#39;s so funny
this album is the spiritual personification of what happens when your friend asks you to pass the AUX cord.
goated album not even TPAB could make Anthony go insane
I think melons mental health is on a decline.
if this album was called Angelic 2 The Butterfly you still would have hated it because its a bad album
As a producer this album is a big source of motivation for me. Motivation to not ever make an album this horrible
What confuses me about Corey is that he clearly wants to be respected as a music artist in his own right, yet he sounds like he is doing a bad impression of Michael Jackson in the majority is his songs. <br><br>It’s difficult for me to take him seriously when he releases an album like this which sounds and looks like it was produced by a 5-year old. The album cover alone looks like something a child would throw together in an hour using Paint.
man, i&#39;ve definitely heard that synth bit before, but i can&#39;t remember what don&#39;t it&#39;s from
honestly it sounds like cocaine, like, i dont know how else Corey Feldman could make it. A surprising number of those tracks where there&#39;s 20 instruments laid over each other, if he just turned those individual melodies into songs they&#39;d probably be at least passable (or at least Just derivative and dull) songs, or that one EDM track that actually kinda banged until it randomly turned into a Funky Town bootleg? Or pulled the Party Rock Anthem synth track?<br><br>This sounds like something made on a coke bender surrounded by people who are paid too much to tell him no. It&#39;d also explain the absolutely bonkers genre switches, beyond what Melon said about this just being every bad idea Feldman&#39;s ever had, which is likely also true.
I feel like if the album had a smell it wouldn’t smell SO bad but it would smell musty
one of my favorite things that fantano gets hung up on is the fact that the skits are trying to do both charlie&#39;s angels and batman at the same time<br>it&#39;s such an inane criticism yet against even more inane music<br>corey truly boggled this man&#39;s mind
could you imagine if bowie released this instead of blackstar
I just can&#39;t laugh at Corey. I mean especially after knowing what Corey said about his music. He knows he doesn&#39;t have a good voice. It&#39;s just dun for him. What I find WAAAAAY MORE pathetic, are the people that will just make videos just to mk fun of Corey. Now thats pathetic and sad.    Gotta respect Corey also for not caring what idiots say. He&#39;s having fun and that&#39;s all that matters to him.  If you had gone through even some of the shit he went through as a kid....most would&#39;ve already checked out of this life long ago. <br>I just can&#39;t make fun of a person that does something cause they enjoy doing it. Especially when they know they aren&#39;t really that good. So to mk fun of a guy for being bad even after he told you its not that good......is pretty shitty and says alot about that person&#39;s character.  Its all unfortunate....
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=769">12:49</a> Oscar the Grouch’s guest number during a crossover episode with Yo Gabba Gabba <br><br>That’s the vibe
It sounds so 80s in all the wrong ways
These genuinely sound like kids show musical numbers
Why did no one tell him how awful this was during the recording of this album??!! 😂😂
Just jooked on Feldmans wiki to see what the &quot;Corey&#39;s angels&quot; thing was based on and HOLY SHIT WTF EW
I didn&#39;t realize they released the Amazing Spider-Man 2 soundtrack as an album.
it has to be one massive troll. How could he possibly be serious? its complete noise, just absolute trash. I would be SO ashamed. the shock value keeps me coming back, so maybe that is th epoint. if you have zero talent, act like you believe you do as the only way to have any kind of relevance? its perplexing.
Came here after watching The Masked Singer Season 11.
I own a signed physical copy of this album. On the shelf in my bedroom with random Internet collectibles, it’s one of the showpieces. Now that you can’t listen to this album on streaming anymore, I feel like I own a small piece of the Holy Grail.
Each of his songs sounds like there&#39;s 3 people in the same room listening to three different songs at the same time.  Each of these songs are different genres and are playing at different beats/time signatures.  It sounds like a mess and it&#39;s exhausting to listen to.  I&#39;d imagine you have to have a considerable amount of molly onboard to think this noise sounds like music.
I cannot wait until we get Angelic 3 The Core
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2020">33:40</a> sums up the whole album just🤤😨😰😖😞😭
If JEREMY DEWITTE and STEVEN SEAGAL had a love child out of wedlock, in their 70s.. you would get corey feldman.  Checkmate
just seen this after some person on another clip implored the watcher to watch...well. Funny is putting it mildly. A pretty dull day has been replaced with this comedy gold review of the worst music known to man. Thank you...got to watch again for your laugh...superb...deffo an album to send to someone you really do not like.
I listened to this album fully yesterday and there&#39;s some stuff that Anthony should&#39;ve mentioned here. Mainly how most of the songs go into completely different directions like &quot;Break Free&quot; suddenly turns into a metal song. &quot;Mercy&quot; goes from a slow jam to a church choir song.
Y’all bullied this man so hard he deleted all copies of this album.
this is one of my favorite videos on youtube
Better than tpab
I thoroughly enjoyed this review than the entire Corey Feldman&#39;s discography and existence combined lol
It&#39;s actually the worst album ever, not just for the year. Come on, give it it&#39;s dues.
I laughed, cried and nearly died listening to this album, what a rollercoaster. May god bless Corey
I come back at least every 6 months for this. One of the greatest YT videos ever.
Corey is a beast bro. Original drill artist.
one of the crazy things after all these years (remember the day was uploaded) is his take on Lil Peep&#39;s Hellboy being Brokencyde quality!!! :-O
Guy has the worst voice ever but insists on being a singer lol he just won&#39;t give this shit up
I&#39;ve heard better vocals on LuLu
He knows he is awful. Since he can&#39;t   make something good his does this. ....and we are talking about it..
I&#39;m seeing him live in August along with Limp Bizkit and BONES..what have I signed up for? A great time 😂
Corey Feldman is a long way from Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go
😂😂😂
I watched this too many times.
Fantano is what idubbbz could have been
I don&#39;t think he listens to his own music
All of us from Justin David 🙋🙋🙋🙋 let&#39;s gather here
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2134">35:34</a>
&quot;Play it again, Sam! Wow, that Jazz certainly does swing!&quot; 😂😂😂😂💀💀💀💀
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2345">39:05</a> nooo Cory, don&#39;t sample my favorite 80s movie, lostboys doesn&#39;t deserve that.
This is an excellent companion piece to the Bonfire takedowns of Feldog and this album
Does he really think this is good music. It sucks.
Ascension Millennium is Corey&#39;s answer to Temporary Secretary by Paul McCartney - in all the best ways
I’m back 😄😄
i know if i heard this when i was 12 in my scene phase, i would&#39;ve said &quot;aw yeah, better than that justin beiber crap!&quot;
Before Hardy’s the mockingbird and the crow, there was Corey Feldman’s angelic to the core. Respect your elders kids
Track 2 tried to rip off that beat in the old six flags commercials with old dude dancing hahaha.....and the rest of this masterpiece sounds like he used a bunch of jackie Moon&#39;s left over beats from the  &quot;Love Me Sexy&quot; sessions that didn&#39;t make the cut......which is nice. Not to mention,  Jackie Moon was actually in the studio with Corey throughout the entirety of the recording of the smash hit &quot; Angelic to the Core&quot;
You can&#39;t even buy this album anymore :(
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=562">9:22</a> like Guilty Eyes Fever or some shizz
I like die antword
It has to be performance art. It&#39;s so bad that I think the actual musicians that are doing guest spots on the album would otherwise sound ok themselves.  They all sound so bad I&#39;m thinking that they must be doing it on purpose. As a spoof album it&#39;s actually succeeding.  That&#39;s the only way my brain can make sense of it. It&#39;s impossible that no one around him during the production of this album would say &quot;hey dude.... this is revolting music.
Hey if yyou  marry my neice please send me an invite or at least lemme know shes a sweetie
Completely wiped from streaming, piracy is the only way now LMAO
Space Pants.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2047">34:07</a> my favorite thing about this whole video is that it was uploaded in Late September. That had to be deliberate, right?
Nice wonderbra sister
this album is what people who hate trout mask replica hear when they listen to trout mask replica
😮...... 😂😂😂😂😂😂the song at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=831">13:51</a> sounds literally like when my daughter was little and got ahonld of my cell phone into the settings and just randomly pressed on the different ringtones letting each one play for 1 second then the next over and over again with no dead space in between 😂😂😂
Remember that episode of the original Star Trek series where the Enterprise passed through a time warp and various random 3 second snippets of moments in time were experienced?<br>Now imagine you, the cast and crew, director, cameraman and everyone involved was on HEAVY concentrates of LSD and mushrooms while simultaneously EVERY childhood garage band ever assembled plays their very best original tunes....in reverse.<br>Now image Corey Feldman on vocals.<br>Yuuup....thats Angelic to the Core.
LOOK at the guy.<br>Did you expect his EARS to be any better?
Aaaaaahhhh.....the soothing sound of.....FELDMAN???<br>Not since Gilbert Gottfried has there been anything like it.
This album is not on Spotify or YouTube how do I listen lol
This is the auditory version of when you go the wrong direction in Mario Kart
This begs the question : could joe jackson turn corey feldman into michael jackson?
This is the only way to listen to the album now 😢
Coming all the way back. Sad news today.
I genuinely had no idea that music could be this bad.  I struggle to imagine what kind of mental illness created this.
So sad we can’t stream this album anymore. Never take life for granted guys, you never know what you have till its gone 😢
I&#39;m here because now this is one of the only ways to hear this album.<br>RIP.
This album (along with most of Corey Feldman’s other material) was just removed from streaming services. So now Anthony’s review will be the only proof that this existed.
Fantano&#39;s worst take honestly.
If Michael Jackson and Marylin Manson had a crack baby .
Seamless sounds like something the muppets would sing.
It is February 2024. I came back to this video today after being aware of this phenomenon of a record (thx to melon) with historic news. I just walked in on my friends roommate who was just studying and WAS LISTENING TO ANGELIC 2 THE CORE UNIRONICALLY. He likes it, hes a fan, and he was vibing to it. I was to awestruck and frankly afraid to confront him and backed out. This HAPPENED seriously. Its actually affecting me but at least my friend is thinking about moving out of there now. Wtf man
More like AWFUL TO THE CORE!!!
i think this video contains every facial expression anthony fantano is capable of making. I&#39;ve seen every single one of his teeth now
Albums like this legit creep the hell out of me, and I spend my time listening to a whole damn lot of bad creepy music. Honestly this is disturbing. I&#39;m laughing nervously
that moment at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2401">40:01</a> is my favourite &quot;accidentally experimental&quot; moment. just pure intense dissonance, i can almost unironically enjoy that moment
He needs steven Segall to lay down some killer blues licks...
kid: i want michael jackson!<br><br>mum: we have muchael jackson at home<br><br>*michael jackson at home.
Corey Feldman actually said, on video, that he was <b>exactly</b> like Michael Jackson in every way.<br>This album is a hot-mess tragedy. How many music styles can he mix in one song?<br>Corey, I beg of you -pick a key, any key. Pick a note, ANY note that is not ridiculously high or flat. Or…find a note period. Omg.
This literally sounds like he tried to replicate plastic beach without any of the charisma and musical talent that gorillas has😭
This is syphilis
This album sounds like my wifes tiktok shit when im trying to fall asleep.
No one can recreate Michael Jackson.
Oh how I&#39;ve missed this video. Now it&#39;s going to be my obsession again for the next few weeks
I played &quot;Duh&quot; in my care and had 200 dogs chase me down the street.
[NOT GOOD]
Horrible doesn&#39;t even cover this and the fact is if he was serious he could afford vocal training and retain a vocal coach he could have a real producer actually engineer his tracks and after 30 years of him trying he still doesn&#39;t do any of it sad really
I mean seriously????  It is a &quot;bit&quot; my man. It&#39;s a parody.......kinda like spinal tap remember?  He is literally on tour with various artists. He is very aware of the fact that he is neither a musician or singer. He can&#39;t get jobs doing his craft in Hollywood so he got creative and reinvented himself and got a publicist and started touring around. He doesn&#39;t get a lot of gigs on his own bill but has been touring and opening up with larger headliners and hence playing to a larger crowd. But I guess if you&#39;re not in the know.....I can see how crazy this would seem!  Lol. Sorry ya did a whole post without being hip to what he&#39;s actually doing. He&quot;s gotta make a living, ya know. I think you should do another post, if not, to redeem yourself, maybe a little promotion to encourage people to go to his show. Cuz he isn&#39;t going to do it. It is the &quot;schtick&quot;  Ooooh, unless that is....he paid you to do a bad review on him and cut him down to further add to the authenticity!  If that&#39;s the case.....hilarious!
Michael Jackson once said the difference between Corey Feldman and his freezer was when he pulled his meat out of the freezer it didn&#39;t fart..😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=559">9:19</a> That synth lead is 99.8% the drop from Rihanna&#39;s We Found Love but with a shitty warp effect on it
I have to say, there are lots of song parts album-wide that don&#39;t musically fit together, parts that sound out-of-key or off-beat and would therefore set off cringe alarms across the world. But the song Go For It! isn&#39;t like that. I think you were a little unfair to that one, influenced negatively (and understandably) by some otherworldly terribleness throughout much of the rest of the album. Go For It! has a decent beat and, at the very least, fits together musically. You could argue that it&#39;s too densely arranged at times (which you rightfully do) and could benefit from being stripped down a bit, but it doesn&#39;t set off the worldwide cringe alarm, in my humble opinion.
Where&#39;s &quot;Ho&#39;s and Boats&quot;?
Sounds like an off-balance washing machine of nonsensical noise. Just a fluster clucking audio dumpster fire of, well, regret, from my perspective. Feldman owes everyone upon whom he inflicted this album a public apology.
How does every track sound like something i made on fl studio while fucked up at 2 am
Sometimes I revisit this review just to feel alive again
I&#39;ve listened to things, people, that you wouldn&#39;t believe. COREY FELDMAN - ANGELIC 2 THE CORE a musical disaster off the charts. I&#39;ve heard notes screeching off the scales like nails on a chalkboard. I endured lyrical C-beams trying to glitter in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate of good taste. All those moments will be lost in my Spotify history, like tears in the rain. Time to mute.
Have you heard Corey live? They probably recorded each track 100 times before they realized his voice only gets worse with each try, and after being tortured with his horrificly awful vocals, they just couldn&#39;t take anymore!
This album is a parody of music as the art form
Is it.....delusional 2 tha core?
It got to a point where Corey was just like &quot;Can we get this fookin&#39; album done!&quot; What happened to all the wicked intros and stuff!? 😁🤯
i dont know alot about music but to me it sounded similar to the non-singles on a micheal jackson album.
I never heard anybody bumpin&#39; this album on their car stereo 💯
Hey! Come on man! First off, Corey Feldman was in The Goonies. He was my favorite Goonie. And this album is good ole&#39; American family FUN. And Corey does Michael Jackson better than Michael Jackson. SIKE!!!! THIS ALBUM FOOKIN&#39; SUX MAN! SORRY! Corey is a great actor, but a NOT great musician. Thank you for your honesty. This video was hilarious. It really had me pissin&#39; my pants 😆🤯😁
Radiohead should open for Corey!!!
You go and see Cory Feldman in concert when you want to see a funny stand up comedy show.
I&#39;d really like to see him re-review this once he gets a little further along his journey of liking bladee
Shoot for the moon... if you fall you&#39;ll  still be among the stars.
The entire thing sounds like a joke. This is what happens when you’re surrounded by people who don’t tell you “No”.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=832">13:52</a> I literally blurt laughed.  WTF is that nonsense.
There&#39;s not a single creative vocal melody on the whole album. All his singing sounds the same.
This album is better than Sunn(((0))) and Deathgrips
That &quot;weeeeeeee&quot; crap has to be a f*ckin&#39; joke
I want a Corey Feldman emo album
MJ is King of Pop. CF is King of Cringe.
I can&#39;t even. This album sounds like absolut shit. Total torture. Fantano suffers for us. Godfamn. No choice but to laugh to keep from crying. Double goddamn. Because feeling embarrassed for Feldman, a man with zero self-awareness or talent... or ears for that matter seems truly exhausting.
Way too many yes people around him. Ot telling him the truth...
This is your best review. Your facial expressions alone are comedy gold.
ATTENTION MILLENIUMMMM🗣🗣🗣
🏳
My favorite tracks off this album are the silence between songs, and there is not enough of it, IMHO.
I think this album gave me Tourettes. I can&#39;t stop randomly F##%^!!! f^&amp;&amp;&amp;!!!  F)(*&amp;^!!! cussing in all  F@#$$!!! directions now. Lick my Feldman, motherF*&amp;^%$!!!
Snoop Dogg somehow managed to appear on the best album of the decade and the worst album of the decade. How bout that.
There isn’t a single redeeming quality about this album… Holy 💩.
2016 was truly a magical year
Realizing 6 years later that We Wanted Change is a wholesale rip off of Prince&#39;s Strollin&#39; as I listen to that far better record on vinyl.
Track 13 was like the worst combo of Rammstein and, well, a thick steamy coil.
Nirvanna has a great bar on their single &quot;You know you&#39;re right&quot; that sums up CF and his music perfectly........&quot;No thought was put into this, and I always knew itd come to this, things have never been so swell, I have never failed to fail..........PAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;

my favorite part is when the autotune goes offkey
To answer your question the song Corey Feldman copied @ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=563">9:23</a> is by Chris Brown. Song is called *YEA x3”.
This album is exactly what I envision happening if a tone-deaf person spends tens of thousands of dollars on hiring people to attempt making a good album yet never accepts any of their criticisms
Is that a sports bra?
Bro it took him over 10 years to make this album. No way it can suck
Because of this review, I have tickets to the next Corey Feldman concert with Limp Bizkit and Bones
...I like it.
Okay, so I really do have a death wish... I couldn&#39;t just watch this video and leave it there... been over to Spotify and right at this moment I am rocking out to Angelic 2 The Core. Not gonna lie... I&#39;m all in 😅
If Corey Feldman didn&#39;t exist we would have to invent him. We need Corey now more than ever.
Grandpa Skrillex ☠️
Every year, when list week appears, I&#39;m reminded of this video. And every year I re-watch it to remind myself of the good and the very bad times. Truly an annual tradition.
Yeah, it sucks, but your fake laughter isn&#39;t much more believable.
I picture FeldDog in the studio pulling a Dirk Diggler. <br><br>&quot;The bass is totally taking away from my vocals!&quot;
I MUST DISAGREE!  Cory fully explored the concept making an album while fully out of your mind on X-stasy and Bolivian booger sugar! Mixed in with cringeworthy meme gold antics that defy all expectations.
That&#39;s literally hyperpop before hyperpop. Isn&#39;t Fantano supposed to be a fan of like 100gecs and stuff?
If you happen to see this comment before you watch, please….. go smoke some weed or something first and it dulls the pain of what you’re about to go through
Your just as cringe dude
His singing sounds like someone stuck a hot curling iron up a cat&#39;s ass.
This album isnt even good to hate listen...unless you hate yourself..lol.  I have heard some pretty bad music before but the artist seems to be having a good time and it shows....this is NOT the case with this..his insufferable personality defiantly shows.   He is just so full of himself that he doesnt even grow as an artist..you have to be able to take advise and criticism from others to grow at any skill...uggnh..so bad...if I actually met someone and they threw this music on...I would run ....far away..you would have to be a lunatic to like this...lol
😂😢
Listening to this album through this review legitimately gave me dysphoria
And just think, you can get a signed box set of all of his music for $300!
This album has to be a joke ….there’s no way anyone thinks this is good music
That Fred durst one sounds like your playing 3 different songs at the same time …..3 shitty songs
I&#39;ll tell you something else that is disgusting: hearing a YouTuber burp in your headphones.
Ironic that this video probably has way may views than Corey&#39;s album ever got listens...
It’s like Backstreet Boys, MJ, and Nine inch nails had a baby with zero talent 🤣
He was so ahead of his time. This will probably become a cult classic album 🤣
Corey Feldman is the Ed Wood of the music industry!
Is this dude a musician, or just a dude that listens to music on YouTube?
In order to make an album this bad you have to have a complete and total lack of self-awareness, surround yourself with nothing but yes people and have zero understanding of song structure and music theory. It&#39;s as if the only music he had ever heard in his entire life was Captain Beefheart&#39;s Trout Mask Replica. Informed by that album he decided to invent his very own style of music. This album is the album that was birthed from that idea.
He&#39;s &quot;Jeremy Dewitt&quot; as a delusional recording artist...I can&#39;t even imagine if Jeremy Dewitt would pull Corey over someday...the traffic stop would be 3 hours long with both trying to out-do one another with their fake embellished exciting life..😂
I feel really bad for feeling so good listening to this gentle melonman just sh*ting the hell out of this other gentle nutman&#39;s record.
Cocaine psychosis?
Have you heard of the sayin <br>“Keep it simple, stupid” <br>He did not keep it simple.<br>Way too many beats in one song- <br>He’s over doing it, that’s crazy … his music is a direct reflection of his torment
I have never seen anyone give so much to do what they love. My friend, your pain was palpable from the opening seconds of the video and I wish I could&#39;ve done something to ease your pain. I mean holy fuck the album is an actual crime against nature and thank you for listening so no one else had to. As a musician I feel violated, as a human I could actually feel the whole species devolving with every track. I hope all these year later your tics have abated and the pain of this experience is a dim and/or sucsessfully buried memory. and you&#39;re right, someone should have gone to prison for that auditory abortion
It’s called Outsider Music. It’s a thing.
I think it’s great that he was actually able to go from acting to maybe modeling to child star gone wild to outsider musician. He’s one of a kind and that outsider musician is quite the title. If you don’t think so, search “songs in the key of Z” and welcome to the Under belly of music.
Your laugh sounds exactly like J. pheonixs Joker laugh.
Feldman had the last laugh. He&#39;s opening for Limp Bizkit in 2024💀💀💀
With my niece the funniest lyric AOT
I would use this music, as a sleep deprivation torture tool. 💀🤷🏻‍♂️👍🏽🤣🤣🤣
The best thing to me is how Anthony probably made more money off this video than Corey made from selling the album.
Between the growling and the Michael Jackson grunts, it&#39;s like Tasmanian Devil doing an MJ impression. (Except that would be entertaining ...)
He makes the most amazing elevator music. If you ever get stuck in there for a week you could try and figure out what the heck is going on with these songs to keep you busy.
Corey Feldman is the Neil Breen of the music industry.
Heard somewhere that the only reason this album got bankrolled was because Corey had dirt on all of Hollywood’s sex offenders. Makes sense to me.
I had no idea Snoop, Kurupt &amp; Durst we’re on the verge of bankruptcy?!?
I&#39;m starting to think this album was a cry for help
One day the genius of Corey will finally be recognized by all and the world will finally be whole .
Man, your laugh is very infectious 😆
if this was called 2 angelic the core you would&#39;ve given this a 10
I&#39;m really starting to think he&#39;s been projecting this entire time and is a creep... like one of the accusations he&#39;s constantly talked about but uses for promotion and never does anything about. He definitely is seriously mentally disturbed and is sexually charged with his &quot;angels&quot;. The pedo police should def be watching this guy.
I like how Corey Feldman tried really hard on this album
This album is so bad that it has actually looped back around to being awesome
I had my first musical Feldman exposure years and years ago, and as a survivor who’s learned to live with my condition, I will say that Ascension Millenium is the best of the bunch. In a relative sense, it is a banger.
Your best review video ever 👌
Does he know Michael Jackson was one and only, and he also died like 15 yrs ago? 😂
you know i’ve watched this video a few times now and i’m ready to speak my truth: lickety splickety is fire
Am I having a stroke?
The people that like this album are the same people that don’t exist.
I thought you worked out, why do you not have shoulders ? and also I agree with your assessment but if I had your body I would wear dress shirts 😂
One of the last songs you played on the album, I think it was called “we did it all“ was an homage to him and Corey Haim I believe
Thanks for dressing up bro. The dirty wife beater is spot on for a Corey Feldman review. I scanned ahead 15 minutes, saw that you were still monologuing so I’m leaving this comment and bailing. Unwatchable.
What a mess. 😂
Holy fuck 7 minutes in and when he finally plays music it&#39;s out of a laptop off screen?! clown world
MK Ultra - the album
I don&#39;t give a fuck what you say. Yeah, Corey Feldman sucks but his album is a fucking masterpiece compared to ANY goddamn shitty ass rap album...AND THAT&#39;S THE ONLY TRUTH!<br><br>Rap Sucks! Destroy hip hop and rap, destroy the &quot;woke&quot; ass, &quot;me too&quot; hipster movement. Say what you feel...listen to Metal!!!
i agree, this is definitely corey taylors weakest album.
he not is ims bum
It’s official: Corey needs an intervention. This record is terrible. Who told him he can sing? I get that he’s trying to relive his 80s teen glory (not that he was that great of an actor to begin with), but THIS is god awful. Just do the convention circuit giving out autographs and forget this $#!+. And STOP with the tired and lousy MJ impersonations.
Not to be confused with Corey Taylor.
Corey thinks he is the spirit of Michael Jackson. Same (but not good) dance moves, outfits, gloves, etc...This is a vanity project. He made it. Payed for it. Released it. Nobody liked it. Just try painting, Feldy. You&#39;d probably be good at that.
Awesome!!  The negativity track is him trying to do Mariln Manson better because they got beef.
Awesome!!  The negativity track is him trying to do Mariln Manson better because they got beef.
“AI, I’d like you to create an album of music that consists of delusions of grandeur, 80’s ‘after-school special’ themed lyrics, desperation and spoiled mayonnaise”.
This album sounds like ur playing it backwards 😂
Lmao this guy is Steve-O  20lbs heavier , this is one of the funniest reviews I’ve ever seen.
Just the album cover is absolutely ridiculous. It’s not even good poses or a good angle. There’s so much more that could’ve been done with that concept. It’s just so bad and then the music sounds just like you would imagine based on the ridiculous cover.
50 minute video is crazy
I don&#39;t wanna hear anyone trashing Steven Segals music again........Segalls music is god tier compared to this shit and Segall wrote a song called Alligator Ass
The album is almost as bad as this guy&#39;s tattoos
Sober Steve-O
His album makes as much sense as doing a review in a wife beater.😮
This man is truly insane
I think THE SHAGGS - PHILOSOPHY OF THE WORLD still holds the &quot;Worst Album Ever made&quot; Title regardless of Frank Zappa saying it&#39;s one of his favorite bands and Kurt Cobain ranked it as his 5th Best Album of ALL TIME.<br><br>The Shaggs were literally 3 Sisters whose Father FORCED THEM to learn instruments and form a band! The Father bought studio time, in 1969, and despite the Recording Engineer telling the Father they were &quot;not ready to make an album&quot; due to their inability to play their instruments the Father insisted &quot;NOW was the time because he wanted to record them WHILE THEY WERE STILL HOT!&quot; You have to check out this TRAINWRECK- especially the song MY PAL FOOT FOOT - written about the Family Cat that had to have feet amputated on TWO DIFFERENT OCCASIONS!<br><br>YOU&#39;RE WEL.....COME?....?!...!...?
hes the joke that keeps giving
I understand all to well having creative ideas no one cares to see (wishing, praying, and trying different methods too), but damn this is so bad on so many levels.  Surprised Scientology never sucked him in, he seems prime
Ngl, this sounds like gd IDL music
Its basically primordial-teezo touchdown
Lol 😄hands down, the best reaction video I&#39;ve seen.
That song &quot;Negativity&quot; is like he heard a NIN song and a Marilyn Manson song one time and went into the studio and made a completely unedited track trying to copy it.
Snoop dogg -appears on best rap album of the century tpab.<br>Also snoop the same year -features on this lol
I liked it more than anything Limp Bitzkit has ever done.
Everyone is listening to Corey’s music the wrong way. Your suppose to play it backwards. It’s so much better
Even Protools couldn&#39;t be paid enough to be on this album...
This album is winning...in the morgue.
some artists have pushed the boundries of genres and instruments. Corey feldman has made us question whether his works even count as music at all. Truly the most innovative and ambitious musician of our time
Wow! I used to think Chris Cornell was the best damn singer of the last 30 years, then I heard Feldman..... I just can&#39;t even joke like this, it&#39;s blasphemy.
Wifebeater really?? Or is that a reflection of the album?
Who told this clown he could sing
Dude, this cat needs a check up from the neck up, really the cd is not worthy of a proper burial at the garbage dump 🤮.   I don’t know if I should be embarrassed for the substandard poor man’s clone of pedo, Michael jerkson   Nah, he should take his Gelt and try to excape the very unfortunate existence of reality that he suffers with daily 😂🤪🔫.    Hats off to all rockers and not posers 🎸🤘👍
I dont know whats more distressing. This album or the chair reveal.
🤭
This album is the auditory equivalent of white knuckling literally anything.
I think he has a new one. He&#39;s showing up on podcasts with some trash. 😅 he acts serious until they laff at him😅did he record this in a tunnel? He says hes his own producer, arranger etc. So you cant blame others😅😅
Holy shit corey came out with a Halloween song today. I’ll report back in a minute on how it is<br><br>Edit: what the actual fuck
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2107">35:07</a> One of my favorite quotes from this video. XD
the album art should be the first clue on how bad this is...
Seems like Corey Feldman would be losing money trying to keep up this band and performing
My goodness
I don&#39;t understand why anyone would purchase his music or pay to see him? Outstanding reaction btw
You really dressed up
Oh I get it, hes not doing music, hes doing schmoosic.
“Fred, I need you to take a giant Durst on this track, homie.”
“What’s up with this weirdo?”<br><br>                     - Michael Jackson
Mic drop needs to lose weight
MY MAN, THIS IS NOT THE WORST ALBUM OF THE YEAR - IT&#39;S THE WORST ALBUM OF ALL TIMES!!!!  He&#39;s an ex child star TALENTLESS LOSER that CAN&#39;T SING TO SAVE HIS LIFE, A TERRIBLE TERRIBLE DANCER &amp; BAD SONGWRITER. THE WHOLE BAND SUCKS - IT&#39;S PUNISHMENT FOR YOUR EARS but AT LEAST YOU CAN LOUGH YOUR ASS OFF WATCHING HIM DANCE HA HA HA. I MEAN DID YOU EVER SAW ANYBODY DANCE LIKE THIS?!???<br>I&#39;ve been to school dances, disco, partys,rave &amp; tehno partys but mostly ROCK CONCERTS but I NEVER EVER SAW ANYBODY DANCE LIKE THIS - and HE&#39;S almost 50 - WHAT A JOKE!!!!!! HA HA HA
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2068">34:28</a><br><br>The “You Know My Name (Look up the number) “ of the album 😅
This album and review is comedy Gold😂😂😂. This album equates to multiple personalities/no talent/no self reflection. Some of it sounds like clips from Shaft😂😂😂.
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=441">07:21</a><br>Decent into Madness 😂
Are you wearing a sports bra?
I can’t believe him or his wife at the time made this album listened to it and was like “yes I can’t wait till this album drops”
If you REALLY want some good Corey content, there was a great article I believe it was for Vice magazine, where Corey Feldman had a Hollywood birthday party that seemed very sad. It was a boxers n lingerie party full of like past their prime strippers and has been hollywood types. Real sad to witness but the article was written as an assignment obviously so they author had to pretend to do a positive writeup but its very obvious how gross the whole scene is. Photos prove that it was very sleazy. Like Ron Jeremy was a guest kinda sleazy. I go back to it from time to time when I havent had a good cringe laugh in awhile.
This album was ear AIDS
If this album was 27% better, it would be the worst album.<br>i haven&#39;t and won&#39;t hear it.<br>i just know.
I’m speechless. Now if only Corey Feldman was. Seriously though, I think I just became mentally ill. I need a nap!
Ha ! Corey Feldman actually made it on the bad list ha
Oh boy.   This album might be the worst album that actually had some money behind it of all time.  It really makes albums like, Randy Savage Be A Man, Kevin Federline Playing With Fire, and Leonard Nimoy and William Shatner Spaced Out look like gold.   If Feldman wants to make music fine but the guy can&#39;t sing at all, so he should learn to play a instrument be in the background and let a real singer do the music.  Also the music is terrible and sounds slapped together with little effort.  Get some top level producers and musicians to craft a album you can be proud not this joke of a cd.
So I can shed a little light on this project lol. So feld-dogg had some solid producers on this. Even the legendary battlecat.  Now what cat told me is Feld Dogg had money up the yingyang and was putting this thing together.  Then the funds ran out and he was sitting on the tracks for over a year.  He then brought in some cheap azz producer that knew nothing about mastering and after a year Corey was satisfied with the album anymore. So he had this cheap awful producer add more instruments and thousands of new adlibs to songs that sound OK to Corey&#39;s expectations.  And he completely ruined the mastering.  So if this album sounds confusing its because he added a ton of garbage to songs that were previously mastered and mixed well...I mean it&#39;s Corey&#39;s album so it wouldn&#39;t be great anyways,  but some of these songs did sound better.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=882">14:42</a> Your burp is actually more musical than that entire album.
If this album came out in the 90s he might have had a hit, this is so low grade 90s dance music
You think he would get some music writers and singing coach, that would help him some
Corey Feldmans music might be horrible but if you compare him to other kid stars he&#39;s doing better than most of them, so good for him doing his thing
this is my comfort review.. back when everything was simple
I wanna buy it just to experience how bad it is with my friend who is a sound engineer.
There&#39;s &quot;good bad&quot; and just &quot;bad bad&quot;. This album is &quot;bad bad&quot;. If you like &quot;good bad&quot; check out Univore Champaign Taste (or pretty much anything by Univore) or Marc Rebellit, Flamingo and Girls Club are my two favs. I love the videos for all the songs I mentioned too.
Bahahahahaha what an amazing album
You are correct.  and you look like Steve-O
thank you Corey and Anthony for this high quality piece of entertainment!! 😂🤣 💯
I&#39;ll bet money he&#39;s on heroin which means living in a delusional bubble
A case study of having no talent yet having to pay 18,000 a month rent for 900 sq. ft in Hollywood
It&#39;s fun to watch you enjoy this masterpiece!  Thanks for the great review!
He’s the living personification of Michael Jackson on South Park.
Anyone every tell you that you resemble Steve-O ?
Sounds like he is trying so damn hard to be Michael Jackson it&#39;s cringe-worthy. I appreciate the fact he is toiling away at it, but clearly he doesn&#39;t have someone around him capable of telling him &quot; hey man, this just isn&#39;t your line of work.&quot;
Haha, what childhood
Super funny
Feldman is to Michael Jackson what Greta Van Fleet is to Led Zepellin except wayyy worse. Yikes!
It sounds like the warped twisted shit dog shit version of Princes song &quot;Trust<br>If we  lived in a blackhole were the law of physics dont apply<br>Causing my ear drums to become Spaghettified.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=125">2:05</a><br>&quot;I have no idea why this couldn&#39;t be properly cropped? There&#39;s crappy white lines on the side of the album . . &quot;<br>After knowing everything else about this hilarious disaster, why did you expect a competent album cover?
The artists like Snoop and Durst should be locked up for defrauding a senior citizen (Cory} given the level of artistry they put down on this masterpiece.
Internets biggest race huster
Pick a genre and massacred it already lol.
They could use this for sound torture .
Snoop might have just recorded his piece and didn’t know what song would sound like .  But yea you would think he would want to know lol.
Oh dear 😮
Legendary album 🙌
does the artist have to be self-aware in order to count as part of the weirdcore genre?
I love this video, just seeing this man broke down insanity on a Corey Feldman album is hilarious.
There&#39;s almost something Mike Patton-esque about Feldman
Coreys back again in 2023 Bro! We need another review!
The worst album since time began period😂
The Birdemic of albums
Corey should of got into jazz 😂
That was Farking Hilarious !! You looked like you were getting a Forced Enema on Every Track !!! Priceless !!
Worst album by a has been who at least tried.......told to you by someone who never attempted to even move out out his grandmas basement with the worst body to have tattoos on.........how ironic.......don&#39;t ya think!......
He is completely tone deaf
This is the Action 52 of the pop music in 2016
I actually have grown to like &quot;Ascension Millennium,&quot; but it&#39;s all production. played live, this tune is just as big a garbled mess as all the other ones.
They played this at a funeral.  The deceased got up and walked out.
Would be great if the last track was just the whole album played from the start in its entirety.
I believe there is an Alien planet that worships Corey Feldman&#39;s music somewhere in the universe!!!
The TWENTY TWO tracks on this album?!?!?!? 😮 who even does that anymore except for a greatest hits album 😂😂😂😂😂
I kept wondering who he blew to get on the Today show, not once, but TWICE. 🙄  He must know where someone&#39;s skeletons are buried to get there...  What&#39;s truly crazy is you can tell he thinks he&#39;s so talented &amp; DESERVES to share all this talent with the world.   Talent.  Yeah, right. 🤣
It could fit into the outsider genre.
Most disagree. This album has become album of the decade.
i wonder what a formal review for this wouldve looked like
My entire classroom of third graders loved when i let them listen to this! (This video, not the album. Also im not a teacher. That would never happen because cruelty to children is a crime and should be punished harshly.<br>.by being kept awake permanently with cry Lil sister being blasted like negan did on the walking dead)
What the hell is Kurupt doing on this album?
I wonder what his production bottom line was and how many copies it turned over
&quot;Angry Michael Jackson voice&quot; took me out ☠️
Could this be considered the punkiest and most experimental album ever? Zero fucks given and it’s a straight fuck you to the listener. Borderline causing people to want to k!ll themselves. They should swap the music in the cyberpunk film “Decoder” (where music makes people want to destroy shit and fight) for Corey Feldmans music. It could be considered a Cyberpunk/Horror film.
Ok so fantano looks like a pufferfish.
I don&#39;t know where this video is going, but if it is anything like your comments and theatrics during the first featured song &quot;Ascension&quot;, then I&#39;m in!  You are so damn funny!  Thanks for the chuckles!!!
This album is horrid, it&#39;s complete garbage.  However,  it&#39;s easier to digest than that tattoo on your left arm.
Ross Geller is like: hmmm pretty good album!
William Hung is like, that’s bad!
Fantano&#39;s ad libbed &quot;something out of the 90s&quot; bit was spot on lmfao
My brother, sisters &amp; I put together a better playlist of made up songs when we preformed for our parents in the livingroom while all of us were under the age of 10.
GRANDPA SKRILLEX STILL GETS ME😂😂😂
&quot;We wanted change&quot; is ironically actually the best song in this album.<br><br><br>The circumstances behind it and the godawful production quality makes it an unintentional masterpiece, the instrumental is also very weirdly catchy.
🤔  When &quot;fake it until you make it&quot; goes on way to long. 🤷‍♂️
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1081">18:01</a> timestamp for myself for when Fantano laughs at the hook of this song and then tries singing along only to lose it even further
i just heard it. jesus . straight up  torture core
The king of cringe. The gift that keeps on giving
It sounds like any other song on the current top 20 pop charts
I hope those songs are not as bad as  your tattoos.....................
<b><i>I think the album is supposed to make you dumb!</i></b>
When is Corey Feldman gonna open for Viper the rapper?
Hey @theneedledrop when is Corey gonna open for death grips?
Corey gayman should play a show with earthworm vondoom
long live peep
His live shows are just as terrible as the album...at least he&#39;s consistent.  Maybe we all just don&#39;t get it ?
Damn, Kurupt must have been hard up for money 😂
Every few years I come back and enjoy this review as there&#39;s no way I&#39;d ever listen to the album directly.<br><br>I swear I am NEVER prepared for how bad it is even though I know exactly what it is.
I love that this has basically become The Room of music, Tommy Wiseau should have been a feature
I&#39;m thinking the ultimate challenge for a musician would be to cover this whole album and make it sound good. I&#39;m tempted to give it a try on 1 or 2 of the songs.
Yeah this aint pop i cant even describe this its just blatant rip off of multiple artist and also yeah he has the WORSE signing voice ever and this is total torture its just random producers ripping off there favorite artist and MASHING it UP which while its ear rape
LICKETY SPLICKETY! Greatest lyric of all time.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Brilliant!!!
This album was pretty bad but I think we can all agree that Michael Jordan was a pretty <b>good</b> basketball player
10 bucks says he didn&#39;t pay Snoop Dog money, he just pimped one of his angels to him.
this is genuinely one of the funniest videos on YouTube
I listened ti this whole album, and I now experience Daytime Night Terrors, which is exactly what it sounds like.
Whenever I need a good laugh or to feel better about myself I watch this video
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=557">9:17</a> I&#39;m almost certain that was ripped off from LMFAO &quot;Party Rock Anthem&quot;
Band lab ass music 😂
That synth is from Taio Cruz - Dynamite  lol
He&#39;s dressed like Jeff Hardy on the album cover
Duh Duh Duh
I saw Corey Feldman live and laughed so hard that I tried to tie my shoe and gather myself lest Corey see me and maybe get his feelings hurt. I couldn&#39;t though and eventually ended up in the bleachers and I just lost it. I think there&#39;s video of it out there somewhere
I listened to it and it was unbearable and unbelievable to hear. It was so bad
Anthony, are you all right buddy?
BRILLIANT! Now I can speed up the process of evicting my asshole roommate.
2016 really was the peak of music
Your laugh is infectious haha
😂 I laughed with you and cried about the music!<br>I don&#39;t have any word&#39;s for this that could better yours young man 👍, I&#39;m not much older than Mr Feldman and this has got me gob-smacked 😮🇭🇲
this is the room of albums
I didn&#39;t think it could be that bad, until listened to. Thought it was just bad...then it was played...
It&#39;s viucious, which is a special word I made up just to describe this album because the rest of english didn&#39;t deserve to be associated with it
Trent Reznor if he was acctually talented
i think i&#39;ve sang &quot;we wanted change&quot; to myself more than any other song
I feel like this was the reaction my mom had when I showed her death grips
Dawg I&#39;m so broke, I&#39;d be on Go For It for, like, free dinner.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=818">13:38</a> 😂😂😂😂😂
Corey made the &quot;The Room&quot; of albums
I come back to this whenever I need a pick me up
I don&#39;t even watch fantano that much, but some of his videos (especially this one) are hilarious, from time to time I come here to watch this masterpiece piece.<br><br>btw, man It has been almost 2,5years that I haven&#39;t seen this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1875">31:15</a> Your cliche 90s verse came off better than what it actually ended up being lmao
Anthony, you can’t just give Corey Feldman a zero because he said that TPAB was the greatest album on Earth instead of the greatest album in the universe.
WEEEEEEEEEEEEE WANTED CHANGE
that ripoff was i think kesha
Wow, this album is just bad to the core...y.
The man had to have been on some strong drugs for him to think that he could sing, he definitely has some demons going on lo!
this album is the uncanny valley of music
Hard disagree that Mercy is R&amp;B inspired. It&#39;s very clearly a rip off of Linkin Park&#39;s slow sections. Like, all of them, all at once.
You wondering if it’s the worst of the year?? It’s one of the worst things I have ever heard. And I’m older , -I’ve heard a lot !!  Again, not wanting to be a dick, but his ego in thinking he can pull this off. All the different genres, etc. the growling vocals, and oh, cover John Lennon ?!! Are you kidding me??  I’m at the end of your hilarious reaction video.  It’s been fun, but come on, Cory …don’t take yourself so seriously.
The artwork ( I use that term loosely ) , on the album looks like early, early photoshop work. I’m still only halfway through your reaction, and it’s awesome to watch you go through this for us!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
back for my yearly torture. I do it for the holy spirit jangus
L I C K E T Y <br>S P L I C K Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y
In Utero if it was good
OMG! That jazz THING!!! WHAT WAS THAT????? OH NO! It&#39;s still going!!!!. He&#39;s singing now...oh my God, no...
Like who puts out this and goes... &quot;That&#39;s good. I want people to hear me do THIS!&quot;
Dude...that Fred Dirst song was like...it&#39;s like an insane person&#39;s mind.
I&#39;m so confused, this music is triggering my flight or fight response but I&#39;m kind of into it ?? it&#39;s so uncomfortable to listen to yet I don&#39;t want to turn it off... I feel like I&#39;ve stared into the abyss and the abyss has stared into me.
If this album had mediocre lyrics, listenable mixing, and decent singing, I would be very underwhelmed by it and confused by the structure. But it doesn’t have good lyrics, it doesn’t have good mixing and it has absolutely horrendous singing. It’s bad.
Late to the party but Gorillaz sounds AWFUL on this album
This is the only good fantano video everything thing else he makes should be burned with him
This album sounds like the very concept of music dying of an overdose at a party and Feldman and all of the collaborators are too wasted to call an ambulance.
This album is so headache inducing, i really wonder if somebody managed to listen to it whole at one take
We finnaly found put what is sounds when doves cry...
How come all of the songs on this album sound like a soundtrack to the very shitty lucid dreams I sometimes have.
The fact that he didn’t even use the green screen and slapped on the cover as an overlay is really funny but pisses me off immensely.
Damn, she really is stuck mentally in 2001
After 6 years I’m finally deciding to embark on the adventure of this album. Pray for me soldiers 🫡.
Watched The Room yesterday and made me want to jam out the music equivalent hahahaha
Yep
this album sounds like sitting in traffic in a hot car, with someone who keeps changing the radio station, at 3pm on a Monday afternoon.
Either this is a man who took way too many drugs, or the greatest parody album of all time. I personally subscribe to the theory that both were involved
Also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1053">17:33</a> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1129">18:49</a> lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1957">32:37</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2178">36:18</a> Funniest part lol
this album feels like being uncomfortable under a heavy blanket in summer
stand by me is a pretty sick film
Figured it was time to re-watch this classic.
You ask why the producer didn&#39;t say &quot;maybe we should do another take&quot;. I&#39;m thinking they did, many times, and that was still the best one.
The Troll 2 or The Room of albums, less listenable than The Shaggs.
You’ve heard while my guitar gently weeps.  Now hear a saxophone painfully die. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1312">21:52</a>
Not so bad it’s good.  So bad it’s a masterpiece.
We Wanted Change is such a great song!
Petition to make Corey-core a thing.  It’s all about bad photoshopping, camp, bad music and movies, cheap/free sound effects and loops (think pixabay and looperman), papyrus font and other cheap editing fonts, filters and effects.  It’s mildly Y2K too, cause of the 2000’s-2010’s pop vibe a lot of his stuff and his vibe has.
This album really sounds like it was just lifted right out of 1996 or something, and had some tragic accidents while travelling through time.
I’m pained by the fact fantano never reviewed love left 2 despite reviewing the singles.
I go back and listen to Angelic 2 the Core about once a year because its so damn funny. I personally love it and it never gets old. Its fun bad. Lickety Splickety!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1270">21:10</a> magnum opus
Corey feldman is the neil breen of pop music
You suck.
This man should have done a career making for songs for Eurovision, this is the kind of shit you hear in that accursed competition. He would knock out of the park with Ascension Millenium, I would make my entire family call to vote.
Fantano in 2018: <b>gives Bladee a 1/10</b><br>Fantano now: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1737">28:57</a>
Having just listened to Nostalgia Critic&#39;s The Wall, I can say, authoritatively, that it is worse than Angelic 2 the Core.
Feldman is the <b>Babs Johnson</b> of the entertainment industry. Divine/Babs won the honor of being <b>the filthiest person alive</b> in Pink Flamingos, and Corey <b>won</b> the trophy for Worst Album of the Decade. Congrats!
I come back to this review at least once every six months
I don’t mind it I must be as nuts as he is
This sounds like a long-lost Devin Townsend project from the 80s. Yes, I am well-aware that he was not releasing music in 80s and was just a kid then.
Snoop couldn’t have put less effort into his verse. Not that I blame him
If this music played at a club, I&#39;d burn the club down and check myself into an insane asylum.
This makes Tom Macdonald&#39;s music sound Oscar worthy.
Still gotta give him some credit. Its not easy to make an album this horrible
Corey Feldman is actually a legit &amp; natural artist.
Still an absolute banger of a video in 2023 💀
I got my popcorn ready to go let’s go for this ride! Can the Shaggs and the fel dog make an album next?
This album is like simultaneously outdated and ahead of it’s time
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=451">7:31</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1087">18:07</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2482">41:22</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1628">27:08</a> 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣 this album is the epitome of penis music
Fantanos magnum opus
This album sounds like the worst kind of music that bad porno would possibly allow.
you missed the hidden track at the end!!! you gotta go back and redo the video
this video really is one of the best on youtube, coming up on 7 years old and i still gotta come back to it every few months. iconic album
This cant be the worst album. It made me laugh too hard
I thought this was Lawrence of Arabia from Full Metal Jacket in the video at first hahaha... I swear, you remind of Private Pyle haha... where gunnery sergeant  Hartman? 😄
For those who have only taken this album in with Melon&#39;s review, there is a part in Forbidden attraction with Corey unzipping his pants and moaning in your ear.
This is what rape victims end up like
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1995">33:15</a> is where I turned into The Joker
Bruce Willis fresh from die hard listening to bad albums 😂
anthony&#39;s laughter is so infectious
I’m sure a bunch of people have said this already: this is “The Room” of albums. Got the same vibe.
I listened to this whole album out of pure curiosity. Worst…mistake…ever
What kind of set-up do you have where your monitor moves when you lean back in your chair.
This is like special needs music.
Rockstar did a much better job at recording music with their in house band for gta 3 than this lol
I wonder how Corey Feldman and Captain Beefheart would have a cup of tea? Lickety splicky? Or a piece of Hair pie?
Best comedy album of all time
This album is the music version of The Room.
This is the funniest video he’s ever made
Anthony dancing at the start of the first track only to break out in uncontrollable laughter is one of the funniest things
WHY ARE KURUPT AND SNOOP ON THIIIIIIS
I always throw this on when I need cheering up
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=265">4:25</a><br>You could say it&#39;s delusional... 2 the core
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1920">32:00</a> &quot;you bring the stars up to the moon&quot;  fantano- &quot;thats wrong&quot;, how dude he&#39;s bringing the stars closer up to the distance the moon is, wtf thats moron status, the stars are farther so you bring them up to the moon from where your looking,wtf dude
You could press this review onto vinyl and it would still be better that the album.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=326">5:26</a> that&#39;s frightening he does because Feldman was straight up a victim of Michael Jackson
This album is ridiculous
its good .
Snoop Dogg is on both the decade&#39;s best album and the decade&#39;s worst album
I&#39;m glad Anthony repeated Corey&#39;s line &quot;Lickety splicky,&quot; because I thought maybe I just had a minor stroke
can&#39;t tell you how many times I&#39;ve watched this
snoop dogg is simultaneously on the best album of the 2010&#39;s and the worst album of the 2010&#39;s. to me that is just amazing.
So this is what cocaine abuse looks like in album form... FUCK. That song about changing and hearing &quot;WE WERE TOGETHAAAA&#39; made me have a reverse boner. Now I&#39;m in the hospital. Thanks Feld Man.
Look... that&#39;s what we call a MIDLIFE-CRISIS KIDS
Creepy Fun Fact: lf you play this album backwards, it actually sounds better.
This is the musical equivalent of The Room. It&#39;s just amazing that a human being made this
There are a few good tracks with good instrumentals and beats, but every single vocal performance is so bad that it is hard to describe
Is this Anthony&#39;s longest review?
22 songs, lol. Prolific songwriter...
I know a podcast where two men listen to one album 10 times a week every week. This one nearly drove them insane I&#39;m pretty sure.
Corey Feldman is the celebrity Chris Chan
Fantano is the whitest thing I&#39;ve ever seen
<b>slowly adds these songs 2 my interrogation playlist</b>
I got Corey Feldman and Corey Taylor confused so for a second I was listening to this thinking “damn the guy from slipknot really fell off”
&quot;Ascension Millenium&quot; is the goofiest song ever lol
Youngest dude I’ve ever seen with dentures
Anthony Fantano is the only person that wanted to get a tattoo sleeve and literally just got a tattoo of a sleeve.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=258">4:18</a> Delusional 2 The Core
Yes, this music is pointless and awful. Yes, you earned a few clicks commenting on this continuing destruction of Western culture. But why do you imagine that any thinking person wants to watch your face reacting to stupidity? And why, if you are a thinking person, did you not capitalize on your likeness to Curt Smith while doing this inane activity?
Hilarious 😅
Yeah fantano, I heavily agree with you. I listened 5 fucking seconds to the first song, and I lost all of my remaining brain cells. This is truly the worst mixtape of all time no cap
If 2020 was an album
Too bad he skipped the attempt at a metal breakdown in middle of the Ska song, laughed put loud when that popped up 😂😂
I feel like I&#39;ve gone too far down the experimental music rabbit hole because some of this album sounds... good to me. I&#39;ve been listening to music that barely sounds like music and breaks all the rules, so now I can even jam out to Corey Feldman. I need to go and bleach my brain because something isn&#39;t right.
And we thought Tom Macdonald was bad 😭
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1697">28:17</a> tell me how Corey Feldman created an anime opening on accident
2016
this is what happens when you get diddlled as an 80s child actor in hollywood
You should have said &quot;Delusional 2 The Core&quot;
This is the album that truly broke him
It&#39;s not corniness, it&#39;s Coreyness.
this album would be a 10/10 if it was intentional.
I must have seen this video 20 times at this point
This album is that kind of bad where first you laugh at it but then there is this creeping feeling of disgust mixed with sympathy
An album so bad he had to revert to his 2009 review style.
WEEEEEEEEEEEEEE WERE TOGETHER
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=830">13:50</a> gets me every time lol fantano just bewildered by wtf is going on at the intro of this song
I&#39;ll be the first one to buy this record if released on vinyl. I&#39;ll buy two. One to listen to it. Another to frame and hang on wall with a caption: &quot;Worse album EVER!&quot;
my favorite corey feldman story is when i went to a signing with a director who had worked with corey, and a guy asked if he&#39;d be able to do a reunion with the whole cast of a show he worked on. the director started listing people who would be down to be in a reunion, and when the other guy asked about feldman, the director said &quot;oh of course corey would show up. no one&#39;s fucking hiring corey.&quot;
shit sounds like cartoon parody music
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=189">3:09</a>
Every time I’m feeling a bit blue, on goes this video….thank you Needle drop…it’s sunshine in 50.53 minutes 😆😆
No way it’s brilliant 😂😂😂😂😂
I always come back to this. It’s just tony fantony making flabbergasted faces for an hour set to the worst fucking music imaginable lmao, love it
Just realized the Core part of the album title is a play on words for Corey’s first name.  This album just does not stop delivering
even the fucking CLB sounded great after this
Feldawg!
This album is actually incredible, a non stop barrage of the worst sonic choices made in rapid succession
The craziest thing about the album, after having actually listened to it, is the fact that Anthony didn’t even choose the worst bits of the album<br><br>This album has so much more in store if you dare to give it a listen
Corey literally imitated the styles of Snoop Dog, Fred Durst, Doc Ice And Members Of Pink Floyd And The Black Eyed Peas All on this album
Dude thinks he&#39;s in the 80s, 90s and around 2009 at the same time
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1876">31:16</a>
Apple Music says a similar artist to Corey Feldman is the Death Grips<br>The algorithm is fucked
quadecas biggest inspiration fr
I come back to this video at least once a year to see melon loose his sanity to this
This video is a perfect demonstration of a man losing his mind and diving into insanity, this should be analised by jcs criminal psychology before he does something

Up there with The Room for sure
i was listening to the review and deadass thought that the part at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1885">31:25</a> where u were singing was corey<br>the album is so bad
My question is, if it&#39;s obviously bad  why would he be on the Today show? Why would you even review it? Is it done bad on purpose to attract attention? This music is so bad and amateur it&#39;s really not worth the attention it got. But I honestly think people love to hate and that&#39;s why we even heard about this record.
&quot;Angelic 2 The Core&quot; is so cheesy, that album is making even the most expensive cheese seem cheap.
Corey Haim is rolling in his grave after realizing what his fellow Corey did.
I wish that fantano had done twitch livestream reactions back in 2016 so we could’ve seen his first reactions to the songs on this shit-show album
Idk I feel like if he had a lil more talent he could’ve made it work maybe
Dressed up for the show, eh?😝 Listening to you ramble is painful.
So this album alongside Nostalgia Critic&#39;s The Wall, Psychosexual&#39;s Torch The Faith and Corey Taylor&#39;s CMFT are albums to avoid. Okay, sounds good!
A true innovator and revolutionary. Only a couple of years later, the whole industry would go on to praise Billie Eilish for her angsty &#39;Bad Guy&#39; &quot;duh&quot;.
Oh my fucking god this video lol the part when you introduced the song Mercy fucking KO&#39;d me.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1726">28:46</a> - Maybe Corey Feldman is an energy vampire. That would explain a lot.

The work doesn&#39;t even warrant a review or response. This is the kind of record that record critics simply pass over. It&#39;s way too easy to tear it apart and call it the worst album of the year. Nothing you say about it will surprise anyone. It&#39;s just bad without even taking the plastic off.
It’s like he was inspired by soft core porn background music?
Hate to say it but I heard the bridge on Springstein’s “Night Shift” and my first thought was “Corey Feldman”
You lost me at track 12...I can&#39;t...I&#39;m weak! Go on without me!
I&#39;m sticking with the statement that this is all a joke and he&#39;s in it for the long con someday he&#39;s just sitting there laughing like some really bad Bond villain just having the time of his life watching people lose their shit over this   that&#39;s what it&#39;s got to be.  it just has to be   please let it be
They are 10 year olds with an iPhone that can make better music than this in their backyard
I&#39;d like to meet the people that thought this was a good idea are they professional music engineers and producers and they actually put their name on this holy crap why they&#39;ll never go to work again
Apparently there was an angelic one.   I missed it thank God apparently

I feel like some beats (like at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1347">22:27</a>) have potential to be something people could vibe to, BUT THEN YOU GET A F***KING DOG GROWL AT YOU. At this point we should worry for Corey, no way he ruined something with potential this horribly without realizing.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1037">17:17</a> the moment we all found out he was sitting the whole time.
Last time a guy named Corey spawned something this bad, I was born.
crazy that this and TPAB exist in the same world
The song ya got me is painful to listen to
I’ve watched this about a dozen times over the last few years.  Mostly just to hear Anthony laughing.  Always lifts my spirits.
It still makes me gag to even hear a few seconds of that album!
Well, I genuinely enjoyed a lot to this album.  Fantano may see it as ripoff of styles but I prefer to see it as grabbing those styles and making them as his own. This is unlike anything I&#39;ve ever heard, very original. Album of 2016 baby.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2260">37:40</a> Fantano sounds like Vince Neil or Bret Michaels when he says &quot;THE PAIIIN&quot;.
The more I hear Corey Feldman sing the more I want to never meet him.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=557">9:17</a> party rockers in the house tonight
Fantano: The Movie
Working Class Hero is the worst track on here. Because it&#39;s a cover of an amazing song.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1340">22:20</a> I love that sax
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=842">14:02</a> this is easily the best track on the album. I really like that guitar and the piano is absolutely killer.<br>I&#39;m serious.
Banter between Corey and Kurupt sounds so forced and Corey tries to sound ghetto.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=670">11:10</a> his reactions are so feminine
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=260">4:20</a> delusional 2 the core?
A new Feldman album released. It&#39;s like 3 hours long. You know what to do.
This is what we&#39;ll be listening to in 2342 our tiny minds just can&#39;t comprehend yet.
Feels like the music equivalent to “The Room”
100% Pure Uncut Crap.
I think Corey Feldman cannot sing or dance for sh*t and he&#39;s trying to be like Michael Jackson. <br>🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂 Hahaha !!!
Anthony looks zesty af in this video
CHIMININANA.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=557">9:17</a> is the synth from Pitbulls everything tonight
is like this is for a different species
Corey Feldman sounds like an even more demented beetlejuice, absolutely amazing
His MJ sounds like a geriatric gremlin
crackle crackle
There will never ever be another album like Angelic 2 The Core. This album really was made by angels and makes “To Pimp a Butterfly”, “The Money Store”, “Kids See Ghosts”, and “To Be Kind” look like 0/10s
I just somehow stumbled on this at 2am and spent over an HOUR pausing and reading every single snippet and then listening to the song as a whole. This shit is INSANE! I only have a surface level understanding of who Die Antwoord are, but with even just that this does not surprise me. I am sorry this girl had to go through this. I really hope she&#39;s gotten the help, or therapy, she needs to deal with all of this, because this is no joke. This hit me so hard. I hope you&#39;re ok; love from the US❤
Die Antwood and Peep aren&#39;t even COMPARABLE to this garbage. I don&#39;t like Die Antwood or that Peep album, at all, but let&#39;s not act like they are in the same UNIVERSE as this. There are people out there that love Die Antwood and Peep; no one likes this album.
released a year after tpab.
My favorite part is probably the lead piano in We Wanted Change, where it&#39;s extremely obvious that he has NO IDEA what the fuck he is playing. He is obviously aimlessly tapping the white keys on a piano the same way that a toddler would, but thinks &quot;it&#39;s jazz, so you can play anything&quot;, not realizing that he is demonstrating the exact opposite.
My boyfriend didnt know what this album was so I told him to listen to it as a joke and I had to try and stop him and he listened but skipped most of the songs 💀
Angelic 2 The Core walked so To Pimp A Butterfly could fly.
W H E E E E E E E is the best hook
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2120">35:20</a> I&#39;m dying
Let’s make sure Anthony makes it’s to the year 2100 just so we can see this be the worst album of the century
Good music.
☆☆☆☆☆@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1065">17:45</a> YOU Had Me with your Dance Moves and Laughs!! Well at least We had a Great Laugh about this and maybe just maybe that&#39;s what Corey Feldman wanted All Along. I must Say this So-called Album would make a Great Halloween party night. Just don&#39;t dress up as Corey. LOL Good Job on this Hysterical Review 👍👍😂😂😂😂😂😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2481">41:21</a> Anthony&#39;s slow realization about Corey Feldman singing about his niece is so funny
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=502">8:22</a> YOU SHALL NOT PASS
These vocals are truly muppets on hard drugs.
the face at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2745">45:45</a> perfectly represents this experience
Going to be honest, that Everybody track just sounds like Disney parade music
Dude , You are Obviously in love with the Felt Dawg,  All of this fake hatred and contempt for his music and attack on his musical talent or lack there of, seems sad , Did he shoot you down when you finally got up the nerve to shoot your shot, so to speak .? Isn&#39;t it enough that the illuminati ordered him to make a fool of himself or pay with his life for being a whistle blower , ( pardon the pun ). How are you gonna feel about this when they really decide his numbers up , Average lifespan of  those in the entertainment industry 45 to 50 years , let it go man ...
To all the haters of this album, wait until 94 minutes and 41 seconds, that&#39;s when it gets really good!
90s...there was the Barenaked Ladies &quot;mmmm mmmm mmm mmm..&quot; at least the songs sounded good.. funny..didn&#39;t know they had a song titled, &quot;Be My Yoko Ono.&quot;
lol 3rd song played with the Charlie&#39;s angels <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=643">10:43</a> ..reminded me of the intro.. instrumentals to Stevie Nick&#39;s White Winged Dove
The Room: The Movie: The Album
Why is a wegmans ad for wine so perfect for a midroll
This album would be better comedically if it wasn&#39;t so challenging to listen to. Like it&#39;s actually hard sitting through it and really paying attention to what&#39;s happening when there&#39;s a bunch of voices talking to you like schizophrenia, and then all these layered parts that mesh weirdly
I still come back to this video when I want a good laugh
Music producer: &quot;So what kind of <b>sound</b> are you looking for?&quot;<br><br>Corey Feldman: &quot;yes.&quot;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=803">13:23</a> I just heard this song,  it was one of the most repulsive things ever made
literal mic spam audio lmao
If nothing else, but there is MUCH more else - his weird stanning of MJ is quite the thing.  Still dressing like him and ripping him off.  Like... the best way to pay tribute is not to cover or to rip-off, but do something good (enough) and then let everyone know that other work is why yours exists.  But this is Corey - so, we get what we get, and I would not change it anyway, for anything in the world.
Anthony suffered so I didn’t have to, which I wouldn’t have because I never would have known about this album without TND reviewing it lol
Can&#39;t beleive the guy has 10,010 monthly listeners on spotify
Idk why I’ve always thought this but this album is musics equivalent to Tommy Wiseau’s The Room.
Its so bad fantano&#39;s laughs make it better
I bet Frank Zappa loves this album lol
Wow he used my guitar part from &quot;You Crossed the Line&quot;   I had no idea.  Might have to have to send the feldog a message about that
Im swaying towards this album actually being a troll???
this album sounds WAY BETTER through your shitty laptop speakers
this video doesn&#39;t get old, nor does the cringe factor
It was at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=443">7:23</a> that Anthony sadly lost his mind and was sent to assisted living
What&#39;s crazy is, his acting is good. But he&#39;s not good at music. Just, not one bit.
every time anthony mimics corey’s singing he unironically sounds 10 times better
this album goated frfr
FYI Corey just performed Duh! the other night on tour in Pittsburgh and everyone loved it so sounds like my boy got the last laugh... again. 🙂
Guess you missed the OBVIOUS Max Headroom references in the skits. Explains a lot
Making fun of someone&#39;s TALENT does not make a good review. Just sayin
This whole album reminds me of when I was in 3rd grade and our music teacher made an assignment for everyone in the class to ‘write a song’ using the stock loops in Sony Acid. Somehow, I have a feeling that the worst songs in the class were still more coherent and listenable than this absolute travesty to human auditory perception.
It sounds like he made it in his bedroom using a bootleg version of Pro tools software…and the “music” is like late 80’s teen TV movie of the week hip hop the producers of the movie of the week made themselves to save money.
I laughed my ass off watching this review.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1311">21:51</a> Sad deflating sax moment
WeEeeEEeeeE wanted change
I think after 20 minutes or so your brain was melting hahaha
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2115">35:15</a> my god im rolling on the ground actually. put at x.5 speed lol.
your improv rendition takes are much better than anything on this pos lol. that synth lead was amazing lol.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1030">17:10</a> sounds like gorillaz but worse.
Probably commented already. But is this guy like the Neil Breen of music? Maybe playing a character. But also maybe genuinely trying to make good stuff but being so so bad at it.
Good news guys, Melon has a new album of Corey&#39;s to review....
Good news guys, Melon has a new album of Corey&#39;s to review....
Corey Feldman&#39;s magnum opus? Is The Goonies. Think about that.
Fantano really wishes somebody could have contributed to the consistency of this album, if they did involve themselves in it. He wants to make sure—you—you know he’s a stickler about consistency
It&#39;s almost as bad as listening to a woke person talk politics.
This is politician dancing music. Karl Rove would love it.
It&#39;s a good comedy album.
Anthony got Filtered
Corey has created a new genre:<br>Shitepop
That first track sound like it’s tidy up music from bob the builder
The funniest thing is that when I was listening to it I didn&#39;t find it nearly as horrifying as you thought. Well, until this review and listening to it more closely. See, the parts before the real horror came into play on each track tended to be so bland that I seem to have tuned out the rest of every single track. I&#39;m not sure if &quot;I tuned it out before it reached its true depths of suck&quot; is a negative or a positive.
Sorry Corey you can&#39;t sing
I&#39;ve watched this video more than listened to the actual album
He&#39;s a concerned uncle 🤣🤣🤣
Pretty sure Lovin Lies rips off the synth line from Neon Lights by Demi Levato
Still better than anything Weezer’s doing these days
HE RELEASED A NEW ALBUM THIS YEAR OHHHH MY GOD
Probablt the best review ever!
I’m sure there’s at least one person besides Cory Feldman himself that thinks this record is actually good
This makes Shatner’s album sound like art
I had to stop at track 12. I can’t imagine what you had to put yourself through to do this.
Imagine writing an album for 10 years and having a reviewer genuinely uncontrollably laugh at it.<br>Fully justified but still.<br>Alot of the tracks are actually copied and samples too surprisingly.
A -1 should&#39;ve showed up on the screen at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=3045">50:45</a>
Corey Feldman sings like the Chuck E Cheese animatronic doing an MJ impression
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=234">3:54</a> when Anthony snaps is still some of the funniest shit I’ve ever seen. The timing of frustration, all with one perfectly unfiltered “umm….so GODDAMN IT! 22 SONGS!!”
this has the same energy as a hostage negotiation video
One of his songs just sounds like Beautiful Soul. I listened to it wondering why I felt like I heard it from somewhere.
Do it lickity splicky???
This is like the modern day “The Shaggs” but if they weren’t forced to make music by their dad
This is “The Room” of music
After watching this, I can’t believe that we all believed he was standing during his reviews and not in a swivel chair
i geniunely fell asleep while listening to this album. at least it can cure insomnia, so thats something
How is Corey not destroying his voice doing the MJ impression?
I don&#39;t care when, but Corey needs to make another album.
Ok but besides the lyrics, vocal performances, production, features, concepts, album cover, and skits/intros, this album is actually pretty good. 😊
Dude the rude burp and &quot;no excuse me &quot;as you were speaking about what makes you sick , made me sick as I was eating with earbuds in so my girlfriend didn&#39;t have to endure the Feld dawg, , I&#39;m eating a chicken salad sandwich and that was just too much man , so fuck off
This is certainly one of the albums of all time
On a second watch through of this video, all the songs sound like the worst versions of other artists. Like around 27 mins in kinda sounds like if nine inch nails sucked
It&#39;s been 6 years. My rewatch count is likely in the triple digits.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2596">43:16</a> &quot;Mercy, UH AH!&quot;. I&#39;m done 😂😂
lickity splickity has potential to be a beastie boys track
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=458">7:38</a> gets me every time.
The sketches are actually so much crazier than you think. They intro with the Batman transition sound, are framed as being Charlie&#39;s angels briefings, play The Shaft theme, and use Mission Impossible dialogue (&quot;your mission, should you choose&quot;). Fucking insane
Time for my yearly fix of this masterpiece video.
He swiveled in his chair! AND WE STILL DIDN&#39;T NOTICE!
I wouldn&#39;t have been able to make it through the album without you, Melon. Thank you.
Snoop better have at least got 50k
He had a party when he was done with this album.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=442">7:22</a> I just can&#39;t get this off my head! At least it&#39;s normal-sounding compared to...... the rest.
No, you crossed the line, Corey, making this album!<br><br>Greatest video on youtube.
jesus....
We need Chanel West Coast and CF to do a collaboration a new Album.
This sounds like a Mindless Self-Indulgence album, but was meant to be taken seriously.
As pure comedy the album holds up.
This album would be good if it wasn’t bad
This record sounds like the best unintentional shitpost
It&#39;s the nightly partying, heavy drinking, and chain-smoking. <br><br>That will give you that real quick. Also kills any stamina he has. Half the time he is out of breath and really REALLY pushing out the last works like your grandmothers death rattle when she dies in the darkness of that cabin in the woods she called home. <br><br>She has all his childhood books there and that is where he got most of his metaphor training and practice. <br><br>Also, Snoop probably cane with the mix that Corey bought and butchered. So he&#39;s going to get that voice over because he paid for it on the track. Most people would just get rid of it and do their own shit over that track or pay the money to have the real guy show up but then ain&#39;t going to happen with a Feldman project I believe.
It sounds like early DCOM montage music
“I wish I had a hammer here,<br>because if I did I would keep tempo with this song on my skull with it” that fucking killed me
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1737">28:57</a><br>2016 Fantano: “I’m being drained”<br>2022 Fantano: Gives Bladee an 8/10
Is Corey Feldman back on drugs? What the hell was he thinking when he made this album. Does he really believe that this stuff sounded good. There&#39;s so many questions I want to ask him about this album and what he was thinking. This music is worse than devil daddy and pyschosexual, the music made by Jeremy Spencer from 5 finger death punch.
This album makes me Depersonalize and i feel like i have to stop myself from Listening this shit has to be the devil
holy shit i don’t know why i never made the connection. this is exactly like tommy wiseau and the room!
This album is more interesting than Actually, Nevermind
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1312">21:52</a> not at all trying to be funny, but I genuinely thought those horns were a sample of a baby crying at first.
This album sounds like playing different equally trash songs all at the same time on a computer and then it crashed while playing the songs
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1737">28:57</a> Fantano when he heard Crest.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1330">22:10</a> may be my favorite part of the album
This is the first goofy ahh album to ever be made
Too think that snoop dogg was on this album a year after To Pimp A Butterfly came out
I love this album I think that you have to have a certain mind to be able to understand how beautiful this art is and if you can&#39;t this is a clear way to filter those people out
Just 20 seconds into the record and was traumatized, i cannot look at music the same way i used to, im scared for life.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=567">9:27</a> its ripped off from who dat girl by flo rida &amp; akon
back for my annual rewatch
i feel bad for corey
This is The Room of music.
the limbo of the lost of albums
I&#39;m seeing Corey in Concert in a few months.. please pray for my ears..
I’ve never seen a 50 min review until now
&quot;Thinking about my niece&quot;<br>ZAMN😍
So bad it&#39;s good
Just in general, Feldman in my opinion, thinks he’s still a celebrity. When someone tries so hard to stay in the spotlight and looks desperate trying to do so, that’s the worst thing that could happen to any “has been”. Going through several different “looks”, such as Michael Jackson and a dork/nerd/losers, make you appear even more desperate. You’re not attractive (never have been), slightly musically inclined and pretending to be famous ……..give it up and live your life like us “normal”, “regular” people
ok fantano, if this was made by Kendrick Lamar and the music was from To Pimp a Butterfly you would have given it a 10. Enough with the Feldman hate.
Can&#39;t decide which one is worse, We Wanted Change or 4 Bid In Attraction. The former is definitely the worst sounding, worst sung and worst performed song on the album, but the latter is just fucking repulsive and nauseating.<br>Also, the beat on the title track, Angelic 2 The Core, seems to be ripped off from the victory theme of Castle Crashers.
Yah - it&#39;s hilariously awful.  But it&#39;s no more terrible that the shit that Lil Pump vomits out, and calls it a single.  It&#39;s no worse than fucking Migos who mumble their way through superficial idiocy...Lil Xan?  Equally horrid.  Seriously, I get that it&#39;s easy as hell to make fun of Corey Feldman&#39;s ridiculous music but the puke that he&#39;s puking really isn&#39;t any worse than the majority of mumble rappers out there who repeat the same lines over and over ad nauseum.  At least that&#39;s my take.
Watching this again on my annual visit. Mercy slaps.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1996">33:16</a> i fucking lost it
I almost forgot to watch this today.
That jazz song gave me some Wesley Willis vibes
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=830">13:50</a> actual penis music.
this sht goes hard on mute
The only album that deserves both 0 and 10 at the same time.
the producer never went over the music more than once again because imagine being in the studio / keeping in contact with someone like him (and on that my coke oop)
Everything single one if these songs, especially the slower, sad ones, sound like something that you would hear on South Park
This is what happens when you get diddled by MJ......
Snoop being the exception, once you are featured on a Feldog album, you re clearly no longer relevant. Kills me that Fred was ever relevant to begin with, but once you get to Feldog... it&#39;s just beyond over. You are 6 feet under
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1737">28:57</a> fantano was always a drainer.
This doesn&#39;t go hard on mute.
Actually Tommy wiseau of music
I&#39;m listening this in the background, and I kid you not I have constantly tabbed back into the video because I thought an ad was playing, but no it&#39;s instead Corey Feldman&#39;s masterful musical production.
This is the only album where you have to clap on 1 and 3
Whenever big things happen in my life I go back to this vid, whatever happens in my life at least melon listening to angelic 2 the core remains forever ❤️
This album is what Wesley&#39;s theory sounds like to Ben Shapiro
Cory Feldman making the worst 80s and 90s music in 2016. God bless
some people get drunk and send dick pics; corey feldman sends drunk voice memos to that one friend-of-a-friend who&#39;s a music producer and tells him to &quot;make it sound good&quot;
I think this finally broke fantano
this may or may not be Fantano&#39;s most naturally unhinged video....
i dont normally comment on videos especially not ones this old but i need to tell the internet that my dad got mad at me for my executive dysfunction issues due to watching “gay videos” on youtube instead of showering, and told me not to get upset with him calling them gay in a completely irrelevant context because he looked at my school ipad which i had been watching this video on and saw “a gay guy”<br>i have absolutely no clue which one hes calling gay but either way i find it hysterical
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1086">18:06</a> explain to me what happened please
I went soo long without watching this review, i am, now, in a better place since.
This is BREATHTAKINGLY horrible. WOW...simply WOW.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1065">17:45</a> I feel like this track is telling me to let go of my soul, because listening to this album isn&#39;t worth it anymore.
This album was pretty good.
The skits are probs the best part, though.<br><br>I’m not saying they’re good. But maybe better than the music.
First time watching this in 2022, I’m just dipping my toe in then running back to The Heart Part 5 before I Overdose of this trash
Instrumentally, this album sounds like the shit you&#39;d hear in a Thrillville minigame
I think this whole thing is disingenuous.   I don&#39;t care for the music I heard from Corey&#39;s album, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s all that terrible.  It&#39;s just really different.  But Corey is different.  And he&#39;s expressing himself, so who really cares?   At any rate, I&#39;d rather listen to Corey&#39;s album then look at this guy&#39;s tattoo, which is grossing me out.
you could put toot sounds anywhere on this album and not really notice
The Arctic Monkeys used that Jazzy lo-fi track as a inspiration for their last album
I’n my opinion the album is a strong 3 to a life 4
Wow, the baddest album of 2016. I&#39;m so glad Anthony turned me on to this long lost hidden gem!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1104">18:24</a> this album got my man looking like the next Joker casting 💀
<b>*Listens to entire album*</b> <br>&quot;Wait..... this is Angelic 2 The Core?&quot; <br>&quot;Always has been&quot;
its fascinating to me how he clearly doesnt know how to write lyrics so he just repeats the same thing over and over
Jesus fucking christ i laughed so damn hard at this.
Would you rather listen to yoko ono over this?
Yo, I recognize the music from those skits, it&#39;s Dick Daqger&#39;s Theme from Pornosonic - album of faux adult film music from &#39;99, with short skits from Ron Jeremy no less and it&#39;s actually a groovy tune.
These songs sound like the joke songs that play when a cartoon character is clicking through radio stations.
Ok, this album sounds like Feldman grabbed a bunch of public domain generic music, threw it in a blender, then put his own super homogenous vocals over each track. There&#39;s no understanding of melody, or even real representation of melody, aside from random backing instrumentation which, again, feels like it&#39;s public domain...that kind of generic. <br><br>There&#39;s so much going on in each track as overcompensation for the inability to write a song. Just throw a ton of samples and drum machines, synth riffs, and call it experimental. <br><br>Now, there&#39;s a song called Discorilla, by Rick Dees, which I put in the category as &#39;one of the worst songs ever&#39;, but it&#39;s still a song. This Feldman album doesn&#39;t cross that threshold.
4 My Love sounds like an M2M song but absolutely atrocious HAHAHAHAHAHA
this had me frowning all throughout
jesus fucking christ the synth one sounds like its from LMFAO HAHAHAHAHA
In my world this video has evolved into a warm blanket which I need on a monthly basis.
I want this to be the only piece of media preserved through the apocalypse, and the only thing alien races have to judge us off of.
these songs make me want to puke if i listen too long, it&#39;s like a rollercoaster for your ears in all the nauseating ways
I wish he had more this informal reaction videos
The real crime is that white tank top
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=840">14:00</a> like playing multiple Nokia ringtones at once.
I dont know man, I kinda like this album.
I understand angelic part of it for reason me and Corey Haim used to actually play at King David and King Solomon&#39;s grave in the row of Kings when we were kids out at the agency does anybody know what the agency is well that&#39;s where you go hang out with people like Catherine Hepburn and Henry Fonda and John Wayne well we were little kids we got to play at the grave of King David in the grave of Solomon and the row of Kings..... I&#39;m just glad he made that album it&#39;s perfect
I&#39;m glad you don&#39;t understand the album...<br>But it&#39;s grown up around the time of the quarries we understand it very much if you only understood where Corey Haim grew up when he was little you&#39;d understand about the abyss the Angels pulling the other Corey out...
There&#39;s a lot more to that album than you guys would understand this guy that did the show he wouldn&#39;t understand growing up back in the seventies and eighties I knew Corey Haim... His mom and my mom were best friends in Elgin Oregon I went to school with Corey there in Elgin I understand that album very well I listen to it several times I actually enjoyed it for a reason there&#39;s a lot of history in that album.... Some people just don&#39;t get it....
Corey Feldman,<br>Proving that sobriety has serious consequences!
Your tank top  isn&#39;t complete without mustard stains &amp; bail conditions.
que album tan cochinada
este akbum es una cochinada
Was this album meant as a joke?
melon goes through all 5 stages of grief throughout this video
One thing you have to give this record, it is diverse as fck.
This whole album sounds as if Feldman listened to that one album crossover of Batman with purple rain in the 90s once then ran with it
Anthony is jealous that he isn&#39;t a bona-fide sex icon like Corey clearly is, moreso today than ever before
Spoiler: Feldman is, in fact, singing “about my niece”. I hope whatever she’s going through is as minor as “I throwed up on myself, and I cried” (to quote the 5-year-old niece of comedian Eric O’Shea)
I was watching Stand By Me with a friend, and when Corey Feldman was on screen I mentioned how he&#39;s a famous musician now. He went home and listened to this and told me he didn&#39;t want to be friends anymore.
Feldman’s producer: “Maybe we should do another take, for protection?”<br><br>Feldman: “What’s to protect? It was perfect! I have 90 minutes’ worth of songs to record. Don’t get goofy on me!”<br><br>Also, Fantano’s reaction to Corey Feldman’s work is similar to Mr. Feldman from Ed Wood, after he watches * Glen or Glenda? *
this doesn&#39;t get old
Sounds like he’s trying a Rob Zombie type of voice.
But did you see he&#39;s about to release a new boxset ???
At least 70% of those instruments are garageband loops
You know how dads mispronounce Pokémon as pokiemans? This is like if your dad mispronounced the entire concept of modern music.
I choose to believe the angels are using a flaming hole in the ground to bisect Corey Feldman
This album sounds more like a south park parody than a south park parody
I just barely realized after all these years that this album is so bad Melon didn’t even put the red flannel on. Just his wife beater.
i like it makes me feel like im watching a dollar store 90s cartoon featuring bubsy
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=562">9:22</a> it&#39;s like bootleg party rock anthem
This was on when i was sleeping and i woke up to this music Shi had me mortified
Why I’m recommended this specific video for the past 3 months lol no do not want to watch again
You guys remember how in tropic thunder they had the simple jack moie and everyone hated it except for the small drug trafficking village? I feel like somewhere it&#39;s the same situation with this album
The should have been the soundtrack to the movie &quot;The Room&quot;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1590">26:30</a> looks clearly like a Slipknot or KoRn based part
featuring Fred Durst in this album cannot be unintended, this has to be purposely the worse album of all time
I hate to say it, but I kinda grooved along with Ascension Millennium.<br><br>the only one.
This sounds like if an elementary school music teacher made an album.
Hahahahahahahaahaa.
All the comments on here are comedy gold! Sincerely lifted my mood. Tears induced laughter. 😂 😂 😂
Anthony, this is an absurdist pop masterpiece, what are you talking about?
From what I could see, Corey was the only producer on the album. That explains everything.
fun fact: as of april 2022 death grips,  the microphones, daughters, the shaggs and swans are at the &quot;fans also listen to&quot;
So, I just watched this entire video twice in a row because I’m having a mental breakdown and somehow this is a coping strategy?
I come back to this because watching melon in complete utter distress gives me a hearty laugh
Tfw you make ad revenue off of a YouTuber shitting on your album
Corey Feldman is the official level below Weezer
This is the first time in my life that I’ve gotten chills in a bad and uncomfortable way from music 😩
BOX O TURDS!
Here for my annual re-watch.
The fart I just let out smells better than this album sounds. And it&#39;s a proper stinker.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1420">23:40</a> MY DTOMACH HURTS FROM LAUGHING
Anthony looks like his going through a mid-life crissis<br><br>And i love it
The courage this man had to sit through this album is truly remarkable.
How is this channel allowed to use other people&#39;s music, but I can&#39;t play my OWN without triggering YouTube?!?!
You can pinpoint the exact point that he began to run out of money.
I’m eating an entire head of lettuce
You know you&#39;re in deep shit when melon&#39;s not wearing a flannel.
This album sounds like a gang of roving musicians beat down the doors to Bowie trying to record and taking over and injecting their own styles are absolute random
These all sound like a bad rip off of Funkytown.
I knew Cory Feldman had a problem with the career on the downside but holy shit. I can&#39;t believe I never got to see him promoting this. I didn&#39;t know about this garbage until 2022 but if this wasn&#39;t his wake-up call then nothing will. If he&#39;s still kidding himself then I predict he&#39;ll fake his  kidnapping or take it all the way and fake his own death. He&#39;s so warped that it&#39;s probably on his list of possible future projects. I&#39;ve got to see if anyone who worked on this album allowed their name in the credits. I would have sued to get mine out. What is the world record for saying holy shit in 1 hour ? Anyone associated with Cory Feldman is of course excluded for obvious reasons. HOLY SHIT!
This album is camp
fantano is going insane
he doesnt have a rating
The original NFT music
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=883">14:43</a>
Sometimes, when life is hard and brutal, I come back to this video so that Anthony can suffer with me, and it makes me feel a little better about my situation
This album makes Blood on the Dancefloor sound like Nirvana
Saying the album is better than Kendrick Lamar&#39;s discography isn&#39;t a review Anthony.
The best review ever...on the worst album ever.
i always thought the phrase &quot;made my ears bleed&quot; was a ridiculous exaggeration, but goddamn am i in pain
Thanks for bringing this full circle for me. I was once in Destin, FL at a bowling alley that had a crappy little bar in it that was advertising Corey Feldman performing. At the time I had no idea what that meant, or why he’d be in the crappy bowling alley bar, but now I do.
He went on steve-o’s podcast not long ago and acted like it was one of the most successful, artistic albums to come out in decades
Hm. Now, as well-deserved as this roast might be and as entertaining as your content usually is, I feel like I have to jump in here and wave my index finger around a little: There really is something wrong about publicly mocking somebody‘s obvious bad sense of taste while, truthfully, sitting around showing more skin than clothes… when you’re not Salma Hayek. <br>So while your appearance may still not be as eye cancer inducing as Corey’s album sleeve, you‘re certainly pushing it here. No offense.✌🏼
The Beyonce feature on this album is really something
i only wish there were tags along the progress bar of the songs so i can listen along properly haha
I like to play this video as background noise every once in a while when trying to sleep
This will forever be the greatest video on this channel. I&#39;ve seen this video several times each year for the last 5 years and plan to watch it many more. It never fails to make me laugh out loud, so many quotable lines.
Guys, I gave this a legit listen today and listen, with the amount of money you have Corey, Mr. Feldman I&#39;m serious, not playing, Mr. Feldman reach out to me and allow me to executive produce your next album, let&#39;s take 6-8 months and lock in every day at the studio and watch what I do with you. Let me know.
watching in 2022 and wondering if Corey Feldman can start a feud with Cory Taylor.  &quot;I asked Taylor to make a sample for my record.  It was so terrible I couldnt use it.&quot;
I can&#39;t believe he didn&#39;t comment on the n-word line in Bad People, truly striking political commentary.
Dude, this is hilarious.
this album is the human equivalent of being forced to drink blended up piss cum and shit
i think the sound bit at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1590">26:30</a> is from the videogame Command and Conquer Generals
The Shaggs live on.
I know it’s a copyright issue, but I loved hearing the tracks alongside the commentary! This video is an all-timer 😂😂🙌🏻
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1278">21:18</a> best teeth in the game
5 years later and Kanye made unfinished, awful sounding albums, trendy.
Out of all the albums Fantano has reviewed, this is definitely one of them.
It’s obvious that some poor recording engineer or producer worked miracles to even get this thing to sound the way it did. Respect to them.
If you think this is bad, just wait till you hear slump ak
The only reason Corey  Feldman exists is for lil xan and lil mosey to be able to laugh along with the rest of us and think &quot;well at least I&#39;m not that guy&quot;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1271">21:11</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1996">33:16</a>
I&#39;m sure with a few producer tweaks here and there it would be fine.<br>In April 2018, Feldman was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award at the third annual Young Entertainer Awards.[38]
This is the room of albums. It’s so bad that it’s genius. Truly hilarious. It makes you wonder what the psyche of someone who would make this music is like. Corey is either the least self aware person ever to live or he’s a genius comedian. Those are the only two possibilities.
I’ve been feeling sick all day and wanted to be cheered up. I now feel more sick. I even had to call in sick to work. I’m not joking. The combination of this album and feeling slightly unwell has produced a new level of illness
0% guns<br>100% drugs<br>50% sex<br>100% autotune<br>0% talent
Why do I keep coming back to this?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1311">21:51</a> idk what it is but that shit has me dead, the way the instrument is just dying away lmao
Angelic 2 the Core is like, what if Jon Bon Jovi made an album but couldn&#39;t sing or compose
This album sounds like an intro to a children&#39;s TV show for some reason
Really sick of this bland boring channel popping up when I&#39;m listening to a dose of Buckley.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1271">21:11</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1996">33:16</a>
Corey Feldman invented 50 new genres over the course of that album
sometimes i like to come back to this video to see the most accurate representation of falling into absolute insanity and madness
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1065">17:45</a> he lost it
This album is a piece of postmodern art.
the only things in common with this album and all eyez on me are snoop dogg and that it&#39;s a double album.
Don&#39;t mind me, I&#39;m just here to meet my yearly quota of watching this review.
at least he is consistent lol
This album legit might be a 10 for me. It is so unbelievably horrible that I am in love with it. Every time I listen to this album I enjoy it thoroughly because of just how funny it is.<br><br>Edit June 15, 2024. I found out recently that this album was taken off streaming services, and I haven’t been right since. I need some prayers yall, I dont know if I can live without We Wanted Change…
the song at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1876">31:16</a> sounds like corey tried to rip off LFO
Somebody has to be famous and super corny unintentionally
<i>Grampa Skrillex</i> made me laugh so hard, I pulled an abdominal muscle. Damn you, Fantano!
This is what you hear when your boyfriend clenches his asscheeks? Sweet. Corey Feldman douche canoe Captain.
Hard to believe Corey Feldman isn’t just an urban legend
WeeeEeHeeHeeHee
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1624">27:04</a> the beginning kinda sound like a really bad Rammstein impression in English. What a bizzare album
I rewatch this review an unhealthy amount.
All this album missed was an appearance by Yoko Ono. That would have been something.
It&#39;s like Kidz Bop for insane adults.
I think of you take away the fact it&#39;s Corey Feldman and that it&#39;s a 50 year old man doing it, it wouldn&#39;t be as bad. If this was a young euro dude with a different image I think it would be taken in a lot differently
Ever hear the old adage &quot;Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery&quot;? Should just say you don&#39;t care for Michael Jackson&#39;s music and leave it at that.
I&#39;d like to hear YOUR recording with Snoop. Yeah, thought so, bud.
You miss the theme. The &quot;growling&quot; you mention is representational of a preacher on the podium. Get it yet? Heaven &amp; Hell. Get it? Not that difficult to understand the process and writing.
Jealous much?
HOW IS THIS REAL 🤣🤣🤣
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1038">17:18</a> Just a polite reminder that Fantano is standing
The harmonica at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=936">15:36</a> sounds like a bad recorder meme. WTF. Will say I have ironically listened to the whole thing and it may seem to be getting into 2 out of 10 on certain songs and then there is a beat switch or something that makes it plummet down back to 0.
I&#39;m gonna buy a copy, this dogshit will be worth a 4tune in a hundred years, my grandkids will benefit.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1312">21:52</a> What the fuck was that horn??? Sounds like an otamatone
Holy fuckin shit this album&#39;s vibe is like one of those wackadoodle, over-the-top satirical radios in old GTA games but worse in every aspect.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1091">18:11</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1877">31:17</a> Melon showing more vocal prowess in these two moments than Corey shows throughout the whole album.
Suicide’s funny eh?<br>I think it is- but I also think everything can be funny in the right context. You don’t so you should have a problem with that. Peace :)
Grandpa skrillex💀💀💀
Now I know my mission in life. I&#39;m going to get 5 Baggs of magical mushrooms and get this album and have it playing in my headphones 247 and I&#39;ll put on speaker when I shower and stuff and just keep dumping pot and acid and druggs which I don&#39;t touch just so I can be close to Corey a d his genius. I believe he is the most misunderstood and most important person in the music world since Kurt Cobain. This guy is so far ahead of the pack it takes a bottle of Xanax to really feel the groove, but in that zone all I see is Corey this Faustian pedophile in a child&#39;s body. This shit is dark and to egdy for 99.99 % of human beings but I understand his pure sadistic creepy genius. I alone am the single greatest price of shit and the greatest fan of this gods music. Praise Allah that we have this god for maybe 2 more years before he asssends into the heavens.
50 min of your life man... One of his videos should have said it all...
yt served this to me in 2022 and you know what? in retrospect, it seems far worse than it did in 2016
If Angelic 2 The Core is so good why isn&#39; t there an Angelic 2 The Core 2? Checkmate atheists
I will never be the same again thanks a lot man
What does Anthony mean when he says A2TC is his MBDTF? 🙄
This is a view into a insane person&#39;s mind... it can make the listener go insane also
This is like listening to tween wave from southpark.
We finally got to see it. He cracked. Corey Feldman is a god. He’s the only one to bring this nerd to the brink of insanity and I thank him everyday for it.
This video is the 5 stages of grief in real fucking time
This album sounds like Helen Keller doing a DJ set …..
Up and coming bands take notes
he stalls for 6 minutes because it’s that bad
Michael Jackson has never made an album this good
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2040">34:00</a> Had me wondering if somehow got a paul mccartney feature
This review is cringier than the album tho. How do you enjoy, say deep cut Prince albums if this is how you dance to this? <br>Are any Micheal Jackson albums actually this entertaining and diverse?
You wasting your time Anthony....
Congrats to you for listening to the entire album.<br>I couldn&#39;t make it past the first song, cause my ears start to bleed like the Niagara Falls.
After a few years of thinking about this album, I&#39;m convinced that Corey Feldman stumbled here through the multiverse where he is actually Michael Jackson in a mediocre world. I can prove this because if you look at the album cover, that is clearly Dr. Strange&#39;s magic portal he is climbing through.
I took DMT to this album 🙏 which made me realize that Corey is a musical genius 🙏 this album is a masterpiece
Some of these songs are literally painful to listen to.
This is Fantano&#39;s magnum opus. I always come back to this video.
If you gave the average person with no musical background a studio, some rudimentary music lessons, and six months time, I guarantee they&#39;d come up with something much better than this album. This isn&#39;t simply a lack of talent, this is like negative talent
yo sounds like the synth lead he stole is chris brown lol i think it’s called turn up the music <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=558">9:18</a>
Me: It cant be that bad<br><br>50 minutes later: kill me please
Do Three Beat Slide next
if this was satire youd give it a 10
My mans laughs are more musical then then the album
This reminds me of The Shaggs. It&#39;s bad, but it has some kind of poisonous enjoyment.<br><br>You know, the good thing about uncomfortable music like experimental, harsh noise or free jazz is that you will get used to it at some point if you keep listening to it over and over. And you will start to appreciate the creative choices behind the unpleasant listening experience.<br><br>But this one strikes your forehead each time you listen to it. It never fails to make you feel sick. It is something like a gore movie that never gets washed out.<br><br>Like Anthony says in the video, this has &quot;accidental punk&quot; spirits in its essence. Maybe that was intentional but maybe it wasn&#39;t. Ether way, that is something super natural, something god powered, or maybe we can call &quot;angelic core&quot; within the music.
Top tier Melon vid
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1066">17:46</a> 🤣
Haha...this album makes me think, is money even worth it?
“I CAN’T SAY NO TO THE BEAT”
Corey should name the follow-up  <b>I N  A W E</b>  lmao
Melon, your shirt is on inside-out, <b>tsk tsk</b>
Corey is a GENIUS, you people just don&#39;t understand.
People like melon are the reason racism will never die. It&#39;ll be on it&#39;s death bed and he&#39;ll be there to revive it for a cheap laugh from other closet racists
That “beat now, street now” song sounds like the kind of “song” you would write when you’re a literal 7 year old
Lmfao it’s 4 am and I just woke up for water, remembered this video existed and here I am 15 minutes later spiralling into madness once again watching it
I love how [NOT GOOD] feels almost unnecessary in the context of this album
snoop dogg being on here is kind of legendary
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=537">8:57</a> sounds like LHUEGENY
&quot;I was hurtin&#39; thinkin&#39; about my knees&quot;<br><br>Corey Feldman predicted Injury Reserve, we just didn&#39;t have the vision to appreciate it
Lickity Splickity I believe is a play on words from a line from the movie 8 Mile. During Round 1 of the final battles, Eminem tells Lyckety-Splyt that &quot;He can&#39;t get wit me spittin this shit Wickedy Lickety shot Spicious spickety split Lickety.&quot;
why did he go OFF on everyone lmao

@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=445">7:25</a>: the exact moment Melon loses it
Probably one of the most influential artists of the last decade.
Corey Feldman is the embodiment of &quot;arrested development.&quot; There&#39;s just no other way to summarize him. Everything, from the fashion, to the musical stylings, to the lingo, to the persona, to the abysmal production of this album, to the delusion... it&#39;s evident Corey kept growing physically, but not mentally beyond the point at which all of this would have been mildly cool in the late 80&#39;s. It&#39;s as if the DNA responsible for self-realization is completely missing from him. If there&#39;s another way to describe it,, take your best shot.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=802">13:22</a> Was the worst moment for me personally.
The best part of this is watching Anthony disintegrate in real time. Its like watching a fast forward of joaquin phoenix‘ performancy in „Joker“
When you consider all the songs that Snoop Dogg has appeared on since his arrival to the music scene in &#39;92, it&#39;s honestly not impressive that he appeared on Fantano&#39;s worst album of the decade (this album) and the best album of the decade (Kendrick Lamar&#39;s T.P.A.B.)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1352">22:32</a> I like how the cal chuchesta voice almost comes out. Corey Feldman is a miracle worker
An Album so bad, Melon brought out his Thatistheplan getup to review it.
The sound on this album is like taking Just Push Play, Freakin&#39; A by Aerosmith, Save Tonight by Eagle-Eye Cherry and Better Off Alone by Alice Deejay, mixing them in a blender with the Sopranos theme song and some late 90s morbid Michael Jackson, and then saying, hey, what would make this even better? Savage Garden.
2022 and this video is the best video of this channel
My favourite video on the internet.
Ok, so, I was ABOUT to think &quot;he&#39;s playing it from his computer speakers, it can&#39;t be THAT bad.&quot; Then I found out Corey released an album LAST YEAR. I listened to a TRAILER for one of the songs, and, I&#39;m shocked. I&#39;m SHOCKED. It was the kind of garbage, horribly-mixed, awfully sung, over-the-top garbage my friends and I would have made at 13 and really thought we&#39;d shake the world with. 0_0
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=836">13:56</a> is me testing all the keys on a korg
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=461">7:41</a> fantano breaks into full blown insanity
2022 and I needed to hear this again.
5 years later melon only wish for another <br>Installment of this
There&#39;s very few videos on YouTube that have been able to make me to laugh this hysterically. Definitely adding to my playlist of &#39;pick me up&#39; videos.😹
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1273">21:13</a> ok, maybe i&#39;ve fallen too far down the experimental rabbit hole, but i kinda like the messy horns here. not in the epic way that Corey was probably going for, but in a &quot;Xiu Xiu - Knife Play&quot; kinda way. send help...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1497">24:57</a> - WANNA BREAK FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<br><br>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<br>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<br><br>WANNA BREAKFREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
I came here to cure my depression.
I’ve challenged myself several times to Listen to this album all the way through in 2021. I’ve failed every time. I’ve done it so many times that it was on my top 10 most listened to album on apple replay.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1959">32:39</a>
ok but i could get down to the 90&#39;s one if i was intoxicated enough
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=560">9:20</a> - LMFAO &quot;Party Rock Anthem&quot;
i never actually listened to this before, i just kinda took his word for it being the worst album ever and went about my day. after finally listening to it i truly wish i never did, i did not gain anything from putting myself through this absolute torture
chumbah da dundah
This is Outsider Art hipster glory. Feldman is the musical Prometheus. He brought us fire from Olympus.
no matter how bad this thing is in every front, BUT this is real. We really have to give it to corey that amount of ambition and passion he has on this. Thats just remarkable :D  Nobody does album this long without really meaning it :D ( I actually really liked in a weird way the song called Seamless featuring fred durst :D :D)  Maybe somebody more talented in future will understand coreys ideas and makes cover of this thing :D
this is one of my favorite videos of yours, so funny seeing your reaction to this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=645">10:45</a> im just going to watch this later
Making good music: Hard<br>Making mediocre music: Easy<br>Making bad music: Incredibly hard
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1883">31:23</a> didn&#39;t expect the reference to &quot;Stay&quot; by Lisa Loeb. Nice!
Every song is like an aggressive parody of a 2008 top 40 song
This is the greatest album ive ever heard
In a million years, people will say this album is ahead of its time. It’s just misunderstood and people weren’t ready for it.
Wow Anthony that really was the worst song you were right
Corey poured his heart and soul into this piece of shit ok.
I think that there could almost be possibly be something here if only Corey had done music from the get go and never became a child actor
Wow Anthony, you were right. That is the worst track on the album.
Spits out gum in first 20 seconds of video <br>Epic win<br>Tony fantany classic
This belongs in the first live action Scooby Doo movie
I&#39;m back here for my annual Christmas tradition of listening to this review.
Thank you melon this masterpiece cured my insomnia
As a man who grew up watching the goonies, stand by me and gremlins the burbs got me ready for the first ever horror film I was actually watching eith
Still funny
It&#39;s Time for the annual viewing of this video.  😇😇
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1870">31:10</a>. One of my top 10 fantano-moments.
Jesus christ i couldve sworn this dropped like a couple months ago
I can’t believe this was 5 years ago
The scat track was really that.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1369">22:49</a> Modest Mouse from hell
I laughed to the point of getting teary at this commentary. 😂😂
I&#39;ve yet to hear the album but I&#39;ve watched this at least 10 times over the years
PARTY ROCKING IN THE HOUSE TONIGHT :) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=565">9:25</a>
Still better than Revival
I never watched this previously and my abs hurt from belly laughing especially the fucking Louis Armstrong esque shitshow
Wait this album is supposed to be taken seriously??? I deadass thought it was like an ironic soundtrack to a porn parody. I&#39;m young this the only thing I know Corey Feldman from.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=262">4:22</a> Delusional to the core, you might say?
this is truly outsider art
Crackle Crackle
i really think it can&#39;t be highlighted enough how truly awful the song seamless ft. fred durst is. complete insanity on that track, terrible musicianship, awful mix, it has everything
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=847">14:07</a> vocal melody sounds like one of the ringtones from my nokia 6303
C&#39;est parce que tu es jaloux
Just deal with it guy, shave your head
What legit drives me crazy about this album is that any &quot;good&quot; part is either incredibly unoriginal and also proceeded by the most garish stuff I&#39;ve ever heard. Your only possible thoughts on this album is &quot;this bland and unoriginal but at least it&#39;s not literally destroying my ears&quot; or &quot;this is offensively garish and a crime against music and humanity&quot;. It never gives your brain any solace. It&#39;s either offensively bland or offensively bad
THE PAIN!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1916">31:56</a> Corey Feldman&#39;s totally a Sugar Ray fan
Who in their right mind would produce this 🤦🏼‍♀️
this is what youngboy fans hear when something other than youngboy is playing
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2167">36:07</a> is one of Fantano&#39;s best
I&#39;m back here watching this again. Life may be ever changing, but the Angelic 2 The Core review is eternal.
Thank you for this masterpiece.
Ya Got Me is anxiety in musical form
It’s like that thing of when you can’t quite put your finger on it cause you really don’t want to touch it but you do anyway and then regret it. That’s what it’s like…
Anthony laughing at Corey&#39;s failure is a balm for a weary soul. ❤
Snoops verse was just an open verse😂 how sad
There’s no way Fred was serious on this album. There’s no way he was being dead serious and not in on the joke of how shit the album is
this album sounds like my nightmares
The &quot;about my niece part broke me&quot;
Go for it slaps
I rewatch this every few months just for Melon’s range of facial expression.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=537">8:57</a> I can’t even understand what this dudes saying
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2460">41:00</a> &quot;I&#39;m being prematurely aged by this album, I feel like I&#39;m 55 now.&quot;<br>That got me so fucking good
You cannot unhear what has been heard
sounds like 2007 or 2009 music made by youtubers.
i love how you can hear the reluctant clicks on the trackpad everytime he has to press play again
Can you review his other albums? Former Child Actor 2002
wow i really thought he was saying &quot;about my needs&quot; in that mercy song, and you were just goofing, but i looked it up. yeah he says &quot;about my niece&quot;. why
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1090">18:10</a> Full on Joker laugh
This album kind of grew on me, like a rash.
I listened to it all, it was a brilliant listen.
I&#39;ve watched this like ten times, sometimes I get Feldman song snippets stuck in my head but they exclusively come from this video
Simplier Time
17 quintillion dollars, and I would still demand my name to be removed from the credits.
This is my comfort video. I watch this when things start to get bad. I need to up the dosage on my antidepressants so here I am again.
How did he rope Jon Carin in to this?
i listen to his music because its so weird
You know, that one song was pretty good.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Oh wait, I just have spotify free and it was a background to a car commercial.
I love the entertainment
Delusional 2 the Core
Its 2021 and youre starting to regret this video. Its really influental now and death grips still has 0 snoop features so mr feldman wins
i thought it was skrillex lmao
This is why we need to tax the rich more.
Never gets old
All of corey feldman&#39;s video content related to this album is absolute gold
Yo, are you gonna review &quot;Feeling Funky&quot;?
This album is like if a cartoon sound effect got struck by lightning and became an entire album.
Such an underrated album 2pac nirvana Kendrick Lamar Kanye West Metallica could never make something like this
The fact that is album is now widely considered by critics to be one of the worst albums ever made in human history along with classics like Elvis’s Greatest Shit and Philosophy of the World by The Shaggs (Ironically released in 1969 😭)
i love how snoop dogg is on both the best and the worst albums of the 2010’s on fantano’s list
Time for my weekly watch of this review. Feldman really did release this album so week could have this review.
I genuinely think this is intentionally bad
I don’t know, guys. It’s been five years. I think this album is starting to grow on me a bit.
The fact that this video is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=3053">50:53</a> minutes long is golden
wow i cant express how bad this record is lol
I&#39;m going through all your video to just dislike
Don&#39;t do Bones like that
lol
This is what happens when your rich and famous - you can surround you with people that just say ‘yes, you are right. You are always right’<br><br>It’s hard to find any other reason an album like this ever came out
I just noticed the first.. track.. kinda reminds me of Funkytown by Lipps inc, just without melody, and charisma lol
Grandpa skrillex had me dying
Fantano: were already this close to killing ourselves....<br>Feldman:...... DO WHAT YOU WANNA DO!!
When fantanos impression is better than the song somethings wrong
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1065">17:45</a> I have no clue why but watching Melon lose his sanity in this part... I just can&#39;t stop replaying it XD
Be honest no one heard this album front to back
This album has the aura of a cartoon character opening a completely stuffed closet and being buried in just trash
it&#39;s like being trapped in a drugless christian rave
Ese wn es angelical
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=150">2:30</a> <br>Wow melon, I know you’re upset, but that’s such a stretch and incredibly disrespectful, I can’t believe you would compare something as shit and terrifying as that torture to something like Chinese water torture
this album sounds exactly like it&#39;s cover
i am taking inspiration from this album, slowly. let&#39;s see if i become a pioneer or a complete nutcase
One of the albums ever
this is hyperpop for old people
At times unironically Ram Ranch is objectively better than some of these songs. The message, lyrics, and melody are better on a very graphic song about cowboys having gay sex than on this Album.
No matter where you pause this video, the face is funny
Happy fifth birthday to this beautiful review back on the 27th.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1203">20:03</a> man is literally SINGING over dubstep LMFAOOOOOO
this album sounded like skrillex (literally looks like him) aged by 20 years and tried to jump into pop back in 2012
Captain Beefheart would be proud
No I don’t like this cd but if he ask I love this cd I go to sleep to ascension millennium I brush my teeth to ascension millennium my mom loves ascension millennium but no. I don’t like the cd don’t ever ask me that again
mercy wasnt that bad
He&#39;s not being PULLED OUT by the angels. He&#39;s being stuffed in.
corey the hyperpop KING 😍👑
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1955">32:35</a>
I wouldn&#39;t buy this album, it isn&#39;t good, but worst of the decade? I&#39;ve heard way worse young rappers albums and I&#39;m a big fan of a lot of the new rap but some of it... idk if it&#39;s music lol.
We seriously need a new Corey Feldman album in these confusing times.
I love how the views and comments keep coming on this video. I return here every couple of weeks. It&#39;s my number one comfort video.<br>Thank you melon.
Seeing disasters of this magnitude make me wonder what it would take to improve them. First off, cut all the skits. Then remove like half the tracks. Take the tracks that remain and try to unfuck the mixes. Then take Corey&#39;s vocals and do whatever you can to fix them and when you can&#39;t just straight-up pull them out.
I don&#39;t know if it funnier if he filmed it at 3am or 3pm
You know, I come back and watch this video a few times a year, and I always believe I’ve heard it enough times to be prepared for what I’m about to hear, yet I am <b>always</b> incorrect in that assumption. This album is bafflingly bad. And I love it.
This album is so bad that not even the subtitles consider it music.
WAIT WTF YOURE SITTING DOWN??!
&quot;This is really sucking me...&quot; -Melon on his favorite album
Every one of these tracks sounds like the moment when you&#39;re listening to music, and a web page autoplays an ad video
I’ve never loved hearing someone hate something so much
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2290">38:10</a> Almost entertaining? This definitely is the highlight of my day. I’m crying laughing.
Have you ever seen that 1999-2000 bowling shirt with flames on the bottom and neck and black on the top? this whole album is the audio form of that shirt
Has anybody ever played the 1st or 2nd Grand Theft Auto games? where the songs on radio stations were like joke-generic and &quot;friendly&quot; sounding on purpose with profanity or very silly simple themes and off the wall shit? Every song on this album sounds like that lmao
This is what trout mask replica actually sounds like when you unscramble the sound
are you drunk at the start of this review ♥
If Andre 3000 had 0 talent<br><br><br>Andre 0 if you will
i feel like if Anthony ever encounters an 11/10 album it&#39;ll be in this format. just like utter dismay without description
what the actual fuck did i listen to................
LICKETY SPLICKETY
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1200">20:00</a> what the hell is this dubstep song. You can clearly tell he has no idea what he&#39;s doing because he&#39;s singing over the bass drop. Tbh I could see him being more of a background vocalist on a lonely island song but I can&#39;t see him being a very serious front line vocalist
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=557">9:17</a> I may be reaching a bit but that synth lead sounds vaguely similar to Kesha&#39;s we R who we R but processed to hell
100 Gecs to people with no taste:
Does anyone else think 4 bidden attraction was listenable.
This album is the musical equivalent what Tommy Wiseau&#39;s The Room is for the cinema
Who would dislike this review?, Am I&#39;m really seeing 915+ dislikes in this review?
This album sounds like if you ask an A.I. that has studied all music known to man to make the OPPOSITE of music.
After one and a fucking half hour listening to this plus the review recording time, what do you listen to in order to heal yourself???
What the?! Lisa Loeb eh?
That was ass
hes not white anthony &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Feldman&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1390">23:10</a> this is the musical equivalent to Jay Bauman’s “this is borderline experimental”
Whenever I&#39;m depressed I just watch this review to remind myself that I am not Corey Feldman. That realization is always uplifting.
that working class hero cover sounds like it was performed by the residents
The best thing that I’ve seen on here all week 🤣
this album makes nav look like a genius
Thinkin&#39; bout my niece...<br><br><br><br><br>BOUT MY NIECE <br>BOUT MY NIECE
Corey moved to the hood after dropping this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2564">42:44</a> the ONE good thing said about this album 👁👄👁
Every year I come back here to listen to this review because just when I think my life is sh*t, this video makes me appreciate that things could be worse👍 Plus I die laughing every time 😂😂😂
he hates this album so much he didnt edit the video. thats pain
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1736">28:56</a> anthy fanto drain
i liked the part where the album ended
Yooo the orchestral Movements in the Dark record, I have show so many people them and that record, I wonder if albums like that have any place in modern times, if so I should be doing great right now 🤣
Feeling a strong to light zero on this one, tran-
Cool cats says this is truly, a masterpiece
Cool cats says this is truly, a masterpiece
PLEASE STOP AUTOPLAYING THIS VIDEO
That album cover should remain anonymous imo
Is this somehow the musical version of The Producers? Are we all getting scammed?
This is the worst thing I’ve heard a thousand times
I just know he was up at 3am recording this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2175">36:15</a> &quot;I wish I had a hammer here cus I would keep tempo by hitting it against my skull&quot; by far the most underrated comment hahahahaga
Honestly this album is a 10 for enjoyablity for me. It&#39;s like it&#39;s so bad that  it looped from being a 0,  back to a 10 because of how hard he tried and failed. It&#39;s like watching someone drunk try and do grade 2 math and fail miserably.
for some reason i watch this once every few months
An absolute classic review. This is one for the ages, a review all future NOT GOOD&#39;s are compared to. The influence is everywhere and you can feel how it changed Anthony&#39;s reviews themselfs and how they are viewed by fans going forward. A true masterpiece. The production, the words coming from the heart, the editing and even the teeth are at their best here. It&#39;s beautiful exploration of the dark depths Melon has to go through for his reviews making him question reality itself. <br><br>I&#39;m feeling a light to decent 6
You know, I knew this album was bad cause Anthony talked about it in some other videos but I never got around to actually watching the review and tonight I was like “you know what, it’s probably bad but not that bad” but oh boy… nothing and I mean NOTHING could have prepared me for this garbage.
A great example of just because you can doesn’t mean you should.
“Yo pass me the aux”<br>“you better not play trash”<br>“i got ya homie”
&quot;Corey, I really don&#39;t know which of these vocal takes we can use&quot;<br>&quot;Um...  all of them at once maybe?&quot;
Anthony I just come here to say that this video right here might just be your masterpiece, everytime I want to have something playing in the background, I put this on, I think I have already seen this video 100 times lol.
I need an updated review of this album lmfaoo
NOOOO.... SNOOP!!!
Satan has a new dance beat....lmao!!!
This might be the best review ever conceived
We want Michael Jackson<br><br>We got Michael Jackson at home<br><br>Meanwhile at home…
This album turned melon into the joker
I actually cried laughing at that Snoop Dogg verse. I was literally crying my eyes out. That was the funniest thing I&#39;ve heard, I think ever.
Every time I hear Corey Feldman&#39;s voice I can&#39;t help but think of him voicing Donatello in the TMNT movies.  If you see it as Donatello making his musician  debut that probably adds another funny layer on top of this train wreck.
Watching my yearly viewing of this review
this album induces the feeling within me that I think the Caretaker&#39;s &quot;Everywhere at the End of Time&quot; is supposed to
You think Corey&#39;s mom tells him that everybody is &#39;just jealous&#39; when they say his album is trash, or do you think even she told him this shit&#39;s wack too?<br><br>If she really loved him she would...
Wow! This album is bad!
This album sounds like someone tried to make real music by taking every stock loop in GarageBand mobile and play them all at the same time.
This album is like Grimes on meth
Feldman must’ve foreseen Fantano’s beautifully unhinged review of Angelic 2 the Core. Why else would “You Got Me” include the lyric, “I’m begging you, please. Just stop!”?
When Anthony said it made him want to stay away from 80s/90s stuff forever, it made me wonder if that was Corey&#39;s plan all along: Completely ruin nostalgia for everyone.
this song put em back in the head
His magnum opus
it is not that bad!
I really hope the worst album of the 2020s will be able to match this album&#39;s incredible, immaculate awfulness.
Back for my yearly rewatch of this one
I&#39;ve kinda grown to like it... it has a certain  charm
I like how the Fantano&#39;s ironic singing voice sounds actually better than the Feldman&#39;s in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1785">29:45</a>
It feels like corey did this the night before it was supposed to release
This album can be used as a torture mechanism
I don’t think fantano has released a longer review since this album. This is seriously legendary
What genre are we shooting for here Corey? <br><br>Yes.
Dude couldn&#39;t even put up the effort to get it on the green screen
If you want a laugh listen to the bonfire talk about Corey Feldman. it’s brilliant
I know that it will be a bad album when I see the album cover.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=832">13:52</a> sounds like a 100 gecs joke song
The whole concept reminds me of bat out of hell but inverted in terms of quality
On We Wanted Change he sounds like a white guy trying to sound like a white guy trying to sound like a black guy trying to sound like a white guy trying to sound like a black guy
Honestly I&#39;m starting to think this album might have been a social experiment all along
why is this one of my comfort youtube videos
This album is like music’s equivalent to Superman 64.
One of the albums of the last decade for sure.
..I think this album might have been paid for and sponsored by the US military for phycological warfare but someone accidentally released it to the public.. be careful listening to it..
I’ve rewatched this review more than I’ve relistened to most albums lmao
This album is a masterpiece - I really enjoy the delusional wackiness of each piece. There&#39;s music that simply sucks. You listen to it once and you don&#39;t care about it afterward. But then there is &quot;Angelic 2 The Core&quot; which stays in your mind forever. The songs are catchy but really suck hard at the same time. The ideas are all over the place and are combined in such an unusual and non-fitting unique way that I sometimes think Corey is some kind of evil genius who&#39;s simply just fooling everyone. The singing is awfully off-key. I don&#39;t know why I enjoy this. But I do.
Lmao comparing this piece of shit to Post Malone kind of delegitimizes the entire review
Still melons best video. I come back every few months to see him head bobbing to ascension millinium.
Wow this dmc5 album is kind of fire I don&#39;t know what fantano was talking about
You don&#39;t have good enough headphones to enjoy this album
All I want for the next Cory Feldman album is for Fantano to just turn on the camera and press play.
I think i may need a therapist after listening to the album and catching myself headbanging a few times
Still one of the greatest reviews ever.
It’s fun returning to this and seeing how Melon has now warmed up to it and thinks of it fondly as bad
This is S tier
This is my favorite album ever, pure genius 11/10
It’s literally impossible to produce an album this bad so realistically it’s a 10/10 album
This is like if the patient from everywhere at the end of time made an album
this is like if outsider music had no redeeming qualities whatsoever
The black tank top theory more or less holding strong
Yo these comments are so funny
I live i laugh and i love, this is camp
I love
Please somebody, what the hell is that catchy synth in the second song ripped off from? I keep thinking of Chris Brown&#39;s Yeah ×3 but that&#39;s not it
Anthony sounds like a traumatized sub telling the soon to be angry homeroom teacher how the class behaved
The The Room of music
This album is so bad that a parody of it would be better
When I’m down I come back to this video, it’s so surreal I forget about my problems
Sure there are a lot of great, classic albums, but this goes beyond those wow
This is literally the first time I ever hoped there would be constant ads when the songs started to play..
This was the start of Anthony’s joker arc
That album cover gets better and better the longer I look at it
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=852">14:12</a>
4 years later its still bad.. his mj impression sounds like a korn impression lol
“Popular Youtube music critic Anthony Fantano (internet’s busiest music nerd)’s 50 minute descent into madness”
Wouldn&#39;t you have to bring the moon up to the stars??? 😂😂😂
This video is the best way to consume this album.
I wonder which he hates more, this album or that new Tones and I lmao
This album is so bad it comes back around and fucks unironically.
That “jazz” track made me scream laugh
He (Feldman) if you notice with both his style of dress and music...he tries to channel Michael Jackson too much.
Corey is living in 3021
This is what death grips sounds like to people who don’t listen to death grips
I feel like this album is genius in a haphazard way because it can’t be digested by a sane person. Luckily enough,this album MAKES YOU insane so good job Corey
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2230">37:10</a> Quite bold, writing a song actively encouraging to ignore the worlds problems. Definitely an unusual take for a &quot;change the world&quot; anthem.
Is... is this Melon&#39;s longest video?
happy birthday the the angel himself, Corey Feldman!!!!!
He&#39;s losing his mind...and I&#39;m reaping all the benefits.
You look like a marshmallow wearing a wife beater.
Why is part of the guitar riff in Negativity sound like it&#39;s a 32nd note off?
Unfortunately Corey Feldman does have demons. He was abused by film producers as a child as well as his friend and colleague Corey Haim who had a severe drug addiction because of the abuse. It&#39;s really sad so in a way I can not judge him
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2569">42:49</a> those four seconds were the peak of this entire dumpster fire. That being said, this is the greatest shitpost of all time, whether Corey intends it to be or not.
Time once again for my yearly viewing of this masterpiece

This is just proof that pretty much anyone can make music. The tough part is actually writing good music, which is something very few people can do.
Let&#39;s just take extra step and see if it happens
I love how the two albums in the background are Ought&#39;s Sun Coming Down and Orchestra Manoeuvures In The Dark&#39;s Architecture And Morality... almost as if to say that this album&#39;s existence is a sign that the world is fucked, but we can still get down and funky if we want to, at least.
WAIT, THIS WAS RELEASED IN 2016!? I THOUGHT IT WAS RELEASED IN LIKE 2003. JESUS, THAT GRAPHIC DESIGN!
is this hyperpop
coreys album &gt; fantano’s tats &amp; wifebeater
melon walks the point for our sins all hail melon
The shaggs being one of Corey feldman’s “artists you might also like” is probably the sickest roast I’ve ever seen.
i fux wit the vision
I&#39;ve watched this video like 100 times
Michael JOKEson
This is like the record Jeremiah Sand plays in Mandy.
It&#39;s like MJ fucked Jonathan Davis.
I think he&#39;s more impressed with how bad this is than he is with how great TPAB is.
After listening to Spermswamp&#39;s album &quot;If Abortion is a Murder, Then Masturbation is a Genocide.&quot; This album is a masterpiece.
Who disliked this video? Who would like this music enough they would dislike the video? Like I&#39;m so confused. Did ANYONE really like this album?
Always watch this video when I&#39;m feeling down. Never fails to make me smile. 😂
this might actually be my favourite video of yours honestly
It’s so so bad but it’s a good bad 😂
Please do RAED next!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1970">32:50</a> Dude was going for Tom Waits and got Tom “Wait hold on a minute…”
Watching Fantano review this album is like watching Zero Punctuation review Ride to Hell retribution.
you have no clue how much I love go 4 it. its so bad. so so bad
hello antnee long time fan here, my brother just called u &quot;anthony fattano&quot; WOWWWWWWWWWW. I am very sorry but know i beat him up i love u atknee byebye
sounds like a beastie boys sample
Melon&#39;s impersonation of Corey Feldman every once in a while is the only thing keeping me sane on this journey of hell
the pop song he ripped off of is what they play in the laser tag arena
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=260">4:20</a> ...to the core?
this album killed my family please help melon.
This video is a fucking journey!
I always thought this album came out circa 2004 based on its album cover.  Shocked It came out in 2016!!
Visual manifestations of spiritual atrophy: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=460">7:40</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=542">9:02</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=663">11:03</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=752">12:32</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=883">14:43</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1043">17:23</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1083">18:03</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1355">22:35</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1991">33:11</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2152">35:52</a>
I don’t know why everyone hated this album so much, it’s amazing! I’m deaf by the way!
Gonna tell my kids this was 1000 gecs, wait, is this 1000 gecs?
I really feel bad that Anthony had to listen through this album. I heard snippets of this album and just cringed. Corey just couldn&#39;t leave the 80&#39;s alone had to bring the booze and coke with him
It&#39;s like the beat cancels itself out.
This isn&#39;t a review. This is performance art.
Fantano looked genuinely fazed at the start.
The slow chair spin followed by &quot;shouldn&#39;t someone go to jail?&quot; still gets me even on 10th viewing
Me after gettin thru each track:<br><br>“YOU CROSSED THE LIIINE YOU CROSSED THE LIIIINEE”
Corey Feldman has made a brand new genre of music with this album: Anti-soul
You’re hilarious man! Great video, love it. 😁
This is such a good review that it did not feel like an almost 1-hour vid
Strictly speaking, Go 4 It has a catchy hook. It’s been stuck in my head more than once. Dark times.
this shit really 50 minutes wtf
literally so bad it’s good
I’ve watched this video over 6 times and counting. This is the funniest shit ever and I appreciate Anthony’s honesty about it.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1970">32:50</a> this music man i swear i have never laught so much in my entire life it feel like imn gona die aomeone gelpo me pelase i cant stip laughting i gon die pelase helpi me
Say what you will, Antknee. This album may be awful, but at least it isn&#39;t boring
Corey Feldman in a Dhar Man video would make sense after this.
The Fred Durst track sounds like Modest Mouse on crack
It sounds like the entire album was sampled from GarageBand
Wow, I didn’t know Fantano was a satanist.
Midlife crisis the album
Every song Corey Feldman has ever created is the worst song ever created.
This review would be cyberbullying if it wasn&#39;t 100% accurate.
The second song I thought was playing backwards
&quot;Delusional 2 The Core&quot;
One of my favorite reviews of all time. Angelic 2 the core: forever 🧡
Haha 😄

“One of the worst forms of torture- up there with Chinese-“ I thought you were gonna say Democracy and said it’s worse!
Still Anthony&#39;s best video
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1595">26:35</a> infuriates me to no end because every other guitar riff is off by like a half second and it keeps throwing me off
You know it’s gonna be bad when he’s wearing a tank top instead of red flannel
he cant be serious
If Corey Feldman has children, I feel embarrassed for them <i>because of this album.</i>
I fall asleep to this every night
His hair looks like it&#39;s at different stages of balding throughout his head
There’s like zero criticisms said by Anthony because the music just speaks for itself
I love coming back here for a good laugh xD
i think the synth lead at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=556">9:16</a> is from yeah yeah yeah by chris brown, at least that&#39;s what it sounds like to me
Great tattoo!!!!!.....It reminds me of the foxtrot  album cover
CLEAN? SOBER? BACK ON TELEVISION??? THINGS ARE LOOKING UP FOR THE FELDMEISTER!!!!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Plz save us FatOne.
Dr.Dre, Kanye West and Jesus himself could not make Feldman sound good.
Melon. I was pissing myself the whole way through this. Thankyou.
This album is amazing
Worst music ever , im a fan of the shit show that is sir feldog . Crackle crackle
Love how Fantano normally avoids playing music because of copyright strikes, but when it&#39;s Corey Feldman or Nav he just can&#39;t resist
thanks for raising awareness of autism, Anthony
You shouldn&#39;t have done that, he&#39;s just a boy
&quot;Every single person who&#39;s listened to this album and consequently professes their disgust are just haterz. U just jealous of my transcendent talent&quot; : Corey Feldman..
I don&#39;t mind it but I&#39;ve herd worse like ye it could have been better but all albums do have there pros and cons so
Every track sounds like a semi-final entry for the Eurovision contest
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=558">9:18</a> Party Rock Anthem
this sounds like something Charlie would make in Always Sunny
you can really hear the Swans influence on this thing.
5 years later I still refuse to believe this album isn’t a joke.
Angelic 2 the Core sounds like you are accidentally playing two (or more) music videos/tracks on your PC simultaneously.
i experienced physical pain during the Kurupt feat
wait y’all not rocking with this?
I saw      COREY  FELDMAN      at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.<br><br>The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.<br><br>When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.
This genuinely sounds like something the guys from South Park would make as a joke. <br><br>Only Trey and Matt would do a better Michael Jackson impression.
just saving this timestamp for later. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1067">17:47</a>
What if this is what we chose as the worst album of the decade but then during the 2020s it becomes the next Pinkerton lmao
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2620">43:40</a> just a reminder for myself please ignore
crackle crackle
His vocals sound like what would happen if they resurrected Tom Petty and during the resurrection they fucked up his vocals.
GOAT.
This album sounds like a can of Monster Energy that&#39;s been left open for a weekend
This is the only music review ive ever watched more times than i can count. 5 years later, here i am again.
Man deadass uploaded the video about the worst record of the year three months before New years
how is this always such a fun watch
that synth riff sounded a bit like yeah 3x by chris brown but calling supersaw triads a ripoff is a bit of a stretch
What in the actual fuck is happening lol
That album cover makes me think he collaborated with Neil Breen.
Somehow got sucked into the Corey Feldman Blackhole. This album review saved me from the icy grip of the Void. Weekly viewing, immediately after CF&#39;s GMA performance is my self care moment.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1588">26:28</a>...<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>&quot;ayo,</b> <b>why&#39;s</b> <b>the</b> <b>boss</b> <b>music</b> <b>playin&#39;</b> <b>my</b> <b>guy?&quot;</b>
This album feels like having extremely high fever or being on a utterly bad trip
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1996">33:16</a> wow bro, they really recorded this dude having a heart attack in the booth
Negativity almost sounds like a really bad Mr. BUngle song. Im getting big clown / jester energy from this whole album. like clip art Jester energy.
imagine you&#39;re in your car with your homie and he says: &quot;yo man put on some corey feldman&quot;.. that&#39;s when you realize you have the best friend ever
I come here constantly when I am having a tough work day. <br><br>Thanks Fantano.
petition for corey feldman to create another album sampling this review
I’m trying to get through the whole album whilst working in college rn. It’s killing me but 5 songs left
This album is like when artists draw all the areas around the actual lines so at the end it makes sense, but with music. It’s like they put an inversion filter over the perfect album.
6 dislikes are from coreys alts, 20 dislikes are from people who like the album, the other 800 are people who just don’t like Fantano
Anyone else on their annual pilgrimage to this review
What&#39;s up with the youth ?, What&#39;s up with the youth ?
I&#39;ve come back for my biannual viewing of this video
The best laugh in this whole thing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2124">35:24</a>
It’s just the 21st century Philosophy Of The World
ContentID refused to listen to this album.
I wonder if there is an actual living human being that listens to this unironically.
The entire albums a South Park parody
You&#39;re listening to it wrong obviously! haha
You know an album’s bad when Fantano will take copyright strikes just to show the bath of cringe this thing is
This is the moment Anthony Fantano becomes Melon
This album reminds me of Andy from the Office making a song about the Iraq war told from the perspective of a schoolgirl.  Or Will Ferrell in Blades of Glory publishing his own poetry book called “let me put my poems in you.”  Just too terrible to be for real.
I think the best part about this album is that it has dubstep and dance elements, but this album came out it 2016, 6 years after the sound design was super outdated, listen to dubstep in 2016, then listen to Go for it, super outdated...
Dude... as soon as the video starts, I can see/feel your pain!!lol!🤣 trust me!!  I wonder why myself!?                                Oh yeah,Corey Feldman if you&#39;re reading this... listen up...   &quot;YOU ARE {NOT} A MUSICIAN!!!!!!!
This review seriously needs to be in the Library of Congress
still disappointed anthony didnt sit through mercy long enough to hear the switch up
He was gonna give Die Antwerd a Not Good?
I think this still holds as worst album ever produced and released.
Relief that the music claiming in this video had already been reversed.
This album is almost as bad as that tank top.
I still come back to this every few months, and it never fails to crack me up
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=704">11:44</a> hearing that laser sound made me commit lego step lickity splicky
this album is my 13th reason why
WAIT!....Wait....wait.............waittttttt!!!!! Are you seriously telling me that the Feldog’s album is not the club banger he promised??? Guess it’ll be another night alone with ma tears! 😭😭😭
anthony losing his mind compilation<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=461">7:41</a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1093">18:13</a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1351">22:31</a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=3042">50:42</a>
Still better than 100 Gecs.
It&#39;s like Feldman didn&#39;t realize that Spinal Tap was a spoof. The misogyny isn&#39;t even the worst feature of this insufferably bad album.
If death grips released this project, he would have given it an 8.
this sounds like what a bot would spit out if you fed it 100 random obscure albums of various extremely contrasting genres from anywhere between the 80’s and now
i think this album was made to be so bad that it would drive a man so insane that they think it is good
2021 still the worst album ever
This is the musical equivalent of Tommy Wiseau&#39;s The Room. Ironically, it&#39;s not even enjoyable ironically.
I thought Total Xanarchy was gonna be the worst album of the decade, then I found about this. total xanarchy sounds like TBAP compared to this.
If you got this record on vinyl you&#39;d likely keep thinking it was skipping or looping, but nope...that&#39;s just how the album sounds
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=824">13:44</a> come on GIMME A TASSSTE
Is it weird that it doesn&#39;t sound different than normal modern pop music to me?
I just remembered that synth lead is nicki minaj starship at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=559">9:19</a>
Tommy Wiseau’s “The Room” of music
Music’s answer to The Room
Not even eight minutes into the video and Melon already lost it
Thus was an extremely unique listening experience. Fantano made it appear funny in the video so u just listened to it for a laugh. After finishing I did want to laugh, but I also wanted to cry at the same time. It was like surviving a near death experience which was so mental you felt like laughing at the insanity of it. Corey should sell t shirts saying “I survived angelic 2 the core”. Cheers melon, I didn’t get out of bed for the next day
This is such a bad album that I can’t stop listening to it. Every time I do I find something new.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=946">15:46</a> A person should have to register to use a harmonica. The most annoying instrument when played properly is next level awful in the hands of a CFeldman. Dude turned it into a lethal weapon. <br><br>When he does that growl voice I think he is channeling his Frogg Brother character from LostBoys. Still no excuse.
I actually liked the mix. It&#39;s terribly written, but it sounds pretty good on my Sennheisers.<br>Edit: I wrote this comment after only listening to the first track, which, as you stated, may have been the &quot;best&quot; one on the album. I retract this statement regarding the rest of the album, lol.
The old man from coming to America listening to this album saying “that boys good”
I love how Anthony loses his shit and does a Joker laugh on literally the first track of this bile shit.
I can’t believe Corey Feldman invented Hyperpop
The comments in the tracks itself are gold and it is one of the reasons why the service shouldn&#39;t have not disable comments which is blatant and borderline censorship.
This Album is what I imagine Brian Griffins &quot;Faster than the speed of love&quot;, would sound like!
Trying to find a good part of this Album would last a whole One Piece story
I need somebody to make a 2021 ASMR version of this video
This album is my villain origin story.
Say that I have no taste, but I can genuinely jam out to Ya Got Me.
Anthony Fantano’s negative reaction to this album is my positive reaction to the latest charli XCX album, that album is so good I just go crazy like melon in this video
I’m sure he’s in a different reality and dimension in a different era.
FUBAR
Hope the Aliens don’t ever hear this as they will never visit us.
This is a treasure. Thank you Corey and Anthony.
Dude, you crack me up!! I put this video on,and let it play,as I started to clean up around here... doing  a few bong-hits too!! Ur making  me bust out laughing!! The Army or Marines should use this cd as a torture device,method,ect...ya know!?
&quot;Grandpa Skrillex&quot;! I can already tell that this review is going to be a banger. We should thank Feldman for bringing this review to us.
anthony is having a stroke at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1940">32:20</a>
You know it&#39;s gonna be a fire album review when fantano accidentally spits his gum out
This album is so bad that lil xan would turn down a feature on it.
I come back to this every once in a while
This album is like doing your talent show with a panic attack
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=640">10:40</a> pretty sure Melon goes through every emotion with this segue/skit
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1623">27:03</a> sounds like a beck song with Johnathan Davis on it
Check out , The truth ...The rape of one Corey &quot; by Reality Checker
Corey is seriously deluded...his music is truly awful...cringefest! 22 tracks??!! His ego is God-like.I suppose this is the result of being surrounded by &quot;Yes People&quot; since he was a small child.
nothing could have possibly prepared me for this album
FANTANO LACKS FINE TASTE. ANOTHER ONE TRYING TO SILENCE COREY!!! YOU CAN&#39;T STOP HIM
Listening to this album makes me completely forget what good music is supposed to sound like
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1350">22:30</a> The funniest moment of Anthony Fantano’s career
BOUT MY NIECE<br><br>BOUT MAAAHHH NIIEEECCEE
Ascension Millenium hits hard as fuck idc what you say
I like it
You tell us you can&#39;t prepare us, then you spend 10 minutes trying (I guess) to prepare us anyways, and then you play the fucking record to us through your fucking SPEAKERS?!?<br>How in the motherfucking unpronouncable name of Bob do you have 2 &amp; 1/3 million fucking subs?!?!?!?!<br>YT fucking baffles me.
I wonder what captain beefheart would think of this
Fun fact ; This album took Corey 10 years to get it done
It had a second spike in sales after it was noticed that the chimpanzees at the zoo would stop masturbating while it was played......It is now standard treatment as negative reinforcement for chronic masturbators as well as an antidote for viagra overdose. It is an immediate limpifier
This album is the turd that forms when you want to be famous but dont really care how.
It’s 2021 and I can’t stop watching this video. It’s habit forming
corey feldman paved the way for hyper-pop imo. Overblown beats. Corny lyrics. Corey is gonna be the soulja boy of hyper-pop
These are the ramblings of a Psychopath. Thank goodness he didn&#39;t cover &#39;Stand By Me&#39;
I was seriously going to listen to this cd...  I  decided to watch your video, and I&#39;ll tell ya, it was extremely painful!!! It&#39;s 2021 now, and he hasn&#39;t done anything stupid since... I don&#39;t think?
Can&#39;t believe this video is going to be 5 years old this year
Corey Feldman is the text book example at why we should not let people become child stars. This guy the album is simultaneously so cringey and at the same time I feel bad for him.
If you think about it... Michael Jackson, Marilyn Manson...   tries to have a gothic Manson vibe to it
Time for my yearly rewatch of this Magnum Opus of this channel
zappa would endorse this record
hope hes going to hop on the hyperpop hype train and get his 8
You watch in 30 years this will be impossible to find and people are gonna charge thousands of dollars for it
I feel so bad for Corey I feel like I’ve never seen someone want it as bad as him he’s just so desperately confused musically
Corey seems to have disconnected from reality a long time ago
He should have just stayed a child actor
What’s your best album of 2016?
so ppl actually did this? like, on Earth?
with the bad lyrics and the garage band loops it really reminds me of the album i made with my dad when i was 7.
This is a disasterpiece... &quot;Play it again Sam that Jazz really does swing!&quot;
It&#39;s basically popular to slate Gory Feldman. But I don&#39;t care I&#39;m not having it.. The lead track is good, thus it&#39;s not the worst album of the year
I rewatch this once every month
Corey&#39;s vocals on lickity splicity kinda remind me of Midlife Crisis
Yeah, it&#39;s bad alright.<br>Lulu is still more unlistenable than this to me, and it was done by way more competent musicians.
Anthony fantano: I do not want to hear cory Feldman tasting ANYTHING  in a sexual manner....<br><br>The ad after, Michael scott from the office: <b>SEEEEEEEEXX</b> <br><br>Me: <b>No</b>
my favorite part of this video was the mid-roll towards the end
i watch this everyday
i had it together until we wanted change but i started fucking crying
back for my daily viewing
The fact he goes in for 50 minutes
Just so you all know, after suffering through a few tracks of this album, I felt the need to cleanse my ears with some Marvin Gaye.
I really like the IDEA of this album. That has to count for something.
It&#39;s like he&#39;s trying to sound more like MIchael Jackson than MJ himself.
I wish I didn&#39;t understand English because of this.
Feldman&#39;s Paradox: It is impossible to make an album worse than Angelic 2 The Core. If one intends to create an album worse than Angelic 2 The Core, and they succeed, then they have fulfilled their goal, that is more than Corey Feldman did when creating angelic 2 The Core.
It is, basically,  the sound of money not being an issue, mixed with lack of self-awareness,  trauma and crack/meth.  Sad, yet fascinating.  🤔
Feed Durst features on the album. That should have been warning enough.
Loose the wife beater. Does nothing for you
I&#39;m watching a man&#39;s slow descent into madness.
It sounds great on 0 volume
The dude recorded this album for 10 years and it turned into one of the worst albums of all time.
There are moments where the music isn’t terrible — then those gravel, noteless vocals come in.
This video is as good to me as Seinfeld or Saturday Night Live.
Laugh so hard at the melodies coming together terribly hahahahaha
More like Delusional 2 the Core amiright guys
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1085">18:05</a> This is the moment when Arthur Fleck truly embodied the persona of Joker
I just listened to the entirety of Angelic 2 The Core at work tonight because YOLO. It was tough at points, but I did it! Do I win a medal?
the corey feldman iceberg is insane. the music, corey haim, the hollywood allegations, assault allegations against him.... it&#39;s literally endless
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2139">35:39</a> Nah it&#39;s just Corey that ruins everything.
Is this why you wrote 1-800-273-8255?
You should review something by Lizzy Mercier Descloux.
I wouldn&#39;t need a dime, this is musical history right here😼
It’s like a rollercoaster that never stops going up
Whole album sounds like South Park parody music.
&quot;Chinese Water Torture&quot; I&#39;m literally fucking dead LOL
what&#39;s fucked up is that this is not even close to the worst thing that fred durst has ever done
u got a problem wit aut.. artistic expression
The origins of hyperpop here
back again for my yearly viewing of this masterpiece
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=577">9:37</a>
What’s sad is that in 2011 or 2012, Go For It could’ve been a hit
This is the funniest shit I’ve seen in a while
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1352">22:32</a> Fantano incorporates Cal Chuchesta here.
This album is like if Tommy Wiseau made Panty and Stocking.
Corey Feldman Jazz be like<br><b>wEeEeEe</b>
That fred durst song sounds like karaoke. Horrible almost accidentally post punk karaoke.
Trump should have used one of his pardons to absolve Cory Feldman of his crimes against music🙃
Rob Lowe said on JRE that whatever age a young actor becomes famous, thats thier maturity forever.<br><br>Corey was about 12 when he was in Gremlins or Friday the 13th
Whatever song is playing at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1888">31:28</a> has been sitting in Corey Feldman’s repertoire for many years now. I know this because the morning show at my local rock radio station in Philly would play that snippet back in the early/mid 2000s whenever they wanted to talk about how much Corey Feldman sucks.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=259">4:19</a> Delusional 2 The Core
If tommy wiseau decided to get into music industry instead of movie industry
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2361">39:21</a> If Masterjam had a double aneurysm.
This is the only Review I have seen from Fantano where he couldn’t just explain what the songs were like because he was completely speechless.  He had to show us for himself.  He had to play the music he couldn’t just describe it in words.
Snoop would turn up to the opening of an envelope as long as it involved a cheque.<br><br>Sad take, but this whole sorry mish mash seems like the pressure release for whatever Hollyweird shit this clearly affected fellow claims to have experienced.<br><br>&quot;Musical&quot; version of The Room maybe?<br><br>On the other hand, this could all be some apex level trolling on his part.<br><br>I&#39;m being diplomatic of course: I feel like going back in time to the 80s and slapping the kid me who thought he was even remotely cool.
Waiting for Angelic III The Core
Him stealing music ideas from Michael Jackson is stockholm syndrome at its finest
I&#39;ve never seen so many melon faces until today.
Its like he was trying to make The Room but a musical version.
This guy has a nice shaven face.
This shit bangs when you listen to it with your headphones off
Set it on fire!rp
Reading the comments on one of the actual songs is so cringy and mind blowing. So many addicts in recovery wanting to blow him... I&#39;m so proud of people for getting clean. But your musical taste doesn&#39;t have to leave w.d with your drug use...
Snoop Dogg really do just be doing shit
Maybe it&#39;s just proto-hyperpop
I heard like 3 songs and I&#39;d rather hear total xanarchy
Best album since My Teenage Dream Ended
Track 23. Empty Bottle
This video always lifts my mood
This album will serve him well once it goes on tiktok
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=258">4:18</a> missed opportunity to say &quot;Dellusional to the core&quot;<br>I hear it like that every time in my head
I’m so tired.
Disgusting, gum.
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1313">21:53</a> it legit sounds like the fucking sax is dying on the floor
2️⃣0️⃣2️⃣4️⃣ And still the worse album!
This whole album sounds like The Nutshack OST
This is my 4th time watching this video. Gut bursting laughs every time. Thanks for taking the hit for us
&quot;A little piece of Anthony Fantano died that day, and he hasn&#39;t been the same since.&quot;
If I were you, I&#39;d Tread lightly needledrop...<br>Crackle Crackle
Negativity is clearly a Korn rip off
The snoop dog verse sounds like it was recorded on an answering machine
I heard if you listen to it backward it actually plays coherent music
I watch this review every January and it never gets old!  😂
I would rather quote Future and say &quot;gushy gush so soaky&quot; out loud in the middle of sexual intercourse than play <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=805">13:25</a> before/during/after sex.
this album is probably a money laundering scheme of some sort.
everytime the Melon breaks down into laughter in this video, I do the same
I wouldn’t be payed to be on the song I would pay someone else to shoot me after hearing that garbage
Corey Feldman walked so Dorian Electra could run 😩😩😩 /j
If an album could get AIDS, this would be the album.
Foetus took a downfall in quality
It sounds better every time I hear it, it takes time but this is actually one of the best albums I’ve ever heard.
Man said lickety splicky
I CAN&#39;T SAY NO TO THE BEAT
I never noticed this before but does Melon have an upside down fade? <br>Number 6 on the sides and 2 on top and blend it in man.<br>Who asks for that?
Anthony sounds like a Broken Man throughout this entire video.
me: a reminder it&#39;s possible to do music wrong<br>guy in my server: technically if he made it and he liked it then it’s not really done wrong<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>the human race never ceases to amaze me
Few years late but I totally lost it at &quot;on the street now&quot;
this review is longer than most albums
I literally have watched this a handful of times. I come back to it every once in awhile when I need a good laugh xD
Absolutely love this review. Corey has brought out a new album, please will you review it 😁
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1444">24:04</a> is one of the funniest things I’ve ever heard 😂😂😂
Not gonna lie, the synths on lovin lies are kind of infectious
this entire album sounds like My World by Guns N Roses off Use Your Illusions II, but somehow much worse.
how did people not know he was sitting this whole time? y&#39;all really thought he stood here for 50 minutes?
Whole Lotta Corey
i come back and watch this once every few months when things get especially bad. because nothing in my life could possibly be as bad as Angelic 2 The Core. this is my comfort video.
It’s crazy to think that snoop dogg has futures on the best albums, and the worst albums
This album makes Tones and I seem listenable
This is my comfort video
Crackle crackle
I looked this album up on Google. Only 12% of users liked it 😂
Ah my monthly viewing of Melons Darkest Chapter
I watch this at least once every year.<br>This video has become my religion.
This album is #1 in Guantanamo Bay
idk man that harmonica in Bad People kinda slaps though
I&#39;ve listened to the whole thing, and in all honestly I find this album inspiring. If I&#39;m writing music and I start questioning whether it&#39;s good or not, it always sounds way better after listening to any song from &quot;Angelic 2 the Core&quot;.
Feldman’s vocals on “Lickety Splickety” sounds like Tom Waits trying to do a DMX impression.
To Pimp A Butterfrly review: 22 minutes<br>The Money Store review: 15 minures<br>Angelic 2 The Core: ALMOST 51 MINUTES!!!!
This is this century&#39;s trout mask replica
The song at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1900">31:40</a> is the one he butchered on The Two Coreys 😂
Still better than anything kingcobrajfs has &quot;released&quot;
There has GOT to be a &#39;Making of&#39; for this album. Behind the scenes, something. Donatello was not meant to be making......this.
Me the whole time:<br><b>Disgusted grooving</b>
Why is this 50 minutes long
It is terrible. No one is just being honest with him. This is not something he is good at period. In any aspect. Why are these others pandering him. On another note it is difficult to here over you laughing. Send it to N Korea a gift to their leader. Forget Corona we got Cory.
Melon u r actually so cute 😍
This record calmed my restless leg syndrome.
Stop reviewing shitty music and start reviewing good shit. Do calculating infinity or do nin do something fucking good!!!
this shit fire on mute
This album is a lot better when somebody has a gun to my head
4 years later I have come back for my annual viewing. Still fresh as ever......
Time for my bi-yearly viewing of this masterwork.
When Anthony said &quot;Elmo laugh&quot; I felt that
rip gum 🪦
is this... is this what music sounds like to Corey??  like do people hear music like this?
I watched. All 50 minutes. I can&#39;t tell if I should hate you for this, hate Corey Feldman for this, or just hate me for staying.
Not gonna lie Anthony’s laugh is actually quite adorable
If you actually listen to the entire album, it&#39;s even worse than you would think if you only saw this video 😂<br><b>WHAT&#39;S UP WITH THE YOUTH?</b>
Corey must have also liked Britney Spears，namely Me against the music, I&#39;m a slave 4 u and Toxic.
This album is aftually pretty good if you are deaf
I hate that I actually somewhat enjoy the chorus of mercy.  Though it seems super unoriginal. I am not well versed in the genre that that song is trying to imitate.
Being sincere with myself, if I would be any popular I can see myself doing the same stuff that Cory did there. You guys got away easy.
Except for the entire album, I think the album was pretty good
A friend of mine showed me this album long before I had any experience or taste in music, and I knew it was awful, but I didn&#39;t remember just how much fun I had laughing at it until I got to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2100">35:00</a> . Thank you, Fantano.
I thought “it can’t be that bad” and lauded this video and listened to the whole 90 mins and oh my fucking god it was painful. Worst album I’ve heard ever. I have a bit of a headache although it is 3:13 AM
I mean this album is so fucking terrible that Fantano decided that getting copyright strikes was worth being able to show us how truly terrible it is live.
It sounds like trout mask replica
In the second track I thought he was playing his vocals in reverse
How can a man in his forties be so pretentious and un-selfaware? <br>Oh right, drugs!
Friendly reminder that in the eyes of Ben Shapiro this constitutes as music but TPAB doesn&#39;t.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=883">14:43</a>. Thank me later
This one time melon, only this time, does shouting white racial slurs for 50 min qualify as a review.
Sorry, how much would “I” have to be paid to be on go 4 it? Dude I’d empty my savings account and pay them for that opportunity.
Sounds like some of worst europop/eurodance that is played at Eurovision.
If NAV ever wanted to feel better about his music, he should just listen to this.
Synth lead stolen from “JLS- She Makes Me Wanna” I think.
How Cory is looking straight into the camera on the album cover. It’s that much more off putting. Like when there’s a picture of a spider on your phone. You know it’s not real but your instincts move you to scroll away.
You know, people say a tortured childhood breeds great art. At last, we have a counter example.
I wonder if Anthony will find a worse album than this in the 21st century
The production on this album is on a completely different level
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1590">26:30</a> love that lesbian hip-hop beat, Yo Majesty lol
The only album that if you play it backward, it actually plays coherent music
Is it a 1988-tatooed-Rick-Schroeder critizing a 2016-mouth-to-eat-dry-cakes-Corey-Feldman for real or am I in the 139th episode The Twilight Zone ? Anyway, for sure, the 22-track album did push the boundaries of the hearable of my ears. Thanks for the burden, you have a new partisan from Liège, Belgium.
Damn he didn’t even bother to line the image on the green sheet lmao
I wish you would shut the fuck up and let us diside if the music sucks or not
I wish I was there to see the Feldmeister whipping up this heat in the stu
Imagine if one day, after the apocalypse has happened, this hits the Billboard Top 100
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=453">7:33</a> now thats a goddamn man right there
Homie: this mixtape is gonna get us out the hood!<br><br>The mixtape in question:
unironically gonna go listen to wesley willis to clean my ears
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1769">29:29</a> Damn Anthony I didnt know there was anime loli moans in the album too. Nevermind, this album is a 10/10.
Sometimes I think about how anthony listens to an album 7 times before reviewing it.
Uh, pop music?
If Death Grips released this you would have given it a 10.<br>We all know it.
Coming back to this, that working class hero is the worst thing I have ever heard, ever.
Idk if anyone commented this but does that not sound exactly like the melon saying &quot;you got me&quot; at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1710">28:30</a>
Baby blue eyes was not a bad track on the album
Listened to the whole album<br><br><br><br><br><br>ASCENSION MILLENNIUM
Now now, no need to be harsh on a blooming artist.<br><br>Think of it. Its clearly outsider art.
the melon lost his shit a long time ago
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=880">14:40</a> Nice one haha
This album sounds like my megaphone trying to play the siren
I can&#39;t wait for people in the future saying, &quot;...well this is my childhood! Why would you hate this???&quot;
Here 4 years later after hearing you reference this album regularly in other videos and can’t wait to take in 50 minutes of you hating this<br><br>Update: Watching you laugh for 15 seconds straight at one of these songs was the highlight of my night
A 50 minute review? What the fuck?
I don&#39;t even blame Corey for this album, because he&#39;s not well. I blame every single person who was paid heavily to enable him and not make him get help. <br><br>That said, this is the best/worst album listening party I&#39;ve ever been a part of. It&#39;s sonically horrific. It&#39;s like if Gollum was trying to sound like a glitchy soundbite of DMX while burning in the fires of Mt. Doom.
Fantano at the most femme he&#39;s ever been. I will not elaborate.
Still the funniest melon video ever. Praying for Cory though fr lol
This album sounds like Corey composed his own track list for a movie that doesn&#39;t even exist
Me: What do you think when you hear the name &quot;Corey Feldman?&quot;<br>My mom: Drug addicted child actor from the 80&#39;s. Why, what do you think when you hear the name &quot;Corey Feldman?&quot;<br><br>Me: THE BEST MUSICIAN EVER!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=668">11:08</a> A three part mission?<br><br>Part 1: Spread love, light and truth to all the people of the earth. <br>How do you spread light? That&#39;s very vague. Giving people electricity and lightbulbs? And do you have to do it to literally every person on Earth? <br><br>Part 2: Do it Lickety-Splicky.<br>this really isn&#39;t a second part period this is just saying to do the first part quickly but they have to spread those things to every single person on the planet. <br><br>Part 3: Go 4 It. <br>It&#39;s also isn&#39;t a separate part. This is just repeating to them that they need to do the mission. Unless this also vaguely means something else. <br>I am so confused.
This guy blows!
I can really tell where 100 gecs got their influence
I choose to ignore the suffering abroad<br>Doesn’t mean it’s not happening <br>It just means I turned it off<br><b>news report sounds</b>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=840">14:00</a> - I was thinking what is this melody... That&#39;s very close to (ironically enough) main riff from &quot;Venom - In League With Satan&quot; lol
God here, uhhh sorry, sorry about that one, i uhhh, i.......yep.
tfw when you could be taken more seriously as the voice of a ninja turtle
police should use this album for interrogation...make them listen to the songs till they break
I still can’t believe you sat through this whole album.
I have listened to this album inebriated and there is nothing mankind has made that is as confusing
all of the songs sound like cod zombies perk jingles
Bruh Angelic 2 The Core is just too experimental and high IQ for you.
this album gives me confidence to finish my three albums in progress
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1347">22:27</a> : Kind of a sick beat <br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1364">22:44</a> : CARTOON VOICES
That&#39;s how I imagine how it sounds inside the head of Charles Manson
This video is ART. Definitely better than the album
The gum falling out of fantanos mouth is underrated
This guy genuinely is losing his mind, this happens to so many actors, and i dont know what causes it.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1952">32:32</a> little synth lead button
I return to this video bi-monthly
Just listening to the clips in the video... the album sounds like it&#39;s trying to be intentionally campy... so either it&#39;s either waaaaaaay worse than you make it out to be, or it&#39;s ultimately mediocre at being a joke album.
I just had to comment that every time anthony put on the actual record my cat would start running around frantically meowing
Time for my monthly watch
This album isn’t even good if you listen to it with the volume down all the way. You still have to see the cover.
I accidentally watched the entire video not realizing it’s 50 minutes long. Thanks Anthony.
Sounds like 5 arcade machines starting up at the same time
I have to revisit this review every once in a while
Who was the target audience for this album? single, middle-aged women that have to sell sex toys to pay for their  short haircuts?
Want to see a man go aboslutely nuts? Lock Fantano in a room and play the song at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1996">33:16</a> for a few weeks at full volume
It is insane that a man who is actually tone deaf was allowed to make an album. I know he had to have bank rolled the whole project but someone could have or SHOULD HAVE stopped him. Either way this video deserves an annual viewing
The intro of break free sounds like a shity gorillaz song
Delusions of grandeur
I might unsub just because Anthony exposed me to this album
This album is what 100 gecs tries to sound like
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=460">7:40</a> is one Hell of a Joker audition. Would have gotten that gig for sure
This album was a little ahead of its time. It’s has 2020 all over it.
I love how he just progressively gets more giggly.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=537">8:57</a> this is honestly the most baffling part of the whole album
My ears aren&#39;t just being raped, they are being molested while everyone I love is watching
My favorite part is the impression after &quot;what is this vocal melody&quot; after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2355">39:15</a> . Come back to laugh at this over and over
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2687">44:47</a> sounds like an electric guitar plugged directly into the motherboard&#39;s built-in mic input
I&#39;m surprised you didn&#39;t mention &quot;B-B-B-BAD MOTHAFUCKA&quot;
Wow, Melon actually played the music.
Cocaine deserves a writing credit on this album
HAHHA THE WAY U PUT IT WRONG PURPOSELY ON THE GREEN SCREEN
Can’t wait for the sequel coming out soon
“What is this vocal melody? It’s not something you sit down and really conceive of, I guess”
The sad and yet concerning thing is, he is so humble and serious about it in his &#39;Coreyography&#39;. Like, he wants to make a career of it. Feel free to judge me for reading his book!
Is he trying to sound like a cracked out James Brown?? Because he does
I now want to hear The Weeknd cover Mercy by Corey Feldman
Skit means shit in Swedish...
It&#39;s like Prince &amp; MJ fucked the shit out of each other in hell and one of them shit out some weird deformed baby demonic spirit thing which flew up to the Earth, twitching, puking, dry-heaving and sharting and somehow, this horrendous being went into the body and soul and mind of a washed up child actor from the 80s and started pissing, shitting, puking, farting, burping, giving birth to other baby tongues......... Yeah.
Famicom Fountains - PROGMAN.EXE is worse....
Why does he keep acting like he is Michael Jackskn?
this video made me realise that melon sits on his knees on a spinny chair in his videos
Anthony Fantano, Corey Feldman, forever
The album is if clumsy smurf and gargamel had a collab
this is what plays on the radio on one of those bad GTA ripoff games
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1349">22:29</a> Anthony gets taken over by Cals spirit
&quot;Concerned uncle&quot; hahahaha, why is that still so fucking funny.
He should just give copies away free to use as a coffee coaster or Frisbee
this review is just 50 minutes of melon laughing insanely
I happen to find Feldman&#39;s music to be very inspiring.
I don’t remember the jokers backstory looking like this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=882">14:42</a> sums up the whole album
I find myself rewatching this at least once a month
Gotta give Corey props for edging out Doug and Lil Xan for worst of the decade. To make music worst than those two took years of not practicing and blindly walking into a recording studio. Give the man respect!
If you look in the background, you&#39;ll spot a vinyl sleeve with a stairwell on the front. This indicates that Anthony would rather throw himself down a flight of stairs than listen to this album ever again.
this &quot;album&quot; reminds me of the movie Boogie Nights when Dirk does his album..lol
That’s not an album, that’s a cry for help.
Concerned uncle I&#39;m actually dying 😂😂😂
mental_breakdown.mp4
i come back to this gem once a year, legit one of my favorite videos on the internet
angelic 2 the core<br>corey feldman<br><b>forever</b>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=819">13:39</a>- the genuine disdain and sadness is the most beautiful and real emotion I have ever seen 😂
I finally found something that Origins is better than.
I Feel Like Fantano Should Have 20 Millions Of Subs It&#39;s Good That He Has 2 Mill But Just Saying Both His Channels Should Have.
Why do you look like you&#39;re wearing a bra?
K-pop fans: this song is the best <br>the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=550">9:10</a>
random kid: I make fire beats<br>the fire beats:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=457">7:37</a>
I don’t know if I got this headache before or after listening to the album
What’s funny is the next video recommended to me is Anthony’s TPAB review. The contrast is amazing!!!😂😂😂
Spoiler: Feldman does claim the crown for the decade’s worst album! 🥳 Go, you working-class hero, you!
I will need to be paid $453,000,000
this album made Anthony go bald
It’s like Corey Feldman just did one take of everything and kept going without going back and listening😂
guys I&#39;m from 2020, this guy sounds like 100 gecs
An album so good it took me 4 years to hear a REVIEW without running away cringing. EDIT:  Aural laxative in the key of OFF.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1196">19:56</a> G O F O R I T
&quot;that white iverson song from a rapper who shall remain nameless&quot;<br><br>turned out well huh
a few of these songs are actually like almost some sort of post vaporwave.... i cant lie...if you look at it like that some of these tracks kinda slap
Man laughs at rape victim for an hour. [2016] [Colourised]
I wonder if Corey knows what’s up with youth?
this is the music version of The Room
So he did a list of the best album covers of all time but it was actually the worst so that proves when he says something is bad he actually means the opposite so this album is his best album of the decade, interesting.
The cover is a masterpiece.
Mid-Life Crisis: The Album
&#39;&#39;ABOW MAH NEES&quot;
Omg your facial expressions cracked me up.  So funny.  😂🤣
This album is now his favorite album. It got in his head, drive him insane, and now he listens on repeat while staring vacantly out the window at the birds on the sill. Corey Feldman sold his soul to Satan for this masterpiece
It will ascend the millennium as worst record. If Weird Al redid it, he’d have to play it straight, note for note
melon why are yyou looking itno my eyes like taht .. . ... .. . ... . .. .
bow my knees
This album is the musical equivalent of Tommy Wiseau’s “The Room”
Its like he ate some food, liked it, and threw it up for other people to try.
This is the bare minimum album
I hate the internet.   I miss people having personal dignity.  Okay I will gladly buy this man a shirt. How can I get that to him? It’s urgent
You can really tell he&#39;s sitting down. He&#39;s rotating lol, how did we not notice
I love this so much <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2124">35:24</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1440">24:00</a> easily the worst thing ive ever heard
imagine being at your job (if speakers r aloud) and some dude plays this EVERYDAY
Bruh, You know it&#39;s bad when melons Mock-singing is better that Grandpa Skrillex Jackson&#39;s actual singing.
Needlesdop gets tortured for 50 minutes.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=565">9:25</a> You’re thinking of that Cobra Starship song... and yeah it’s totally ripped off
i am responsible for every view
I like how he cuts before he can finish saying that Fred Durst has made music almost as bad as this album, as if he couldn&#39;t bring himself to be THAT mean, even to Fred Durst
Corey Feldman: Delusional 2 The Most Potent Most Disturbing Degree
the only good thing about this album is that it SLAPS on mute
The music videos are even better
Michael Jackson: <b>fucking breathes</b>                                  Corey: shit someone get me a pen and paper I gotta write that down
I still come back to this video from time to time. Its self care
I like touching your nose with my cursour
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=661">11:01</a> The riff in background is from a 70s porno with Ron Jeremy, the song itself is called ”Dick Dagger’s theme”. Amazing.
Corey Feldman is to music what Terry A. Davis is to programming.
Why does he cycle between 16 different genres...?
You know when people say, &quot;I nearly spit my drink out&quot;?? Well &quot;Grandpa Skrillex&quot; nearly ruined my monitor...holy fucking shit lmao
I feel hurt. I feel like Anothony should have apologized to us for making us hear such atrocity.
WHAT DO YA WANNA DO
“Shouldn’t someone go to jail?” - a though provoking question by the greatest philosopher of the 21st century <br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1046">17:26</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1310">21:50</a> was the point where the horns turned into a deathrattle through a kazoo.
I&#39;m so glad you did an entire reaction to the album!  You are so dope for that :D
I nearly died when I heard the sax at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1312">21:52</a>. Lmaoooooooooo
Here it is, the rare NOT GOOD that&#39;s <i>actually</i> worse than a 0/10. Jesus fucking Christ, this album is twenty trainwrecks all at once.
i thought &quot;chinese water torture&quot; was the name of another album lmfao<br><br>i swear listening to this album makes every other song sound like a godsend
Corey..yer fucked.
Perhaps if Snoop had been offered more money, he would have done the &quot;thinking about my niece&quot; background vocals as well.
This album actually has quite a lot of similarities to The New CALassic Mixtape by Cal Chuchesta, and that album was rated a STRAGN 10EN/10, so I think Anthony should give a better score to this one as well!
THE MELON IS LOSING HIS FLAVOR LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM.
This is terrifying to watch. Anthony losing it is making me uncomfortable. 10/10 would watch again.
it&#39;s like the sixth time that i&#39;m watching this thing and i lose it everytime corey sings that fucking niece line
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1980">33:00</a>
Nice shirt, Anthony. It&#39;s the Brown flannel.<br><br>The Chris Brown flannel.<br><br>Not because you&#39;re talking about a Chris Brown album.<br><br>Because it&#39;s a wife-beater.<br><br>That&#39;s the joke.
This video should&#39;ve been banned as a snuff film,  considering its 50 minutes of some poor soul being slowly  killed by second hand embarrassment.  But is definitely entertaining to watch!!
I know it&#39;s cliche but his voice sounds like a very angry cat beating the life out of a frail, sickly cat.
In a parallel universe, Corey Feldman wrote A Crow Looked At Me.
Did anybody notice the OMD record in the background? If Angelic 2 The Core hurts your soul, I recommend you listen to Architecture and Morality, a futuristic synthpop record from the start of the 80s.
Question: is TPAB more good than A2TC is bad? Which is more extreme?
This man neddle drop went through the 7 stages of grief on the one song with Fred Durst.
This is the best album in existence.
after all these years of watching melons reviews, my favorite will always be the one where he laughs over loud music for 50 minutes
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=461">7:41</a> Yep, This song broke him
Whenever I want to lift my mood, I watch this video.
I agree with your review of the album, I just don’t know why you had to go on a 36 minute rant on why you agree with the Turkish government and their stance of covering up the Armenian massacre, it doesn’t really add to the review imo
Random, but the I think the song around the 34 minute mark might be some Muppets theme tribute done in a terrible way. I was wondering was it reminded me of. I don’t know if someone has commented this already, or not.
Antony listened to the music and deadass said “somone should go to jail”
if he played the big day it could be better
Corey Feldman should be in prison.
Is he going for &quot;Lickity-Splitly&quot; to reference Tom Waits &quot;Old &#39;55&quot;? if so... Why?
I come back to this review every few months and it has literally never failed to bring me joy
How does this album sound both overproduced and underproduced at the same time?
My cat has grown increasingly hostile during this video. This horrible album is so bad, animals can even tell how bad it is.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1414">23:34</a> what’s the name of that song? Asking for a friend
Holy shit I just realized that Snoop Dogg is the only artist to appear on Anthony’s best and worst album of the decade.
This album sounds like someone with no musical talent tried to recreate Neil Cicieraga&#39;s Mouth Sounds Trilogy, except making most of the music from scratch
Damn Anthony, would you stop being a music snob already?
I&#39;ll give this a Light -0 to a Strong -1 on this record.<br>TRANSITION.
This album almost makes XXXTENTACION sound good. That&#39;s one hell of an accomplishment
Im sorry, Im confused ....what was the actual part of the double album that you hated....
The funkadelic side isn&#39;t so bad.  Honestly it doesn&#39;t sound too different from the trash Carly Rae Jepson and Miley have put out.  It&#39;s the rockadelic side that&#39;s exceptional.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=840">14:00</a> that Is a somewhat usable piece he has there. I like the piano chord progression with the synth but its marred by that lame ass intro and nonsensical rambling going on during the track.
Why am I watching this, AGAIN? Why do I hate myself this much?
Pains me to see Anthony suffer like this.
I’m not exaggerating when I say my friend from high schools shape of you dubstep remix he made in 3 hours is a hundred times better produced than this album that apparently took a decade to put together
God is dead and corey has killed him
Isn’t Corey Feldman dead? God if not why is he making music. He’s a nut job holding on to whatever but of fame he can...
Go 4 it
This dude voices Mickey when he laughs
Talking about shite - wtf is that on your arm ? Looks like you’ve got a skin disease. Sue your tattoo artist and have it taken off ( unless ur going for the diseased skin look ).
This is absolutely hilarious..........’Play it again Sam wow this Jazz certainly does swing’
These all just sound like god awful Phineas and Ferb songs
I understand you think it&#39;s great but I don&#39;t agree that it ascends a rating in terms of greatness when Black Star by David Bowie didn&#39;t.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1083">18:03</a> he is starting to become crazy
I lost it at the batman sfx
Snoop Dogg: &#39;Just Eat&#39; advert‼️ 🙄
Back for my bi monthly viewing experience. This review is like a 10/10 album to me. 50 minutes of bliss
Wasn&#39;t bad tbh, it was creative and engaging, bit corny
The corey feldman album review by anythony fantano stays ON during sex
What would&#39;ve prepared us for the journey we were about to embark on was if you jumped on the chance to say &quot;delusional.... 2 THE CORE.&quot; XD
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=432">7:12</a> : It&#39;s fucking Gold
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=762">12:42</a> I am JUST hearing his impression of Michael singing “This Time Around.” Also, don’t know if you mention later in the video, but his dancing is EXACTLY styled after Michael. And his hair, his outfits... I get inspiration, but this is verging on plagiarism- I say verging because it isn’t quite there, you know? Just... like if you want to be a tribute artist, DO THAT instead.
I like how he apologized for no edits cause he was ranting like it was a bad thing, like we need a cut everytime there maybe dead air
The beats legitimately sound like those ai-generated samples where a computer attempts to mimic real music.
Make an album without listening to it challenge
WHAT THE FUCK YOU&#39;RE TELLING ME ASCENSCION MILLENIUM IS ONE OF THE BEST TRACKS ON THIS??? I STOPPED THERE BECAUSE I COULDNT TAKE IT ANYMORE AND IT GETS WORSE???
I was having a bad day until I resaw this. Thank you fantano
Wow Anthony I understand that you loved the album alot, but 50 minutes for a review is a bit much!
We should throw this album to a massive dumpster fire to burn and see if it summons some cthulhu-esque being.
What&#39;s up with the youth?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1175">19:35</a> 100 grand plus life insurance forever and a car and a house also a dog and a free ear exam so I can see if I have a ear tumor from incredibly bad music
Any and every tiny, stolen element is immediately, brutally detroyed by the fifteen other elements that have been unleashed with the sole purpose of spilling blood. Ear blood.
I think the other ppl in the room did the best they could, which was to pile so much shit on top of everything that it all drowns out. I cant follow any one particular element. None of it even matches, not just in style, but even the fucking beats and rhythms are off.
Baha your shirt is on backwards. Correction, inside out.
Dont burp on cam or on a mic. You unprofessional asshole. And put on a real shirt.
You lost all credibility when you said &quot;it triggers me&quot;
Omg this is 50 min?
Silly melon if Death Grips released this it would have been a 10
You really built this up.  But honestly, it doesn&#39;t sound much worse than Katy Perry&#39;s usual stuff.  Just Katy Perry, but with an old guy growling.
This album broke melon in a way lil xan couldn’t even fathom
This is genuinely the most fun I&#39;ve had watching an Anthony review. I want to see him real time react to more truly awful albums. <br>LICKETY SPLICKETY.
&quot;This...this Corey Feldman atrocity of an album...its not good.&quot; <b>depressed explosion just barely scraping together enough power for a weak cough of a boom</b>
So I wasn&#39;t sure how bad this was going to be... I listened to 3 seconds and literally laughed so hard I thought I had just gazed upon Cthulu himself and was going mad! WTF
That man has some nice teeth
The songs are actually pretty good if you dont listen to them
I think the angels are actually putting Corey in to hell on the album cover
An album, that are full of bad MJ impressions, sounding like the 90&#39;s worst music, and some sounding like bad Pokémon songs.. <br><br>NICE.
I&#39;ve watched this whole thing like 30 times, by far my favorite melon video
Anyone else watched this video like a dozen times lol?
Don&#39;t mind me, just coming back for my monthly breakdown.
Thanks for putting ads on this video, because they give a short break from this awful music
This album sounds pretty good if you put your volume at 0% while playing it
I’ve actually never seen this video before today and I feel like this is a turning point in my life
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1340">22:20</a> is where the albums badness makes Cal manifest in Anthony. Also, holy fuck what a musical punchline.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=816">13:36</a>
the song that fantano says sounds like the weekend is a solid 3 on its own genuienly. the chorus is surprisingly ok. if someone with actual talent had this chorus i feel the total song itself would be decent.
I don&#39;t like too much Anthony here, yet I was interested in listening to this album.<br><br>Listened to 1 and 1/3 songs and had to quit because I couldn&#39;t get a grasp (playing hard Devil&#39;s Advocate).<br><br>When he said 22 songs, 90 minutes of this, it hit me hard.<br><br>I&#39;ve never felt so much the phrase &quot;I wouldn&#39;t wish it even to my worst enemy&quot;
I was watching this review in bed and when he started playing the songs, my cat ran away
All these years later and I still just can&#39;t believe this exists.
if jpegmafia released this it would be a 9/10
I would pay Corey Feldman to be on Go 4 It.
The only thing cringier than this album is you taking it seriously enough to pick apart track by track and your fake historical laughing while reviewing this train wreck. This is legal the same way your videos and reviews are allowed on the Internet.
Honestly I found MC Hammer’s Hyphy albums almost as painful.
This album hits diffrent on mute
That &quot;WEEEEEEEEeeeeeeEEEEEEEEeeeeeeEEEEEEEEeeeeeeEEEEEEEEeeeeee&quot; part in that jazz song&#39;s hook has to be the most annoying 2 seconds of 2016. A 10 hour loop of this would be sadistic; I wouldn&#39;t wish this loop on my worst enemies
Corey is truly an alien trying to understand humans
The mix of Anthony dancing ironically in a comical way and then the faces he makes when trying to comprehend what is going on in parts of the music is hilarious.
This is a sad album because it makes you wanna die
Mans gum was like I don&#39;t wanna be here for this....
This sounds like a deep learning ai trying to make music after only training for like a few hours.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1125">18:45</a>
Just listned to the album, and I wouldn&#39;t even wish that sort of torment on my worst enemy
Yo this shit slaps
Damn this album slaps on mute
Since when does Melon do real time react videos?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1597">26:37</a> is just an intro outtake from Linkin Park
Alternate title: melon on the brink of suicide continues his pattern of self destructive behavior and had a breakdown for 50 minutes
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1877">31:17</a> &quot;Something out of the 90s&quot;<br>Speaking of, it is easily inspired by &quot;Chasin You Around&quot; by Sugar Ray, even just with the intro and how it pans out<br><br>EDIT: Holy shit Feldman tried to write a Sugar Ray song
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=562">9:22</a>  the song he&#39;s ripping off is Raise Your Glass by Pink.
Feels like he made the album faster than it’s runtime
He hated this album so much he didn’t even bother to green screen it
Thanks Anthony now I hate music from the 80s and 90s
I watch this at least twice each month, like I need it
If this was a new 3d Sonic The Hedgehog game soundtrack -- people would be praising it.
i listen to this album every time i need help with my diarrhea, thanks Anthony!

I think the worst part is that he did a fundraiser to finance this talentless crap, because apparently he was too broke to make his own record, but felt he had some sort of calling to make one.
According to Wikipedia, &quot;Feldman asked fans to help raise $105,000 to fund the album through Indiegogo, but fell short and only raised $14,982&quot;.<br><br><br><br><br>Ah, that explains it.
Listening to this album is like watching Cats. It transcends subjective good and bad quality, and it is simply an endurance test. Do you have the strength of will to complete this album, or are you a coward?
Anthony fantano looks so concerned and scared at some points in this video
I know I&#39;m late to the party, but it sounds like an entire album of Markiplier parodies.
I thpught the first track said deception decepticon
Finally watching this in quarantine
This album gave me coronavirus
You&#39;re &quot;triggered&quot;.<br>I&#39;m out.
I like that this starts with Anthony kinda laughing and joking about each song at the start, but he slowly falls into a deep despair by the end of the record.
This review is like that scene in Full Metal Jacket where Gomer Pyle freaks out.

Album so shit my pc crashed when i watched it
It really has the same vibe as the room
Thank you, Corey Feldman, for releasing Angelic 2 the Core! Anthony&#39;s review of it will cure any bout of loneliness, boredom, and self-doubt
Always found it ironic that dood looks exactly like Skrillex
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1959">32:39</a> is better than anything on the actual album.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2152">35:52</a> on repeat

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1040">17:20</a> a very confusing and emotional 5 seconds before realising that fantano sits in his video
That jazz showtune song should be covered by an experimental band.. It has a potential of being a weird but decent song.. Not gonna lie.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1480">24:40</a> &quot;We&#39;re already this close to killing oursleves. Let&#39;s just take that extra step and see if it happens.&quot; <br><br><b>Viagra music with Corey Feldman vocals starts playing</b> <br><br>🙃
In retrospect.. This album was a sign to the eventual Donald Trump presidency.. We should had known.
your tattoo sux.....Feldman rules...
I’m here for my monthly viewing :)
Holy shit, almost forgot to watch it today
I actually want to have this album on CD ironically
Amazon reviews of this album are hilarious!
To add to the pain, he&#39;s working on a &quot;box set&quot; Doe&#39;s he not live in reality?  His worshippers will do and buy anything....... Literally and figuratively
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1092">18:12</a> anthony doin the joker laugh... yoooooo
This album has the quality of a playlist of minecraft parodies performed by a choir 9 year olds.
I&#39;d love to see NIN cover Negativity with The Downward Spiral style production 😏
Lmao listen to the tracks at half speed
I think you&#39;re playing it backward.
This is a good bad album, what I mean is that you can play this with your friends and have the best time just laughing about it.
&quot;negativity&quot; just sounds like a reject from the quake 2 soundtrack
Mans is thinking about his niece
This album sounds like if Perry Gripp took a bunch of PCP and just went apeshit on Ableton Live
Maybe Cory (through this album) wanted us to feel the pain he felt during... certain work as a child actor. I sure as hell felt violated after listening to this album
When Anthony cuts the music to talk about it&#39;s like I&#39;m getting a moment to catch my breath.... Please make it stop
&quot;track 12&quot; caused me to convulse and talk to myself... Why<br>How <br>I <br>Fncl<br>Clclcclcpckdjdn<br>BB b bbb
This album is so uniquely bad that even melon’s green screen refused to work
This isn&#39;t that far off from 100 gecs for me honestly
Sometimes in the middle of the night I&#39;ll awake in a cold sweat, the words &quot;AND THE LORD SAID: THOU SHALT NOT LIE&quot; echoing through my brain, reminding me that Corey Feldman is, in fact, a person who exists.
Bald man legitemately loses hid mind live on video
Funny how your least favorite albums all have a 2 in place of the word to in the title
Roblox Sexy Tycoon: The Album.
Anyone else still watch this annually?
Omfg your laugh is so stupid and fake shut up it&#39;s making me want to hear the record...pull up your wife beater your mom wants to do the laundry..

I’m lying in bed with my husband next to me, watching this video. Around the 27 minute mark I turn to him, see him lying on his back and staring up at the ceiling. He says in a small voice, “I don’t feel comfortable anymore. This is scary.”<br><br>He had no context to what I was watching. This is why I married him.
Snoop Dogg is the Nicholas Cage of Hip-Hop
You only hated the album because Corey is black 😡
The fastest 50 minute video on Youtube, I watched it 7 or 8 times and it never gets old
It’s like daft punk and skrillex tried to reverse engineer trout mask replica
I don&#39;t understand how a 44-year-old man could release this.
I feel like if you look hard enough there is a 100% chance there&#39;s a weird fetish porn compilation with this album in the background
yall should go look at the google reviews
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=425">7:05</a>
This is my favorite video from the Melon head
I wonder what Cal Chuchesta would thought of this album
I just stumbled on to this....so fucked up.  This is Melon at his best.  Im watching all 50 minutes.  All In!
I swear every time I come back to this to video it becomes funnier and funnier
I wanna meet the person that listened to this and was like, &quot;damn that shit is hot.&quot; Then shoot them in the fucking face.
I&#39;m convinced Cory Feldman is trolling us in some magically brilliant way. WHAT IN THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT?! I&#39;M DYING! 😭😭😭
This dude is like a knock of balding version of Maynard James Keenan. I couldn&#39;t imagine mjk being as corny tho.<br>Sure does look like him kinda though you gata admit
To me it sounds more like Corey is saying lickety splicky.

just realized snoop dogg is included in both best &amp; worst albums of the decade.
ok but who decided to put death grips in similar artists, on apple music for corey feldman💀
I was trying to drink a beer while watching this. Big mistake.<br>I kept doing Beavis-style spit takes and now my room&#39;s a mess.<br>Thanks Corey. Thanks Melon.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1090">18:10</a> for maniacal laughter
His face at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA">0:00</a> somehow says it all
I’ve been watching this review in full at least once a day. My fucking God.
Listening to this album gives off the same vibe as watching a Neil Breen movie
This album gives me the heebee jeebees
Some of these songs legitimately sound like they could have been on one of the Pink Guy albums.
Weird that his documentary is the commercial for this. Wtf?
It sounds like he made the entire album without hearing it
Listening to this I can now feel what Corey felt when he was molested. My heart goes out to him. Nobody should be put through so much inhumane torture...
You know that one british office scene where David Brent is dancing.  This is the audial equalivent
One day he’s going to review an album so bad the red flannel won’t cut it. He’s going to review an album so bad he’s not wearing any clothes.
Shaggs level of bad
Watching this really high makes it 500x funnier. Also it lasts like 3x longer
Fat STEVE-O
So this album is just a combination of all the music from the 80s, stereotypical 90s hip hop and all the rock bands that have no personality? Cool.
The first track sounds like a Phineas and Ferb song
Angelic to the Core 2: Electric Bugaloo
Corey Feldman is midlife crisis incarnate.
i don&#39;t know what the quarentine is doing to me, but i&#39;ve watched this video every day for the past week
This is the musical equvalent of the Best VHS In The World
acting as though the problem with this album can be described in terms of fusing too many genres, or even described in words at all, is probably missing the point. this album is ethereally terrible
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=824">13:44</a>
why are we listening to this through your mic audio?  would&#39;t have been hard to set it up properly oof
yeah fine this is crap but where&#39;s YOUR album BRO <br>jk hahahaha
Ladies and gentleman the likely worst album of the century.
this still is your best video, antnee!
It sounds like a South Park parody
Anthony, art is about feelings, and I&#39;ve never seen stronger feelings in you outside this video. That means this album is good because it makes you feel things, it doesn&#39;t matter if those things are pain, disgust, misery or hopelessness.<br>strong feels = strong album = strong 10<br>I hope you change your mind in the future.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1088">18:08</a> laugh of a madman
WTF are you wearing?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2370">39:30</a> is my favorite part
Imagine an album so bad that Notthony Goodtano bashes it for almost an hour
OVER ACTOR<br>REACT LESS PLEASE thank you
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=258">4:18</a> Think the words you were looking for there are &quot;Delusional 2 The Core&quot;.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=948">15:48</a> when high school musical starts randomly playing on your computer
You can really hear the death grips influence
You crossed the line<br>You crossed the line<br>You crossed, you crossed, you crossed the line(x40)
Wow, this is the only album I’ve seen melon dance on camera to... it must be a really good listen
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1277">21:17</a> Is this RHCP-Can’t Stop at home?
22 FUCKIN TRACKS?!? OF WHAT??
Lickety Splickety sounds like the best Death Grips song that never existed
Of course Fred Durst has to take part on this.
You know it&#39;s bad when melon is willing to risk the YouTube copyright bots because the only property describe this album&#39;s quality is to play it
Corey sings like a methhead one track and Linda from Bob&#39;s Burgers the next
This album is so bad that it makes me wanna prank people by blasting the songs out loud and pretending that I enjoy them 😂😂😂
If you removed corey feldman and maybe chopped off a couple instruments on each track this might be fine.  It might have a couple bangers but not super smart or engaging.  BUT FUCKING COREY FELDMAN COMES ON THE GODDAMN THING AND TUNNELS THIS ALBUM INTO THE FUCKING EARTH
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1312">21:52</a> it’s hard to believe this is real, I couldn’t make a piece of music sound more busted if I tried
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1272">21:12</a> just leaving this for myself
I realize this is an old video, but I gave it a re-listen today after accidentally rediscovering it.<br><br><br>I just wanted to say... this isn&#39;t even a terrible album in a certain way.<br>When an album is bad, it&#39;s usually just boring or it&#39;s hard to listen to.<br>This album is so captivating, I keep going back and listening to songs on the album (and songs from his other album from the early 2000&#39;s too). It can&#39;t be background music, it captivates your attention so much, it keeps you so focused. <br>I&#39;m loving this album so much, it&#39;s fucking hilarious and I can&#39;t stop listening to it, so therefore to me, it&#39;s brilliant.<br><br><br>Avant-garde classic.
Time for my bi-annual watch
He didn&#39;t like this album because you need to be on Bath salts to understand it
All of you need to see this album’s website, it is absolute fuckin platinum
the best way I can describe this album is that it sounds like fake music; music that plays in the background of a cartoon or other tv show but it&#39;s an entire album of just that
Should be the best of the decade
i am actually suprised that anthony fantano have time machine
Am I the only one who&#39;s still flabbergasted at how godawful the cover is? It seems Corey deliberately hired a guy that was kicked out from a Design School and still kept going as a designer.
L  I  C  K  E  T  Y    S  P  L  I  C  K  E  T  Y
He was channelling Hanson&#39;s MMM BOP. lmfao
Who else has watched this multiple times for a good laugh?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1899">31:39</a> anthony&#39;s  singing attempt was better than what actually came
I think this album is just super brown like some Ween releases. I dig it
I almost chocked on apple pie listening to this review. 🤣🤣🤣
&quot;...it&#39;s totally ripped off from other song, I don&#39;t know which one, but I know it is because it&#39;s the only part of this track that sounds good.&quot;<br><br>Dayum.
The only album so bad he had to simply show us rather than tell us
The worst thing about this album is that it&#39;s so long. <br><br><br>I&#39;ve tried listening to the entire record and I was like &quot;Okay, this 1st song is kinda bad, but I guess it&#39;s filler.&quot; But the thing is - every song here is bad. It&#39;s so bad that it wears you down because you expect at least some sort of peak on every record. But that just doesn&#39;t happen here. It literally drained me of energy and I wasn&#39;t able to listen music for the rest of the day after I listened to it.<br><br><br>The most relatable quote here is &quot;I&#39;m being prematurely aged by this album.&quot; I literally felt like I was about to die after listening to this. Truly incredible record..
anyone know the name of the album next to &quot;architecture and morality&quot;
Bruh WTF is this shit, does this guy have a sound engineer? is He signed to a record label? who the fuck released this shit to the world.
Every eyeroll Fantano is having isn&#39;t because of how lame the song is...he&#39;s actually orgasming over the epicness of Corey Feldman&#39;s voice.
Feldman was raped a bunch as a kid and that shit fucks you in the head
I think <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1066">17:46</a> is the inspiration for supermarket by logic
This video has wonderful energy
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1039">17:19</a> my food in the microwave at 2am
You only hate this album because this album is not racist nor condone white supremacy.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1355">22:35</a> when you nut and she keeps zuccin
I hope one day, a live musical is made surrounding this album...
The production is worse than Cut The Crap by The Clash (especially the first song), AJR, and Imagine Dragons combined
Did yall noticed that snoop was on the worst album of the decade and  also the best album of the decade
Just as MJ was stuck as a 10 year old boy psychologically,   Corey is stuck as an immature 13 year old sex crazed doofus.  Both are deeply troubled men who never grew up.<br>LoL can you imagine if his next album was a deep introspective shoegaze/post-rock album about a broken, lonely man trying to escape his past while also trying to seek a purpose in life where most everything of importance is now done by machines;  instead of trite pop talking about parties and honeys
So you think it&#39;s pretty good, got it.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1086">18:06</a> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1089">18:09</a> Melon showing the face he makes when he nuts
I actually like this album in a really weird way
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=458">7:38</a> Best part
&quot;Grandpa Skrillex&quot; killed me
God dammit, Melon. This review is a MASTERPIECE
I could see this dude becoming Hollywood&#39;s new Charlie Manson and his Angels being the ones to carry out his demented prophecy. We&#39;re all fucked.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2000">33:20</a> if i tried to record a song, and my voice came out sounding like that, i would never pick up a microphone ever again in my life
You just know that Corey Feldman plays his own CD when he&#39;s at home.
I was just clicking through old videos on this channel, and I&#39;d never heard of this album or seen this review, so I decided to watch for the laughs. But I&#39;m actually blown away at how bad this is. Tbh the only Corey Feldman song I&#39;ve ever heard is Ascension Millenium, back when it was being shared around as a music video to be memed and mocked to death, so I thought I was sort of prepared for how terrible and amusing a record of his would be. I was not. Abrasive cacophony doesn&#39;t even come close to describing the assault my ears just experienced. This is insulting to music. I can&#39;t believe anyone thought this even came close to sounding good. It&#39;s just layers of dissonant noise with god awful vocals. It&#39;s so bad. Just so incredibly terrible. It&#39;s astonishing.
lost count of how many times I have watched this review
Angelic 2 the core: 2 angelic, 2 core
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2838">47:18</a> he became the guy from Something Terribly Offensive for a moment
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2117">35:17</a> actually made me burst out laughing. I mean, holy fucking shit.
Here is a theory: Tommy wiseau is the ghost writer for the songs
He got on his niece and preyed?!?!?!
Don&#39;t mind me, just making my bi-annual pilgrimage.
Corey Feldman is the Neil Breen of music
this is what happens when the universe goes upside down, <br>along with melon&#39;s to pimp a butterfly review
i unironically listen to this album from time to time<br>it&#39;s the literally most fitting type for the &quot;so bad, it&#39;s good&quot; thing
If the kid cudi principle holds, the next feldman project is going to be so good its bad
if this album never came out melon&#39;s redux mbdtf revuew would&#39;ve been 10/10
I always find myself coming back to this review. It&#39;s hilarious.
The scary part is all the dislikes this video have that mean he have fans.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1066">17:46</a> Anthony getting his groove on button.
This album is what happens when all your friends don’t have the guts to tell you that you really can’t sing.
I wonder if Snoop Dogg actually thought Go 4 It would go viral. &quot;All the kids listen to dubstep now and the song is a total earworm. Royalties for days!&quot; I don&#39;t think it&#39;s impossible as greats at any particular craft are not always good at evaluating talent.
So your telling me this is <b>not</b> a joke
How can 740 people dislike this?! This is the reason YouTube was created! Ive lost count how many times I have listened to it!
He really defiled John Lennon’s Working Class Hero 😭
&quot;You may not like it, but your kids are gonna love it!&quot;
My jaw honestly dropped at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1997">33:17</a>
This is like bizarro Mr Bungle with 0% talent....no bueno.
This album removed the grease stains from my garage floor.
He better make a new album lickity splicky.
&quot;When people say that &quot;White people ruin everything&quot;...  I know that&#39;s not true, but in the face of this I can&#39;t come up with a retort.&quot;<br>Prob the best sentence to describe the album with lmao
Corey went to the crossroads to make a deal, but the devil was like ; &quot;I don&#39;t do miracles dude, I think you need an angel&quot;.
The musical equivalent of Tommy Wiseau&#39;s &quot;The Room&quot;!
I can&#39;t help but feel like Black Midi listened to this album and got really inspired
Almost 4 years later, and you’re more synonymous with this album than Corey Feldman
In retrospect, we could&#39;ve easily seen this to be the worst of the decade. But goddamn I&#39;m so happy this album got the spot.
Its 2020, Snoop was in 2 superbowl commercials. 1 for guacamole dip, the other as subways &quot;plant based&quot; spokesperson<br>I dont think he can say no to money for anything
Cal Chuchestas album was better than this
I&#39;d need maybe 100 dollars to appear on that song instead of Snoop.  <br><br>Tbf I have nothing and am a nobody so I&#39;d maybe do it for 80.
this review achieves so much more than any album could. it makes you feel EVERY emotion so powerfully. it takes you on a demented journey through the decline and breakdown  of the human psyche. it’s so cohesive. it ties together so incredibly at the end. the way all the central themes of this review tie themselves up at the conclusion rivals kendricks poem at the end of tpab. its messy presentation, as shown on the thumbnail or a tank-top wearing bald man next to a poorly photoshopped square, only adds to its charm. this is an improvised spoken word piece that achieves more than many albums ever could. i give this review a very very strong 10 to a light 11
This sounds like it came from those corny educational music videos your elementary school teacher would play when she didn&#39;t feel like teaching.
dont worry danthony, i have weed so the music wont melt my mind, remember music sounds better high
&quot;How is this legal?&quot;.....fantastic.
Idk if y&#39;all have tried listening to this album but the mix is horrible. You can barely make out what the terrible vocals are saying at all.
Sounds like someone put every music genre in a shredding machine then it was regenerated into songs using AI developed in the 90s
This album just shaved off 2 years off Anthony’s life.
this is going to be like the shagg&#39;s philosophy of the world in the next 50 years
I’ve never laughed so hard in my fucking life
I have to be up in 3 hours why am I watching this
Alright imma listen to Death Grips on repeat now.
Holy shit it&#39;s 50 minutes
Imagine the engineers witnessing this in person....
His little &quot;something out of the 90s&quot; riff was actually better lyricism than anything on this entire album.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=933">15:33</a> you’re welcome
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=884">14:44</a> you’re welcome
I think the best and funniest thing Corey could have done was make track 22 an actual good song. 21 tracks of crap and then 1 song that was genuinely good.
When those girls come in with that “Go...for...it” that shit hit home hard
snoop dogg was on the best and the worst album of the decade??? what a range of collaborations
I invited my friends to a listening party and they said &quot;That sounds like an act of self harm.&quot;
What are you talking about? That shit was fire yo. 🤣
I want a supercut of every &quot;Why?&quot;
You probably didn&#39;t even listen to it backwards
This album sounds like accidental 100 gecs.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2309">38:29</a> Nope, it&#39;s 2020 and you&#39;re still not laughing about it.
He looks so stressed out from listening to just a clip of only one song on this entire album! XD
He said december 2019 he was workin on a new album... here&#39;s hopin its much, much worse and comes out soon
100 gecs for old people
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1039">17:19</a> I never knew the melon was sitting in a chair this whole time. I always assumed he was standing.
This is the first 11/10 review. This is cannon.
back for my annual viewing of this video
It honestly sounds like Gob’s CD from arrested development
y’all really be afraid to moan while i be in my girl ear like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=577">9:37</a>
This is just a really long Tiktok video
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=836">13:56</a> is that a cat in the mix?
I almost feel bad laughing at this because if you look into Corey Feldman&#39;s story, it&#39;s pretty obvious he was sexually abused as a kid. That combined with the whole child star thing has obviously fucked him up. That&#39;s the only explanation I have for this album existing
This is gold, solid gold!
I ripped the audio of this video and burnt it onto a cd making this review my favorite (and possibly best of the decade) album.
bout my niece
Fred Durst is on this album.  Because of course he is.
Holy fuck this really is so fucking bad
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1997">33:17</a> YOU WERE RIGHT ANTHONY, THIS REALLY IS THE WORST TRACK ON THE RECORD.
Demonic 2 the Core gonna be a review for the ages
Who’s here after melon ranked this as the worst album of the decade?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1490">24:50</a> that instantly reminded me of snow cone by deadmau5
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=720">12:00</a> talk about bizkit man
Yellow flannel: good<br>Red flannel: bad<br>White tank top: amazingly bad
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1092">18:12</a> Joaquin Phoenix joker laugh?
&quot;will maybe go down as the worst album of the decade&quot; <br>and sure enough...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=825">13:45</a>
This album is fucking amazing.  U dropped the ball fanato
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1086">18:06</a> the moment he broke
Good review, Anthony, but I really draw the line at your saying that this album justifies Corey being sexually and emotionally abused by Hollywood producers.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1508">25:08</a> That MDE sticker tho
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1093">18:13</a> fantano goes full joker
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=440">7:20</a> <br>The music itself didn’t made me laugh but Anthony laughing so hard just made me laugh so hard.
This album is a solid 10/10 i dont understand the hate
in all fairness the ideas behind the tracks are not that horrible, i literally can imagine a better version of every song that would of kinda worked. the issue is the execution its just sloppy whoever produced this is just as much to blame. if you had a good producer and either switched out corey for a more gifted singer or had him to 100 takes with good effects on his voice then this could be decent. if that version was put out in like 2000 ish it could be a hit. coreys problem is his thoughts are dated.
&quot;Might go down as the worst album of the decade.&quot; <br>It sure did.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2684">44:44</a> has got to be some of the worst vocals I&#39;ve heard in my life. A true achievement.
THE IMPROMPTU LISA LOEB SONG YOU CREATED OUT OF THAT 90s TRACK OMG
more like worst of decade
coming back after this was the worst album of the whole decade
It’s essentially trout mask replica of the 21st century
So is it so bad it’s good? Like The Room?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1085">18:05</a> Melon gave us the Joker laugh before Joaquin Phoenix did
Over 3 years later and this is The Room of albums at this point
2020 crew checking in.
I can&#39;t believe this album came out in 2016 I always thought it came out in 2006 or something
You already knew it was going to be #1
The Citizen Kane of album reviews
kpop fans: omg this is an absolute BOP! song of the year, y&#39;all better STREAM<br>the kpop song: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1190">19:50</a>
He was right. It was the worst.
every track on this album sounds like 2 or 3 songs layered on top of each other
i want to live in the universe where this is considered as hard rocking an album as corey thinks it is in his mind
It was worst album of the decade
Disliked for talking shit about Hellboy.
&quot;Maybe goes down as the worst album of the decade&quot;<br>called it.
You were right. This is the worst album of the decade.
Anyone here after he named it as the worst album of the decade?
Worst album of the decade
IT MADE IT TO THE TOP OF THE DECADE LIST WOOOO
you actually need talent to make it this bad
you can tell he hates it so much cause part of him is actually enjoying it in an obscene way
Whose here after this was named his worst album of the decade
It did go down as the worst of the decade, but the melon described it in awe, not disgust. As if it was not that it was the worst, but the best at being bad.
This album is worse than Chinese water torture
Who&#39;s here after Melon named this Worst Album of the Decade?
Worst album of the decade.... melon also see to the future
JESUS CHRIST. THE LIL PEEP AND POST MALONE SHADE WAS VICIOUS.
This album sounds 10x better when you listen to it backwards.
It took me 3 and a half years to attempt to watch this entire video.<br><br><br>Congrats, Corey. You&#39;ve created not only the worst album of 2016, but the worst album of the 2010s.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1014">16:54</a> idk if this is an interpolation but if not this is just a direct steal of smooth criminal
Melon: mentions Fred Durst showing up on this album, and mentions how terrible Limp Bizkit&#39;s music is<br><br>YouTube: plays CarMAX commercial featuring Limp Bizkit music and a Fred Durst cameo
Worst Album of the Decade: Confirmed
crackle crackle
Who’s back after he named it the worst album of the decade
He was right, it was the worst album of the decade! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=34">0:34</a>
This has to be an inside joke album
What&#39;s incredible about this album is that it goes into the mind of a crazy person for 90 minutes. A true classic of the bad music genre.
Melon predicted this as the worst album of the decade. All hail the prophetic Melon
<b><i>WORST ALBUM OF THE DECADE LADIES AND GENTLEPERSONS WE MADE IT TO 2O2O !!!</i></b>
you really weren&#39;t lying when you said it would be the worst album of the decade
Jesus that Fred durst song. Wow that&#39;s fucking horrific
This album sounds like an explosive diarrhea
back from worst albums of the decade video haha
50 min? xD
&quot;an album that will maybe go down as the worst album of the decade&quot;
You could say it&#39;s delusional... To the core
I&#39;d still take an Angelic 2 The Core over another fucking Maroon 5 single
Shout out to anyone back here after he gave it worst album of the decade.
This is as if if crazy frog had zero talent
Beholdeth... the worst album of the decade... <b>sniff</b> just beautiful
It really was his worst album of the year huh
Yep, definitely your worst album of the decade.   Now I am here to know why.<br><br><br>Edit:  Well finished the video.  That was an experience.
It did it. It made it to his worst album of the decade
Fantano confirmed this would be the worst album of the decade
this is art in itself
worsthony of the decadetano here
Corey Feldman feat. The Republican Pussycat Doll who got fired before they shot the album cover
I love how he said “this may be the worst album of the decade” and he actually said that in his worst of the decade video. He knew THE MOMENT HE HEARD THIS SHIT that it was the worst thing ever
Welp, you called it. Worst album of the decade.
hey, he was right
Anybody else hear him laughing like the joker at some points? This music really is making him lose his mind
&quot;Worst album of the decade&quot; He called it.
Worst album of the 2010s indeed, maybe of all time.
I’m back. Fatano made it official.
of the decade
So what rating does this album get? -1/10
No other album is so AMBITIOUSLY bad. This album has fred durst and snoop dogg on it. Definitely deserves worst album of the decade.<br>I&#39;ve never seen such sarcastic facial expressions.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1096">18:16</a> anthony you kinda sound like the joker haha .... haha ....  😟
Still one of my fav vids he&#39;s ever done.... FUCKING HILARIOUS 🤣🤣

&quot;this might go down as the worst album of the decade&quot; well holy shit
He called it
I don&#39;t understand why you chose to give this a 10/10.
We did it baby. Worst of the Decade. God bless you, Mr. Corey Feldman, godspeed
Finally I can say it:<br><br>THE WORST ALBUM OF THE DECADE.
Here after he named this the worst album of the decade.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=31">0:31</a> I’m from your own future and you are most definitely correct
Well, he was right. It did go down as the worst album of the decade.
Who’s here after the worst of the decade
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1173">19:33</a> Anthony dont pretend like you wouldnt beg for Corey to put you on the track
“I think with maybe go down as the worst album of the decade”<br><br>Makes it the worse album of the decade*
change that title to “worst album of the 2010s”
This album is what they use to torture musicians in hell
&quot;&#39;this may be the worst album of the decade&#39;&#39; -fantano<br>Me after watching his top 15 worst albums of the decade lists: He knew....
&quot;an album that will maybe go down as the worst album of the decade&quot; <br><br><br>and here we are
“An album that will MAYBE go down as the worst album of the decade...”<br><br>It did
Iconic
Who else came back here to celebrate this album winning Worst Album of the Decade?
Worst album of the decade baybee
Well folks! The prophecy came true!
we did it
IT DID<br><br><br>IT GOT NUMBER ONE<br><br><br><br>ITS THE WORST ALBUM OF THE DECADE
And the worst album of the decade goes to...
whose here after melon said it was the worst of the decade
When you turn on the jazz station on Sims.
I’m terrified that in 20 or so years as music becomes more and more homologized and genre-less that this album will be viewed as some overlooked long lost gem and will be celebrated as a piece of art.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1483">24:43</a> He almost said &quot;Go for it&quot;
y&#39;all are gonna get me fired. I&#39;m at work with tears in my eyes i&#39;m laughing so hard.
I held it together until Fantano said: “I guess he’s a concerned uncle.” <br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2495">41:35</a>
Anthony “I can’t say no to the beat” Fantano
What are you talking about melon, this by far Kanye’s best album
Every time I see this pop up on my &quot;recommended videos&quot;, I watch it....<br><br><br>The entire thing. Every. Damn. Time.
like jesus <b>CHRIST</b>
Its 2020 and I&#39;ve finally cracked it. Some of the loops are from Garageband; that synth lead, some of the cheap instrumentals (etc.).  <b>tosses cigarette at gravestone</b> But who cares. Case is done. People have moved on. Its time I did too. (Roll credits where all the names are just me) The End
man at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2100">35:00</a> i swear is the worst music i heard in my life
&quot;Might go down as worst album of the decade&quot;<br><br><b>Doug Walker has entered the chat</b>
I have watched this an unhealthy amount of times.
I’ve literally watched this 5 times in a row. Melon’s reactions are priceless
What a time in 2016 lol. Lil’ Peep was alive, Michael Jackson was affectionately referred to as “MJ” here....
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=820">13:40</a>-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=830">13:50</a> is actually perfect!😂😂the jesus christ has so much rage in it😂
Was it worst of the decade?
Sounds like a detuned radio station, broadcasting from hell
Cant wait for this album win worst of the century and millennium.
Are we ever gonna see anthony fantano in a wifebeater again..
Starting 2020 by watching the MAGNUM OPUS of this channel
He sounds like the love child of Michael Jackson and Gollum but he’s doing a Muppets impression. Not a specific Muppet. Just all of them.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=564">9:24</a> lmaooo they ripped off LMFAO&#39;s Champagne Shower I&#39;m pretty sure
I greatly appreciate Anthony not even bothering to properly attach the album cover to the greenscreen. he literally just slapped the jpeg in his editor and left it there. a perfect fit.
He rlly missed an opportunity to say delusional to the core at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=258">4:18</a>.
This reminds me of mystery science theater 3000
Well for the worst album of the decade you do seem to be vibing quite hard there anthony
The intro on Ascension Millennium
&quot;it may go down as the worst album of the decade&quot; , wow how wrong fantano was
It’s like Corey heard “Sign ‘O’ the Times” once ten years ago, and tried to copy it while high off his mind and at some point, he completely forgot what he was trying to copy so just started improvising with GarageBand loops
The only place this album should be sold is in the most remote gas stations of Canada, Alaska, and Antarctica
Melon&#39;s laugh always enhances his reviews. Hilarious.
Corey Feldman is the Neil Breen of music, and Neil Breen is the Corey Feldman of film.
That&#39;s exactly what I would expect from a human being who writes everything in caps
gonna tell my kids this was Joker (2019)
This is a cool thing that you did Mantano
I couldn&#39;t tell if Anthony&#39;s laughing was genuine or if he was just losing his mind, or both. After watching the worst 2016 video, I can confirm that the former is true, but I won&#39;t rule out the latter just yet.
you know the album is bad when he has a long intro about just how bad the album is good job melon
corey feldman: actor, recording artist, concerned uncle.
now that is definitely the fans fault, they just didn&#39;t give him enough money on his indiegogo, so all he had to work with was emagic magix music maker and corel draw
melon i usually agree with you but godamnit  y o u  c r o s s e d  t h e  l i n e
The album is so bad, it&#39;s hilarious to listen to. I almost love this album.
Idc what anyone says crossed the line is catchy lol
Does anyone know the name of the white album on melons shelf?
It sounds like bad anime music.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1286">21:26</a>, disturbed vocals on an 80s style ballad 😂😂🤮🤮🤮
&quot;Goddamn i cant say no to the beat &quot; 😂😂😂😂😂😂🥳
This album is just a bunch of competing noises jumbled together 😂
This video really cheers me up
I come back to this video whenever I feel depressed. The pure bewilderment and misery makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside.
The instrumental intro to &quot;Wanna Break Free&quot; is the one thing I&#39;d save from this flaming tower of garbage, and the worst part is that I LIKE that intro. I feel a bit sick.
I almost forgot to watch this today
He sounds like Dave Mustaine with even less singing ability.
They should use this album for torture
its like if my world by gnr was an entire album
I think he got some of those riffs in the loops section in Garageband. His vocals almost sound like Eric Cartman on Working Class Hero.
You need to be a word for word remake of this video on 9/27/26
This album sounds pretty good if you don&#39;t listen to it
This album makes the albums I despise sound like Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band.
So this is what they call music nowadays? Pfft... <b>Pulls up newspaper.</b>
Die Antwoord is not an English name. It&#39;s pronounced &#39;dee&#39;. And they are good. Leave them alone. Imagine they&#39;re black. See? Suddenly much harder to find fault.
crackle crackle fuckers
This album gets a Laugh out of 10
Have merrrcccyyy on my soul. Fantano was diggin it
anthony tanktano here..
imagine spending 50 minutes and 53 seconds talking about how much you want to passionately tongue kiss corey feldman... kinda gross anthony.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=379">6:19</a> a bad porno? Anthony, do the top 10 pornos of the year list.
You know, Corey, your movies are pretty good when your music isn’t screwing it up.
Anthony as always you miss the idea, this album was made to be a &quot;so bad it&#39;s good&quot; it&#39;s The Room embedded in music.
Is this album supposed to celebrate music of different eras ?
Ur skin looks like chicken
This album triggers my fight or flight response more than having a gun pointed to my head
I watched this vid so much that I kinda got used to the badness of the album, its kinda weirdly endearing in a meme-y way now
this video had me in tears. i had to pause a couple times cause i was about to ruin my mascara.
He just needs the mustache and he’s Melon Mercury.
This sounds like 60 movie, tv, and video game soundtracks thrown into a blender
Is Corey Feldman just replicating the Tin Machine arrangement of Working Class Hero?
Anthony literally sounds like Joaquin&#39;s Joker when he laughs
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2117">35:17</a> this might be the hardest I’ve laughed in my entire life
Corey is Deep(as shit) ;))))))
Every time I come back to this video it make me laugh hysterically
This album cured my constipation... 👍
It sounds better🔥 when you hear it backwards 🔙 🎧 ...with a bottle of beer....or two...🍻🍻 <br><br>😂😂😂😂😂😨😨😨😨😨
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1036">17:16</a> when your grandma greets you by kissing you on the lips at a family event
I love this video, I watched it all the way through at least five times already
So 8/10?
Still, to this day one of my favorite videos on youtube. No matter how shit I am feeling it makes me laugh.
This would&#39;ve been revolutionary in the 80s
idk man, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=849">14:09</a> is tight
I hate this album almost as much as my wife
Feldman is the original skid from Letterkenny.
Melon is the Oprah to Feldman&#39;s James Frey.
This is if spam did a 22 track record
Corey is so bad, Cal didn’t even try standing up for him in this review
This guy’s hilarious
Alot of the time, its just sounding like casey neistat going through a mid life crisis.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1880">31:20</a> is literally that one Shania Twain song xD
THis is so entertaining
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1037">17:17</a>
And even after all that, you gave him a 10/10 because he wasn’t ‘black’
this is what going insane looks like
I can imagine a youtuber making something like this
Corey Feldman copyrighting the music from this review has probably made him more money than the album anywhere else
this should be used as a way of torture. does anybody have that picture of the kid in the holster listening to the ipod?
If somebody told you this was a Death Grips album you would have given it a 10
Haha grandpa skrillex
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1959">32:39</a> sorry had to timestamp it bc god damn that killed me
I don&#39;t know pretty much most mainstream pop music sounds this terrible to me
move over TPAB.
This isn&#39;t Pop music. This is VOMITCORE!!!!
Alternate title: Melon plant eating man laughs manically at sounds put together in a bad way with funny impersonation of other man of music who&#39;s considered legendary
Your teeth scare me.
One sad thing is that Corey is obviously surrounded by yes-men. He&#39;s clearly got some mental health issues. That just makes this whole fiasco of an album really sad.
I dont care how bad the music was. You cant say somebody &quot;deserved to be molested&quot; just cause they release a sub par album. Disgusting.
I like to call it Target commercial music
Was placing a PNG of the album cover over the green screen supposed to be some kind of ironic statement?<br><br>If so, I agree.
Melon, I know yous mad bout what happened at the club last night, but you didnt have to slash the tires of my mama&#39;s car. She needs that to get to work.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1960">32:40</a>
Reclinethony hairlinetano
I&#39;m slowly watching this video in ten minutes increments because I can only take so much at a time
You mean to tell me Lil Xan has a better album than this, or am I tripping?
So y’all don’t like when Blueface raps off beat <br>But when someone raps on five different beats at once you still don’t feel it?
NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO!
Ur right this album is the absolute worse, melon
That cover, doe.
I laughed hard multiple times watching this! 😂😂
This is The Room of music. A masterpiece of awfulness. I predict people holding listening parties in a few years
worst album of the decade bro not even of 2016
I saw deep purple live last year, Ian Gillan did a better job singing at 74
Not to alarm you but your arm is blue
when you impersonate michael jackson while trying to make a devin townsend album while drunk and listening to club music
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=562">9:22</a> the synth lead is from get together by madonna i’m SURE of it.
They should blast this at guantanamo bay
All of this music sounds like it was ripped from a YouTube channel from 2011
This is my third time watching this video from start to finish... classic
i swear this gets funnier and funnier every time i watch it
this album predicted 1000 gecs
Hindsight is 20/20!! Corey Feldman was just ahead of his time.
Too bad Nostalgia Critic released an album even worse this decade, this is no longer the worst.
After that Fred Drust collabe track came on I had to go and listen to Down With The Sickness to cleanse my palate before I could continue to watch this
This video just flies by, entertaining all the way through.
ive watched this more than ive masturbated in life ... this might b more satisfying ...im 43
human music
Kaya Jones from &quot;4 Bid In Attraction&quot; is a former Pussycat Doll who got kicked out of the band before their first album dropped and was only credited as a backing vocalist. Her schtick now is releasing this caliber of music and being a Sexy Trump Supporter
Nostalgia Critic&#39;s Angelic 2 The Core
I kind of like the instrumental to &quot;Take A Stand&quot;. If that song were a single from some one-hit wonder during the mid-late 90s with a decent singer and lyrics on it, I could MAYBE see it working. But otherwise, yes melon, this album is indeed truly one of the worst things I&#39;ve ever heard. Peace to ya for sitting through this trash.
Some of Corey’s vocals mainly the more aggressive ones remind me of some of those done by Marko Hietala when he’s done songs like “Messenger of Gods” or on the song “Gone”.  These are two songs Hietala did when he was doing stuff with his own group Tarot when Nightwish was resting for a bit.  My point is that if Corey was going for that kind of style, then he failed horribly.  Besides, it seems more likely like Anthony said, and that he seemed to be going more for vocals similar to Michael Jackson, but whatever the truth, he still fucking sucks at it!  Angelic to the Core?  Should be called Septic to the Core.  Fuck that album.
this record is a testament to Corey Feldman&#39;s poor vocal ability, there are some of these songs I could see working with better vocalists and better production
it sounds like if captain beefheart did some bootleg version of tpab
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1933">32:13</a>
After listening to Daughters’ You Won’t Get What You Want, I can safely say that this album is far more horrifying and anxiety inducing.
This album is the “Room” of music
Corey hung around Tommy wiseau while writing this album but its music and not a movie and this is so bad it&#39;s bad. Not like the room where it&#39;s so bad its good.
Anthony: &quot;This is probably the worst album of the decade&quot;<br><br>Nostalgia Critic&#39;s The Wall, just in the final stretch of the 10&#39;s: <b>&quot;Hold my beer&quot;</b>
The synth lead was ripped off from Alone by Calvin Harris
This sounds like the soundtrack to a crappy version of devil may cry
i was waiting for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2000">33:20</a>
Once in a while I come back to this review to watch Melon suffer 😂
Negativity is what Rush sounds like to people who hate Rush
put stuff from that album on your alarm<br>it&#39;ll sure wake you up, screaming
The song Go For It sounds like a Breathe Carolina song or something lmaoooo
Feldog update: he’s attempting to crowdfund 10,000,000 for a movie he claims will expose Hollywood pedos, yet the indiegogo campaign has flexible funding and its blatantly obvious he’s a druggie exploiting his friends legacy
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=825">13:45</a> Melon sounding like Smeagle from LOTR
Oh c&#39;mon Melon, you know Ascension is an absolute banger!!!
Corey Feldman can impersonate Michael Jackson? Wait till you hear his James Hetfield at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2565">42:45</a>...
What if Corey Feldman is just so ahead of the curve that we can’t understand his genius.
At first I thought you were exaggerating.....But then you started playing it
i can no longer count how many times i’ve watched this
Omg yuck 🤮
The clips from the album make me feel like I’m listening to Corey Feldman having a mental breakdown.
@theneedledrop Just found your YT channel and this review was <b>gold</b> . And I agree, the mixing on this thing is <b>all over the place*. Truly schizo. Not to mention the off key vocals, atrocious lyrics and pulling all the *worst</b> musical elements from the late 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s conceivable. The only possible way this album could be saved, is if Feldman made a very public and provable announcement that he is a time traveler, and brought back his <b>new</b> music to us.<br>Also? You get serious brownie points for that OMD album back there. &lt;3
this album is like if yung skrrt was mentally handicapped
this makes Nickelback look like the best thing on the plant
Did he rip off Mia Vidal?
The best worst album ever created<br><br>It&#39;s the Room of the music world
this is the best 50 minutes I&#39;ve ever spent on youtube
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2370">39:30</a> ahahhahahahahah
Other than the vocals, music, lyrics and artwork. Album is great.
Corey singing sounds like Dave Mustaine trying to imitate Michael Jackson
1st  track sounds like oompa loompas from Willy Wonka
I always come back to this video
A short list of genres this album covers according to rateyourmusic:<br><br>Dancepop<br>Pop rock<br>Electropop<br>Hip House<br>Funk Rock<br>Brostep<br>Nu Metal<br>Electroswing.<br><br>Eight genres. Eight COMPLETELY DIFFERENT genres in one album.
THINKIN ABOUT MAH NIECE
Missed opportunity for delusional 2 the core
This is a masterpiece of fuck!
Snoop Dogg’s net worth is estimated to be around $135 million. <br><br>And he still took a check to show up on this song. <br><br>Corey Feldman’s estimates net worth is $3 million. <br><br>How much do you think he dropped to get Snoop on this album?
Its this Whole Album or Death.
Corey Feldman copyright claimed this video 7 times. what an idiot.
It feels like my ears are being sexually assaulted by 30 different sounds at once in every song. I need to take a hot shower after listening to this album.
I always return to this video to recover some kind of laughter I might have left inside
This album sounds like it was made by someone who&#39;s never heard of music before, and was told to do his best to interpret what he thought music was.
He talks about it like a -1/10 and doesn&#39;t even give a rating
I like to think Melon picked the album up some time after this and unironically bumped to one of the track. Then fell into a depressed and self-reflective state for months.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2156">35:56</a> Anthony’s sex face
I have to come back to this review at least a couple times a year so I can have a good laugh
Wow, play it again Sam! That jazz sure does swing!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1509">25:09</a> he looks so stressed out oh my god I feel so bad
This is your best review
jesus christ melon. I get that you didn&#39;t like the album but did you have to say that Cory deserved to be molested by Hollywood executives?
Wish someone tell him dude  you are horrible. Please stop making music. His acting twice as bad  album  title is has been
Look how he massacred Feldman
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=448">7:28</a> me starting to sleep but is tasked when it seems like there’s nothing left
Someone made a nightcore version of We Wanted Change lmao
I can&#39;t wait for Melon to review the next Corey Feldman album
I literally laughed like 1 straight minute when you dropped the gum. Don&#39;t judge me.
IDK, as a blues man / punkrocker, most of these do not sound any different from the thrash they play and have been playing in the clubs or on the radio for the last 15 years or so.
I am not exaggerating when I say that this is one of my favorite videos on the internet
This album sounds how the cover looks and not in a good way.
This is one of my most favorite videos.
My toes have more talent, my  balls have more taste,than Corey  and the shit on my boot is above duckass Corey Feldman, need I say more,,,
I just realized this man Corey Feldman voiced Donatello in the 1990 Ninja Turtles movie
Just dropping by to watch this for the thousandth time to help me sleep.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1350">22:30</a> Cal is that you?
Speeding Bullet 2 Heaven is actually the Rockadelic portion of this album.
I agree with the review but torturing that black family for the last 15 minutes was a bit much
It has like one comprehensible song, so I&#39;ll give it a full 9.
Even my dog hates this album
This is like a sequel to Fieldies Dreams
honestly though i hear a few seconds of potential every now and then but then he ruins it in the worst way with all of his overwhelming bullshit
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=929">15:29</a> fantano gets down with his bad self . Ch mana na na😆😆😆😆
Corey is the only artist that could win a beef with Eminem.
No
50 minutes?
This is a cosmic horror, not an album
During this review melon turned into lemon
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1175">19:35</a> not a word without 100000$
I got an ad for a hearing loss lawsuit while watching this video, and that about sums it up
There is no god
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1037">17:17</a><br><br>.. anthony was sitting this whole time
In that shirt you look as bad as coreys album sounds.
can anybody tell me the first album behind him? The white album with the multicolor faces on it
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1870">31:10</a>
i want to give up on the craft of music
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=690">11:30</a> seems like porn
Lickety splickety should feature on  Rick and Morty
no one: <br>me: who wants to see a melon album reaction video?
What everybody views this album as<br>Me: I’d gladly slam my copy with my guitar<br>Middle Aged People: This is what people are into nowadays?<br>Current Generation: It’s like witnessing a car crash so bad you can actually look away at it<br>Snoop Dog: I worked on this?<br>Fred Durst: F#%k all you S@*theads<br>Doc Ice: Why?!<br>The Angels: Well that was a B$@*h<br>Corey Feldman: Masterpiece!
This review is meditation for me
With all these ads melon is making more money on this video than Corey did with the album
This some Guantanamo Bay shit
Whenever I’m sad I put on this video to both laugh and remember that few if any things in life are worse than this album
Has Corey listened to vocal jazz at all?
That awful cover of working class hero makes me wanna fucking kill myself. The original Lennon version, and to a lesser degree the Manson version are enjoyable. Whatever that was physically hurt me, though.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=824">13:44</a> LMFAOOOOO
Trout mask replica of 2016...maybe...kinda...no
Farrah Abraham didn&#39;t crawl just so Corey Feldman can run.
Thinking about my niece omfg i&#39;m dying
Wow. Just wow. I cant believe I&#39;m 3 years late to this holy fuck.
He stole another song that Jazz track sounds like the intro song in Lost boys.
okay this is hillarious and that slow jam &quot;For your love&quot; the beat was a rip off of another song, he stole the beat from Jessica Simpson &quot;Nothing but a T-shirt on song. Come on CF be orginal. And for the love of Pete, stop singing, because you can&#39;t. Its American Idol gone wrong, Thank you theneedledrop for another entertaining show about CF. I havent laugh this hard in a long time you rock. And thank you for torturing yourself by listening to the Album, I know your ears must have been bleeding and therapy was involve. lol
Okay if I&#39;m being 100% honest, I like this album alot. Like I get that its horrific. But its so bad its amazing lol. Theres a certain charm it has that I adore. And to be BRUTALLY honest, on Go For It? The dubstep drop has a certain nostalgia for me that sounds cool. Just overall I know its just weird and off the wall and inconceivable. But like, I LOVE it for that tbh :)
You better tell Mr. List to put this at #1 spot on the top worst albums of the decade list...
thinking about MY NIECE
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2110">35:10</a> dead from here
You didn’t like the album because Corey has legs and you’re jealous
I shared a hot tub with Corey Feldman in Hawaii, no joke.
This is The Room of music
Imagine working really hard on this album and this guy comes along completely crushes you
This sounds like a parody album you&#39;d hear in a sitcom, not something that actually exists
How is this not the most viewed Video on YouTube?
Fantano was never the same after this video.
Almost 3 years later and it’s still the worst album of the year
It still mite funny than a lil Dickey album
this new death grips is sounding great
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2470">41:10</a><br><br><br>this is the single funniest lyric i have ever heard, even if the message he wanted to convey was serious<br>anthony&#39;s reaction to first hearing BOUT MAH NIECE makes it funnier hahahhafhghgh
This video is Anthony questioning his existence for almost an hour.
Here&#39;s the &quot;bout my niece&quot; button <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2520">42:00</a>
I know he gave Cudi a 0 but this is so so so so so so so so much worse. If SB2H is a 0 then this is a -150.
When snoop said “all she wanna do is twerk twerk, all I wanna do is party” over like five beats at once. That touched my soul 😩😢
This album is what I hear when I try to listen to To Be Kind.
Try New Folder (5) by $waggot. That&#39;s possibly the worst album I&#39;ve ever heard.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1312">21:52</a> lmao I lost it
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1089">18:09</a> Anthony Fantano turning into the Jocker
I finally realized that the angels are actually trying to place Corey back into hell in the artwork.
This makes Kid Cudis speeding bullet to heaven look like a 10/10 album
I&#39;m trying to sew a patch but it&#39;s taking me the length of the video, I keep looking up in disbelief or laughter
this really reminds me so much shitty music from children&#39;s tv shows
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=323">5:23</a> &quot;For whatever reason&quot;
You know it&#39;s bad when Anthony didn&#39;t even care about putting the album cover on the green screen and literally just dropped it and rotated it a bit
He had such a hard time reviewing this album I think that Anthony lost his sanity for awhile.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1600">26:40</a> I thought Anthony’s cough was part of the music. Would have fit just fine.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=831">13:51</a>-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=838">13:58</a> sounds a bit similar to the final 50 seconds of Hafssól by Sigur Rós.
Whatever Corey Feldman&#39;s smoking, I want some of that!
I was unconvinced that this could be the worst album of 2016. I mean it couldn&#39;t be that bad right? But then I watched  the entire video.
What&#39;s more pathetic, Corey Feldman or his &quot;Angels&quot;?
The album that broke the melon’s back
10/10 REVIEW IT AGAIN
Even If Corey Feldman played the irony card, like the movie &quot;The Room&quot;, no one would care enough to laugh with him.  Corey Feldman&#39;s true genius is in ruining the career of Corey Feldman...nobody could have destroyed his career quite so perfectly as he did himself.
This album is the music equivalent of the room
Imagine an album so bad it didn&#39;t deserve the RED flannel
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2156">35:56</a> WeEeEeEeEeEe
Cant tell the difference between this and any other music played today.  The Music played reflects the era, ..Garbage.
this has to be the worst album ever
This album took 10 years to record according to Wikipedia.
this album might be a -10, but this video was a 10 to watch. great performance anthony!
*best<br>*VERY GOOD
There are 679 dislikes on this. Mom, I am scared.
you talking shit but i don&#39;t see you covering working class hero, ANTHONY
I know Melon for 2 years, and I didn&#39;t know abou this video until he did THAT unpack video.<br><br>You are full of surprises Melon boy.
You can see melons decent into madness as the review goes on.
Corey Feldman got molested as a child...now he wants payback...
I&#39;m so happy I stumbled upon this video. If I ever feel insecure about my own music, I&#39;m gonna remember this record.
Well he owns a copy of it now
Honestly, if you listen to this record pretending it’s Captain Beefheart returning to subvert modern pop tropes, it becomes a four star album.
The world is grey
Who else is back here after the unboxing
Good review Anthony, but the part where you threw the album on the ground and started stroking it was a bit much.
SHUT UP MOUTH!
He has the singing voice of Bob Dylan but none of the lyrical or instrumental talent
This review will go down as a FRICKING MASTERPIECE!
I have to comeback after the orgasmic unboxing ❤
If The Room were an album
look like he con crack, but still eating healthy
My favorite part is how Fantano didn’t even use the green screen to show the album but rather pasted it sloppily as a diss to Feldman.
Love the O.M.D. album in the background.
Peak melon
I’m buying this album on vinyl. It’s beautiful. So many emotions
Press F for gum
What a smooth skin FAntano!
I watched the whole thing. 🥴
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1868">31:08</a> did you improvise that on the spot or is that an actual song from the 90’s? Because I feel like I’ve heard it before
around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1718">28:38</a> is when my ears were murdered
If this album came out 10 years ago... it would’ve still been fucking outdated.
Id give it a 6/10
Ah another 4 am sleepless night, another viewing of the angelic 2 the core stellar review. This is my asmr
so is this a -1 ALBUM?
Someone should definitely be in prison, Melon.
Its like that &quot;name one thing in this photo&quot; thing; just a whole bunch of meaningless indescribable shapes all competing for your attention
Whenever I need a good laugh, I put this album on, and it never fails to make me cry laughing. It&#39;s so bad that you&#39;d swear it was a joke.
Melon having fun
Was there a lyric about overthrowing the government for healthcare?
I think about this video almost every day.
The intro 2 break free is kinda super sick
Anthony is usually pretty wholesome but this just seemed like borderline bullying
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=567">9:27</a> I think it’s a Rihanna song? Neon Lights?<br><br>edit: Demi Lovato, Neon Lights!!! It takes almost the exact same synth burst! I mean, it’s really generic, but still!!! I found it!
The greatest music review of all time.
This sounds like an album that Matt Stone and Trey Parker would make as a  parody album
Anthony looks like cartmen
Somebody bought this album
god bless cory feldman. without him, we wouldn&#39;t have this review.
I&#39;m sorry that I missed the third anniversary of this abomination&#39;s release. How was the party?
How is this &quot;Not Good&quot; when you call Trout Mask Replica a &quot;Classic&quot;? There is no difference between these two albums.
was this a joke album or is this serious ?
The second song with the synth lead, Sounds like a party rock anthem
I have to find the people who disliked this video and ask them “why?”
Jesus, this movie has the worst soundtrack I’ve ever heard.
This album has an 11% approval rate on Google and it upsets me so much.<br><br><br><br>Why would 11% of people enjoy this?
&quot;Mercy&quot; isn&#39;t terrible. It&#39;s not great, but compared to the rest of it, it&#39;s definitely not terrible.
This is basically humanz but worse
ouch
This is like Trout Mask Replica without talent
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2050">34:10</a> Anthony getting ready to commit murder
And I thought my mixtape sounded like shit....
Some of these songs sound like Minecraft covers played through a microwave 20 feet away.
In the first 15 minutes we&#39;ve heard what sounds like poorly derived versions of...<br>Michael Jackson, Skrillex, Avicii, metal/screamo, Foxy Brown, Daft Punk, and many other all put into a cement mixer and recorded in an industrial tumbler, sprinkled with Ye-era Kanye&#39;s god complex, and only baked long enough for Corey to faint relevancy again.<br><br>Did I mention it was only the first 15 minutes?
This is what insanity sounds like, really, insane.
i feel so bad when melon lip sync along  cause it proves that he had to hear it multiple times
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1610">26:50</a> YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU&#39;RE DOING. That is so obviously Left Hand Suzuki Method.
A reviewers nightmare
50 minutes of raw uncut Melon. Yum.
still better than death grips
This is borderline experimental
is he dead yet?
Silly melon this is a meta critique of the right to freedom of speech by providing such a convincing counter example
The Room: The Album. <br>Except The Room actually had charm and an enjoyment factor.
This is still one of the worst aural assaults on record.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1037">17:17</a> spinthony chairtano
Aye didn&#39;t know Spongebob&#39;s snail made an appearance on the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1959">32:39</a>
I&#39;m suprised this is still up given YouTube&#39;s shit copyright claim system
Why is this dude doing a review half naked????????? Not sure it makes sense other than that he&#39;s trying to show off his shitty tats. LMFAO at these fucking ponces. Not sure what&#39;s worse though bro, the album or looking at your pasty ass body.
Take a shot every time Fantano starts laughing hysterically from insanity.
I didn’t even realize the video is 50 minutes
Whenever I&#39;m trying to study I somehow end up here with this playing in the background as I do something like maths or physics. It really helps me concentrate. Thanks Anthony &lt;3
whenever i feel insecure about my own music i just watch this. dear god. how is this a real album.
Idk what are you talking about when you say bad album, this is basically DG music..
At around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1035">17:15</a>, he spins around so smoothly that it should have hit me that he was sitting on a chair this whole time
that sniff that he does at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=478">7:58</a> sounds like the sample from bb poison
His best review Anthony shredding an album apart is fuckin hysterical
Corey: We Need to Stop Hollywood Pedophiles<br>Also Corey: Michael Jackson was a big inspiration on this project.
Clinicalthony Depressiontano here to review this album
it went from shitty numetal to shitty Nine inch Nails song to shitty R kelly song real quick
Why does that song w/ the riff sound like Celldweller tho?
damn he really fell off on this one... i wish he stuck to rapping like on the chronic
This album is one studio visit away from being a Death Grips album
This is Poe&#39;s law in album form.
That first track he played sounded like a 2/10 at least then when those faster vocals came in it sounded like a children&#39;s TV show looool
This is like if Dirk Diggler actually got his record produced
Either you go hard as fuck to Ascension Millennium or you’re fucking lying
Anthony, even though this was released two and a half years ago, it still brings the stars up to my moon
Captain Beefheart and his Magic Speeding Bullet 2 The Core
this is like if kid rock and skrillex made made one of those producer/rapper mixtapes loaded with filler in a month except its corey feldman and it took 10 years
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=883">14:43</a> pretty much sums up the review and the album.
Corey Feldman is the captain beefheart of the 21st century
Whenever I need I good laugh...
I swear it’s like he listened to “man in the mirror” and thought he could 1 up MJ
holy shit you are so defeated by the end
I always forget how joker-like Anthony’s laugh is
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2040">34:00</a> sounds like a Mr. Bungle/Mike Patton song.
This album sounds like if the overflowing genious of Prince had gone too far and his brain couldn&#39;t take it anymore, resulting in every bit and piece of different musical ideas being scattered across his head and making him lose his mind, starting to obsessively write and record nonsensical tunes that he threw together on an album just before being taken away by white jackets that &quot;just want to help and take him somewhere safe&quot;. That&#39;s what i hear.
it’s like they lobotomised the lead singer of mindless self indulgence, forced him to listen to 48 hours’ worth of 2000s pop songs, then told him to write as many songs as he could in a 5 minute time limit.
This is what 2Pac listened to before he made ?
This album turned you into Jeff Goldblum at the end.
This is as raw as a chicken that&#39;s still alive
This is hard to watch. Melon needs a hug after this one...
This is like Hunt Down the Freeman but an album
Yo Anthony, great review and all, but did you really have to go on a rant about how Corey is the product of the Jewish run music industry and that his music being used to brainwash the masses and spread Israeli Zionist propaganda like a disease?
You can actually see Anthony&#39;s mental stability drop with each passing minute
Why is this 50 minutes long?<br><br><b>Edit</b><br>oh.
You can see the melon slowly losing his sanity and falling into madness
Feldman&#39;s musical choices on this album make a lot more sense when you realize he&#39;s just trying to be Michael Jackson.
This album was written by Randy Marsh before he became Lorde.
Ascension Millenium kinda sounds like Corey Feldman desperately trying to be Trent Reznor, and failing spectacularly. The video illuminates his desire to be MJ at the same time as well.
That first song he played sounded like something that Tim Burton/The Ooompa Loompas would sing in that Johnny Depp Willy Wonka movie 😭
I love Melon&#39;s laugh
how dare you. Have you ever made album from scratch. Do you house wayward angels? Don’t come 4 Corey SIS deal with yr obvious issues and . get. a. lyfe.
Descension Millennium
How dare he drag Funkadelic&#39;s name in the mud like this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2270">37:50</a> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2300">38:20</a>
i come back to this video often
&quot;like&quot;
It seems like parts of this record may have broken you, dude 🤯😵. I hope your psyche recovered 😉😊.
this album simultaneously made me depressed and cured my depression
The last minute and a half had me laughing even after the video had long since ended. One might suspect he was joking, the previous forty-eight and a half minutes of this video, about wanting to kill himself or aging prematurely, but the absolute sincerity with which he lamented other albums&#39; inability to ever supersede this album as worst of the year is a demonstration of the legitimate brain-damage he sustained during the course of listening to this pernicious assault. <br><br>I&#39;m gonna save this video just to return to that last bit.
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23mjinnocent">#MJinnocent</a>
threethony sixtytano
Every song on this album needs at least three instruments removed from it.
The album cover looks like the start screen of a shitty flash game
If this was made my brockhampton you’d give it a 10
Corey Feldman is Cal Chuchesta&#39;s ghostwriter
I watch this review often and i love it, pure entertainment , Corey feldmans album is so bad its good and i enjoy listening to Angelic to the Core when im looking for a laugh or feeling low after a hard day in the office  .... &#39;We wanted Change&quot; &amp; &quot;Duh&quot; are not only the worst tracks on the album but easily the worst out of tune poorly made shit songs ever ! .. thats coming from a man of 42yrsld and growing up with Feldmans movies as a kid ... infact if i was back to doing boxing i would prepare myself with a warmup while listening to &quot;Duh&quot; to get me really pissed off and aggresive , the video to &quot;Duh&quot; and the song &quot;Duh&quot; have really left me hating Corey Feldman entirely, fuck you and fuck your album Feldman !! sorry pal you really fucked up this time and i cant wait to see what you come up with next to get some cash
Each song seems like its an unintentional parody of whatever artist accurately represented each individual genre over the years, which he&#39;s trying to portray. And there are a ton of genres on this album, which makes it brilliantly horrible.
this is track twelve<br><br>this is track twelve<br><br><b><i>there&#39;s 22 tracks</i></b>
This reminds me of that episode of south park where everything sounded like shit
Top ten things to do when you and your friends are stupid drunk
Honestly “Ascension Millennium” is my guilty pleasure. That songs gets me pumped every time it just so happens to come up. Which isn’t often.
Every now and again I come back and give this classic a watch
I wanna see Anthony behind a panel judging live action singers/artists. he would be so entertaining to watch
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1980">33:00</a><br>Wow, Anthony, you were right. This is the worst song on the record.
Corey&#39;s gonna get a 10 some day just like kid cuddi
This album&#39;s wikipedia page literally only three sentences<br><br>&quot;Angelic 2 the Core is the fifth studio album by American actor and singer Corey Feldman, released on June 22, 2016.[1] Feldman asked fans to help raise $105,000 to fund the album through Indiegogo,[2] but fell short and only raised $14,982.[3] The album was universally panned and is regarded as one of the worst albums of all time.&quot;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=542">9:02</a> review movie world
Fantano laughing hysterically at these songs seems so much more insulting than anything he could have possibly said about them lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1312">21:52</a>-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1313">21:53</a> I died of laughter when I heard those horns lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1090">18:10</a> Fantano turns into the Joker from bad music.
This album sounds like when in a Disney movie, the protagonist&#39;s unique rock band get acquired by the countries biggest label and they think they&#39;re going to be the next big thing but turns out they turn their song into some electronic pop song to get mainstream and the band learns to be themselves and never ever do what that label says. However, in those movies the song is purposely made to sounds shit.
who else feels like this is an album you might have made if you were like 7
omg the horns at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1312">21:52</a> hahaha
We Wanted Change killed me.
About that worst track, you mean We’ve Got A Bigger Problem Now by Dead Kennedy’s?
The Fred Durst track had “i - Kendrick Lamar” vibes, which made me sad.
There are 2 possibilities:<br>1. This album is a joke intended to piss people off<br>2. Humanity is doomed
He probably questioned himself why he chose this path as a music reviewer when he was listening to this abomination.
these songs sound like rejected cuts from a Blood On The Dance Floor album
Fantano is a pleb. A2TC is a maximalist classic on the level of MBDTF and Kate Bush&#39;s The Dreaming
that&#39;s just god awful. <br><br>I&#39;m so sorry.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1090">18:10</a> This is the laugh of a truly broken man
It&#39;s time for my bi-annual viewing
I&#39;m surprised Corey isn&#39;t a cult leader yet.
This is what I’d imagine Teddy Duchamp would be doing with his time
Kid Cudi: Speedin bullet 2 heaven.<br>Corey Feldman: Hold my beer.
I saw that MDE sticker on your laptop Melon
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=562">9:22</a> it comes from that Party Rock Anthem by LMFAO I think
delusional 2 the core
Is this The Room of music?
So I know Corey thinks he sounds just like MJ,but really, it just sounds like he has flem stuck in his throat and it&#39;s not pretty.
This sound like elevator music
I&#39;ve watched this video so many times. It&#39;s still entertaining.. also the reason he can&#39;t help but make MJ style of music is because there&#39;s still a little bit of Michael inside of him ;)
Best moments  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=455">7:35</a> ,      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1617">26:57</a> ,    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1996">33:16</a>
Back here again ! … just for your knowledge this review has more views now than the official music video Asecension millenium by Corey LoL lol LOL !!!!!
this album is going to be called an avant garde masterpiece in the future
Fuck, I know I’m late but Corey Feldman sounds like he wants to be Daft Punk, Michael Jackson, and some other more talented artist at the same time.
I could listen to Anthony Fantano... wait for it... FOREVER.
Corey Feldman&#39;s &quot;Angelic 2 The Core&quot; is the musical equivalent of Tommy Wiseau&#39;s &quot;The Room&quot;
I genuinely don&#39;t think I could make a worse album if I tried. And I have no musical talent whatsoever. This album sounds like if a 90 y/o nearly deaf grandpa heard Flume and recreated it with free music tools online.
This album is what I would make if I had access to logic pro in 4th grade
As a fellow Corey, I would like to personally apologize for this worse than awful man&#39;s music, and hope to repatriate to you as a sign of redemption.
Its like james ferraro for real
This song like a song singed by a cartoon villain, but he is drunk and he is on drugs and the studio is on fire and a nuke has been dropped near the studio
Haha &quot;that was my gum..&quot; :D
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=883">14:43</a> damn, that&#39;s actually a textbook example burb
This is one of those videos you can watch on mute and it will still be absolute gold based on Anthony&#39;s facial expressions alone. It deserves an annual viewing, AT LEAST.
i listened to two songs and felt abused. How has anyone listened to the whole thing??? I could feel my ears receding into my head.
So fucked
Wee-eee-eee-eee were together<br>Wee-eee-eee wanted change<br>Wee-eee-eee-eee said forever<br>We were one and we were the same<br><br><br><br>Yeah, even Genius says this is &quot;probably the worst song ever&quot;<br><br><br>...<br><br>Wee-eee-eee
Almost forgot my annual viewing of this legendary video
the “lickity splicky” part fucking kills me
You never ever abuse children! Or they will make these kind of things later.
This album is truly the Room if it were an album. I love it. Always puts me in a good mood
Yeah, jokes on you Melon! He probably gets all the ad revenue from this video. That&#39;s probably the only money he will see from this album though...
This is the Trout Mask Replica of our generation
This is my favourite feature length movie of all time
Feldman sounds so bad.<br>If two or three of these songs were mixed and mastered really well and had people that could actually sing, they’d be juvenile but quirky little pop tracks, passable and not gut wrenching
I&#39;ll never get tired of this video
First time I&#39;ve seen this video, never heard any of this guy&#39;s music before, and I was laughing myself silly. All I can say is, thanks for suffering this album so that most of us didn&#39;t have to. Also, good to see OMD&#39;s Architecture &amp; Morality on the shelf there. A classic!
It&#39;s hilarious how in his attempt to mock Corey he sounds 5x better than him
I actually really like Corey, I really love and respect dude, but this IS funny.
You sound like Jack Black when you imitate Corey&#39;s voice and that&#39;s a good thing since Jack Black is awesome.
I need a gif of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2278">37:58</a> for various internet purposes, plz
This video honestly could have been Fantano laughing like an insane man for 50 minutes with the Album playing, and it would have been just as effective.
I&#39;m late, but this is so hilarious looool
ART. Thank You Corey and God Bless your niece.
Yeah. We get it. You have good taste in music. I do , too.  And I didn&#39;t even have to spend 50 min explaining how crappy this is. I just dismissed it as the crap ot is. Instead of wasting all this time slaging someone&#39;s attempt to write a song, why don&#39;t YOU write us something? My guess is you can&#39;t. Come one AF.
Not all music reviews feature the reviewer not only stating “this should be illegal” and asking the artist to show them mercy and stop with the music, but eventually having him go, to going “no, no, no, no, no” and “how is it even possible” and “I can’t even think of how to make an album worse than this” and it’s beautiful.
Light minus 3
@DanSoder would love this so would big jay oakerson . The Bonfire on Sirius xm
you were right, that is the worst song of the record
Keep coming back just to hear Melon crack up, which always cracks me up! God bless you, Melon.
jezus christ lickity splickity anticipates esketit by 2 years
greatest mumble rap album of all time.
You sir are a braver than me. I made it to the halfway point but that’s all I can stand and I can’t stand no more.
Keep in mind snoop dogg was both featured on this album and tpab
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1312">21:52</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1317">21:57</a> I died
on one hand I&#39;m glad this exists so it provides an example of what not to do, but on the other hand, it makes me want to quit music, climb into a McDonalds grease vat, and die.
This album is like a bad version of the actor Crispin Glover&#39;s: &quot;The Big Problem ≠ The Solution. The Solution = Let It Be&quot; album. That album was fucking insane and went all over the place, but it&#39;s pretty clear when you listen to it that it&#39;s more of an art project and Glover obviously knew that he wasn&#39;t making popular music. The fucker covered Charles Manson even! <br>The problem with Feldman&#39;s album is that he thought it would set the world on fire and be a big pop hit. He thought he was making a goddamn sgt. pepper.
You just know this is going to be called an avant-garde masterpiece eventually.
If there was a musical representation of kitsch, this would be worse than it. This is like a Chinese knock-off of von dutch brand clothing.  This is like if someone was trying to parody 90s-2000s edm music but way to late for the joke to be relevant
Corey Feldman heard Mike Patton on the Peeping Tom album and then decided to shit this out. WTF!?
A couple times a year I come back to this when I want to feel good about myself.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1860">31:00</a><br>Anthony: “It’s like something out of a Disney movie”<br>Me: Hears opening riff to “Beautiful Soul” by Jesse McCartney
This album broke Melon
Some of these tracks might be decent if he hadn’t sung on them
So you know when you have 50 tabs open in your web browser.  And some of them start making noise.   So you start frantically searching for the culprits and after like 3 seconds just dissolve into a full blown panic attack and just slam your laptop shut?  Well you&#39;re in luck because we have that in form album now!
there are 639 dislikes as of right now.... you can’t help but wonder how many of those are actual corey feldman fans
It’s like he’s stuck in 86.<br>Weird as F
This is basically Derek Savage level songwriting.
When he goes into this rant after he yells God damn it at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=235">3:55</a> until he starts talking about kid cudi, it really reminded me of idubbbz with how genuinely depressed he sounds and how powerfully sarcastic he is
One of your best videos. I feel sorry for Corey...
Nothing will top this review. Fantano has reached his peak. Oh and this album makes waterboarding seem fun by comparison. The entire &#39;Rockadelic&#39; side of the album is some of the worst i have ever heard period. The &#39;Funkadelic&#39; side actually makes me laugh so i can kind see value in it but at the same time i really don&#39;t.
He sounds like a rabid Richard Nixon
Listen to this album and then listen to &quot;Doolittle&quot; by Pixies. Your head will literally explode.
Please review one of corey feldmans other albums. Please.
This is what Lou reed aspired to be
I felt psychotic after this ...
Honestly, say what you will about this album, but I feel the one thing that causes it all to fall apart is the fact that Corey&#39;s singing voice sounds so cartoony. Seriously, all I can think of when I hear him is that Donatello animatronic gesticulating and bopping about.
This album is &quot;The Room&quot; of music
Why must I revisit this so frequently?
Angelic 2 The Core &gt; Kendrick’s discography
Seeing melon slowly descending into madness is by far the best thing I’ll ever see in my life
ASCENSION MILLENIUMMM!!!! Terrible song
Please put a shirt on bud.
This sounds like when you are a little kid and you wake up before everyone else at a sleepover while an Adam Sandler DVD menu is looping and there is nothing you can do about. Also Guantanamo Bay.
He&#39;s like Ariel Pink in a way.
I&#39;m freaked out that I don&#39;t absolutely hate this. It&#39;s a fun bad. I feel like he knows what he&#39;s doing
It&#39;s that time of the year again where I come back to this. Never gets old.
That first track sounded like what the studio did to Drake&#39;s album from that one Drake and Josh movie
Jesus Christ you could bite through clam shells with that mouth.
<b>melon: the descent into insanity</b>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1614">26:54</a> BWEAKFAST
This is my all-time favorite music review.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1069">17:49</a>
I like it.  But then again the world is my MST3K.
Dude. put on a shirt
The video I&#39;m anticipating the most is &#39;Corey calls out Needledrop&#39; 😂🤣
&quot;Grandpa Skrillex&quot;<br><br>lol. awesome
We can only hope that Corey funded it himself and lost a shit load of dough on it. That would be a splendid outcome
The teeth are really on display in this one. 11/10
Anthony if you include song audio in your reviews make your videos with some big external speakers! So it sounds bigger &amp; &#39;fuller&#39; on our end y&#39;know.. Fuck it use Hi-Fi !
So what I can gather it’s spy kids the album
i usually wait till octoberish for my yearly viewing of this, but i couldn&#39;t wait
its almost too easy to picture Anthony as an 80&#39;s twink with a pleather hat and matching chaps standing outside some place called &quot;the Man Hole&quot;... have I thought too far into this?
This video ages like a fine wine
Wow. 50 minutes. HAHA
The one element missing from this album is slam poetry compliments of a coked out of his mind Charlie Sheen.
How dare he butcher working class hero like that haha idk why im laughing im actually offended lol
Its like popular music through up all over itself and then committed suicide and it was made into an album.
Corey Feldman is a very odd person himself though haha
Can we get a list for all the songs Corey ripped off on this?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1312">21:52</a> sounded more like a kazoo than sax. Corey clearly once again way ahead of the memetic game. A pure genius. A bonafide living legend.
The CALassic Mixtape is miles better than this thing.
Back again for my monthly viewing
Holy shit this album sounds like a rooster with acid shoved up its ass.
The album that broke his brain
I watch this video like once every other week. Idk why
How do you put out something this bad? It&#39;d be half-assed for a high school garage band. I mean, I knew Corey Feldman made music, but I sort of assumed it was another bland rock group from a celebrity. I was unprepared for the insanity. Maybe he&#39;s actually a genius and it&#39;s a concept album dealing with someone withdrawing from a fictional sci fi drug?
holy shit im dying. the song at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1380">23:00</a> sounds like something The Blood Brothers would do
this sounds like south park meme music
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1890">31:30</a> sounds like he&#39;s doing a really bad Bon Jovi impression... don&#39;t think it&#39;s working for him
If MGMT made this exact album then he would have given it a 7/10
Top 3 amazing things about this album. <br>1) &quot;Thinkin bout my niece&quot;. <br>2) Corey Feldman mimicking MJ.<br>3) This album is 90+ minutes long.
This is borderline experimental
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1970">32:50</a>
I felt Anthony&#39;s pain. <br><br>Jesus, that was awful. I couldn&#39;t bear anymore.
It’s as if someone locked Corey in a basement for 15 years with nothing, but Michael Jackson, Tom Waits, N-sync and NIN albums. And forced him to record a CD with GarageBand
Melon rates bad, I rate bad.
This video IS an album.
That John Lennon cover at the end of the album was fucking brilliant
this is the kind of album that makes you think: &quot;you know what, im terrible, but im not this terrible.&quot;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2227">37:07</a> -Sounds like a joke-song from South Park.
Take A Stand sounds like a shitty Father John Misty song and I can&#39;t stop laughing at it.
How am I just seeing this beautiful work art right now? Thank you for this blessing Fantano
I’m suffering
So bad its good... sorry... bad.
There is too many random things happening on the album. I picture their recording studio being filled with a lot of empty nitrous oxide cans during the &quot;production.&quot; Definitely ideas from someone on a lot of uppers.
Without volume it looks like you are having the time of your life listening to this album
Returning for the yearly viewing
This album sounds like the album KoRn will make in 2029
I laughed through the entirety of this video and it is my new antidepressant.
If he shut up and let us listen more for ourselves
I didn’t think I’d ever utter the sentence “he sounds like a kazoo” in my life, but that jazz track did it to me.  Incredible
This video is the reason I subbed to your channel. It&#39;s the one thing I&#39;ve never regretted in my entire life. That&#39;s right - I regret my whole life but this one decision. Thanks.
lol he hated White iverson, I&#39;m sure he&#39;s happy about Post Malone making it and not being a one hit wonder.
The review that broke Anthony. Also let this review not distract you from the fact that Corey Feldman use to voice Donatello in the first live action TMNT movie.
Back in 2019
You just don’t understand the horns are actually the moaning of dying whale Corey caught on audio while fishing for the rare shi zan jellyfish off the coast of pong dong China
Listening to this at the end of 2018 so next year I can only go up
Didn&#39;t you mean the best album of 2016 Melon
I had to come back to this .. Corey Feldman is the tommy wiseau of music
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1360">22:40</a> Cal taking over
*best
Wow Anthony, you were right, this is the worst song on the record.
And apparently he asked fans to fund the album, which they fell short of the goal. He couldn&#39;t afford to fund his own album?
Anthony is making the same face in this video that he makes while he&#39;s getting pegged to Pony Boy.<br>Change my mind.
<b>Delusional 2 The Core</b>
Apparently, Corey Feldman has made 632 burner accounts.
This is actually Avant Garde music
Corey Feldman sounds like an evil elf that turned on Santa
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=458">7:38</a>  the most contagious laughter i&#39;ve heard all year...
İmagine, at some point in this album’s recording someone came into the studio and said “hey guys, this is a killer track but do you know what would make it even better???   Fred Durst.”
Literally the worst “music” I think I have ever heard. His live performances on the Today show are cringe worthy. He must be struggling to even break even on the cost of making the album.
It&#39;s been 2 years and I still can&#39;t stop watching this. This is Anthony&#39;s opus.
Someone else should rerecord this album to improve upon it
I can’t wait for the eventual 10 Corey gets<br><br><br><br><br>“Hi everyone, I’mthony Speechlesstano here with the new Corey Feldman album”
Hysterical melon cackles at child actor
Miley review better
the news track part is basically a shitty copy of sugar’s music video intro but totally useless and trashy
The tracks seem to defy basic song structure. It seems like the instruments are competing with the song, or playing a different song all together.  That&#39;s before we even get to whether or not the concepts are good . They obviously are not.
This was a fun ride. We had some laughs, we had some tears, some depression, some happiness, some relief.
I caught several diseases hearing this
<b>This album is ahead of its time and we&#39;re just not ready</b>
This album was fueled by crystal meth &amp; meatless chicken strips.
I can’t believe its been two years
BRUH THE HORNS ON THAT FUCKING SONG ARE HILARIOUSLY NASTY MY GOD 😂😂😂😂
This whole album was painful to listen to even just snippets of, but that Working Class Hero cover made me physically ill.
TEN OUTTA TEN REVIEW IT AGAIN TEN OUTTA TEN REVIEW IT AGAIN! You were too hard on Corey Antone Its a good album dont you do this to Corey my second favoret actorman!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1410">23:30</a>
Still watching this regularly
This was the first time I saw Anthony listen to music
Oh it’s almost an hour ... oof
Hi guys back to watch this again
Negativity sounds like disabled David Draiman singing over DBZ background music.
Is there a single alternate universe where people enjoy this?
Something is telling me that this isnt the best video to watch when Im depressed af
Some of these tracks could definitely be on a songs in the key of z outsider compilation for sure<br>Also ascension mellienum is an uplifting banger
So, decent to light 7?
Every now and then when you give a really good album a bad review I watch this video to watch you in pain.
Corey and Death Grips should collab. Make it happen Melon
Both the best and worst album of 2016 have white lines in them.
I religiously watch this video, thank you, Melon
This is just the Room as an album
The vocals are reminiscent of Alex turners <br><br>Good stuff, a heavy 8!
The year is 2056. Music has evolved to the point where all genres have melded together and everything has stagnated out. Music creators haven&#39;t created anything of value, or anything incredibly original, in years. The world is beginning to notice, and is looking for a solution. Anthony, who has long retired his channel and theneedledrop brand, goes through his old vinyl collection trying to reminisce of the now-named &quot;Golden Age&quot; of music. He tries to pull out his copy of The Money Store, but in his old age he trips and bumps his shelf. Suddenly, Corey Feldman&#39;s Angelic 2 The Core falls into his hands. He remembers this review, and begins to play it. Completely opposite to this review, our Melon&#39;s eyes begin to light up as the music hits his ears. Everything has changed. The underlying genius of this album is just the thing that the world needs in this dire time. Anthony calls one of his old friend, Kanye West, and tells him he knows how to save the music industry. Kanye, who retired after the universal praise following eventual Yhandi&#39;s drop in 2032, uses his old connections to get Melon the attention he needs. Melon meets with the heads of the Sony, Universal, and Warner music labels. He gently puts his vinyl player on the table, and begins playing Corey Feldman&#39;s Angelic 2 The Core. They are absolutely blown away. Corey Feldman is flown out to oversee the making of every new music project, and things are beginning to look up. His album flies up the charts, and overall reception of music is the best its been in years. Music is now in a renaissance rivaling none other. Corey Feldman and Melon are known throughout the world as the people that saved music. Eventually the two meet in person to converse about how the landscape of music has now been revived. Anthony is nervous 2 The Core, standing in the shadow of a revered legend. He does nothing but praise him and his brilliance. Corey offers no response, and merely squints his eyes at Melon. Anthony turns to leave out of embarrassment, but just as he has his back towards Corey, he feels a sharp stab. Blood drips down the yellow flannel as Melon turns his head to see Corey with a shining knife pulled out of his back. With a tear in his eye, Backthony Stabtano can only make out one word, &quot;Why?&quot; Corey mutters- &quot;I remember.&quot; Anthony falls to the floor, and Corey begins to use his newfound power in the music industry to tarnish the legacy of theneedledrop.
this is kinda long
I have seen this video more times than melon has gotten accused of mistreating minorities in the comment section of his videos
This review is better music to my ears than the album
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2395">39:55</a> sounds like the magic schoolbus theme smoked crack for 20 years
BOUT MA NIECE...OOOOOOO BOUT MA NIECE
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=832">13:52</a> best lead-in of 2016
I know Melon reviewed this guys &quot;album&quot; in 2016 already but <b>CAN WE PLEASE HAVE A &quot;CRINGING TO COREY FELDMAN&quot;?!?!</b> I want to see Melon reacting to Feldog&#39;s live performances. It could be a new video series. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23cracklecrackle">#CrackleCrackle</a>
when i feel insecure about the music i make i use this video as a reference point for how much worse it could be
It was at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1312">21:52</a>, the melon died a lil bit
Anthony do you even listen to mr bungle? Because Corey has successfully recreated the best of mike Patton&#39;s work.  10/10
I love this album a lot<br>I&#39;m a huge sucker for things that are so bad they&#39;re funny
This was actually pressed and distributed by a label. Let that sink in man

A few times every year I pull this out to remind me that my life could be worse.
Why did you listen to this? I mean look at the album art
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=462">7:42</a> fantano loses it.
LAUGHING
STOP
CANT
Don’t you just hate it when a Has-Been actor try’s to be a Singer and dancer? OMG! Give it up Corey, you aren’t a singer at all!
I almost think Corey could do metal vocals if he weren&#39;t just the worst and somebody else wrote the music
This is really fun to watch stoned.
&quot;Snoop dog shows up anywhere theres a pay check&quot;<br><br>- Melon  2017
Your tat looks like it was done by a 6 year old boy in crayon.
Feldman asked fans to help raise $105,000 to fund the album through Indiegogo, but fell short by 90% only raising $14,982. (Wikipedia).<br><br>Complete strangers gave the total of almost $15,000 of their hard-earned money to help record this double-CD abortion. Think about that.
That snoopdogg song sounds like a DDR track
I watched this video 3 times a day, is really good for my crippling depression
I do have to say it&#39;s pretty catchy. Just horribly stupid lol<br>Basically Kirin J Callinan without the irony and artsy stuff.<br>I might listen to this for shits and giggles. Thanks Melon.
This album is one of the surprise purchases the Doomguy made, and that&#39;s why DOOM 2016 happened.
It&#39;s pretty impressive that on an album this bad, Corey&#39;s vocals still manage to be the worst part.
This video is Anthony&#39;s Magnum Opus of an album review
Watching the live performance on the today show cured my pancreatic cancer but took my ear drums. If Lord Corey giveth, Lord Corey must taketh away...
Low-key thought this was a post-punk album
2016 definitely will go down as the worst year of the decade and Corey Feldman contributed a lot to it
I watch this every month
2018?
Isn&#39;t Cory feldman a car dealership or something?
Should have been the soundtrack to the animated movie Food Fight
You know how this album would make total sense?<br>If you were to take one of those Internet troll faces and use it as the album cover.<br>😬
I love how Corey Feldman sounds less like Michael Jackson and more like Jamie Madrox doing an impression of Michael Jackson.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1067">17:47</a> I&#39;m fucking wheezing
I have seen this 10 times already and I keep coming back. It’s hypnotizing. Anthony is so on point with how bad all these songs are and his reactions are priceless.
That synth ripoff sounds like you could hear on Cobra Starship
Oh poor poor Tommy Jarvis. You were such a good kid until Jason came and fucked you up. This is how you turned out.
The only thing I gained from this album is that Corey Feldman walks around a lot of places.
I&#39;m disappointed in Kurupt.
So if this really did take 10+ years to create, then that likely explains the disjointed, incoherent vibe the album has. He had an idea for an album ages ago, laid some stuff down it fizzled out, he picked it up later and tried a bunch of new stuff he thought would be cool and then it fizzled out again and on and on until that fateful day in 2016. The thing is not only all that though, but that every time he picked the project up again after a few years and added some new stuff that was hip at the time, he didn&#39;t erase any of the stuff he already laid down years prior or replaced/revised tracks, he just fucking slapped it on top of what was already there. Like a shitty car with 3 decades of political bumper stickers layered atop one another. And you gotta scrape from Hillary down to &quot;Change&quot; Obama, then &quot;Hope&quot; Obama, and down to Kerry, then Gore, Clinton 2, Clinton 1, and finally the original long-forgotten Dukakis layer.<br><br>That&#39;s what&#39;s going on with this album, musically. Like 20 years of shitty, derivative ideas layered atop one another, all playing at the same time, clashing with one another SO HARSHLY.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1042">17:22</a> clockwise hair whorl confirms that he&#39;s not a gay melon.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=195">3:15</a> oof that comment hasn&#39;t aged well lol
I almost cried when i saw an actual vinyl single of go for it at my local record store.
Suffer. I wanna die. Give it to me lol
how is this album any different from death grips
You think this is bad<br>Watch his live performances
Thank you I haven&#39;t laughed this hard in a long time
Call Corey Feldman Gallagher cause he broke the melon
Mans really hates lil peep and post malone lol
Lickety Splickety on my Blickety uh
The Post Malone diss at the start of this video looks really dumb now.
The fact that this video has dislikes is baffling
1.6797462729472773920274739200/10<br>Best Track : Lovin Lies<br>Worst Track: EVERYTHING ELSE (except Lickity Splickity and Ascencion Millennium)
Corey is a more versatile, prolific, and lyrically deep songwriter than some hack like Tom Waits. Feldman’s music will be listened to and studied for thousands of years as timeless classics despite THE EVIL MELON’S obvious attempt at character assassination here. You just don’t get it,man. YA JUST DON’T GET IT<br>In 20 years you’ll all see how wrong you were about this album
Y on Working Class Hero does he soundlike he&#39;s he&#39;s tryna soundlike Johnny Cash on Hurt.? Lol.
the worst part to me is the use of a 2 in the title.
more like, worst album of all time
Since Corey&#39;s also an actor, a nice twist to this would be if this is just a character/persona he does.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=933">15:33</a> you’re welcome
On the song “Bad People” it sounds like a kid is butchering a recorder
This is so funny it brings me to tears.
It&#39;s funny, because I&#39;m a regular viewer of this particular review, and every time, as hilarious as it is...<br><br>... I just think, does this really differ in major ways from basically all pop music? I don&#39;t think I can actually tell the difference.
This coming from someone who actually likes Design the Skyline, this album is absolute trash, but your reaction to it is absolutely mint. And on the seventh day of recording this album Corey realized he was angelkin, and his mission to save the industry with the power of JAYSUS, but at the end of the day...nobody cared, except those looking to laugh their heart out through their teeth &#39;til it BLEEDS. XD<br><br>The Wikipedia calls this accidental post punk, I&#39;m just sayin&#39;.  O w O<br><br>The track with Snoop Dogg is actually decent, I&#39;m shocked.

The synth lead on lovin lies is ripped of from Robert delong’s “in the cards” btw
It sounds like one of those overdone meme mashup songs
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1311">21:51</a> HAHAHA
I kinda like some of them.<br>They sound funny and ironicly bad, like something you would hear on a GTA: Vice City radio station.
A good way to raise money for your channel would be to set a fundraising goal really high and if it’s reached you have to livestream you listening to the whole album again
The CD costs around 40€ in Italy...
REVIWALL DIDUNT GONED VIROOOOOOL-oh shit wrong review.
Sounds like shit Russian soldiers dance to
this is without a doubt the worst album of the ever
Jason Voorhees didn&#39;t die for this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=176">2:56</a> hmmm

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1986">33:06</a> 2meirl4meirl
This album is a permanent snapshot of Corey&#39;s cultural context and mental state at the time of his molestation. He stopped developing emotionally after he was molested, and he&#39;s been trapped in that mental state since. It&#39;s fascinating if you approach it from that angle.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=568">9:28</a> It&#39;s &quot;Turn Up The Music&quot; by Chris Brown
STORY TIME <br><br>this album honestly reminds me of when my dad was going through a midlife crisis and recorded songs as if he was going to be the next Jim Morrison. only difference is that my dad sucks at singing even more than the guy on this album. no joke, he couldn&#39;t sing to save his children&#39;s lives!<br><br>my dad performed ONCE at our local public hall, got a few compliments from a few of his friends and then spoke to me as if he was a professional record producer. he&#39;d say &#39;i&#39;m going to record some vocals, so i need complete silence&#39; and then if i made the slightest bit of noise, he would shout at me from his studio. he also said things like &#39;listen to this, it&#39;s so pucker, it&#39;s another hit!&#39; when he&#39;d never had a hit song in his life. then there was that one time where he said &#39;there&#39;s no way i&#39;m just going to let good songs i wrote sit on the shelf.&#39; it was some of the most delusional, egotistical behaviour i have ever witnessed in a person EVER and it came from my own father! it was as if he was a white, unsuccessful Kanye West!! he even asked me to get my friends to buy his songs off of iTunes and he&#39;d try to impress me by singing certain notes that he failed miserably at. <br><br>the thing is, my dad is an amazing multi-instrumentalist and is great at painting and stuff. but it just got to his head a bit, so he wanted to be good at singing too. but you can&#39;t be good at everything. i could see it meant a lot to him though, so being the decent daughter i am, i helped him with the music on some of his songs and then his music came out sounding better. his voice was still hideous though. he must hear a completely different sound to what the rest of us do. people have complimented him and said he&#39;s not as bad as other people they&#39;ve heard before, because they didn&#39;t want to hurt his feelings. but i&#39;m a very honest person and people in a situation like my dad&#39;s situation don&#39;t like people who tell it how it is. hell, if my mum told him she didn&#39;t really enjoy his singing, he&#39;d just sulk and get moody at her. <br><br>thankfully, he&#39;s had enough of recording now. probably because he&#39;s accepted he&#39;s shit at it. but yeah that&#39;s a summary of when my own father used to be a classic case of &#39;i&#39;m getting on a bit now and have received some compliments for trying to sing in front of an audience, so i must be something special and obviously am amazing.&#39;<br><br>i love my dad really though. bless him. he&#39;s gonna teach me how to use his studio stuff too.
Yeah... so I wear hearing aids that are synced to my phone, and they literally cannot even process this album. All I hear is incoherent noise... this is the first time music has translated this way to me, so I imagine this is some seriously bad mixing.
Worst Crap I&#39;ve ever heard. Could raise the dead. Then re-kill-em. 😂
Ok I liked his old movies but Jesus christ what was this man thinking when he made this
I would rather listen to FACK for a year straight, than listen to this album all the way through once.
I&#39;m scared to watch this lol
i think this is the 12th time ive watched this video
Corey Feldman needs help, dude’s lost it.
First track sounds like if Daft Punk had dementia.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2485">41:25</a> spat out my orange juice
Anthony, you forgot to list your favorite tracks in the description of the video...
I got less than 10 minutes into this video before I had heard enough and had to go outside for several hours, get high as fuck, and then sit down a write a better song than anything I had heard in this video up to that point.<br><br>I literally had to go and write a good song to cope with the fact that this album exists.<br>It is so bad that the creative part of my brain needed help remembering our reason for living
Corey would have made this album a hit if he just ended up telling everyone that it was intentionally terrible.
I think he needs that map, right about now.
Idk man, it’s one of those “so bad it’s good” lol.
OMG...this album is an abomination. Why would he do this.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1875">31:15</a> Best freestyle of the decade.
it’s basically ariel’s worn copy
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2055">34:15</a> this literally made my jaw drop. Holy shit, that is the worst song I have ever heard, ever.
Shouldn&#39;t someone go to jail? Hahaha.
Where&#39;s the pizza ?
Come on bro, that album was awesome!
Did Corey Feldman steal the covert art from the old RuneScape login screen?
It&#39;s degenerate art.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2230">37:10</a>
I’ve seen this so much I memorized the comments.
Dude WTH !! a T-shirt please
I GOT IT UGUYS...its a psyop...his music is to torture us like that did to them folks in Waco
I&#39;ve watched this so many times, it never gets old.
Those horns tho😂😭 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1312">21:52</a>
Wow Anthony, that thing you did with the gum was totally crazy xD EPIC STYLE xD cray cray
There clearly was no audio engineer present.. The mixing is awful. It&#39;s s muddy mess. I can see what he&#39;s going for, but he just doesn&#39;t have the chops to pull it off. In some instances it&#39;s arguable that his instincts in terms of melody aren&#39;t too bad, but he just doesn&#39;t have enough skill or talent to produce those ideas correctly..<br><br>I go between seeing what he&#39;s going for and thinking it had potential to outright cringing often.
&quot;realy up there with Chinese water torture&quot;
this isnt a review this is a documentary of Anthony losing his fucking mind
“How is this legal?”<br><br>My all-time favorite line from a music review.
Corey Feldman is playing y&#39;all the album he made is just so he can launder his drug money.<br>Everybody&#39;s laughing at Corey call him a fool but I want you all to ask yourself something if that nigga is such a fool then why the hell is he living in a Mansion fuckin 3 hot bitches.<br>Y&#39;all sleeping on Corey on the down-low he&#39;s a cocaine czar.
You know what? After all this time, I think I found something good about this album:<br>It sure makes me feel better about my own music.
This is the musical equivalent of the movie the room
This single handly broke Anthony
Those vocals hurt my brain
Wow melon, i thought the album was bad too but you shouldn&#39;t have used the n-word 10 times
Tankthony Toptano
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=566">9:26</a> the synth lead you think of is Chris brown “yeah 3x” I think
Michael Jackson was the king of pop.... Corey Feldman is the king of cringe
I swear, I listen to this almost every month just to remind myself &quot;Hey, just as a reminder, you will never be this bad. Life sucks, but not Corey Feldman making music bad.&quot;
Imagine making a track worse than Party Rock Anthem that rips its synth lead
You know one day some hipster in college will right his or hers mid term paper on how this album is secretly a masterpiece and is about the duality of God and Man.
This mans laugh is infectious
I swear to God at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1387">23:07</a>, Corey Feldman says “I want your sister’s dress”
why do I like this video so much?
My GOD this album is total shit. I agree, CF is completely delusional.
Why did he always stop RIGHT before the songs got good?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=882">14:42</a> lmfao bro almost threw up
Wow this actually sounds like it&#39;s from an Office-esque cringe comedy sitcom.
I&#39;ve watched this review so many times the music is starting to sound good
This album sounds like it took every sound that’s been popular in the last 30 years threw them in a blender and then recorded it during an earthquake.
Redux review when? Corey heard your criticisms and went back and fixed the entire album, recently.
I come back to this video like twice a year. It&#39;s been two goddamn years and my brain still has to process the fact that this album exists every time that I remember someone put this into the universe.
Kinda like witnessing a car crash from afar only to find out you&#39;re actually the victim.
This was the review that finally broke Anthony Fantano.
I think its my life what ever i wanna do by vennu malesh is unironically better than this trash
I want someone to re-create this album.
thanks Corey, we needed another &quot;song&quot; sampling the Edge of Seventeen intro riff..
So i cant call out of work without catching shit and Corey gets to release this
I hear 👂 they might make Lost Boys 22 so that’s a bright spot for Feldman.  Maybe he can use that $$$ to pay the “Angels” for all their work..
High five if you think the Album cover is 10 time’s worse then the album!
Around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1503">25:03</a> almost thought that was kendrick llama singing

&#39;bout my niece
This or Money Store?
Some of the songs sounds like low budget 90&#39;s sitcom intros
It’s the worst thing I’ve ever heard in my life. Talk about leveraging once fame to make something that mocks music. His album art is worse than what I get handed by panhandling artists on the street and also sounds worse
maybe this review broke me but I found this only pretty bad
Go to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=3044">50:44</a> and gaze into the despondent eyes of the melon
i didn&#39;t know neel breen released an album
this guy makes captain beefheart sound like julie andrews.
The Vegaboys is coming.....
birdemic 3 should have this as they&#39;re sound track
So, Corey is the Tommy Wiseau to music?
If music had the equivalent of an abortion, then Corey&quot;s got it.
Nah, it’s not bad; it’s just avant-garde/harsh noise. He’s actually purposefully trying to discomfort the audience in the same way he was discomforted by the audience that loved him in the 80s and left him to bleed out. Truly and inspirational figure for generations to come.
Lickety on my splickety, uh
Haha, that album cover...wow!
Either Corey is a delusional washed up childstar or an insane genius creating the Trout Mask Replica of our generation
I had to come back to visit after letting someone else know about your review. Now listening again, I can tell Corey was really trying on the album and I feel bad for laughing. Not too bad though because there is still enjoyment and I like to think that is what he wanted.

The only thing that holds back Corey Feldman is a lack of self-awareness. He could become one of the greatest meme artists in the music industry if he just embraced the insanity a little.
It&#39;s been almost 2 years and this review is still one of the best birthday gifts I have ever received
So since this vid has over 1,000,000 views does this mean Angelic 2 the Core went platinum? 😎
Hey thanks Anthony now I have cancer I’ll be invoicing you soon with my medical bills
8/10. Needs more Cal Chuchesta
My favourite bit of this album <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2116">35:16</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1206">20:06</a> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1212">20:12</a> the look on melon feldman&#39;s face to the camera (us) just like:<br><br>&quot;yep, you&#39;re really hearing this shit right now, yeah it&#39;s happening, just soak that shit in.&quot;
I still respect this album because it gave us 50 minutes of Melon man
Sounds like the very last stages of a sloppy Michael Jackson binge.  Grandpa skrillex.  I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve made better sounding extremely lazy music blends lol
“I’ll rip off your head and shit down your neck” Corey Feldman
<b>wEEeEEeEEeEEe</b> wERE toGETHaaa
Holy fuck this is an atrocity.
I like to think they are pushing him down into Hell as punishment.
every track on this album sounds like the tee up for a terrible terminator style pun about how I want to stop listening to this song...
This may be the best video on YouTube
hey thx for dressing up for the recording of your show!  where do u shop?  its hard to find” your grandmas naked torso designs inc”.. cause there soo popular.....
I put this on in the background while I do homework. The pure hatred is very calming to me.
this album sounds like me using all the special effects on my piano at the same time while all my friends sing in pig latin in weird voices
I wonder if Feldman ever regretted ever releasing that album, cause I do believe he made himself the laughing stock of the music world.<br><br>He should really stick to acting rather than doing both that and music.
Lol it sounds like death grips
need some of this goodness in my life rn
God damn...
I cant believe you gave this album a <b>7 OUT OF 10</b>
Lickedy splicktano
What he says @ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2461">41:01</a> is priceless!!!😂😂😂
This album should only be used to induce vomiting,better than Ipecac syrup.
My god, he is having a crisis!
I&#39;ve seen people in hot pepper challenge videos that look less in pain than you listening to this album.
the producer didn’t do any second takes and flew through it because he wanted it all to end as soon as possible
The negativity track is probably the best song on the album. That being said, its like being the skinniest kid at fucking morbid obesity camp.
This album took 10 years to make... just let that sink in.
His best review ever😂
Way better than death grips.
Jeez Anthony, I know you liked it, but I think calling it better than the entire discography of Animal Collective, Kendrick Lamar, Death Grips and Radiohead combined was a bit overboard.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=565">9:25</a> synth lead sounds similar to the hook for Swedish House Mafia&#39;s &#39;One&#39; (which features Pharrell on the vocal mix - it&#39;s funny because you &quot;don&#39;t know which &#39;one&#39;&quot; the track is ripping) that kind of booming hook was also featured in Chris Brown&#39;s Yeah x3. Aside from this strong Primal Scream, MJ and Kevin Rudolph influences. I really think he is attempting his best Lil Jon &#39;get crunkkkk&#39; with the growl. I also appreciate how he merges the theme from Shaft, the Adam West/Batman melodic motif and Charlie&#39;s Angles narration in the skits.
What&#39;s that? An Architecture and Morality OMD vinyl in the background? Pretty good taste, Melon.
Não sei nem o que eu estou fazendo aqui se eu não entendo quase nada 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The most accurate way to describe the album is &quot;Unironic shitpost&quot;
50 min review, damn. Melon: the movie
I&#39;m dead💀
Ok my review of this very musically controversial record by Corey Feldman himself in a nutshell, his vocals are pretty much a crossover from Jesus Jones to Per Gessle of Roxette 🤔 not sure what he was aiming for as far as style goes, to his credit there were a few semi decent tracks and by a few I mean maybe 3 songs total, I am a studio producer of 20 years experience and I have to say the mixing and mastering job on this album was nothing short of absolutely terrible, first of all, he has way too much going on all at once on almost all of his songs, you cant really even hear Snoop Dog on the song Go For It which might have been for the best lol, he would have done better to continue releasing music in much smaller doses like maybe one song at a time over a long period given We can only take his music in small doses, to his credit I always thought he was an amazing actor but he probably should have just stuck to acting, 🤔
I was about to say Fantano was being too harsh on this one but I got two tracks into the album and my cat threw up.
Holy fuck the song @ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2160">36:00</a>
Back for my weekly viewing
This is seriously a decent way to torture somebody on death row.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=715">11:55</a> hell Kendrick would even be on this album if you paid him enough
Corey&#39;s face on this cover seems like it&#39;s saying &quot;being alive after all this is the real hell&quot;
It might have been okay if Corey Feldman didn&#39;t sing
i can dab to every song on this album therefore 10/10
Here for my yearly viewing
Corey actually banned Fantano from going to any of his concerts after this review
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=677">11:17</a> <b>DO IT LICKITY SPLICKY</b>
Overrated
i LOVE this video and i LOVE you anthony, still proud of you (and partially myself) for making it through this album
UH-SEND-SEAN, MILL-ANNIE-UM!
Negativity actually sounds pretty good. At least better than anything else on this godforsaken album.
Grandpa<br>Skrillex
50 of the views are mine.
ur just a hater !!! go home gay melon man!! u don&#39;t respect t arty work!
How the fuck did you listen through this whole album?
The Corey Feldman review drinking game - take a shot every time Anthony cringes

I fall asleep to this review. And I mean it in the nicest way possible.<br> <br>edit: I also have nightmares afterwards, because of the songs this putrid album consists of.

Hello hello I am back again for my monthly view of this video.
COREY FELDMAN IS THE MOTHERFACKING BOMB!COREYFELDMAN BOMBSQUAD!
Cringing With Corey
He says &quot;internet&#39;s busiest music nerd&quot; like &quot; time to deliver a pizza ball&quot; at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=8">0:08</a>
He should bring our star to the moon and crush the earth just for hearing this album
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=461">7:41</a> reír para no llorar
Please review the new Paul McCartney songs
Nearly pissed myself😂😂
Are the synths ripped off of party rockers?
ABOUT MY NIECE
iffy got the licky splicky uhh
It broke his review format
Id rather be caught with drugs and expelled from school than listen to this album
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=824">13:44</a> pure disgust and frustration
2016 was a shit year too
Busy ga pi all he does is listen to music
about a quarter way through this review my nose started bleeding
This album is like Corey listened to Trout Mask Replica, heard that it&#39;s a legendary cult classic and slightly missed the point of why.<br><br>Just slightly.
&quot;Thinking about me NIECE??&quot; &quot;He&#39;s a concerned uncle&quot;. OMG
This unironically cured my cold
the new trout mask replica but bad...
Cory Decent actor but a terrible singer.
Despite the nastiness, I like the Charlie angles + Batman skit concept lol idc
Viper the Rapper is better
anthony you look like logic in this video
This album is like a modern Trout Mask Replica, if Captain Beefheart was really trying to write good music.
all this makes me think of if WRONG WAY. DOWN A ONE WAY STREEEHEEET.
The lyrics themselves of &quot;negativity&quot; are god awful stupid, but... I actually kinda like the song. It sounds like a more radio friendly version of Idiot Flesh (Pre Sleepytime Gorilla Museum) obviously Idiot Flesh have a lot more talent, but still. Despite my desire to not like it, i can&#39;t help liking its weirdness.
I really love Corey for his personality and brave spirit, but music industry probably is not his thing, I would go back to movies or theatre instead of him probably. His music reminded me of Faderhead a bit )
This is probably the greatest album of all time.
Reminds me of blood on the dance floor
This album is just a modern day trout mask replica
ok so this video is almost 2 years old and i decided to watch it thinking it was a normal review. but i got about 5 minutes in before i saw there were 50 minutes remaining. this is gold
This album is the musical equivalent of the movie Michael Scott made in The Office.
fantano&#39;s adlibs are better than the actual vocals
so much of this sounds like Neil Cicierega mashups
This video will never get old
Next album getting a 10/10
corey feldman is going to get a 10 on his next album like cudi
My dad&#39;s cover band opened for this band, and everybody liked my dad&#39;s band more than Corey Feldman.
Out of all of your other reviews, this is the one that I come back to every week. It just gets me through my bad times. Thanks Melon.
Wow Anthony, you were right, that was the worst song on the record
Guys, hear me out. Kid Cudi went from a 0 to a 10. Next Feldman album, guaranteed success with the melon!
I&#39;m really glad that River Phoenix never had to hear this.
why do all the people that make terribly good shit have long black hair (tommy wiseau... at least he fucking owns it though)
Corey i think you broke him
The best part of this review, is it&#39;s the first time melon has been rendered unable to even say anything about it, it defies explanation, it even defies critique in many ways. Corey Feldman has truly created a masterpiece here.
What if this was someones favorite album, and they were interested to see what their favorite melon had to say about it, only to see this?<br><br>Lives could be ruined by this video.
The first and only  -1 / 10
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=934">15:34</a> &quot;CHIM MIH MIN NA NA&quot;
lmao!!
2018 and I still come back.
It&#39;s eerily like what you get when a couple radio stations play at once. In a few parts it even sounds like static and it&#39;s so poorly mixed that it gives the effect of some parts being really loud, while others sound (unintentionally) barely audible.  The blatant rip-offs (some 3 or 4 layers at once) make the effect make my metaphor sound too accurate... i honestly can&#39;t believe what I&#39;m hearing. So we have to admit he accomplished his goal: He provided a totally unique listening experience (through his goulash of derivatives).
What makes me sad is that somewhere in the world, someone actually likes this album<br><br><br>EDIT: upon taking a quick look on iTunes, people have actually gave this album positive reviews. The human race is doomed.
🍿🍿🍿
So I live across the street from Corey and if I&#39;m having a shit day I sit on my balcony and listen to him rehearse. All my problems go away. Thank you Corey.
Let my catch my son downloading the entire angelic 2 the core album
Lmao!😂 all i have to say.
Feldman is like Michael Jackson without having talent beat into him.
Your hour long review of the album is better than the hour long album.
Delusional 2 the core
I just love watching his bad reviews lool
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1878">31:18</a> when Anthony Fantano accidentally becomes the best part of a Corey Feldman album.
ive watched this atleast 9 times already hope he makes another review like this asap this was hilarious
It&#39;s a Prince rip off. That&#39;s all it is, with shit skits. Guys, can we get Corey Feldman to a Psychiatrist please? This is just not okay.
wEEeeEEEeeeEEEeeEEee were together
Yoo you have a OmD 12&quot; AND THAT ALBUM IS FUCKING AMAZING TOO! Souvenir is on there i believe!
Everytime I get mad at one of Fantano&#39;s opinions, I go to this review and remind myself that he had to review this.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1959">32:39</a> the sound of goddesses
This honestly might be your best and most rewatchable review
This is basically Boarding House Reach though
its 2018 now and  lickety splicky is about to be a 6ix9ine bar
I feel like my ears are bleeding on listening to this album
Corey Feldmans &quot;singing&quot; voice makes him sound like a He-Man bad guy.
Corey made 582 accounts so far just to downvote this
Still has better vocal performances than Knife Man
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1273">21:13</a> melon&#39;s face with those messy ass horns
So... a 6/10, right?
I feel so sorry for Corey Feldman.
It&#39;s time i watch this again
The stars are only further from The Moon from earths perspective
I&#39;ve rewatched the nonchalant burp at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=884">14:44</a> so many fucking times...I can&#39;t stop. Help.
If you plug your earphones in, turn the volume up to full, put the earphones in side an empty baked beans can, sit it in your kitchen sink and listen to it from the dining room it kinda sounds pretty good. 10/10
This video deseved 1M+ views. It is truly a work of art.<br><br>...<br><br>LICKADEEE SPLICKEDYYYY
I wasn&#39;t expecting much from this cd. However I was actually surprised that it was not bad. It reminded me of the old school rap music when they would mix a lot of sound effects and skits. Snoop dogg is on it along with others. Pretty good all in all and it&#39;s something different.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=742">12:22</a><br>Eating out your girl like..
Insanely late on this but the singing in the first song sounds like the oompa loompas in tim burton’s willy wonka reboot
Smoking meth while listening to this makes it so much better...
Corey Feldman Hospitalized After Getting Stabbed in the Stomach 3/28/2018
This has 22 tracks. So does madvillainy. Coincidence?
your review of this album helped me feel okay with my beliefs
The Weeknd actually takes a lot of artistic direction and inspiration from Feldman&#39;s works.
To be honest, i&#39;d give this album a 1/10 for the sole reason that it&#39;s hilarious. hilariously bad.
I&#39;m so proud to see that this video has breached 1 million views. It&#39;s been a big part of my life since it was published.
I actually listened to all 50 minutes
MILLIONTH VIEW HOLY SHIT
Man, SFU ain’t got shit on this
Try not to cringe challenge
literally the 10th time I am watching this in its full length
They all sound like kids show theme songs.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1997">33:17</a> I just got a venerial deseise
i almost just choked on my burrito this is so funny

BTW, how come he can play the music from this album in his video?
Here before 1 million views
You can feel the Cal Chuchesta influences
This is still one of the funniest videos on Youtube.
YOU GIVE THIS A 0/10 BUT DAMN GETS A 7 WTF
no bullshit...this may be the best review of ANYTHING on the internet EVER.
This is a legendary review
Honestly this album is not too far away from today&#39;s big selling  pop music and everyone should be worried about it...
1000 years from now this album will finally be recognized as the masterpiece it is
Its amazing to see how we’ve progressed since this. Peep is dead, Post Malone’s new album got a 7, Melon man lost his memes.
And this is track 12 😂😂
HOLY SHIT 50 MINUTES
When I grow up I want to be a Corey&#39;s Angel
Melon tryna hit a million
It&#39;s a fucky Lil Cut ✂️ is right lol.... This has absolutely wrecked his brain... Poor Mr. Fantano smh 😢
No way it&#39;s worse than Nickleback
This is literally the Pinkerton of modern times. In a couple of years it will be acknowledged as an amazing confessional about cory&#39;s mental state.
How much of this album do you fine folks think has to do with Corey&#39;s abuse suffered as a child by the &quot;elite&quot; in Hollywood? Not that I necessarily believe all the things he says about it but he seems pretty convicted
Show those fucking tats fayntayno
This review came out on my birthday.
I’m giving this a strong WHYYYY?!?!!?
<b>LADI DADI DA SLOB ON ME KNOB</b>
Dude....I love you.  This is up there with Macho Man Randy Savage’s rap album (I dare you to listen to the Hulk Hogan call out “Be a Man” and not laugh your sac off).

The review that broke the melon
lowkey 🔥
I can’t believe this is near one whole hour 😂😂😂
The intrnayd. Busied music nerd
do worst to best for em
Progressive pop at it&#39;s finest
first time an album actually made me physically sick just listening to it
So I need some YouTube help, on one of fantanos livestreams a comparison to this album was made to another satin if Corey Feldman was good it would sound like this, what album was that please God somebody help me. For fucks sake PLEASE help me.
This album and it&#39;s participants reads like the panel of the Gong Show.  Washed up celebrity celebration at its finest!
If you aren&#39;t gonna watch the whole vid, please just skip to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2119">35:19</a> and make it worth your while
I almost forgot to watch this today
Music’s answer to the Room
I am so disgusted right now hahahaha. I am literally having flashbacks to when i was sexually assaulted by an old man as a kid, this album really does make you have suicidal thoughts hahaha
If you look Angelic 2 the core up on youtube this fantano shithead is the first thing that pops up. It&#39;s actually an album myself and many others thoroughly enjoy and appreciate. I&#39;d hate for this over the top and short sighted video here to be many people&#39;s first impression. Listen to the album with an open head, if you don&#39;t like it that&#39;s ok too but give it a chance. Goodbye Needleturd i&#39;m gonna watch vinyl rewind or some other dumb shit in my freetime instead.
To pimp a butterfly was in the suggested videos while watching this
Whythony Godtano
50 minutes crying in front of the camera XDDDDD
Hot Fucking Garbage!!! You can see the sadness in Fanny&#39;s eye.
After listening to some tracks on this album, i was sore and tired. I felt sick, clinging on to my life by a string... I was dying... Until I went to Spotify, to listen to Speeding Bullet 2 Heaven. I was cured. I had forgotten what music sounded like... And hearing Kid Cudi orgasmically moan over a guitar... It was certainly music. And it sounded like a hell of a great album after being crushed by this.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1642">27:22</a> new nine inch nails is sounding good tho
I had the displeasure of listening to this entire album. <br><br>I nearly died. <br><br><br>It&#39;s just that bad.
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Angelic 2 the Core. The genius of it is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of music theory most of the subtleties will go over a typical listener&#39;s head. There’s also the dualism of good and evil, which is deftly woven into the album&#39;s concept- the inspiration is heavily drawn from Nietzsche literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these subtleties, to realise that they’re not just brilliant- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Angelic 2 the Core truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the depth in Corey&#39;s lyrics like “Be the best that you can be,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Sun Tzu&#39;s Chinese classic The Art of War. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Fred Durst&#39;s bars unfold themselves on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them.
Donatello needs to RELAX!!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=884">14:44</a> perfect timing!
He recorded it 06-2016 so it took 10 years to make this
The synth lead from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=540">9:00</a> ish is from the party rock anthem lolol
Corey Feldman&#39;s music sounds like something a cartoon parody of a popstar would sing
Fantano worst tattoos of ALL TIME
Even in the 80&#39;s this album would&#39;ve been terrible
This album is giving me a headache
corey never got the memo, that a little kid impersonating Michael Jackson, can be endearing, however, a nearly 50 year old white man, doing it, is just sad and creepy.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2169">36:09</a> those are NOT the words to Pete Seeger and Lee Hayes&#39;s immortal &quot;If I Had a Hammer&quot;, sir!

Antony is so right about it accidentally sounding like post punk I shit you not the vocals on this album sounds like Micro-phonies by Cabaret Voltaire
This is the greatest comment section I have read in my entire life
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=781">13:01</a><br>My favorite moment in this review
The song at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2040">34:00</a> lol the intro is like a really bad version of Table top Joe by Tom Waits
Just realized Snoop Dogg is basically the Nicholas Cage of music.  They both started out excellent in their fields but then apparently forgot how to just say no.<br><br>Also, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1878">31:18</a> a rare Boythony Bandtano appears!

Melon made a 50 minute album bashing a rape victim wow
may very well be the worst album ever.
Can you make an ASMR version of this please Anthony? Thanks
Omg that jazzy song is BRUTAL.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1995">33:15</a> for the most hilarious attempt at... something.
I came here for the weird music, but I stayed for the funny faces.
This rendition of Working Class Hero sounds like it was performed Cartman in a South Park joke.
Worse than Fitz and the Tantrums?
Corethany Feldtano
Sorry gimme 5 minutes and I&#39;ll be back, I just need to pause this review and listen to something else cause I can&#39;t take anymore of Corey Feldman music. BRB
Delusional 2 The Core
Is fantano sitting or standing?
100 Feldman read this review.
I hope there are more albums like this so I can see melon go progressively more and more insane
This album is funny.
Revisiting this review. It’s like a  needle drop comedy special :D
RIP LIL’ Peep 👀
This album groomed me.
When the worst song was playing, I was outside and the geese were singing along. I know because when Anthony changed songs, they stopped.
Negativity CAN be positive. This video made me much happier than it should have.
Speaking of Corey Feldman, he is now claiming he was stabbed by a knife that contained an untraceable poison, and that he only has 2 months to live.
how can you live with yourself. you got this man stabbed
Corey was stabbed recently, Melon? Care to admit your murder attempt?
Funny thing is Corey is doing better than this guy and will see more money than this guy will see
Shout out if you got homies who would listen to this
Corey Feldman gets a Not Good and then a year and a half later he gets stabbed, coincidence?
Honestly, a handful of the musical arrangements on this album aren’t even all that bad. It’s just that they’re mixed and mastered so horribly that half the time you can barely tell what’s going on. Like, they had some decent ideas here and there, but they completely squandered even that minuscule potential.<br>And, you know, Corey Feldman’s gross, phlegmmy vocals are on all of it.
I keep checking my speakers to see if my something came unplugged. Everything sounds so wrong and flat.
Corey Feldman is someone’s favorite artist.
This asshole stole Miles Davis&#39;s On the corner guitar wah strum????
that&#39;s a scary fucking laugh you got there
NARRRHHH DA DA DA DAAA HMMMMM BUM BA DA DOOP LAUW DOO DOO<br><br>HMMMM BA BAD DA DA DA<br><br>BOO DOO DOO DOO
Can someone add some subtitles for the album. I can’t understand a word of it.
I&#39;m confused. He knows the lyrics...suggesting...he actually looked them up...noooooo
21/03/2018, Corey Feldman&#39;s montly listeners on Spotify: 2,600          poor people
&quot;think of a number in your head, how much you would need to be paid to make an appearance on this song&quot;<br>How to Count Past Infinity
I showed a Corey Feldman song to my mom, thinking it would make her laugh. Instead, she said it &quot;wasn&#39;t that bad&quot; and said that she&#39;s heard me play worse music. When I asked her what music I listen to that could possibly be worse, she said Joy Division. I&#39;m in shock. How can anyone think like this?
i went and listened to a couple songs, it really is indescribably bad. it literally sounds like something made as a parody.
was listening to this while i was doing an english project and i damn near didnt finish

Dear god, how one of the legendary Frog brothers has fallen<br>As a major Lost Boys fans....this has left me scarred
At that point in the album, I&#39;m pretty sure saying &quot;go for it&quot; could be considered as provoking listeners to go and off themselves.
I get this album was bad but he&#39;s gone through some seriously awful stuff in his life.
it would’ve been like okay on an archived back alley blogspot page in the early 00s
WHAT&#39;S THE RATING
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2368">39:28</a><br>Deep Purple  - Highway Star
And so began my requesting of ‘we wanted change by Corey Feldman’ at every party I subsequently went to
This was such a great album and i am so happy for him he will be the new artist to do the Superbowl this year grats Corey you deserve it.
I watched this while i was sick<br>I ended up vomiting<br>Im suing u fat boi
Is it better than Merzbow’s Pulse Demon?
Synth lead at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=562">9:22</a> was directly ripped off from party rock anthem even tho that song was popular in 2012
Peak melon
The saxophone at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1284">21:24</a> sounds really nauseous and then at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1314">21:54</a> sounds like it&#39;s throwing up a lot. I don&#39;t think it wanted to be involved in this abomination...er, album.
I would rather be ear raped with an ice pick than hear this puddle of AIDS again . Crib death is more likeable than this
I put this on in the background while I work or do homework. The pure hatred is very calming to me.
that sound you made at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1600">26:40</a> is a more valid musical statement than the song<br><br><b>hhhrrruuck</b>
pause @ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=970">16:10</a> for sacred image.
I’ve always wondered what he’d think of Philosophy Of The World by The Shaggs
Holy shit I just realized this video is 50 min long
When I first heard this album, I just assumed it was a cry for help, and the final manifestation of the abuse he&#39;d suffered at the hands of Jackson.
Are these the lost Lil Peep tracks?
Do a cringing with Corey on one of his music videos!
Please tell me someone else has visited the website that is named after the album. Fucking please I need to vent with someone
That Jim Halpert look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2057">34:17</a>
This album maybe would passed for ok in the 90s or 80s
best anthony waifu material there is
Woah I just saw this review for the first time. This album has to be a joke right? Right? Please be a joke
Sounds like Primus
I guess you could say Corey had a little Michael in him.
This is a horrible review because of This Horrible,horrid, disgusting album
This is one of the best videos on the internet. Period.
Soooooo... like a light to decent six on this thing?
This is one of the greatest album reviews on the internet.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=925">15:25</a> me plAying hArmonicA with my nose
The face he makes at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1486">24:46</a>
You poor man. You have my complete and total empathy in regards to listening to this. A friend of mine bought me this as a gift. He told me that I had to listen to it and see if I could get all the way through it. I could not get through a single song. <br>I am a musician, I am a songwriter and I am a singer but my god sir, Corey Feldman is not any of those things. ( Though if this was meant as a comedy album good lord he succeeded in spades. ) I liked your review and subscribed. Mind you, I may revisit this review many times because it is hilarious. <br>Take care.<br>Tony
This album sounds like someone hearing mindless self indulgence once and thinking “what if I tried that” while completely ignoring the fact that msi is an ironic self-deprecating project and totally playing it straight instead with 0 self awareness
Track 13 sounds like an intentionally shitty song that Randy would perform in a South Park episode. I don’t know, it’s hard to find the eight words.
22 songs and only 90 minutes? Were they produced by AxCx?
I went to the concert, and half of the people left before the third song
It is hard to watch you break in this way, Badthony Daytano.
feel so sorry for the musicians and the ex-strippers on the record that needed the money this bad:(
Brokethany Fantanooooooooo
Corey feldman is michael jackson as 3pac is 2pac
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1375">22:55</a> that sounds like a dying animal
Corey Feldman needs to score a Tommy Wiseau film. Or Wiseau should shoot a film clip for Feldman.
Lickinthy Splintano
For personal reference:<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=441">7:21</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2112">35:12</a>
This album suddenly becomes a masterpiece if you&#39;re high af
New shirt plz
Legendary review Mr.Fantano
I’m forcing myself to listen to the album all the way through because just skipping around this video is cracking me up
I bet he&#39;s NEVER had ONE single lesson in song<br>Or he would know how NOT 2ruin his OWN voice LOL✨
To correct the description, these are not opinions. These are facts. Reupload and fix this please.
yo I think I like ascension
This album is like if extraterrestrials were stuck in orbit around earth and in an attempt to block them from spying on us we jammed them up by only allowing them to get TRL from late 90s MTV. THEN, to mock us they made this album as their impression of what they heard.
By far your most entertaining video
Damn that sukt
I&#39;ve watched this at least 30+ times.<br>It&#39;s one of my favorite things ever.
You ruined this album from becoming a meme
“How is this legal? How is this allowed? How is this okay?........Like........Shouldn’t someone be in prison? Shouldn’t someone be in jail!?” <br><br>Hmmmm. Unfortunately, no. You see, Mr. Feldman is working for DARPA creating the next weapon of mass destruction. This is his masterpiece.
BOUT MAH NIECE
It&#39;s like The Room of music
&quot;Angelic 2 the Core is the fifth studio album by American actor/singer Corey Feldman, released on June 22, 2016.[1] Feldman asked fans to help raise $105,000 to fund the album through Indiegogo,[2] but only went on to raise $14,982&quot;  Thanks Wikipedia. I don&#39;t know which shocks me more, that it&#39;s his fifth album or the fact he thought he&#39;d raise $105K for it
This is one of the greatest videos of all time.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1530">25:30</a> I️ mean, there is only so much one can stay in the presence of Corey without feeling incredibly depressed
COREY FELDMAN :<br>THE PRIMADONNA ALBUM .
THIS DOUBLE ALBUM WENT TRIPLE DOG SHIT .
Slam an entire vegan smoothie every time he laughs.
I like the Ascension song. Kill me.
I love how melon couldn&#39;t have even been fucked to get dressed lol
yay! music finally has a best of the worst!!
This album was created by the CIA for torture
i don&#39;t know what the fuck you mean this is clearly the best album of 2016, best album of the decade, litteraly the best thing in the world
I feel like Anthony is telling me my parents are getting divorced
&quot;Up there with chinese water torture&quot; 😂😂😂😂🤣😂🤣😂
Very funny review, dude! 😀😄
50 minutes fuck
I&#39;ve watched this video far too much for a normal person
Brah you need to start with crossfit.
Does anyone know that album with the primary colors in the background?
The today show performance is just incredible. The most geniune laugh ive had in a long time.
Corey Feldman probably watched this whole thing
HEY! Stupid head! Me and my friend really like this album he is a god!!! 😤😡🤬
&#39;White and Nerdy&#39;. <br>Insipid electrobop
All i want is a remade version of this album by someone who knows what theyre doing and with someone who can actually sing
Could you maybe show less wife beater chest when you do a review?
It literally has shit flute in it
this album is a total fantomas rip off......but sadly corey is no mike patton.
wow.
Huh didn’t know linkin Park released a new album
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1070">17:50</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1080">18:00</a> Cory Sound like a washed up, semi dead Lil Peep
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1182">19:42</a> I&#39;d need to be paid $1.3 million to be on this bad song
Damn, you sure talk about Lil Peep a lot. Even in a Corey Feldman album review. Get over it.
I&#39;m actually almost gagging at how bad this is, nice
The track Volcano from Swans&#39;s Soundtracks For The Blind would be right at home here.
Fun drinking game:<br>Every time melon man says “Um” take a shot.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1959">32:39</a>
This is still to this day one of the funniest videos you&#39;ve made melon
I come back to this review when I need a nice pick-me-up.
What was the worst album of 2017??!
As a musician, I watch this review every time I become concerned that I don&#39;t have what it takes to write a good song that people like, and every time I hear this album, I remember that at least I can&#39;t be this fucking bad.
I&#39;m glad that this was your favorite album of 1935, this is my favorite Styx album by far.
this sounds like the intentionally bad GarageBand music my friend makes on his soundcloud
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2153">35:53</a> this is a good gif XD
Greatest...music....review......EVER.
This album is &quot;The Room&quot; of the music world
Thinking about my niece! (Bout my niece)
Still better than DAMN.
JAM ON HEE HEE
P.S THE WRONG COREY DIED!!! R.I.P HAIM 🤘💊🍻⚰🔥
it&#39;s music for meme&#39;s
im imagining corey feldman silently watching all 50 minutes of this video
Still got the best teeth in the game
I never thought I&#39;d hear a pop/nu metal/funk song with a Michael Jackson wanna be singing over it.. That negativity song was the worst of all those things mixed together.. Corey Feldman deserves some type of award for this.. Its epically bad lol
he didn’t even bother to use the green screen
I wanna make <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1959">32:39</a> my ringtone
This right here folks is how a man goes insane
I&#39;ve had such a great time with all his shit, I feel like I owe him some cash
Somewhere, there are people that produced and mastered this album, we must find and slay them in order to bring peace to this timeline.
damn, anthony has some bravery playing this shit out loud. i wouldn&#39;t want anyone on earth knowing i&#39;ve heard this<br><br>edit: nvm i aint no bitch
corey feldman is so offbeat i don&#39;t even know if there&#39;s such a thing as &quot;on beat&quot; here
This is my favorite torture porn
I feel it&#39;s appropriate that I happen to be hearing this album while taking a particularly lengthy piss.
This video eminates pure hatred. I love it.
Your laugh is just sooooo contagious 😂😂😂😂
rough
One of the better vids on youtube
<b>Lickity Splickity</b>
This album sounds like a parody of 80s songs
It takes me 5 minutes to watch this because you can skip to any point and it&#39;s hilarious.
I low-key like Corey Feldman music when I&#39;m high af cause of how legitimately insane he is. He&#39;s so off the mark it&#39;s legitamitely enjoyable.
To stay hip with the young crowd, his next album will be in the style of crack-slingin&#39; dope-boy rap:<br><br>&quot;...And Sell it to the Whore&quot;
Get ready 2018 <br>Angelic 2 the core (angelic idm-elic/angelic new wave-elic)2: electric boogaloo<br><br>Featuring genres that will satisfy Anthony Fantano
Corey Feldman: Best to Bestest
&quot;Kinda lookin like grandpa skrillex here&quot;
I dont think you understand melon, this album is clearly meant to be played backwards
This my favorite album how dare you lousy 6 out of 10 fuck nugget
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1995">33:15</a> i laughed so hard so suddenly that it was actually painful
This album is The Room of albums
&quot;that white iverson song, from a rapper who shall remain nameless&quot; oh melon
I was thinking this is really bad, but probably not quite the worst album ever, then I got to around 33.00.
I would pay a ton of money to see a making of documentary of this record
More snaps and headbobs please, this needs a little Emperor.. &#39;&#39;I wanna be now.. <b>record skip</b> Uuuuuuugh, I am themmmm!&#39;&#39; I like his incubus record symphonics <b>wickee wooo wiki wiki whooooo!</b>
Go 4 it!!
This review helps me go to sleep
I had to rewind the Fred Durst feature about fifty times
I feel mentally stronger as a person after having suffered through this album for fantano&#39;s sake
this is the “the room” of music
BRING THE STARS UP TO THE MOON
This shit sounds like something off of Yo Gabba Gabba
<b>L I C K E T Y  S P L I C K Y</b>
worst album of all time
you killed lil peep
for my love sounds like it was made in garage band
His vocals sound way better than Corey&#39;s when singing the lyrics
i heard Axl Rose helped with the production and some of the lyrics
This is hands down the best video you’ve ever made
If u want extra entertainment look up the Amazon reviews for this album, they made my night.
To mask the pain this music causes my soul I just look at Anthony&#39;s facial expressions and laugh to keep down my vomit
This album is making my acid reflux worse...
Did you listen to it backwards?
&quot;Right up there with Chinese water torture&quot; Oh my, that is quite horrible...
This album&#39;s genre is listed as &quot;Outsider Music&quot; on Wikipedia, even though it actually had professional recording and Snoop Dogg on it. Oh, and it took ten years to record.<br><br>I&#39;m not kidding. 2006 - 2016
Ooooooooh &quot;Architecture and Morality&quot;! That&#39;s really nice! Didn&#39;t expect to see that one here
Looking for a new one of these this year mate
To his credit, he doesn&#39;t seem to use a lot of auto-tune on this record.
Dude, Corey Feldman inadvertently created a new genre: Accidental Punk. Nice!
the part with him and Fred Durst atonally yelping together might just be the funniest thing I&#39;ve ever heard. It&#39;s so awful in the best way possible.
This album triggered our beloved Melon, that&#39;s how you know this is utter shit.
I&#39;m back in 2017 and this review is still the greatest thing to ever be on YouTube
Love how you just put the album on the screen, and you didn&#39;t fit it in the green screen xD
The album is a crime against humanity.

James Franco stars as Corey Feldman in The Disaster Artist 2
Best album ever released to mankind!! Definitely timeless! It&#39;s way ahead of it&#39;s time!!
whenever I doubt my ability to create music...I just watch this and think &quot;Okay you are actually pretty tight&quot; lol
The lovechild of Skrillex and Michael Jackson
Nigga sound like DoodleBob
<b>WeEeEeEeEeEeE were together</b>
if i wanna have a laugh i come back to this album and it does the job impressively well<br>i kinda like it now for having listened to it soooo much, hahaha :)
rip lil peep
&quot;I gotta power through &quot;...lol
Only someone out of their mind would be proud to admit that it took them like a decade to finish this project. How the fuck do you say that and feel proud????
The comments on here are the best! Lol This video is gold to me and when I&#39;m feeling down I know I can come back here and watch this for a great laugh! Poor Ol Corey surrounded by yes men! 😂
I come back to this every few months for a quick pick me up
Corey Feldman needs to get his own Dance Dance Revolution soundtrack.
Worst album.. best review
Next time I want to see him shirtless
Boy, this was a really edgy take. Going after a beloved and respected musical group like Corey Feldman and his Angels? What a hard target. I can see you aren&#39;t afraid of controversy.
LMFAO…!!!!
I swear to melon I&#39;m buying this on vinyl
Because he&#39;s bad, he&#39;s bad, shum-on.
Anthony, this was spot on &amp; hilarious!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1997">33:17</a> sounds like the cluckin bell commercial from gta
Angsty white-boy broken psy-quality garbage rap from the 2000s come back from the dead
the artist is a bit cringe but some of the instrumentals were slappin&#39;
when listening to cory Feldman, close your eyes and imagine grover from sesame street singing...it will make you laugh.
The first and only time I have seen complete unanimity in Antoine Fantoine&#39;s comment section.
you know you got the worst album ever when fantano makes a whole 50 minute video on it without a fucking transition
The Tommy Wiseau of music
There&#39;s a song thats been on the top 40 lately that reminds me of this album so I came back to rewatch this because I couldn&#39;t actually listen to the full thing by myself
Top ten worst albums of 2016--1-10 Angelic 2 the Core.
2017 guys Coorey Feldman actually needs help he spent to much time as a child star in hollywood
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2124">35:24</a><br><br>commenting so I can sample that later lol
RIP LIL PEEP
Anthony looks like he&#39;s in pain by the end of this.
Where&#39;s a ty Lopez ad when you need it
Wait you forgot all mainstream music is trash.
Every time Antwon says &quot;This is the worst song on the record&quot; I know what song it is, but I am always surprised at how bad it is.
Corey is to music like Trump is to the presidency. Since Trump won everyone thinks they should &amp; can do what they want.
This is the worst album in music history but has the greatest review in music review history.<br><br>PS. I would like to send a sincere apology to all the music on today’s radio for the bashing &amp; cursing I’ve blown at you. This is proof that you could never be on Corey’s low level of bad.
Back in it for possibly my 20th viewing of this video.
I think I&#39;d rather die than listen to this.
Sawmill Joe is a great rockabilly foke artist who&#39;s made lots of great music yet has never been able to get a physical release of his albums in a world where I can get album cds of puke sound effects being sold as music on Amazon just because a brate celebrity wanted to pretend he was a real artist at everyone elses expense WHAT THE FRICK?! is wrong with this world :&#39;(
this album is too painful for me to watch anymore right now I must cleanse my ears with good music before it&#39;s too late and I lose them forever
Still a classic
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1956">32:36</a>
Rip Lil Peep
Corey is the Charles Manson of murder
&quot;94:41&quot;
Corey Feldman <br>1) Stop Singing<br>2) Stop Dancing <br>3) Stop trying to be a con artist and get your hands dirty by getting a real job like the rest of the world.<br>4) Stfu about Corey Haim. He was and always will be BETTER than you. Nothing can change that, not even your pathetic book.
After listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1590">26:30</a> I refuse to believe this album was made without malicious intent
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=234">3:54</a> needs to be my notification sound
I can see where Anthony is coming from. I listened to some of the album and it is indeed impossible to create any words that can explain what it sounds like.
Probably the best music review I’ve ever seen
I watch this video from time to time. I never get tired of this video. This is the best video. Nice
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1443">24:03</a> all i can think is of Filthy Frank singing the Flintstones theme in the Born in the wrong generation video
Don&#39;t give Corey hate he&#39;s a hurt boy x
This is the cringiest album of all time it sounds like a bunch of South Park parody songs
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2440">40:40</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1980">33:00</a>
God I love you
what even am I listening to
Delusional, that&#39;s the only thing I can think is wrong with him.
holy shit too fuckin funny at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=880">14:40</a> !!! Fuckin lost my shit when your digestive system started rebelling against what your ears are bombarding it with!! Your ears crossed the line with your gut bro LMAO
Someone should make a gif out of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1065">17:45</a> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1076">17:56</a>
Corey Feldman is the Tommy Wiseau of music.
This album is AMAZING if you take mushrooms before it.
Releasing an album of just pure silence is better than this
Give it 10 stars cause of the Hollywood sex scandal.
I lost a bet, and the loser had to listen to 3 Feldman songs. It was the hardest thing I&#39;ve ever had to do, and I design rockets and work in chemical propulsion.
i like the omd record in background. my fav band besides echo and the bunnymen and the fixx. echo is best band ever.
when the youtube gods force u to make a vid
Someone should deliver a copy of this album on vinyl to Anthony&#39;s doorstep
GOD THIS ALBUM REEKS OF DEATH
Give the guy a break, I&#39;ve heard worse! At least Corey is doing what he enjoys most &amp; that is singing,and that&#39;s My opinion! I love Corey! I respect your opinion now I gave you mine.Have a great day sir.
this is such a masterpiece hahaha
the guitar intro on Negativity was SOOOOOOOO off tempo
btw anthony, are you looking forward to the new tool album?
This review almost made me shit myself laughing!
It&#39;s far better than the Stinkin&#39; Park in a more recent review. Not much but...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1125">18:45</a> LOL
Whenever he says, &quot;It&#39;s so <i>____</i> , it&#39;s almost ______&quot; drink.
The worst thing I heard on this video was you belching.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=883">14:43</a>
He&#39;s trying so hard to channel Michael Jackson and failing spectacularly. I feel sorry for him. He totally lacks any self awareness which is sad.
Does anyone else say, &quot;Hey Ant.&quot; When Fantangimionio says, &quot;Hey everyone?&quot;
Dont kick a guy when hes down.
How can we ever be sure this is not just an elaborate prank
a postmodern masterpiece10/10
This album is as bad as your style.  Nuff&#39; said.
But what rating did it get?
This is like the exact opposite of Trout Mask Replica
I wonder what the producer was thinking through the recording of the album...
I really want to watch this, but the tank top....
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2113">35:13</a> XIU XIU!!
Corey Feldman found the brown note.
The synth from the second track is ripped off from &quot;Turn up the music&quot; by Chris Brown
not so funny after his truth campaign video
This is the dude who said he was raped as a child in Hollywood
I cant believe I watched this entire video about the worst album possibly ever made.  I laughed so hard I had tears streaming in my eyes (please dont tell Cory Feldman because he will turn it into another album)  Oh Lord you are a funny funny man.  You turned the most repulsive exercise in delusional narcissism into a hilarious comedy.  I can see this as a movie...this untalented twit  makes this hideous album and a you tube critic videographer turns it into a smash hit breaking all prior sales over The beatles, Michael Jackson...no Corey Feldman is the all time blockbuster...But, when the critic, You, hear that you are responsible for making Corey a star and thus prolonging the agony of him making more albums, you refuse to ever mention Cory again, let alone  review his latest crap which truth be told exceeds his first album in utter revulsion and  lack of any cohesion at all thus making the first album seem like the work of a genius in comparison....So in the movie the mega rich and  successful Cory Feldman desperately needs your scathing reviews or else his career will collapse.  So he tries to wine and dine you, he offers you the services of his angels...he offers you large sums of money...he is relentless but you stubbornly refuse to help his career feeling guilty over the fact that every where anyone goes people are humming his songs, they play in elevators, doctors offices, the grocery stores...you cant escape this travesty that you contributed  to the music mayhem  by helping him  to become an overnight success (albeit unwillingly)) so you leave the country and Corey follows you....Finally the two of you are thrown in a Turkish prison for smoking weed and you get him to promise that when you guys get out he will never sing another note again.   Finally you both escape the prison and the country...and guess what...Corey makes another album....called (Aint no Sunshine in Hell)...like all his albums it is a rag tag assortment  of hip hop, blues, jazz, pop and even some Opera Orias thrown in for bad measure...In the end you are seen spining a gun  around and around on a table...a woman in the background says, &quot;Anthoney stop acting like this...so Feldman made another album!&quot;   Finally after many tries the gun stops spinning and points directly at you...You take the gun and we hear it explode as the credits roll.   Then we see you girlfriend blowing up another balloon and it pops.  You put the gun down (its a kids toy) you grab the dogs leash, put it on the dog and you walk out of the house  humming one of Cory Feldmans hideous sons from his new album...Aint no Sunshine in Hell... FADE TO BLACK
Do you believe he claims it took kim 10 years to make this piece of crap!I don`t know how anyone could even listen to it all.
&#39;The Room&#39; of the music industry.
This CD is the &quot;humiliation<br>ritual&quot; Corey has to go through. Next, he will be up for an Oscar. Lickety splicky. OMG this entire CD is total shit. Just SHIT! Dammit i cant take IT!!!
Craptacular, what a shit review of a shit album!
“Let go let go let go” ....I don’t hate it. I feel dirty &amp; ashamed. 🤦🏼‍♀️
Please stop cursing God. It makes you lose all credibility.
This is the the White Album of our times.
NEEDLEDICK
FUCK WETHER HIS ALBUM IS GOOD OR SUCKS!!!! Corey knows every fucking thing about corruption in the industry!! BET ON THAT!!! He could blow the lid on more industry big wigs than Weinstein!!!! His desire probably has been to make music so they shut him up by allowing him to make his music and to even promote it!!!! Think about that shit!!!!
Hun, I think you just do not have a taste for Music that is different ... for instance Die Antwoord is an amazing band who&#39;s from South Africa... and since your just a white man from America you&#39;ve been conditioned to hate things not to your &quot;norm&quot; (not your fault) Corey was good friends with MJ who was an angel. You have to go down the rabbit hole to understand the encoded messages ... open your mind... 432 HZ sound frequencies is where its at...
i will never get sick of this video.
shaun king? Is that you? black and gay..wow
looking at you and listening to Feldman&#39;s music go nicely together..you look like this sounds.....oooooffffffft
Do you hear and see a little Ozzy in his opus hehehehe geez...Dubstep Ozzy-esque...too deep for you and me...we&#39;re missing the whole point...hahahahaaaaa
Just watched the dance that goes with his&quot; popular &quot;track off this ablbum. Hysterical. He may have been goofing on us - I don&#39;t believe that was for real. What is your idea of good music? Little Feat was a pretty great band...when I was an &#39;angsty youth&quot; (we really weren&#39;t angsty...we were too cool for that shite).
How many know to what &quot;the needle drop&quot; refers? :D Thank you God, for allowing me to live thru the 60&#39;s, 70&#39;s And even 80&#39;s music...and scratchy albums. :D Hey - I like Skrillex! haha
Good news! Now he wants 10 million to make more of this Shit!<br>Oh no I`m sorry, he wants to &quot;expose pedophiles&quot;. Thats why he needs 10 million dollars. To say names.<br> . I`m sure he was abused and that tottaly fucked him up<br> but he realy knows how to MILK that
l&#39;m not into this music ....but your attitude, incessant cackling,  and goofy expressions,  make it worse dude.
BTW, I can&#39;t stand it either, but who gives a shit. OH, you apparently. 50 mins and 53 seconds worth of a shit. Fuck off.
Wow, melon. Making fun of child sex-abuse victims for almost an hour? Really?
Ooooh shit feldman didn&#39;t even have a hand at all in writing the first single. Someone called Selin Stone wrote go for it 3 years ago
Snoop just needed to appear on something worse than the snoop lion album so that&#39;s not his official worst effort anymore
He doesn&#39;t know if he wants to be MJ or Dave Mustaine
Check out &#39;Another Place, Another Time&#39; from synth rock robot band &quot;the Rockets&quot; to hear what corey was going for in ascension millenium
Taking a long lunch break after listening to disk 1. Will have to take a few deep breaths (of mind numbing chemical inhalants) before plunging into disk 2
Its not bad.maroon 5 is tops when it comes to fucked up music.

but srsly this makes me so happy that this is the lowest that hollywood can throw at us, now i&#39;ll always compare my output to this like a musical litmus test. i don&#39;t think i&#39;m afraid of uploading my tracks anymore so thankx fantano for suffering for our amusement and edumacation!
molested/10
This makes me forgive Anthony for shooting up that college in Oregon.
how did i miss this video?
Track 12 sounds like 2 songs playing at the same time. Oh what a mess. It&#39;s like one of the horrible people from American Idol recorded their own album. Lmfao.😂
TAKE EVERYTHING REACH ROCK ROLL REACH ROCK ROLL PASS THROUGH SILENT PUT SHINY BEZOARS FRESH IN THE POT FOR SALE
This dude had me hysterical lol definitely going to see more of his vids
I had a good laugh with you during this album review so I had to check discogs to see who would produce this NOBODY he did it all thanks for the laughs Anthony <br>   Written By, Arranged By, Producer, Composed By, Recorded By, Piano, Rhythm Guitar, Bass, Drums, Lead Vocals, Backing Vocals, Mixed By – Corey Feldman
Notice at around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=675">11:15</a> that the porno guitar playing through the whole skit is literally just a song ripped right off of a Pornosonic album.<br>I do mean literally.
I won&#39;t buy this album unless it has ninjas...
I think I pulled a muscle in my back cringing at some of those sounds.
this album is bascially when an autistic kid discovers the sound effects on a school keyboard
This is the most amazing review of a record we&#39;ve ever heard/seen. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23relatable">#Relatable</a>
Check out the Oakridge Boys. They&#39;re terrible
maybe the reason that Corey Feldman’s Angelic 2 The Core is so bad is because his fans only raised $14,982 of the $105,000 that he wanted to invest into it.<br>HOWEVER, this album would still probably be CRAP even if he raised twice that amount of money. so, yeah.
I&#39;ve listened to it for about 10 minutes and it&#39;s like a sort of harddrugs to me. This shit makes me laugh so uncontrollably hard I&#39;m running out of dopamine.
this album is RAW.<br>kidding, i haven’t listened to it, and probably with good reason. it probably sucks.
you think this is bad, anyone remember the naked brothers band?
BTW what&#39;s wrong with your left arm? You should go to the doctor...I see a circulation problem.
Feldman doing MJ officially makes me embarrassed to be white. It&#39;s sooooo cringe worthy.
6 minute abs!
I have seen this review probably a dozen times and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1997">33:17</a> never fails to make me fucking wheeze with laughter. Comedy fucking gold right there.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2468">41:08</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1997">33:17</a> sounds like karaoke night in the dementia ward of an old folks home.
Explosions in the Sky tattoo? I’ve got “The Earth is Not a Cold Dead Place” 👍🏻
This review and the comments are fucking killing me
I get a lot of nods and props when i bump this driving through the hood
I can&#39;t believe you gave this album a 10/10!
i watch this review more than my favorite movie
i watched it so many times i &#39;m used to the songs lol
I mean. IMO it doesn&#39;t sound that bad.
Hilarious, but.... why do that to yourself.
When is the time to say to Corey’s face stop?
This is how I feel when I listen to today&#39;s Country Music. It&#39;s just blah...lyrically corny and mostly messy. And the damn accent on every fucken country song wants to make me go punch a cow udder.
coming back to this I think the most shocking thing about this is Fred Durst still exists
The thing is is that some of his musical ideas could really work, but his execution is just so fucking terrible.
The synth riff in question sounds reminiscent of LMFAO - Champagne Showers.
How can music be that shit
WTF is this album. I Know it&#39;s called Angelic 2 The Core but this bullshit belongs in hell
He&#39;s had a history of being molested as a kid, i think if you listen to his lyrics a little more you can find the message. Anyway, regardless of what ikind of &quot;genre&quot; it is, I personally think the album is a cry for help
Why is your chest hair so low?
Best teeth in the game
How can Anthony&#39;s droning for almost the length of DAMN. be more entertaining than this album?
&quot;I&#39;m dying on the inside, I swear&quot;
Stretchthony Marktano.
Kurupt???? He&#39;s one of the greatest hip hop lyricists??! I am actually gonna cry! Wtf are old deathrow legends doing on this dick heads album
It took me a few minutes to realize I live in a world were this album exists.
This video&#39;s great. I&#39;ve watched it numerous times. I look forward to the next project by Fantano and Feldman.<br>I&#39;m sure people who like this record sing and dance to it in the same ridiculous way Fantano was 😃.
Corethony Feldtano
Fuck, I missed the 1 year anniversary of this life-changing experience of an album!
what the fuck shit is this?
It&#39;s a certain type of creative? 😕
lmao if you think this is bad you should listen to his former child actor album from 2002. this is nothing. absolutely nothing.
okay was this album made on garageband? because i hear some of the loops i play with and make joke songs with my friends in the songs.
Cal Chuchesta is the producer of the album.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2371">39:31</a> Fantano has a fap.
Happy 5 year anniversary
The thing I&#39;m struggling with is this, if this is the worst album of 2016, then does that mean there are even worse albums that are stopping this get the &#39;worst album EVER&#39; accolade?
Anthony puts love and careful listens into those 5s and 6s he reviews but here.. here there is no love
This is the same Corey Feldman that played the older Brother in &quot;The Lost Boys&quot;.<br>Wow.<br>The shock and disappointment is strong with this one.
Snoop dogg will do anything for money
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1860">31:00</a> sounds like a god damn Jewel or O-Town record lmao
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1036">17:16</a> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1046">17:26</a> that spin was HILARIOUS!
I&#39;ve never considered suicide, but this album on the first legitimate listen sent suicidal thoughts straight to my brain. I am not kidding.
LMAO &quot;Grandpa Skrillex&quot;
modern day trout mask replica, but no one recognises it&#39;s greatness. in the year 2020, (when sir kanye west is elected) scaruffi will come out of the shadows and declare this to be the only worthwhile album in rock history - better than beefheart could ever achieve.
A V A N T G A R D E
Honestly I barely almost find enjoyment from it, as I have a deep love for 90s EDM &amp; Pop. Such a shame.
Lmfao @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1860">31:00</a> @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2370">39:30</a>
Can&#39;t believe you gave this album a 10 but only 7 for DAMN.
Every song sounds like three different songs overlapping each other.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=827">13:47</a> JESUS CHRIIIIST
calm down mellon your impersonation level is too good <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=781">13:01</a>
I almost disliked this video when he started playing parts of the album until I realized he was suffering just as much as me.
One day this album will be used as forensic evidence and featured in a documentary film about the psychological damage inflicted upon child actors in Hollywood.<br><br>Or in case Corey eventually goes on a killing spree.
Shut up, Mouth! :P
By the way, the Fred Durst feature is more obvious.  It sounds very Limp Bizkit.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=445">7:25</a> HIS FACE OMG
Corey Feldman must be delusional. Or he just has a bad taste in music.
-1/10?
AHHHHH RECORDING FOR THIS TOOK PLACE FROM 2006-2016 THIS EXPLAINS EVERYTHING
I like that because the album is so bad, so is this episode. And I don&#39;t mean bad, I mean badly put together. The album is off frame on the green screen on purpose and he hasn&#39;t edited this episode at all. And he&#39;s in a tank top. Like.. that&#39;s genius.
So am I the only one that realized his shirt is on backwards?
Cal chuchesta did it better
Lickety splikety...
Lets hope 20 years from now people don&#39;t call this ahead of it&#39;s time masterpiece ....
I made a drinking game out of this album. Every time someone laughed they took a shot of vodka. My friend passed out on track 4.
You weren&#39;t wrong.
Better than Sgt pepper my ones.
This video has 472 dislikes. That must be the exact number of Corey Feldman fans.

Anthony, @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1557">25:57</a>: what if that IS one of multiple takes. The best one. ...
<i>this album gave me hepatitis</i>
Anthony&#39;s vocals are better than Corey&#39;s
Corey is amazing !!!and this is horrible
Can&#39;t believe you gave this a 10 but damn a 7
I&#39;ve lost my boner

i love how fantano tries to mock his voice bu winds up singing insanely better than feldman
the entire thing sounds like an outro
Melon&#39;s manic cackling always makes my day
If Corey came forward today and said that we have all been punked; that this was just a big joke, then it would be brilliant.
This honestly made me wanna cancel my YouTube red subscription just so I could sit through ads
I&#39;m back for my monthly viewing of this review
The synth lead is from Neon Lights
DAMMIT FANTANO...STOP BEING SO DAMN ENTERTAINING...I&#39;M WATCHING THIS THING WAY TOO MUCH ALREADY!!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2100">35:00</a> - I think he&#39;s trying to copy Randy Newman.
this album would read like a parody of pure comedy if it was released a year later
I think this may be a money laundering scheme.
The synth was ripped from party rock.
Dude that synth at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=557">9:17</a>. What the fuck is that from? I have the words on and on and on in my head but I don&#39;t know what that is from. Someone please help me
If this is the worst album then how come you can speak about it for an hour huh?
whoever has listened to this album through and through and enjoyed it should host an official AMA on Reddit.
D O I T L I C K I T Y S P L I C K Y
this could be the E.T. game of music<br>buy it. it will be worth something for collectors<br>maybe

Fuck this album is fucked
I saw corey feldman in New York a couple weeks ago and all I can say is.... wow... and crackle crackle
&quot;I don&#39;t want to hear about Corey Feldman tasting anything in a sexual manner&quot; LOL
I will never be able to look at Mouth from The Goonies the same again
I think there should be a reality TV show called &quot;What wouldn&#39;t Snoop Dogg do?&quot; Or &quot;WWSDD&quot; for short. It&#39;ll play out kind of like Dragons Den in which people/company&#39;s come up to Snoop Dogg and pitch parts/roles for him to play/rap. The tension comes from how Snoop Dogg will act like he&#39;s not keen, but of course in the end he&#39;ll always say yes.
&quot;i was thinking bout my niece (bout my niece..... bout my niece)&quot; the best line ever said
I am not sure if this guy is serious or not, tbh. Even the album cover seems purposely cheesy. Sure he&#39;s not musically shit-posting?
this album is nothing, go listen to his older stuff. Specifically Former Child Actor
Worst album? Uhhh try again sweaty? Best album CLASSIC/10
This album gives me faith in my music career
fuck my brain what the fuck is feldmand thinking is he trying to kill us
The wrong Corey died.
I needed this Anthony, thanks 😂
This is the type of music I want playing at my funeral. Album of my generation.
THE WORST ALBUM OF 2016<br>(Corey Feldman&#39;s Angelic 2 The Core)<br>[NOT GOOD]<br>you don&#39;t<br>fucking<br>say
Turns out Corey produced it himself....
BS
I liked it...
I think that album gave me cancer.
KURUPT?!?!????
I actually enjoyed &quot;Everybody&quot; from the album, but the rest of the album sucks ass 😂
This album is The Room of music
This almost sounds as cringe as the ICP shit I&#39;ve heard
I&#39;m gonna be honest with all of you. I think Mercy was the best song.
I still don&#39;t understand how this is all one singular album. There&#39;s so many genres, so much shit. How does anyone make something this bad?!
I like the idea that, at the same time Corey is recording this, his agent is just on the phone with like 8 other people saying &quot;dude... Dude... You gotta listen to this fuck.&quot; My theory is that this is the result of Corey not realizing people were only encouraging him to laugh at him.
best vid of channel no doubt
So...what i&#39;m hearin&#39; is a light five to strong six on this? Jk, jk. 😅😂
post Malone isn&#39;t even that bad lol better then migos
It sounds like you&#39;re playing five songs of all different genres at once and putting your hand in a garbage disposal
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=539">8:59</a> sounds like Kanye to me. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1637">27:17</a> and a few other parts are like Mike Patton. Feldman is secretly a genius.
Corey Feldman makes the best music ever. This album reveived 9.5/10 and 4/5 and 5/5 on Wikipedia from big music rating companies. It reached platinum in a few months. Corey made a great album with Angelic 2 The Core.
He&#39;s not even wearing his flannel for this one. We&#39;re entering uncharted territory here gentlemen. God help us all.
This album makes me wanna knit a sweater.
He was a purty good in Friday the 13th
I have to get this album.
skiddlee boop bop bow! Great Stuff!
angelic to the core? more like dillusional to the core😂😂😂. this has got to be one of the worst albums ever. I really wonder who he blackmailed to invest in this piss poor album?
angelicthony coretano
so on my phone when I close YouTube it doesn&#39;t keep playing the music. I closed the video and went to play a game and Corey Feldman started playing and I couldn&#39;t get it to stop...... I had to restart my phone.....<br><br>oh my....
the only people who enjoy this bullshit are people who can&#39;t even pass a 4th grade math test
why is this 50 minutes
oh frig off
Anthony sounds like Root Beer Guy
It&#39;s basically of Montreal let&#39;s be honest
I think the first songs lyrics should be more like it&#39;s a musical number in Lazy town. It sure sounds like it is.
BOUT MY NIECE
Batman &amp; Robin of music industry.
This is the room of music
I feel like listening to this killed some braincells
Wait.. Fred Durst?! LOL oh and scat intro.. nice. That &#39;worst&#39; tune reminds me of South Park comedy tracks lol. Drugs are bad mkay
All the DJ stuff is his bottom bitch&#39;s electronic/DJ &#39;sampling&#39; and presets production for sure
When Fantano cough-weezed at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1600">26:40</a> I honestly thought that was part of the song
Delusional 2 The Core
so i need to listen to tpab so i don&#39;t off myself tonight
This should be the worst album of 2017 because of how bad it is.
Not since the Clash&#39;s Sandinista have we seen such a disquietingly provocative double album. Great albums have profound messages. Transcendent albums re-order both our dreams and the language we use to fabricate them. Cory Feldman&#39;s &quot;Angelic 2 the Core&quot; is the latter. Way, way latter. In Ascension Millennium, the album&#39;s opening track and manifesto Feldman talks of giving toys to his soul, boldly implying that the spirituality trap is an even a bigger illusion than God ever was. The tone for the next 68 minutes of your life has been set: no one in getting out of here with any consolation for his shame. By track number six, &quot;Bad People&quot; Feldman uses logic to obliterate the concept of mercy. Much has been made of Feldman&#39;s voice. How it is to Michael Jackson both paean and blood libel, homage and homicide. But that is a distraction. Feldman&#39;s a death crooner not a soul singer. In his pipes there is pre-sleep apnea Leonard Cohen soprano with hints of Geddy Lee and notes of Vince Neil. And that voice belongs to a sadist for whom all he touches turns not to gold but weapons. A murderer is defined as someone who takes from you everything you ever had and everything you ever will. But what do you call someone who does all that and leaves you breathing? You call him Cory.
Corey Feldman has embodied insanity a lot more in one album than Swans have in their whole discography.
&#39;&#39;Grandpa Skrillex&#39;&#39; :&#39;D
he sounds like charlie kelly
I&#39;m an 11 year old who uses a cheaply made music maker to make music and my music is still better. These songs are most likely the worst songs that I&#39;ve ever heard.
I&#39;m having a contact aneurysm.

This is the first video I&#39;ve seen of yours and you got my immediate respect with the OMD album behind you :)
But what did he rate it though
I come back to this review every now and again when I want to laugh and suffer simultaneously
The album was great in my opinion!!!
L I C K I T Y S P L I C K Y
for now we see through a glass darkly

The day Snoop Dogg says the words &quot;I don&#39;t care how much you pay me!&quot; Is the day Danny Brown does gospel.
He&#39;s so bad he&#39;s literally losing teeth onstage .
Maybe he went for the &quot;create shit and maybe people will call it experimental&quot; approach
Sounds like Papa Roach trying EDM
the only video on planet earth where you can actually watch a melon slowly lose his fUCKING MIND
Is it worse than any Murphy&#39;s album?
Sounds like something straight from Rick &amp; Morty<br>SHOW ME WHAT YOU&#39;VE GOT
I died laughing watching this video. why does Good Morning America keep encouraging him LMAO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣 stupid Corey Feldman
Boi melonhead had to whip out the old wife beater for this slaughter
Corey sounds like Lil Wayne is gargling yoghurt...
I kid you not, I have watched this video at least 25 times already. This is pure comedy. Whenever I have a bad day, I come back to this video. The comment section makes it even more hilarious lmfao.
I RARELY agree with Cpt. Muscle Ts reviews, BUT..... He does listen to things so incredibly in depth that its interesting to hear his deconstructions. PLUS, fantano actually has a cosby-sweater tattoo! And thats BEAST! This time I agree with him 110% on everything he says. It truly is beyond description. This is the most aurally catastrophic, incoherent album of ALL TIME! I challenge ANYONE to find worse . How could NOBODY, NOT A SINGLE SOUL tell Feld-dawg how horrific this is? They probably did, and he did what he does almost everytime he gets slammed and did some mental jumping jacks that turns it into a compliment. &quot;we went viral, 10milliom views, we are 32 on the top 40 heatseekers&quot;. Its like, Feld-dawg, you&#39;re getting views like William Hung got views. Its such a laughable train wreck that no matter how embarrassing our worst moment this year was. Its not as bad as this. In America we like our shit in massive potent piles. Two album lengths worth.
Nothing, NOTHING, can prepare you for &quot;Lickety-Splickety&quot;. It is so insanely fucking horrendous.
But is it worse than Philosophy of the World by The Shaggs?
This is real music, a thinking man&#39;s record
and still, Lil Yachty&#39;s Teenage Emotions is even worse... bravo
I have myth busters playing on my TV while I watch this and they just wrote &quot;needle drop&quot; on a piece of paper
It gives me conniptions
The album closer was very good, however.
Go 4 It is pretty decent...cookie cutter as hell, but not bad to be honest.
This album made me revoke my religion and gave me suicidal depression.
Where&#39;s the Corey Haim feature?<br>Oh
Hey, there should be a competition in which people would have a week to create an album, having no musical background - I bet 99% of random people commenting here would be able to pull it off.
&quot;Looking like grandpa Skrillex on the cover&quot;.  lol
The best thing to come out of Corey Feldman&#39;s music career is this review.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1959">32:39</a> honestly sounds better than anything on the album
according to the websites official website feat. web design circa 1999,  this album has been in the making for A DECADE
its like if someone&#39;s drunk dad tried to record a sequel to &quot;2 be a master&quot;<br>an album for children with pop songs about pokemon that was produced in like a week
you know... it is such a fucking shame that ascension has one of the best music videos ever made... because that song is... lovecraftian...
YOu suck dude!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=260">4:20</a> i really wanted u to say &quot;delusional 2 the core&quot;
I recognize a lot of the &quot;good parts&quot; in his songs from free sample packs from back in my early music production, that synth loop that fantano said was pulled from another song is from the Cymatics free EDM samples
there are semblances of legitimately catchy sections within some of the tracks, but every single time I found myself seeing potential in a measure or so of a song, Corey heroically stomped all over it.<br>the composition is nothing short of cacophony, his vocals are atrocious, the mixing sounds like a disaster, and the concept is messy as fuck.<br><br>there&#39;s no way Corey is 100% right in the head
Corey, and Fred Durst that&#39;s cruel and unusual punishment
With the last track, I like Anthony&#39;s singing way more than the actual song....And I never ever thought I&#39;m gonna feel this way.
BRAIN MELT
Imagine if you just expose your child to this album, and this is the only music they hear ( you never play the radio either) and then one day you just show them all the great music there is.
This album is way ahead of its time.<br>Next 808s and heartbreak
This has to be a satire maybe like Tim Heidecker but I don&#39;t want to insult Tim Heidecker
Remember when Eminem said that Kurup is top 6 (and better than Nas). Yeah.
There goes my gun
im going insane
Well it doesn&#39;t sound nowhere near as good as the lost boys soundtrack
Cringe. It&#39;s like if your dad was having a midlife crisis and was trying to be cool with the kids. Everyone is Corey&#39;s child, and everyone is painfully embarrassed for him.
Funniest thing is this album is $20
Lol when the vid is 50 minutes long xD
You gave Damn and Lil Boat a 7 and this album a full video? Smh unsubscribe
I&#39;ll never forget where I was the first time I saw theneedledrop&#39;s Corey Feldman review.
I watch this review once a month
This album is the musical equivalent of those annoying 90&#39;s kid posts from buzzfeed
When you make an album so shitty Fandango roasts you for almost an hour straight 
for some reason the first par of go 4 it sounds to me like get swifty of rick and morty
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂I almost pissed myself!!! Dyin over here!!!
he wants $20 for it on his website too
Corey Feldman is the Tony Wiseau of music
ANTHONY IS LEGITIMATELY LOSING HIS SANITY, LIKE THIS ALBUM IS SCRAPING THE SANITY OUT OF HIS SYNAPSES.
better than tpab
one of the funniest videos i ever seen in my life hands down
I thought he said &quot;to the penis so big you feel nothing at all&quot; on working class hero
oh my fucking lord. those aren&#39;t horns. they&#39;re kazoos. fucking kazoos.
You have never listened to a Kidzbop album have you?
John Lennon should come back from the dead and bitch slap Feldman
I&#39;m going to go drink cancer now.
I got a six pack laughing at this video.
In the Today Show, they say that this album was 10 years in the making. rip
he made it for Corey haim
The &quot;You crossed the line&quot; song sounds like two songs being placed at once.
your reactions to this are fundamentally better than corey feldman
oh hi mark of music
I love this, but like make one where we listen to loveless together. as much as I love to see you tortured by what could be the worst album artistically of all time
And then god said to man &quot;do it lickity splickty&quot; and man responded with &quot;i..i cant...this albums terrible&quot;

Yeah man, you know, I hate when people say they gon&#39; do something and they don&#39;t do it.
Thinking about my niece...<br> ABOUT MY NIECE, ABOUT MY NIECE
I want to die, pass me the bottle of that fine drink called shotgun
I&#39;ve tried to listen to this album several times now. I can&#39;t get through more than a couple songs. It&#39;s the musical equivalent of sitting around and sniffing shit
im literally shaking this is so bad
This video did show at least this album can rouse people&#39;s emotions. Cause I&#39;m sad for, shocked by, angry at, suicidal because of, and I feel the strongest sense of pity for Corey Feldman.
How the fuck did you listen to this whole album. I know you must have to make this review. How could you just sit and let it play
How many times has everyone seen this? I&#39;ve literally counted and this is my 12th time.
We may not share the songs we love, but we definitely can despise the songs we hate together. Pitchfork*
I just bought my tickets to see Corey in June &amp; i&#39;m so excited.
Bruh YES Corey Feldman needs help, just look at his twitter my dude, it&#39;s BONKERS
I&#39;m sure this had to be a joke. like everyone around him told him it was great and everyone would love it, while at the same time laughing and joking and making fun of it when he wasn&#39;t around. maybe this was one huge joke on Corey fieldsman.
posibly the best video in this channel?
418 people fucking loved this album
I think the pop song he ripped off on the second track may be Party Rock Anthem...not sure though.
Ah shit, he&#39;s balding.
Whenever I have a bad day, I come back to this video.
Broken-thony Will-tano
it&#39;s like you gave a twelve year old FL studio
Why&#39;d you do this to yourself.
I found something worse than this album:<br><a href="https://soundcloud.com/brain-busta/sets/pi-1">https://soundcloud.com/brain-busta/sets/pi-1</a>
This video is almost a fucking hour long and it&#39;s still my favourite review you&#39;ve ever done.
And then he proves he has no knowledge of astronomy as well as music. I think this is the sound of the worst midlife crisis ever.
I think the old Nokia ringtone is more moving.
I like noisy music but this is just a musical migraine.
Just odd. Bad reviews are always entertaining.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2124">35:24</a> &quot;play it again Sam. That jazz certainly does swing.&quot; Hahahahah his delivery on that
anthony do you know your photo is the profile picture for Corey Feldman <a href="http://last.fm">last.fm</a> page
Back again for my monthly pilgrimage
Late as fuck, but I heard a bit of KMFDM in that fucking callout track. Please kill me.
standbyme
Where&#39;s Aesop Rock when you need him?
This album isn&#39;t worthy of the yellow shirt.
when i have a bad day i watch this video
i just looked this up on spotify and went to related artists and they put nails and death grips as related artists! like wtf? hahahaha
This album is absolutely fascinating. How was it even released to the public? Who said that this was okay? Does Corey actually think that this is quality music?
I think this album is what mental illness sounds like
Isn&#39;t Corey Feldman the Tommy Wiseau of music?
Belíssimas canções, harmonias deliciosas, um grupo extremamente criativo.
his laugh is so inspiring
Obviously this album is supposed to be bad, Feldman is just trolling. I don&#39;t understand this review. <br><br>Or maybe it is part of the trolling?
I feel like a Blood On The Dance Floor review is the natural next step after this.
Lickety splickety
This is so bad. I couldn&#39;t even finish the video and also it made me procrastinate XD.
You should give a better point because you look really enjoying this thing.
play it again Sam that jazz sure does swing 😂😂
according to his website it took corey a decade to record this album and im just really confused how this is the final draft
After listening to all of this shit, my metabolism needs some Miles Davis or i&#39;ll die.
Its a comedic masterpiece... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1313">21:53</a> is that a fucking kazoo?
This is the fist time I&#39;ve seen the back of his head. Landmark moment in my life.
honestly these are the sounds of hell
he and tommy wiseau must be related
Its like if nickelback made a hip hop album after listening to the entire limp bizkit discography on meth but worse
in 50 years, this will be seen as the next trout mask replica, you&#39;ll see melon<br><br>you&#39;ll see
Ooohhh it&#39;s an explosions in the sky tattoo, I&#39;ve been wondering what that was for awile
<b>&#39;BOUT MY NIECE</b><br><b>&#39;BOUT MY NIECE</b>
stop contr0lling whut i lik
Just hearing the album title spoken aloud makes me laugh.
i would say the true worst song on this thing is we wanted change
what the fuck and KURUPT IS ON THIS
The full effect doesn&#39;t translate through the video, I had to go listen to it myself to TRULY understand the MAGIC of Corey Feldman
Honestly, this album intentionally or not provides social commentary on the state of generic pop music. Like this album really lacks any sort of talent or meaning, but it has almost &quot;stripped back&quot; all that goes into hiding its &quot;genericness&quot; from the audience
I am at this moment 3 minutes into &quot;lovin lies&quot; and I&#39;m not like cringing or anything, but I don&#39;t really like it. I can&#39;t tell you any lyrics because I&#39;ve just been filtering out his words, but the production is really lacking any sort of finesse. The kick drum is so horribly compressed in the mix. As I&#39;m writing this, the song &quot;likety splikey(?)&quot; started, and it&#39;s overcompressed and generally overproduced. It&#39;s awful. His singing is terrible, generic use of stereo spread, and his writing is pretty poor and cliché
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2368">39:28</a>
<b>twitter block</b>
I think this is a healthy outlet for the sadist in me
are albums with &quot;2&quot; in it automatically bad?
I felt a little bad for him until I watched his WifeSwap episode... 
reminds me of raed
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1036">17:16</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=845">14:05</a> What makes track even this even sadder is that it has Jon Carin, who worked with legendary bands like Pink Floyd and The Who.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=467">7:47</a> you are always so full of joy
lol this is labeled as outsider music in wikipedia
Fate of the Furious is the Angelic 2 the Core of movies
This is like one of those god awful halarious cover performances you&#39;d see on one of those singing shows except it&#39;s worse.
fuck you melon mount ninji and da nice time kid may not be die antwoords best work, but it isn&#39;t bad. Zeftilldeth you just don&#39;t understand d
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1305">21:45</a>
juicy melon xxx
maybe it&#39;s just way ahead of It&#39;s time?
The song snippets make me tense up and feel like i&#39;m not getting enough oxygen. It&#39;s like the music is trying to absorb my soul.
I think this album may be too patrician from you, Anthony.
Wow ummm yea just I....wow.
This album along with Philosophy Of The World and Wheelz Of Steel Volume 1 are the worst albums I have ever heard.
Dude, I have to say that while you have some points in saying that the record is terrible. It is. But maybe he thinks it&#39;s good. That&#39;s the problem, because while he has banned you from the show, he thinks he&#39;s pretty good. While we know it&#39;s trash, it&#39;s important as a critic to guide people to help them, and while it is crap, it&#39;s not right to spend 50 minutes trashing someone, making fun of it mercilessly and laughing at them. You could have spent five minutes, and just said it&#39;s garbage. Let&#39;s be clear, I&#39;m not defending this music, because it is garbage. I&#39;m just a middle party that thinks that critics should guide artists who are terrible instead of trashing them until they get pissed, and ban them from their shows. And I think in a way, he thinks it&#39;s good, but you can&#39;t take anything seriously with joke albums. From what I hear, this is pretty much a joke album. For Snoop&#39;s reasons, this is just a paycheck. But in a way, this is kind of a sad realization that Feldman needs help. I think he needed lots of help, and no one was there to tell him it was garbage. In summation, I think 50 minutes trashing this album is a little harsh on a joke album.
people made fun of me for shooting like this in school, but the guy who shot this ad got paid for it.
XDDDDDDDDD
Still better than SB2H
Grandpa skrillex tell us again how great your live shows were
Gutted he didn&#39;t drop the second album on Easter Sunday for THE RESURRECTION.
wow don&#39;t know Anthony was featured on this album, if you listen closely at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1710">28:30</a> you can hear his voice
Not gonna lie, this probably could&#39;ve passed as a decent comedy album. Like, if it was ironic, I&#39;d probably listen to it every once in a while for a laugh or two.
I see where he tries the Michael Jackson growly kinda thing, but he can&#39;t sing so it sounds ridiculous! lol
LMAO OMGGGGG THIS ALBUM IS FUNNY AF
Honestly the religious themes make this album the original DAMN.
I watched a gyro while I ate this video
this makes Val Kilmer&#39;s album  sound like the apex of music.
if tommy wiseau made an album
Wow... This album makes speeding bullet 2 heaven look like Madvillainy
God Bless you Fantano. This is hilarious!!!!!!
I would legitimately listen to him cover a full song off this record.
cheatin my drug test while watching
somehow, this album is so bad it almost seems like comparetively it will make Anthony think speeding bullet to heaven is like a 7 or 8 if not maybe even a 9.
Was listening to this review without looking at the screen and some song that I thought was part of the review started playing. I was like &quot;hey this song is actually pretty good!&quot; then I looked and saw it was just the background music in a McDonalds commercial lmao
&quot;Grandpa Skrillex&quot;<br>Lol
When&#39;s the full album coming out on vinyl?
What kind of a lunatic could mix this rubbish? It&#39;s so all over the place it sounds like three cheap radios all playing different stations in the same room.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2468">41:08</a>
i did the math to appear on &quot;Go For It&quot; I would require $300,000 and and 3 Album Record Deal
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=825">13:45</a>-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=828">13:48</a>
That synth lead you were talking about kinda sounds like Calvin Harris&#39; I&#39;m Not Alone, kinda.
lmao Shawn Mendez did a song with the mercy idea I&#39;m pretty sure
This album makes me feel dirty
wow, the lyrics are like bad fanfiction- even from the first sentence you&#39;d just want to sit the writer down, tell them &quot;You&#39;re doing it wrong, there was all this lead-up and there were expectations that built up, but this uninteresting nonsense from the start makes it seem like you don&#39;t know how to _say something coherently_. Now, change this... change that.... move that part to way later...&quot;<br>Just some sorry ass lyrics, the sorryest of them
I always thought he was standing up to do these reviews
Best teeth in the game
The melodies in this album sound like a they were created by a kazoo playing crackhead.
It&#39;s almost a mockery of pop and dance music, but ironically. Reminds me of Politikz, but instead of being creative, Feldman just missed the mark so hard.
Let&#39;s just take that next step and just see if it happens 😩😩😩😩😩😩I been crying bro
Your tattoo breaks the record of badness...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=462">7:42</a> melon goes insane
You laugh at him now but just you wait till he&#39;s selling out stadiums ya bloomin idiots
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1050">17:30</a> his tank is inside out.
Negativity actually sounds like a really bad early disturbed song. Like, an album cut from The Sickness.
Dude, what is up with that? You seem to hate everything these days. This is clearly an <b>excellent</b> album.
Dude, your shirt is inside out.
Dude, are those your real teeth?
I&#39;m 99% sure Corey Feldman is trolling... I don&#39;t know how other people don&#39;t see that.
Is this album 2016&#39;s Trout Mask Replica?
that dubstep was as good as all dubstep
How many units did this piece of crap sell?
shouldn&#39;t someone be in jail. ahahahahahahahagaga
its like if tonetta had 10 times as much money and 10 times as little talent behind him
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1425">23:45</a>
These beats, Im dying
On the plus side after listening to this album you will probably raise the scores on other bad albums you have rated as it must make all other music seem better now
I&#39;ve been waiting for an Adam west interpretation of Batman to coexist in the Charlie&#39;s Angels universe and Mr. Feldman gave it to me. Papa Bless
what the fuck is this even?
&quot;Speedin&#39; Bullet 2 The Angelic Core Of Heaven is the fourty-ninth mixtape by Nigerian reggae singer Ore Oke Gbogunmi. It was released on June 6, 1944 and was an immediate critical and commercial success&quot; taen from the wiki
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1948">32:28</a>: Brilliant impression of a cat slowly being strangled to death by a bear
is this death grips?
You burped your vegan juices into my right ear Anthony
ASCENSION.. MILLENIUM
definitely just way ahead of his time ;)
It&#39;s almost like he was only allowed  to listen to the song &quot;my monkey&quot; by Marilyn manson weil making this album but still wanted it to be a pop album
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2030">33:50</a> , I am laughing so much I am dying.
Great follow-up to Blurryface. Wonder what Twenty One Pilots will come up with next
Sounds like most crap I hear on the radio these days...
this is way funnier than it has any right to be. Holy shit.
Your poor , brave soul. Thank you for your service! You nailed it! Every song was some strange, pseudo copy of every 90&#39;s pop band. It&#39;s a damn shame that some people call this music!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Angelic 2 The Core is like Mr. Bungle doing a Top 40 parody album which makes the fact it&#39;s a serious endeavor even more puzzling
This album gives me terminal depression lickety splickety
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1867">31:07</a> &quot;Sometimes words don&#39;t express the feelings we really mean, so I wrote these feelings for you.&quot;<br><br>...What?
This album isn&#39;t as bad as your wife beater/tank top look.
Lickety Splickety&#39;s <i>A Series of Unfortunate Tracks</i>
Straight from the album&#39;s website: &quot;Angelic 2 The Core has truly been a labor of love for Corey. One of its many personal charms is that Corey recorded the album in his own home studio and played all of the instruments himself on some of the tracks showing that in addition to his skills as a singer/songwriter/producer, he is now adding multi-instrumentalist to his resume.&quot;<br><br>christ.
Not gonna lie, the song at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=853">14:13</a> actually sounds decent
I finally found the perfect album to clip my toe nails to.
It sounds like Mindless Self Indulgence but like, not as a joke....
Bro this album cover really made with Microsoft PowerPoint= Masterpiece
I normally hold distain for ad breaks, but in the face of this &quot;album&quot; they are an oasis.
this album was written by &quot;bad people&quot;
it&#39;s like Cory is having a stroke whenever he tries to sing.
This made me listen to the album, couldn&#39;t get past the first 20 seconds of the first song lol.
Me me big boy
Incredible. There&#39;s OMD&#39;s &quot;Architecture &amp; Morality&quot; sitting there in the background, and he&#39;s talking about the Corey Feldman album instead.
The Batman theme was the best the best piece of music on this album.
&quot;I hate when people say they goin to do something and they don&#39;t do it.&quot; Best line in the album of all time.
Music starts @ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=435">7:15</a>
April fools day is coming up. Don&#39;t forget to buy your Feldman album before it is too late!
So this is basically Pink Floyd&#39;s the wall right?
at this point, this is how I know the world is completely mainstream and has no artist value whatsoever. I have seen you critique Speeding Bullet To Heaven and now you mentioned Lil Peep. I don&#39;t even have the slightest perception that your ears acquire and I wish to not ever. No words... triggers me in such a way beyond explanation. I admit that this is by far not the best but not the worst. I&#39;ll assume that your creative listening is shot and you should acquire the title &quot;The Internets Most Bias Nerd&quot;
It&#39;s not bad I find it listenable
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1421">23:41</a> best part
Suicide Silence&#39;s new album doesn&#39;t seem so bad after hearing this
This album legitimately drove Fantano insane. Corthany Feldtano is mentally unstable.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1714">28:34</a> TRYNA GET THAT HEALTHCARE PLAN I FUCKING DIED
I feel so sad that I can only watch this once for the first time.
wait what the fuck, it&#39;s an hour long
this album is so bad anthony doesnt even wear a shirt
&quot;Grandpa Skrillex&quot; lol. This album tho.... It&#39;s like he picked every shitty free VST plugin from FL studio, and all of its shittiest presets, combined with Barney&#39;s drum kit pack, and made an album with it. Then had MC Hammer&#39;s pants remix/master the entire thing
Corey is putting out a single for Record Store Day.
the song at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1860">31:00</a> I swear is a Jesse McCartney song
Negativity sounded like a shitty version of Twiztid
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2116">35:16</a> Thats some pig molesting right here
how tf did Snoop Dogg do feature on a song. LIKE WHY YOUR A WESTCOAST LEGEND WHYYY???!! YOU DIDNT EVEN NEED THE PAYCHECK YOU FUCK !! GODAMMIT SNOOP WHYYYYY
Corey Feldman recently played in Green Bay WI... Not even the backup band looked like they were having fun. AND THEN! Michael Jackson outfits!
I think the sad part is that Corey is actually taking himself seriously.
Not a post malone fan by any means but white iverson makes speeding bullet to heaven and this album look great
<b>A N G E L I C</b>
Corey Feldman - To Pimp A Butterfly
This album is just a joke, right?
The only good thing about this album is this video. Never fails to make me laugh.
Why sister was baby taking to our dog in the next room and I legitimately thought it was part of the song playing at the time. I was like &quot;what the absolute fuck?&quot; Lol
The electronic beats, the choppy editing, the loosely structured vocals. It&#39;s obvious Corey Feldman is a Death Grips fan.
J.Cole&#39;s new project was better than this. and that&#39;s saying something
just listened to this album in it&#39;s enterity again. i can say that in 30 or 40 years its going to be considered Trout Mask Replica of this generation
Honestly, &quot;Go 4 It!&quot; is propaply the &quot;best&quot; song on that album. I mean it sounds like a legitimate bad song, while the rest is clearly a cry for help.
This will end up being a classic for all the wrong reasons...
&quot;how is this legal?&quot;   LOL ... such a great review
I am watching this video and his laugh is so contagious. The album is extremely bad and his laugh makes the whole entire thing so hilarious. And he is a cutie too.
nigga, this shit sounds like a Sonic Adventure soundtrack lmaoo
Corey Feldman is like the Tommy Wiseau of music
He has Architecture and Morality on his shelf. Couldn&#39;t be a bigger contrast to the utter nonsense on the Feldman album. I feel strangely compelled to buy however just to experience its full horror
fake glasses wtf
Poor thing. He is a nice guy but who in the hell told him that he could sing, or write, or dance? He may be a good actor, but seriously.... this is an abomination. It&#39;s all over the place, I really don&#39;t understand why his friends, family, fans haven&#39;t told him that he sucks at it. He sings about old lame stuff and try to make it sound cool. I&#39;m worried about him. lol
Friendly reminder to pick up The Core&#39;s single on Record Store Day!
THIS IS ABOUT HIM LOSING HIS BESTFRIEND COREY HAIM AND WHAT THE HOLLYWOOD PEDOS HAD DONE... PROB ALSO HOW HIS WIFE SUZIE USED HIM... JUST MY GUESS ?
bout mah niece
WIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII~
&#39;BOUT MAH NIECE
&quot;Thinkin&#39; about my nieeece...&quot;
There&#39;s a video for &quot;Duh&quot; on YouTube, and it&#39;s truly offensive towards women.

this is if Fack by Eminem was an album
I keep watching this over and over again
This new Death Grips album sounds really good
.....im so thankful for the abomination that is CF, without him there wouldnt be this fucking classic &quot;review&quot;......
oh boy
Was that a khazoo in the background at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1310">21:50</a>?
I fucking pray those two girls on the cover got payed alot....cuz god damn, what an embarrassment to be on this album XD
Where is the yellow flannel?!
I&#39;ve watched this video like 10 times to cheer myself up.
if you had a life you wouldn&#39;t be rubbing your gums can you do better?
I still like it more than lil yachty. &gt;.&gt;
Watching this drunk at 4am is truly the best thing
this is his greatest review yet <b>slow clap grows to thunderous applause</b>
i&#39;ve gotta say, that Corey Feldman doesn&#39;t sound good throughout this whole album. Especially in vocals because it sounds like theres no confidence whatsoever and also sounds like hes screaming &#39;KILL ME&#39; For 90 minutes straight. The unfitting samples and instrumentation on this album is so messy and ridiculously jerky that I like to declare this album as a &#39;Junk Album&#39;. And Plus I can&#39;t get over how bad the mixing is throughout this album. Corey Feldman, Pls Stop &amp; Jump of a bridge.
it&#39;s dickass reviews like this that hold many people down from finding there creativity in music because your ears don&#39;t hear a overproduced sterile sound like britney spears... Corey Man keep freedom of expression real no matter how it sound
corethony feldtano just jealous that he never made album that good yet
I feel like Corey Feldman hasn&#39;t listened to any modern music for a decade and then a week before he started writing the danm album he crammed in a decades worth of music into his slowly dying brain
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=900">15:00</a> &quot;people&quot; sounds like he&#39;s ripping from Gorilaz.

I know i&#39;m probably going to get shit for this, but this honestly feels like i&#39;m listening to Hollywood Undead&#39;s dads try to copy their sons equally shitty music.
This is the musical equivalent to a Neil Breen film, only nowhere near as enjoyable.
This is my favorite review ever. Ever.
that was complete and utter torture. thank you
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1995">33:15</a> it can&#39;t be even worse...<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Ohh...
Ascension sounded like the freaking gummybear song
Holy shit man, the first 15 min of your reactions actually had me in tears
Not even lying the chorus for Go For It was actually good for 5 seconds and then they had to mash in dubstep.
So of it sounds like music from a shitty sonic game
The only thing in music I don&#39;t want to upload from torrent
You should do Philosophy of the World
I&#39;d still listen to this before I listen to Taylor Swift or Selena Gomez
it&#39;s not that I don&#39;t like him as a actor or as a person, it&#39;s just that this is so embarassing and awkward. not sure who told him he can sing. but not only does it sound like it was recorded on a computer, but he&#39;s just all around not a good artist. and I don&#39;t like how much he tries to be like Michael jackson, it&#39;s past the point of just inspiration, it&#39;s copying and he&#39;s horrible at it.
this video is a meme gold mine
I laughed out loud in the middle of class. COREY IS TRYING RIP
some of this album sounds like really, really, really, really awful Mindless Self Indulgence.
I want to see him review I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love by My Chemical Romance so bad.
I need that artwork on my fucking wall. Grandpa Skrillex fleeing like a bat outta hell.
This reminds me of that bit in The Adventures of Ford Fairlane where he&#39;s in the recording studio and the kid is singing horribly out of tune
That was a Guetta rip off ye?
I think that people have told him the truth but he&#39;s so delusional that he doesn&#39;t want to hear it so just like rejects from American Idol, they&#39;ll never get it.
Someone needs to buy up all copies of this album, seal them in lead, and bury them deep beneath the Earth.
Man...Tommy Jarvis really got insane when he killed Jason Voorhees XD
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1620">27:00</a> sound like a member of onyx but after taking a fat fucking bong rip
he means bring the stars up to, from far away, the relative closeness of the moon.
a shitty album deserves a shitty comment<br>let iggly izzaela out of that cage
im thinking about buying this album. only to show young bands that even that idiot sold at least one copy
I was listening to this and a song played I thought &quot;this isn&#39;t that bad&quot; switched back to the video, turns out it was the music to an ad. This album is trash.
Please, make more of this. This is gold.
The dude was a very abused child actor... could we expect any more? Terrible situation for him but, yeah, throw your money into some help for yourself instead of putting out this bullshit.
That reaction at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=792">13:12</a>, hilarious.
After recent events, and discovering this, I think I am more confused about life than I ever was.
You&#39;re such a goofball Anthony! Say hi to the kids for me!<br>xxoo Aunt Bertha
It&#39;s true: Just because one gets molested by Michael Jackson, it does not mean that talent gets transferred via the anus.
This album reminds of one of my favorite bands, The Residents, but...without the irony, honesty, interesting sounds and lyrics, humor, charm, experimentation, and genuine expression--instead of just &quot;hey, what do people like? Dubstep! And others like oldtimey Jazz! I need to pander to everyone!&quot;<br><br>Anthony! It seems you haven&#39;t reviewed The Residents before, right? What do you think of them?
I&#39;m calling it now. This guy is so desperate to stay famous that within five years he will have either died or made a sex tape.
Corey is a musical genius......<br>For making such a God damm awful album that we have to listen to it just to take it in that its possible to be this bad.
Minimum payment to appear on a Corey Feldman song for me would be £1,000,000
I&#39;ve queefed catchier tunes.
Is this the descent into madness?
fuck lil peep
i fucking choked when he dropped his gum
Maybe the earth IS flat.
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23badbadnotgood">#BadBadNotGood</a>
This shit makes deaf people smile.
Your album was better than this and you were fucking around.
Anthony should do a cover album for this, make angelic 2 the core an actually decent album
I ordered two copies of this CD as Christmas presents -- several friends are big fans of Corey&#39;s filmography and I knew this would be right up their alley. Needless to say, they were ecstatic when they learned of their gifts. They exclaimed things such as &quot;no words&quot; and &quot;seriously?&quot; Oh yes, I was quite serious indeed.<br><br>Corey demonstrates wide range in this album; I had a hard time pinning down quite what his style was as it seemed to change from one track to the next. Many artists lack this ability, so I was impressed. If you&#39;re a fan of Corey&#39;s work &quot;Angelic 2 the Core&quot; is devilishly fun. See what I did there?
The neel brein of music.
His voice is like a cross between Dave Mustaine and the singer from Wheatus. Truly execrable.
Suicide is Badass
But where&#39;s Angelic 1?
This video is a part of my daily routine now.
WeWeWeWeWeWe want to change!!!!!1
About as equally bad as your tattoos. I would still listen to this unveiled pile of coprolite before any rap/hiphop made for the past few years.
tf happened to this guy, he was such a good actor when he was young and now this?
gros C..... ;-)
I&#39;m pretty sure in interviews Corey called this a concept album...
Corey&#39;s 90s stuff is better
This album is the modern MK Ultra.
Remember 222 is a tribute. A TRIBUTE!!! That&#39;s just embarrassing. I&#39;m sorry, Corey Haim, you deserve so much better!
Literally laughing so hard at this. 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Lost it at Chinese water torture lol
Holy crap, I sincerely feel bad for you Anthony for having to listen to this... Good job.
I watched all of this.for fun.
ITS SO EMBARASING
I mean, pop music really isn&#39;t my cup of tea, but since I am highly interested in music in general, I started watching this video, and holy shit, even I can tell how this album is absolutely worthless
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1353">22:33</a> Did Fantano pull a Chuchesta?
does anyone know how much money toni fantantico makes?
How the fuck are there dislikes?
I&#39;m feld up with this planet
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1995">33:15</a> hollyyyyy shit that&#39;s literally the worst thing I&#39;ve ever heard
burp, baby boy....burp!
Up until <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1995">33:15</a> you had me convinced this was a testament to the tragedy of the human condition, but now its imposible to convince me this is not a work of irony.
The album was dope, especially Ascension Millennium.<br>He&#39;s just way ahead of his time.
His face at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=446">7:26</a> made me laugh so hard!
i crie evertim
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1180">19:40</a> 1.5 million, and he would have to pay the capital gains on it...
This video is literally what I have been waiting for... I have been dying to hear parts of the tracks from this sh*t show ever since his Today appearances &lt;-- can&#39;t believe there was 2, though the second was even &quot;better&quot;... but of course there is no way in f*ck I&#39;m paying money for this or sitting through a full track... this video must be a gift from the angels... Corey&#39;s angels????
i really am suicidal rn from his music
Corey is a genius y&#39;all just don&#39;t get it
fantano is ripped 😍😍😍💯💯💯👌👌💜😩😩👌💦💦💦👻👻💦💦🔥🔥😂😂
this is borderline experimental
Big up that OMD record there
oh boy, you really found one didnt you
my cancer cells are slowly growing as I listen to this.
I swear to god I can feel my brain cells deplete gradually every second.
The comments on this video are fucking hilarious. The video makes me laugh harder than almost anything ever too. Good times all around. Love when fantano just busts out laughing.
Isn´t this Corey Feldman going to be a internet meme. Therefore it will be a hit after all?
The songs on this album all sound like left over songs for the soundtrack of Disney or Dreamworks next mediocre summer blockbuster film.
I would rather listen to Speedin Bullet To Heaven. At least that had about 3 decent songs.
You know what could sound worse than this album?<br>This same album LIVE!..... O_o
Half way through one of these bits, I was thinking, &quot;Okay, we&#39;ve had our fun, can we put on the real music now???&quot;
How is he able to play audio from the album here? He never plays tracks from the album he is reviewing, am I wrong?
is this really corey feldmans idea of good music? he thought WAY wrong
MAKE IT STOOOPPPP
Is killthany metano okay?
dude, since when you got an All Of A Sudden I Miss Everyone tattoo?
Corey Feldman is the adult version of Jacob Sartorius!!
<b>Insert comment about Jcole being bad</b> MOAR LIKEZ PLEASEEEEEEE!!<br>EDIT: I&#39;m a lyrical spiritual miracle
Is it weird that I use this to fall asleep?
I apologize if you mentioned this in your review, but I wanna point out that it seems that a song off of the album was written by Fred Durst. I didn&#39;t think this album could get worse
best harsh noise album of all time
Wow. I&#39;m actually astonished. I have an album that I made as a joke because I was bored and it&#39;s better than this. Seriously I can&#39;t believe it.
all of a sudden i miss everyone on his left arm 😱
why does every track on this album sound like a parody track from South Park?
I actually love this album<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23angelic2myheart">#Angelic2MyHeart</a> &lt;3
Wooooooooow. &lt; (This isn&#39;t long enough). I came on youtube to find Dark Souls Lore vids and stumbled across this.... I cant.  I can&#39;t. .... <br><br>I can tolerate &#39;A 10 hour of&#39; phrase repeat channel on youtube... but this...<br><br>Nah, I&#39;m out. How did you sleep after listening to this.<br><br>I actually want to buy it and try and listen to the whole thing to see if it could be done.... <br><br>Feel bad for Corey Feldman. It would suck if you took so long to make something; only to find out that it is universally hated.
We Wanted Change reminds me of Seaside Rendezvous by Queen, except the worst thing ever.
It&#39;s simply too avant garde and boundary pushing for your parochial taste.
Synth riff on that &quot;Love &amp; Lies&quot; track sounds like &quot;Turn Up The Music&quot; by Chris Brown
&quot;Play it again Sam, wow that jazz certainly does swings&quot; FUNNIEST LINE OF 2016!
My.......God
Best review ever
Angelic 2 The Core or Speeding Bullet To Heaven?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1875">31:15</a>-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1886">31:26</a> is a hit classic.
You&#39;re doing God&#39;s work here
I watched this and listened to the album... Why did I do that, it&#39;s so so bad 😖
I like to just imagine the mix engineer pulling up the faders and just struggling to get one of these cluster fucks of arrangements to work
Thumbs up for the MDE sticker on your laptop
The Negativity track sounds like its sampling Jean-luc Ponty&#39;s Impossible Voyage or w.e. its called. Only going off the snipet i heard here.  I havent heard it since i was a kid when my dad would put it on. I havent listened to this album, but it kinda sounds like an amalgamation of all the things corey has heard and liked and then he combined them all together in no order with extremely poor execution.  Add a pinch of terrible creativity and no talent and you get this.  I really enjoyed this vid, your sacrifice is not in vain!
the album cover is so disgusting. there&#39;s no design, aesthetic, class, good fonts, or anything. just...no..
this album is a strong 1
Legitimately feel bad for this guy. It took him 10 years to make this album — <b>10 years</b>. Imagine working on something for a decade then everyone totally shits on it. That has to suck ass.
I need a methodone clinic after this
this man obviously has a passion for music. he reviews music. and when such an abomination comes along, it isn&#39;t surprising that it takes a toll on the reviewers mental health.

Lmaooooo
Corey sings like a lost Black Eyes Peace member having a stroke
poor guy :(
I believe this album can stop isis
This was pretty entertaining to watch. I think you should do more of these every now and then
Did I just sit through this whole thing? This is slowly melting my brain. 50 minutes. This is not healthy but somebody has to do it. Anthony I hope you are ok after this.
I got to track 5 before I came back here to watch your review. I laughed where you did on that Ascenion track
you can slowly see this album driving anthony insane
If 2016 were an album
That &quot;about my niece&quot; section of the video had me cackling!
This is hilarious. I can&#39;t lie, I bopped my head a couple times around the 13 minute mark but then again I&#39;m still feeling the effects of NYE.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=3176">52:56</a> No, stop.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2153">35:53</a> Oh cool, he got an IceJJFish feature!
This is probably great stoned haha
We laugh now, but this is the future of music. Just watch
Holy shit the opening track is literally just Funky Town from Shrek.
He&#39;s trolling us. It&#39;s that simple.
I feel emotionally raped after this shit,oh Corey WHY WHY WHY???
watch his live performance on the Today Show. Dude clearly isn&#39;t trolling; he actually thinks he&#39;s making good music. kinda feel bad for him and all the people mocking him on Facebook. He&#39;s stuck in some weird broken child phase like Michael Jackson -- you can tell by all the cheesy upbeat lyrics and the fact it sounds like a record for kids.
I believe the pre-synth lead section at around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=550">9:10</a> samples Derezzed by Daft Punk.
It triggers me 😂😂😂
Lickity Splickity sounds like a banger
This guy has such focus, commitment and patience to be able to sit through and talk about so many albums that are really awful. A true, busy music nerd!
Anthony, this is cyber bullying, and I demand you take it down!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=884">14:44</a> BURP
Sounds like dance pop Ariel Pink for retards to me.
Corey Feldman: Delusional to the Core
This review is 50 minutes long? The fuck!
People actually bought this album ...
Corey: I&#39;m in the prime of my youth and  I&#39;ll only young once<br>River: Yeah but you&#39;re gonna be stupid the rest of your life.
This album is ironic, like everything related to it lmao
light 0 to -1
That is amazingly bad. It is over 90 minutes. It is $18.99 on Amazon. I thought it would be about $3.99 by now. It is so awful I want to own it so I can share it with others. It sounds like 3 songs are getting played at the same time. How could Yoko allow him to ruin Working Class Hero? What is worse is watching him perform these songs live. Watch him dance on the Today show to his shit song. You can rank this worst album of the decade with 3 years left
Corey Feldman currently has 9,481 listeners on Spotify. Wow.
first song is lit lol
man fuck that nurd
The only time I&#39;ve ever been glad to see an ad.
we know about this album and all Anthony but... album of the year? really?
is like seeng myself talking about regaetoon
his vocals reminds me a lot of Ambient Massage song by Rhett 😂😂😂
A2TC &gt; TPAB
Instead of a fifty minute review, you could&#39;ve done Corey&#39;s in ten and also have reviewed a Tool record
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1629">27:09</a> ♪Feeling like a freak on a leash♪
the cycle of emotions from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=824">13:44</a> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=863">14:23</a> is oscar worthy
Thumbs up if Corey should future on a track with Cal Chuchesta
I seriously have so many questions about this album.
Anthony,  I&#39;m an engineer.<br><br>first off, I wouldn&#39;t want any credit on this album. I wouldn&#39;t mix this in a way that I would mix my other clients no way... idk what you pay me. I&#39;m talking the money but this... this is plumbers don&#39;t wear ties all over again. this is a new low... I cant...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=560">9:20</a> It sounds like a rip off of Party Rock Anthem. I bet that was the most recent pop song he listened to before making the record.
You made a 50 minute video about this album? You needlessly tortured yourself for almost an hour.
For real, does anyone but Cory like this? How tone deaf do you have to be to enjoy it?
I laughed so many times during this video
Just an aside: Die Antwoord is pronounced &quot;Dee&quot; with a short &#39;e&#39;... Dog ek sê maar net :)
Somehow this album has made me love Limp Bizkit...Corey has made Limp Bizkit look great
this album is ten years in the making
&quot;Seamless&quot; sounds like a duet between a cartoon villain and his dopey sidekick.
Lickety Splicktano
It sounds like David Draiman was forced at gunpoint to impersonate Michael Jackson and Justin Timberlake in the same studio session.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Love Anthony&#39;s facial expressions when he starts a new song
I fucking CRIED at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1626">27:06</a>, holy fucking shit... !!! 😭😭😭
did anyone else laugh when he played everybody?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1324">https://youtu.be/L3E0kq9YkjA?t=22m4s</a><br><br>anyone else here daft punk - get lucky? is that not the exact same sort of sound / vibe ripped off here lol - no dbout what he was going for but the fail lol
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23grandpaskrillex">#GrandpaSkrillex</a>
angelic 2 the core is actually a masterpiece i re-listened to it a couple of times
When someone flat out laughs their ass off when listening to your life&#39;s work. 😂
better than Radiohead entire discography
I never thought I&#39;d sit and watch this all the way through without pausing, but I did and it hurt my sides.
cant believe this is what the dog from that movie became
What the hell are those sounds at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=729">12:09</a> ?? Sounds like somebody recorded then looped Corey making these strange growly noises. Who the fuck said &#39;&#39;Oh man, amazing idea right there!&#39;&#39; You gotta really wonder about the mental health and self-awareness of this guy.
I feel like this &quot;album&quot; is an attempt at mashing all of Prince&#39;s albums together.
The second song&#39;s synth sounds a lot like Demi Lovato&#39;s &quot;Neon Lights&quot;. Please like so others see
&quot;It&#39;s almost like post punk, the vocals are so bad it&#39;s accidentially experimental.&quot;
what a fucking legend
I wish he named it angelic to the corey
When you watch a review of an album and the best thing isn&#39;t the album it&#39;s Anthony&#39;s awesome tattoo. I&#39;m sorry he had to endure this album.
Took me three days to get through this video. THREE DAYS!
Corey is like a crappy knock off brand of Alice Cooper trying to be experiment al
i like the way yoou lose faith to the humanity
Kurupt and Snoop were on this album?! WHAT THE FUCK?! I&#39;m stunned lol dudes went from The Chronic, Doggystyle and the Dogg Food albums to this?
I doubt this album is actually serious.
the bottom corners of the album cover go past the green square 0.o
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=570">9:30</a> that synth lead sounds like Chris Brown &quot;Turn Up The Music&quot;
You can&#39;t imagine my relief after I&#39;ve finished watching this video and remembered that good music still exists
holy fuck I had no idea what I was getting myself into when I clicked this video.. This music is doing things to me that I&#39;m not okay with, I never knew music could do that. I feel scared, confused, and very, very concerned about Corey...
The song at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1489">24:49</a> ain&#39;t too bad actually to be honest.
J.Boles album is worse than this.
And this was the beginning of Anthony&#39;s descent into becoming the Clown Prince of Darkness, the Joker!
That song bad people sounds like it&#39;s  trying to rip off people by gorillaz
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1454">24:14</a> OMFG!! 😂 I&#39;m genuinely SHOCKED at how terrible this track is. I just fucking can&#39;t! 😭 Why?! 😧😅
is this album worst than Kid Cudis Speedin Bullet 2 heaven?
if its so bad why spend 50mins on it
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1035">17:15</a> he isn&#39;t standing in these vids?? what
Snoop recorded those lyrics on his phone and sent that shit in via carrier pigeon.
Is &quot;earbleach&quot; a thing?
To be honest an album that&#39;s &#39;Beyond Parody&#39; couldn&#39;t be a more perfect representation of 2016.
I read that he was raped as a child and did some drugs.  probably had an effect on his sanity.
wasnt Corey Feldman a teen idol in the 80s? I can imagine Justin Bieber coming out with something like this in 25 years.
It&#39;s Swiftian satire right?
Do I see a Cal x Feldman collabs in the future
It&#39;s so bad I actually find some of these songs good
idk whats up with you here anthony this dude is mike patton&#39;s supreme successor<br>this album is a 10/10
Wow...Negativity sounds like a B-Side from Metal Gear Revengeance. Dogshit Squared.
We Wanted Change is sort of a masterpiece in awfulness, I kind of love it.
He&#39;s lost it
I kind of want to listen to it just for the laughs.
this album is the longest 90&#39;s commercial ever
lmao
That&#39;s one odd looking lesbian in the video
Still better than most rap these days.
i luckily have not heard this album yet, should i or should i not?
This album is trascendent and yall too dumb to understand!
The story of one man&#39;s descent into madness.
The first track sounds like a villain theme from a tv Disney movie
shouldn&#39;t this be on thatistheplan?
sounds like he tried to make some Kpop hits but it didnt work out at all
Coming back to this video makes me instantly start laughing. You can totally see the desperation on his face trying to find ways to describe the awfulness that is this catastrophe. Love +theneedledrop so glad I found it and this review! Genius review, I&#39;m constantly laughing I love it
I guess Todd from Bojack Horseman finally finished his rock opera
You should of submitted this episode to the emmys for best comedy special.
I think we found Trump&#39;s inauguration performance.
you crossed the line, do the bartman
trying to get that health care plan
Sounds like kids bop 80s grown up remedial edition
This album is the Joker to Fantano&#39;s Batman
I&#39;d love to see him do this type of video but for a album he loves. like get n deep about what parts of what songs portray themes in the album
There is pain in that laugh.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1300">21:40</a> I kinda liked the horns<br>oh wait, someone alreasy said that
this whole album is a cringe hahaha the clips were more then enough no way i could listen to a full song let alone the album...
Feldman broke Fantano
This idiot can&#39;t even get his pop-culture references right. Nevermind the &quot;Batman&quot; lick, does this dumbass not realize that &quot;Your mission, should you choose to accept it&quot; was <b>never</b> in &quot;Charlie&#39;s Angels&quot;, it&#39;s from &quot;Mission Impossible&quot;. Was your brain just too pulverized by this godawful mess to catch that, Anthony? ;)
It sounds like that negativity song just consists of pre-made 4 bar loops from Garageband, the kids version of Logic Pro haha
You need a certain level of intelligence to appreciate Corey Feldmans music
I never thought I would say this, but...Snoop Dogg might need an intervention.
how is this real jesus
Pink Guy&#39;s album is a 10/10 compared to this all jokes aside.
this album is like a really bad trip
holy shit that fred durst track. that was hilarious. it just descends into screaming over each other hahaha.
C&#39;mon, Anthony. You can&#39;t possibly think this album is serious. This dude was in Sharknado 3. This is the album version of the hilariously terrible movie. It&#39;s Philosophy of the World without the accidental genius.
First song in and I&#39;m actually crying from laughing so much at the composition. This can&#39;t be real.
This is the St. Pepper&#39;s of our generation. A true masterpiece.
the niece bit is the funniest hahaha
The first song reminds me of Mogwai&#39;s Mexican Grand Prix and has effectively soured Mogwai for me.Thanks Corey.
YO ANTHONY. Did you hear the NEW Corey Feldman track feat. MC ride and Kendrick Lamar?
damn how did I miss such a classic review
the only way this took 10 years to make and came out like this was Corey had to.. he HAD TO.. record a portion anytime he was drunk or totally smashed like &quot;Oh shit.. I gotta finish my album&quot;<br><br>or you know it could&#39;ve been on purpose <br><br>also it&#39;s awesome to actually hear Anthony listen to the tracks while talking about how bad something is
this is why we must stop child molestors.. cause the kids grow up to make songs like this<br><br><br>[Corey Feldman says he and the other Corey used to get passed around by grown men if you didn&#39;t know]
50 MINUTES😭😭😭😭
On the second song he totally ripped off Cobra Starship&#39;s You Make Me Feel.
Lickety Splickety sounds like a discarded early draft of Rick and Morty&#39;s Get Shwifty. &quot;No, I think on reflection, the title &quot;Lickety Splickety&quot; is just too dumb. Let&#39;s go with Get Schwifty after all...&quot;
delusional 2 the core
He truly cackles.
I died of laughter already at the second track, this is gonna be a treat.
&quot;White people ruin everything&quot; !! LMAO
I finally figured it out: This album reminds me of any climax of any musical disney channel movie where the big pop band is about to blow everyone away and it&#39;s so fucking awful even as a kid you vomited in your mouth a little
this album is military grade
HOW IS THIS NOT SATIRICAL
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1995">33:15</a> PLEASE LET THAT INTRO BE A FUCKING JOKE BECAUSE IT&#39;S COMEDY GENIUS!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1425">23:45</a>
It just sounds like what I would hear from the dude I see every day in front of Wal-Mart.
Speedin Bullet 2 Heaven is not that bad compared to this
lmao this album broke Anthony. Call repair man pls
I went to listen to some of the songs and had to stop cuz my anxiety was kickin in bruh... Shit is no joke
why does he sound like a bad impression of Mark Hamill&#39;s Joker?
This is literally the real atrocity exhibition
Best review of anything ever 😂
GRANDPA SKRILLEX! LMFAOOOOO
I was waiting for him to rate the album, I thought he would give him at least a 3 but since he didn&#39;t I think he might felt a light -1 to a strong 0 on this one
You won&#39;t understand this album until you watch Mac Miller&#39;s S.D.S music video. This is the greatest concept record of our generation. Don&#39;t review this album if you are too stupid to actually LISTEN. Thank you. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23bestalbum2016">#bestalbum2016</a>
Vocals sound like an untalented Mike Patton
Rumours suggest that the US Department of Defense is developing a weaponised version this album for use on the Syrian front
Is there anyone who enjoyed this album? Like, what did his family and friends tell him? What was his manager&#39;s feedback?<br>This album just raises way too many questions it stresses me out
Check out my music, it&#39;s bad<br><a href="https://soundcloud.com/g_murrda">https://soundcloud.com/g_murrda</a>
KURUPT IS ON THIS
this cant be real
Give him a break guys, his father stormed the beach at Normandy...
Corey is an underappreciated genius!
Some of these tracks seriously remind me of some of the music numbers from Tim and Eric skits
my dad really likes the wizard of oz
Anyone know where can I get the only vocals version? These vocals kill! Thanks in advance!
After watching this, I&#39;ve decided that I really want to listen to the album.
Thank you! The adam west batman intro to Charlie&#39;s angels really made me gag several times
so is this a 0
When theneedledrop accidentally improvises a Jesse McCartney hit while trashing Corey Feldman
Should have drank some Evan Williams. It takes the edge off.
skipped this one, but just seen it for the first time after watching your worst albums of 2016. this is fucking gold. i hope one day someone finds this 100 or 200 years in the future. lmao
Welcome to this review, if you just watched Anthony&#39;s worst Album 2016 list. It&#39;s 50 minutes of pain, but also, fun.
whoa you disin corey feldman<br> now you crossed the line<br>you crossed the line<br>you crossed the line<br>you crossed the line<br>you crossed the line<br>you crossed the liiiine
if you removed his vocals from some of these songs, they could pass as being legitimate dance music. go 4 it could easily be a good song if all the vocals were removed. he ruins so much of this album with his fucking voice.
plot twist : kendrick lamar will use this album as inspiration for TPAB 2
I hope Corey uses samples of fantano on his next project
Fuck that cover is killing my eyes
When I kill myself I want this playing on my smartphone, it will make jumping off the bridge more easy.
Wow
Spoiler Alert: This is on his worst of the year list...<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Its only number two.
You look like a mortal Cal Chuchesta.
I didn&#39;t think it could be as bad as you made it out to be but  this is probably the worst album I have ever heard.
The album is so bad that it cannot be found to illegally download :(
corethany feldtano
I feel he secretly love this album
ya laugh have me weak niggaa lmaooo
It sounds really terrible but to be honest it doesn&#39;t sound any worse than a lot of the shit pop music you hear on the radio or on TV.<br>Lady Gaga, Katy Perry and Nicki Minaj are no better than this.
WYLD STALLIONS!!!!
I could watch hours of fantano reacting live to the shittiest songs.
this is probably pretty much what a  Kanye record sounds like in the early stages lol
whats sad is if you actually read the lyrics it seems like corey really wants to help people around the world...what he doesn&#39;t realize is he&#39;s the one who actually needs the help lol...poor bastard
Corey Feldman or IceJJFish??
Coming to a charity shop near you soon.
U think he needs a producer he&#39;s like j dilla nujabes and madlib rolled into one
BEST REVIEW EVER
!!!
This is worse than the latest Br3ttD0g59 release and that&#39;s really saying something.
Feldman kinda sounds like he&#39;s trying to sound like Patton when he growls.
review any initial D soundtrack melonhead
i wont be surprised if Corey killed himself in 2017
best album 2016
This album isn&#39;t even good at being a cry for help.
I mean no ill will but you should do more videos like this. It doesn&#39;t have to be necessarily bad albums, but you had me laughing my ass off more than I had in a while. Sucks I don&#39;t have friends as weird and funny as you, but at the same time, I may be partly to blame for that. <br><br>P.S. I feel so weird talking this sentimentally about my disposition considering I&#39;m 20 and (cue bad impression of Rick from The Walking Dead) should be talkin&#39; to people and be doin&#39;...stuff and...THANGS (!!!) (end impression) like &quot;normal&quot; people my age rather than sulk like an emo twat about being &quot;forever alone&quot;
I found a worse music. Little t from bgmedia on youtube
BOUT MAH NIECE
Admittedly, I laughed along with Fantano through the entire hour of this vid even though I was also slightly angry that Feldman actually got a producer and a label to release this hot mess. Of course he got guys like Durst to help shit out this musical abortion to torture the public.
wow 50 minutes of trashing. glorious.
It&#39;s like generic 2010s edm mixed with bad 90s pop while a tone deaf man sings country songs over it
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=807">13:27</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=890">14:50</a> is one my favorite parts of this! The way he says &quot;JESUS CHRIST&quot; make me laugh so hard! 😂😂😂😂😂
If Tommy Wiseau made a Pop album...
i made a mixtape this year and i tried to make it as bad as i could, and it&#39;s still objectively better than this trash
This is what it sounds like when shallow people with no self-awareness try to make &quot;deep&quot; art.
This album is beyond description... so here is a 50-minute description. Lol.
honestly it&#39;s impressive because you have to put so much goddam effort to make an album so bad
I&#39;ve watched this probably close to 20 times.
I love how bewildered he is, and laughs at it because it&#39;s so insanely perplexing that something this shitty could exist.
....aye ....duh kinda goes hard....lmfao jk I&#39;ll stop that
First of all License to Drive is one of the best movies ever. I know what you are going to say, &quot;Corey Haim (RIP) made that move good.&quot; Regardless, they are both very talented.  I give Corey Feldman&#39;s album an 8.4532 out of 10. I think being the voice of Donatello in the first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles should give some credence to anything he does in the future.  And also since the death of his best friend, and fellow brat pack, Corey Haim, you could see the impact it had in his later work. I think this album is darker and more self-reflective then some of his earlier stuff.  Once again this album is an absolute 8.4532 and easily one of ROF&#39;s albums of the year candidate.
mmmmmmmmmhmmmm.
this is the BEST ALBUM of the year for me,i have never laughed so much in many years.ty corey:)
if Kanye West made some shit like this, yall would be slobbin on his knob, callin it a 10/10. Shame...
you need to review IceJJFish albums
I only recognize him from the Dad in Back to the Future
would you say that my unfinished-but written and coherently directed album (still in production) is better than this fucking trash?<br><br><a href="https://soundcloud.com/daniel-williams-303/sets/cii-myth">https://soundcloud.com/daniel-williams-303/sets/cii-myth</a>
Are all the people hating on baldony fatano people that actually like the album???
Fuck you Anthony you wouldn&#39;t know art if it hit you in the face with it&#39;s Hollywood dick.
LOL
20 years ago this would&#39;ve been a horrible horrible piece of garbage. Today, I predict this will go quadruple recycle bin
Also please review J.Cole For your eyez only
Review Stoney Deluxe by Post Malone please
I hope if another extremely terrible album is released, you give it the same treatment as this. I love going through each track and riffing them. Hilarious.
Sooooooooooooo it goes from funk/dubstep to 50&#39;s style jazz? WHAT THE FUX!!!!!!!!!
Whenever he played the tracks I was left wondering if I was hearing something wrong, or that actually was the music.
I dig most of Lil Peeps stuff but yeah, Hellboy was disappointing. Crybaby was a lot better. Nothing revolutionary, but good sad trap
&quot;Do it lickity splicky&quot;
Grandpa Skrillex = Nightmare Slain.
Grandpa skrillex is the fucking best nickname for him
Trey Parker and Matt Stone are gonna have a field day with this shit lol
This album is proof that not all ideas are good.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s going to be very competitive in the &quot;gag gift&quot; market though. I actually halfway suspect that&#39;s what his intention is and has been this entire time. Surely it&#39;s a joke... right? ... Right??
[NOT GOOD] LOOOOL
This album is one giant meme
TRIGGERED
Anthony got that soft lady body...I&#39;d like to touch it while I listen to some Feldman.
This is the musical equivalent of Sonic the Hedgehog fan OC...
R u fat or muscly I can&#39;t even tell
To be fair, Snoop was great on Plastic Beach.
Imagine all the people listening to music in peace
&quot;GO 4 IT! FEAT SNOOP DOGG *E...&quot; This video is no longer available due to a copyright claim by Selin Stone.
When he actually played some music instead of linking it i knew this was gonna be a good episode.
Still the best review on the channel 😂😂
I was like haha this cant be worse than Justin Bieber right? I was very wrong.
That song with Fred Durst was just ............
How does this stack up to Miley Cyrus and her &#39;Dead Petz&#39; though?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2111">35:11</a> this song sounds like something david liebe hart wrote and performed
That album cover is awfully tacky photoshop. It looks like the angels are....&quot;breaking wind&quot; with the smoke......
The one you said was the worst is the best song of the year. Reminds me of &#39;life in a glass house&#39; by radiohead
is that an explosions in the sky tattoo?
That song corey is singing at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2060">34:20</a> would be perfect for a serial killer slaughter montage.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2152">35:52</a>, what song is this?
Wow. It&#39;s really shitty tattoo on your arm. Piece of art from drunkenhand artist?
i love this album it made a good dog toy to give my dog for christmas
Corey Feldman is almost accidentally Mike Patton. <br>Mike Patton in shit and glitter and rolling face ft. Fred Durst.
i was waiting for cal to show up the whole time lol
is this even  our dimension  ??....
This is a groundbreaking album. Music is about breaking the rules, becoming the new norm and being a trendsetter. And with Corey Feldman&#39;s attributes he showcases all those ingredients with this 2cd shitfest extravaganza.
Why&#39;d he make a 22 track album? Perhaps he should have narrowed it down to maybe 5 songs and focused more on them. Narrowing it down to 1 song would have actually been a better idea.<br>Corey, get one song right before you focus on another 21. <br>This is what musical frustration sounds like.<br>This album should have been titled Delusional 2 the Core.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1446">24:06</a> omfg
You all most have to go buy it because it&#39;s so bad !!!! You know, proof that something could be this bad!
review big boat by phish
Is this music? I want to die. Give me everything Fred Durst has done at one time before I listen to any more of this...
lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1589">26:29</a> is just killing me.
it literally makes me feel like its making me retarded
It sounds like he recorded this album on the fly, not caring  how it sounds lol
With all the money he has, he needs to hire someone with a bit of tact. I mean, his album cover looks like it was cut and pasted by a kid using PC Windows paint.
Isn&#39;t Snoop retired? He probably does this shit for fun.
I&#39;ve legitimately listened to and watched this review for about 70 times now and I don&#39;t regret one single time I&#39;ve done so, because this is the best thing Anthony has ever thrown at us.
Have you guys noticed that he sounds a little bit like Dave Mustaine from TWNAH era?
Broken Fantano
I&#39;m sort of new to this page, but THIS REVIEW IS 50 MINUTES LONG!!!! HOT DAAAAMN!!
lost brain cells ....
What going on everyone Triggeredny Trigtano here
It&#39;s like an alternate universe where Danny Sexbang was a fucking moron
If you haven&#39;t blasted &quot;Ascension Millennium&quot; &amp; &quot;Go 4 It&quot; driving down Sunset with the top down you haven&#39;t lived. <b>YOU WILL GET NOTICED!!! GO 4 IT!!!</b>
Corey Feldman should have charged people to NOT be on this album... He&#39;d be Bill Gates rich.
This review is the best publicity Corey Feldman could get, 400,000 views of a horrible album is still 400,000 people who may not have heard about of it before. I&#39;m just looking for a silver lining but failing.
I swear if Corey Feldman would&#39;ve just made this a comedy/joke album like a musical version of &quot;I&#39;m Still Here&quot; with Joaquin Phoenix it would have been at least a novelty.
Grandpa Skrillex... Genius
this album sounds like the oompa loompa songs from the newer version of Charlie and the chocolate factory
why is anthony&#39;s torso so huge
The worst tatoo on left arm /\
Heads should roll.
For kicks, compare this to Crispin Glover&#39;s album Big Problem Solution Let It Be.  Take note, actors - THAT&#39;S how you do weird if yer gonna make an album!!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=444">7:24</a>-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=461">7:41</a> is the most beautiful reaction of a shitty song that I&#39;ve ever seen.
Just as a quick aside, has anyone seen the fucking website for this shit? <br><br>It looks like it was made circa 2003, with jpeg artifacts everywhere and super low-quality images of Corey and his angels plastered all over the place.<br><br>It&#39;s just chock full of depressing accolades that the album has &quot;achieved&quot; such as the track &#39;Remember 222&#39; reaching number 23 on the Cashbox Radio Network, &#39;Everybody&#39; hitting number 13 on &quot;Digital Radio&quot; and &#39;Take A Stand&#39; being featured in some independent comedy called Zero Dark Dirty, which is tragic since I&#39;m pretty sure the song was intended to be 100% serious.<br><br>There&#39;s also tons of videos of him performing here and there, some of which appears to be in local bars, but he seems deluded enough to think that this is just the build-up to arena tours, judging by the imagery plastering this site.<br><br>It&#39;s all unbelievably cringeworthy, but overall I just feel sad looking at all of this.
Again, you understand NOTHING.
Gran pappy Skrillex. ouch. 😂😂😂😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=460">7:40</a><br>Reminds me of when the Nostalgia Critic snapped, drove to Home Depot to buy a crowbar, and smashed the <i>Neverending Story III</i> DVD.
the worst music is at j Loserhead&#39;s SoundCloud HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=882">14:42</a> your welcome
&quot;Lickity splikety&quot; I&#39;m dying.
It&#39;s prog, you just don&#39;t understand the beauty of this LP. Degenerate.
I want this album for Christmas.
The random placement of some of the horns just reminds me of &quot;My Lovely Horse&quot; from Father Ted, with the psychedelic saxophone solo.
Corthony Feldtano trying to hold it together during that &quot;we wanted change&quot; song is fucking gold.
It&#39;s funny too because a lot it does sound like out of the 90s or before, like out of his hey day. He&#39;s still living in that time. I heard he even has a Street Fighter 2 arcade machine in his living room, that&#39;s no joke by the way.
I swore for a moment it sounded like he ripped off some sounds from the <b>Thriller</b> album.
&quot;Shouldn&#39;t someone go to prison?......Shouldn&#39;t someone be in jail?&quot; This is by far your best video.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=882">14:42</a> pretty much sums up this record!
Worst album ever, in hindsight.<br><br>&quot;WEEEEeeeeEEEEeee wanted change&quot;
fam, I just watched the today show performance and was legit suicidal for a hot minute
Too avant-garde for me
&#39;its almost unfair to the other bad albums out there&#39; LOL
Horrible Music ... and retarded weird live performance.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1678">27:58</a> was my breaking point, what was yours?
these responses are hysterical
Youre totally right!!! HE TOOK THE BEAT FROM THE SONG DIE YOUNG BY KESHA!!!!
So bad it&#39;s good
I&#39;m gonna listen to this shit on 2 tabs of acid fuck it😂😂😂😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=941">15:41</a><br>JESUS CHRIST <br>IS THAT A FUCKING RECORDER???!???
Are you 100% sure this is supposed to be a serious album? I have a hard time believing this because god fucking damn that&#39;s terrible.
THIS ENTIRE VIDEO HAD ME IN TEARS LMFAO
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1421">23:41</a> Lmfao! Listen to how feldman sings that backup part after durst. Lmao you have to listen to that, guaranteed laughs.
Yo, Anthony... You looked like you went through torture, so I&#39;m giving you a Like for your sacrifice...
I  think mine is worse<br><a href="https://soundcloud.com/thelatenightboiz/sets/vibes-ep">https://soundcloud.com/thelatenightboiz/sets/vibes-ep</a>
It sounds like a garbage version of Eiffel 65.
You can actually see him slowly losing his sanity
please tell me the album is on streaming i wanna live the experience
this album being released is like when you hand in a test thinking &quot;dude I aced that shit&quot; and then finding out you got 0
All I can think of is suicide now.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=833">13:53</a> I was kinda into this track at first, nothing really to complain about going into it. But god... thoughs vocals... why
I&#39;ve watched this video like 8 times.
The album will get famous for all the negative commentary on it. <br>The mixing on this album sounds horrendous. <br>Corey really went to try and be a jack of all trades on this but unfortunately was a master of none.<br><br>$22 dollars he&#39;s looking for for this on C.D.
It&#39;s got a certain something. That something isn&#39;t good. I don&#39;t even know what that something is. But this album has it.
Wow, you were right Anthony.
It&#39;s saddening to think of all the true talent that will never see 1/100th of the attention that this drivel has received. Granted, this shit is pretty much unanimously acknowledged as garbage but still, he&#39;s famous and he is still being booked to perform.
Tankthony Toptano here.
&quot;<br><br>HNo the stars are past the moon. How do you bring the moon past the stars? Jesus that makes no sense&quot;
when he&#39;s just wearing a wife beater you know the album&#39;s shit
This album is almost as bad as your tattoos
I thought you were overreacting when you said it was the worst álbum of the year, or maybe of the decade. You proved me wrong. This is awful, for real.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=881">14:41</a> is it just me or was this completely unexpected yet so awesome.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1310">21:50</a> The sound of that horn is the patience in his brain deflating like a balloon.
This was secretly made for the  CIA torture program and it accidentally leaked
The best part about this review was your laugh
Anthony, I just listened to the whole record last night. And I have to say, IT&#39;S THE WORST ALBUM OF ALL TIME!!
Cried laughing at times. I hung in there with you all the way thru, but I must admit that I AM DISAPPOINTED that after all the ranting and raving theres NO RATING?!?! I mean theres not even a NO NO NO NO NO a 1 or 0 for that fact! All in all, good video...I guess.
I&#39;d give up my first born child to hear a Corey Feldman live or acapella album.
Guantanamo Bay mix 2017!  If only he got paid every time they&#39;re going to spin this record.
I got a chill up my spine when you said brokencyde
Desiigner&#39;s New English - Strong 2 to Light 3<br>California - Light to Strong 2<br>No Heart - Light to Strong 3<br>Unleashed - Light 2 to Strong 1<br>Showtime - Light to Strong 1<br>Angeglic 2 The Core - Strong 10 to Light 11<br>The Violent Sleep Of Reason - Stromg 4 to Light 5
Existence is pain
Oh my Christ Fred Durst&#39;s on the album
If we get into WWIII, instead of waterboarding any captured terrorists and/or spies, we should tie them down and make them listen to this album over and over again (after having first given them a strong laxative.) And the UN would condemn us, in ringing tones, of committing acts of the vilest, most inhuman savagery against enemy forces...
I don&#39;t get it, his music sounds normal to me, not my genre, but still not worst
Maybe Feldman is alot smarter than we all think. Realizing if he truly tried to make the best music he can, to possibly have some catchy songs where he can develop some type of fan base n go on tour n make some money, he would get nothing. It would just be boring and no one would care. Instead, he makes the worlds shittiest music ever, which at least jolts some ppls curiosity. They wanna kno what the devils fart sounds like and laugh. Also ppl will go and see him now, the way they would see a comedy movie. laughing at those ridiculous dance moves n clothes. Seriously, that has to be it right? this is not real? No way in hell can anyone make this trying their best for ten years. No friend would allow it, he realized he sucks n this was a decision based on money.
Dude, ur soo funny, the part when you knew we all would say &quot;ur right anthony, this is the worst song&quot;. omg, that shit cracked me up so hard the moment the song played. Right away too, haha, it only took a few seconds to realize it. lol, How was that not a joke? how can anyone even allow that to be on a album?
I keep coming back to this review. It&#39;s like a music review and a comedy sketch combined. Pure gold.
Ｄｏ ｉｔ Ｌｉｃｋｅｔｙ Ｓｐｌｉｃｋｅｔｙ
WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE WERE TOGETHAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Anthony&#39;s spirit is truly broken by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2435">40:35</a> lmaaoo
LOL that Brokencyde diss
Always wanted to see the back of your head<br><br>Good meme
fantano&#39;s laugh plus dancing plus this music had me almost crying LOL xfd omfg
He makes Vanilla Ice seem like a goddamn genius -_-
Lol these comments make me want to get the album
how can anyone do this to music? seriously my ears are bleeding...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=891">14:51</a> Sounds Like GTA Store Music.
worst tattoos of YouTube
Zebra Katz is worse
Sounds like Mike Patton lol
So you&#39;re saying we should buy it ?
That moment when Anthony can sing better than Corey. XD
This makes &quot;Electronic Supersonic&quot; sound like Thriller
Every song sounds like the deep cuts from a 1990s straight to video ninja turtles movie soundtrack.
This, particularly the last few tracks, sounds like it&#39;s ripped off from a South Park - Finger Bang album.
Love your channel Anthony! How can I get you to give me feedback on my band??? <a href="https://www.reverbnation.com/runningriot6">https://www.reverbnation.com/runningriot6</a>
Find an album worse than this? Just pick any Kesha album...
Be A Man by Randy Savage should fight this album
Wow... worse than sb2h huh?
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23triggered">#triggered</a>
This album is the &#39;The Room&#39; of music. Does Tommy Wiseau have a production credit?
Haven&#39;t heard this yet, I&#39;m gonna go listen to 20 seconds of it just to decide if it&#39;s worse than King 810 lol
He&#39;s brought out of the depths of hell(, while he should have stayed there) I immediately heard it
corey feldman was one of many hollywood child fuckdolls. corey haim killed himself because of his past, elijah wood has also started talking about it. check it out for yourself, would be nice to finally get the names of the perpetrators.
sounds like a bad mj and prince rip off
2deep4u melon head
so there&#39;s something worse this year than Of Mice &amp; Men&#39;s Cold World?
I turned on autogenerated subtitles, and I swear it registered one of the songs as applause
After I heard this review I had to check it out.. yes you are right it&#39;s awful
If Joel and the bots were forced to listen to music on MST3K......
I mean, I think the head angel or whatever is a DJ. She&#39;s probably the one who produced and/or mixed a lot of this garbage. This is the sort of shit that a coke addict would think sounds good because they&#39;re on coke. Reminds me of those scenes from The Sopranos with AJ and Christopher &quot;making moves&quot; in the music business lollllll
way too many things going on in all the songs.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1895">31:35</a> was definitely Lisa Loeb&#39;s Stay.
&quot;I dare you to find an album worse than this&quot;<br>Alright...how about...<br>&quot;Samen&quot; by öOoOoOoOoOo
Corey Feldman&#39;s album won&#39;t even make it to the dollar store shelves. It&#39;s so awful.
this record crushed his soul and I fucking love it
His torso is so smooth  ._.
Let&#39;s steer clear of tank tops, champ.
&quot;grandpa skrillex&quot; bahahaha
Michael Jackson&#39;s spirit is trying to posses Corey Feldman, and their souls are merging as a result. This is the truth.
Michael Jackson&#39;s spirit is trying to posses Corey Feldman, and their souls are merging as a result. This is the truth.
sounds like it could be a South Park piss take?????
it would have to be atleast 1,600,000,000 but thats only for 30 seconds on the song
theres a plan here.  make a record so bad that people buy it to laugh at or rattle up a party.  really bad albums get just as much talk as great ones.
soooo......a strong 8?
........u ok dude?
I can&#39;t believe the horns on that song with snoop with. Jesus,that sounds crazy
I cant stop laughing. this is ridiculous
oh my god
My mixtape is still 100 times worse than this.
Perfect review of this turdpile of an album. Had me laughin! But damn homeboy brush your teeth and do a few push ups once in a while.
I want my hearing back please. Who could ever, ever put their name on this album as Producer-Engineer water boy, janitor etc. Snoop just likes money so no issue with him, Fred is just as bad as Corey so no lose there.  My God how can any Talk Show even let this guy perform is just beyond me. Time for 24 hours of non-stop Led Zeppelin to clear my head of this complete disaster.
&quot;Grandpa Skrillex&quot; 😂😂😂😂
He looks like a broken man here, poor guy. Also, &quot;grandpa Skrillex&quot; is just great.
Ah no don&#39;t forget blink 18trios new shitz how of an album
best vaporwave album ever made...
EVERYONE IN THE COMMENTS HATES IT TOO, THE WORST ALBUM I ACTUALLY FEEL KIND OF INSPIRED
Wtf we know that&#39;s you thatistheplan, just be yourself and stop playing as these chump ass characters Anthony Fantano and cal Chuchesta
why not do something different and speak nicely of corey ? peoples need to bully him is exactly like joining in on the bullying of a kid in school.
You should review Strengths by Invalids. It&#39;s an absolute masterpiece math-rock album from a generally undiscovered band.
i love lil peep ):
you should get out of parents basement and do something useful for society.
To me I would call this the worst album based on the production value and the vocal performances. If this were mixed better, if Corey had vocal coaching and producers that could give him valuable feedback then you could even argue that the vision, the lyrics and his songs were &quot;awesomely bad&quot; like some cheesy 80s movie. But with the performances suck and the production value sucks any life and ingenuity out of this album to the point that you can&#39;t hear any fun or emotion out of this album. You can&#39;t hear anything enjoyable. You can only hear how bad it is.
This made me wanna start cutting myself who in the fuck green lit this pile of shit
You are awesome my friend! I&#39;m laughing through this whole video! Hah
bruh
I watch this every night before going to sleep.
This album is like a musical Cringe Compilation
dude this was funny as fuck
accidentally post-punk hahahahajaajjahahahahahshsjs
the actual fucking Neil Breen of music right there
Why are you wearing a wife beater shirt...I would be covering up those man blobs and nonexistent muscles and your tattoos aren&#39;t attractive either
ayy lmao
The wrong Corey died.
sad part is he said he was working on this album for yeeears  ....and it&#39;s complete garbage. lol
Corey Feldman is getting sued for putting me on suicide watch with this album
I forgot who was Corey Feldman was and looked it up on google, then I thought of myself this is a troll. Andd its not.......
this is my favorite review.
Almost feels like old school needledrop when Anthony used to play clips from the albums he reviewed.
Listened to this album. Can confirm, [NOT GOOD].
He never could act...and he sure as fuck cant sing...
You should do his older album &#39;Former Child Actor.&#39; It&#39;s even worse.
💖
This video and that wife-beater are equally as bad as this album.
Corey is a willing shill for Hillary Clinton it seems if you look at his facebook. I say willing because not even Hillary would pay this train wreck of a human being to shill for her.
sounds crazy
Honestly, though - If Corey Feldman offered me $1,000,000 to do a thirty second guest feature on one of his song, I would TOTALLY do it. In a heartbeat. I have neither shame nor artistic credibility or integrity to lose. I could use the money to make an actually GOOD album to win over all the fans I lost and to appease the critics who said that I sold out by doing a verse on a Feldman song - and still have money left over for some hookers-and-blow parties!
The year needs to end first before an album can be the worst
Angelic 2 the Core.<br><br>The <b>CORE.</b><br><br>COREy Feldman made an album called ANGELIC 2 THE <b>CORE.</b><br><br>I JUST GOT IT. FUCK.
the feldag
review any Cheif Kooffreh album
Its so terrible!, I cant look away.
the album is bad, VERY bad, but so is your fake, forced laughter. now, review the new darkthrone!
I respect anyone who actually puts in an effort in this impossible industry, true its not everyones cup of tea, but worst album of 2016??

You can see Anthony&#39;s sanity start to deteriorate as he kept playing more songs from this album.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2376">39:36</a> &quot;What is this vocal melody? dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-&quot;<br>That melody has been stuck in my head for weeks.
i like you but this is my 3rd attempt at watching this video why couldn&#39;t you review it without playing soooooooo much of it... this shit wears at you like idk how you can sit through this. so bad it aint even funny
People need to see the masterpiece that is the angelic 2 the core website. I shit you not, a signed copy of this album costs a hundred dollars.
dude feldman was close with MJ
He&#39;s just as bad as lil yachty.
Is it possible to be worse than speedin bullet to heaven?
Hilarious critique of an album that shouldn&#39;t have ever seen the light of day.
Pause this shit at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=460">7:40</a><br><br>Remember that talking severed zombie head from Return of the Living Dead part II? Fuck&#39;s sake...
ur fat
Can&#39;t afford a shirt?
One of my favorite podcasts out there right now is Jason Mantzoukas and Paul Scheer&#39;s &quot;How Did This Get Made&quot; where they rip and have fun with bad movies. If you and a couple of other guests could do the same with music, I think you might have something here. This is a fun watch.
Yes, Corey is awful, but at what point do you blame the producers and everyone else involved?
See,  now  when anyone sucks at anything , everyone will say yeah, he was the corey feldman of this or that,  thanks a lot  corey.for encouraging  no talent losers the world over  2 go4 it.
This is my favourite video of all time
this album is something that would be the soundtrack to a fever dream ffs I&#39;ve never heard music that&#39;s made me queasy until now
So a solid 4?
I think those tattoos are the worst ever...
He was molested.
why is this 50 minutes
This was released on New Years Day, isn&#39;t this kinda late?
Im getting a distinct Andy Kaufman feel from Corey Feldman lately.
And 22 songs!!! That&#39;s 22 more than necessary WTF!!!!!
I&#39;m laughing my ass off cuz your jokey impersonations of his voice are so much better than his shitty vocals. It makes me smile :)
Who is this butchy-woman on this video calling herself Anthony?
If I had to choose between listening to this third-rate album or this sexless dweeb-who thinks way to much of himself-I&#39;d pick Feldman <br>Would you shut up for 1 sec. gross guy!
still better than anything u could make tony u fuckin hack. PS nice exaggerated reactions those wacky faces seem totally genuine so glad there are like 3 ads on this vid you sure deserve the $$$ for looking bored and faking outrage over bad music and making the most basic ass observations about the songs PPS. i promise i wont tell anyone you stole all your mannerisms from sam hyde and made them 100 times less funny <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23teamcorey">#teamcorey</a>
is this trout mask replica
I agree. worst Album of the year. lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=186">3:06</a> Why is it SO difficult for you to say &quot;Die Antwoord&quot; correctly? You <i>do realize</i> those aren&#39;t English words, right?? I mean it feels absurd even asking you that, but fuck me, I cannot wrap my head around why you can&#39;t get it right. I mean train-wrecking the pronunciation of &quot;Autechre&quot; like you do is one thing, but messing up Die Antwoord is just ridiculous.
But what&#39;s the score?
Quality belch at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=884">14:44</a>, Fantano.
There is an album worse than this, look up Phantom Days by Tylias. somehow this guy got his shite out there
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2700">45:00</a> i heard &quot;a penis so big you feel nothing at all&quot;
FACE TAT- by Zach hill could possibly be a worse album
Everyone should see the Howard stern show episode where he tells Corey that he sucks and he sucks so bad that Howard and his band &quot;the losers&quot; are better then they face off in a rock battle it&#39;s great
The Die Antwoord roast 😫  Why Annie Fantani? Just let them live in their own little world and make their whacky trackies.
Thinkin&#39; about my knees~
Best Review ever. 😂😂😂
Greatest Fantano review ever.  I like this long-form style, playing clips from the tracks.
The vocals sound like Dave Mustaine impersonating Michael Jackson. Christ, this album is a fucking dumpster fire.
Maybe Chris Ray Gun has some extra Clorox for you.
&quot;Grandpa Skrillex&quot;<br><br>Nailed it
Best album of the year.                      <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>to laugh at!
This is the trv kvlt, fuck black metal, hail satan!
Feld-dog&#39;s jams sound sounds like the soundtrack to a bad, early 90&#39;s, sraight to DVD Disney movie. <br>And for some reason, the show &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot; popped into my mind during one of those songs. 😕
Not only did I spent an hour I&#39;ll never get back, I also spent another hour watching this video. <br><br><b>God, please let me die.</b>
Oh wow, I actually spent time listening to the record to get a scale of how horrible this album is. Fuck, I&#39;m not saying don&#39;t listen to it, please do! It&#39;s amazing how deep Feldman scraped the bottom of the empty shit barrel that is his life. This album is The Room of music. This man put this album out, folks! Even though it had no business making it past his imagination, he put it out there. We wanted change should be a soundbite sent to everyone, just to piss them off.<br><br>I can&#39;t get enough of this album. It&#39;s the saddest attempt. A Korn/POD/Limp Bizkit supergroup could do better than this...but sadly would be less entertaining.<br><br>This is more than a dumpster fire. This is a heap of abortion leftovers, mixed with human suffering. <br><br>This is the new bottom, people. Bask in it!
This album is truthfully awful, possibly one of the worst albums to ever be released. However, I can guarantee that it will at some point find a cult following. I imagine the same type of cult following that the movie &quot;The Room&quot; has. I won&#39;t be a part of the cult, but the people are out there. The cult just hasn&#39;t been formed yet. Things don&#39;t have to be &quot;good&quot; to gain a following. They just need media/publicity. Just look at how far Trump and Clinton got.
Dude, I&#39;m so glad I came across your reviews. Shitty day and this really pulled me through, love your humor.  I lost it when you got to lickity spliticky, lol fuck that&#39;s some awful &quot;music&quot;.  Your review was honest and insightful. i&#39;ll be watching more.
the most barable part of the album was the first half of wanna break free like when your bleeding out so much  and the pain finally stops  and you realize death is around the corner and you just accept it
ive watched this video atleast 10 times
Corey Feldman Vapourwave anyone?
I would rather listen to Trout Mask Replica, even though that album&#39;s a gigantic wild bunch of weird noise and madness and that&#39;s a classic album XD
Now I know this album was so bashed XD The samples of the album from the Amazon website were just horrid, forgettable, cringe worthy, generic, terrible, awful, embarrassing train wreck.
I can&#39;t find any information on this album other than it being released through Corey&#39;s own record label <br>So I&#39;m left to assume that he literally recorded this all himself. <br>I mean apparently it&#39;s a decade in the making on top of that, so.
not gonna lie, the hook on Ascension Millennium is pretty catchy in the shittiest, cheapest way possible.
This album should have been the entire Space Jam soundtrack
def worst album ever
I cant believe you actually listened to that whole album. Production isn&#39;t bad on some/most of the songs but his vocal ability is complete trash.
is this what they&#39;re making prisoners listen to now
This review has my fucking sides hurting 😂😂😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭💀💀💀
Subscribed because of this video. Amazing.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=943">15:43</a>
I had the exact thoughts about that weird ass jazz song Anthony. It could almost be an enjoyable track if it had been buried on some B-side by another band. Holy shit, I can&#39;t believe that song exists in this plane of reality.
The Angelic 2 The Core album but every chorus is replaced with the nutshack theme but each nutshack is replaced with an Angelic 2 The Core Skit
Another thing his &quot;style&quot; reminds me almost exactly of a duo called The Jesus Twins thru used to come on Howard Stern long time ago and they had the same thing they said it was a new sound we&#39;d never heard before. But they had good music the musicians were good but it was so corny and they danced weird too. And they were hot!!  So Corey may have  heard them he was a Howard fan for a long time.
I respect Corey doing his music it&#39;s definitely not for everyone. Me being one of those. But when you played the first song I don&#39;t know what was funnier you or the song. It just sounds dated unfortunately I did like the first song he did on the today show. He needs to stop dancing it&#39;s just way to old school. I love that he wants everyone to love each other and be kind he seems to have a good heart. I just like him from the movies. After all he did kill Jason in Friday the 13th pt 4 the final chapter!
The troll 2 of music
Second worst: Joytime by Marshmello<br>Everything by Marshmello is cringeworthy
Worsthony Albumtano here, internet&#39;s most triggered music nerd
i thought corey feldman died lol
The really sad part is that the lowest common denominator is Corey himself. On the rare occasion when ever the producing or the writing tries to shine, Feldman starts singing and then I die a little bit inside...
Crispin Glover has an album that equally ROCKS!!!
I think that you need help. Everything that you played spoke to my soul. I would rate him close to Elvis, Howlin Wolf, Stevie Ray Vaughn, Jimmy Hendrix, John Lennon and much more.
I need answers.<br>Answers on how the hell this happened.
Look, I love experimentation and genre-splicing when it&#39;s properly done properly, but Corey Feldman is horrible at it.  Why couldn&#39;t he have just stuck to one genre?  I would take generic pop punk over this mess.  At least that could be somewhat entertaining if it&#39;s done well.
OMG Anthony I always thought you were a dork but man, this video shows such a cool side of you.
The producer and engineer for this project were obviously paid entirely in rock cocaine
review randy savage&#39;s be a man. it&#39;s [GOOD]
can we trade him in and get haim back
This is how Hillary Clinton kills her snitches
album not even worhy enough to go in the greenscreen
ok the album is bad but this review is mostly nitpicking.. some of the stuff here are just as crappy as most pop music out there. I didnt hear anything in the tracks that you showed that is exceptionally bad or that I havent heard before on the radio
sure, corey&#39;s album is gonna suck, but i wish this critic would have had the decency to wear a shirt. cover it up.
This reminds me of a guy I knew who had some mental issues.  He would book studio time and record stuff.  Later he&#39;d play it for me and I&#39;d just give him encouragement because I felt bad for him.  I guess that&#39;s what everyone in the studio was doing while this was being made.
tl;dw
Absolute perfect nerd crush for me.... and so flippin&#39; hilarious...But you are spot on with your review....you look like you are suffering through this hahahaaa!
You need to wear a hat and cover up those God awful tattoos!!
PLZ REVIEW A RAED ALBUM
Bryan Silva&#39;s music from this year is worse than this. They are pretty close though
Simple plan put out an album this year, I’d be willing to bet it’s worse.
Ok I got it! Comparable to Eddie Murphys  Coming to America, &quot;Give it up for Sexual Chocolates&quot;. Or was that Arsenio Hall lol.
It sounds like pretty much anything on the charts these days....
Dance Gavin Dance - Mothership
Anthony is too much of a pleb to comprehend the patrician brilliance of corey feldman.
I don&#39;t think snoop does it for money I think he is just desperate for relevancy and will do anything on the off chance it might be a hit
This album is about bad vs good. In terms of music.
The only things that are worst of this record are Anthony&#39;s singlet and arm hair.
But Anthony this was 10 yrs in the making. So it&#39;s  got to be good right?!
it&#39;s so bad I can&#39;t even watch the video, sorry
Thank you so much for doing this for our entertainment. Sorry you had to go trough the whole thing - I really appreciate it. You the real MVP.
Corey Feldman is genuinely the sort of person that would go and murder people after watching this review. You&#39;re playing with fire <b>Coranthony Feldtano</b>.
Fucking hilarious
Shit album but all,the hipsters, of course, are demanding it (yes I work at a record store)
I had a good laugh, thank you
&quot;I was thinking about my niece&quot;That killed me right there.
Joyce Manor&#39;s Cody deserves a review.
Jesus, it&#39;s not thaaat bad.
The look of defeat in your eyes at minute 24 and track 12 of 22 is something I&#39;ll never forget.

I&#39;ve watched this video at least 5 times already... Oh god I&#39;m such a masochist...
The album is currently sitting a 4 out of 5 stars.

This album has shaken my belief in God. Thanks, Feldman.
I love all of the ironic 5 star reviews on Amazon
This album makes &quot;Speedin&#39; Bullet 2 Heaven&quot; look like &quot;To Pimp a Butterfly&quot;
The second coming of Christ is rolling in his Grave, Everytime one of these tracks are played. 2th, Corinthians <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=260">4:20</a>., ✌🖕👉
Garbage in it&#39;s lowest form.
These songs sound like bad Bob and Tom parodies
wow that was painful .cant help but laugh . ilove this video
Funniest review!! 😂
The best part about this entire video was the wicked MDE sticker.
Sad thing is you know there&#39;s gonna be people who like this shit
Why do you review an album that bad? It is a waste of time.
Totally right about that synth lead, it&#39;s on the tip of my tongue, it&#39;s something 90&#39;s, I just can&#39;t quite grasp it.
An album by a good musician that&#39;s almost this bad. Gary Numan - Machine and Soul
yep comparable to Chinese water torture for sure!!!!!! 😭😭😭😭 (im not laughing im crying!!!lol)
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Angelic-Core-Funkadelic-Rockadelic/dp/B01H6B13GU#customerReviews">https://www.amazon.com/Angelic-Core-Funkadelic-Rockadelic/dp/B01H6B13GU#customerReviews</a> HAHA
Is this actually real?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1800">30:00</a> sounds like a chinese Lenny Kravitz knockoff
sounds a lot like Ben Minal&#39;s &quot; Everything but the music&quot; which was a parody.
the second song played sounds like a rip off of modest mouse&#39;s &quot;i came as a rat&quot;
OK, I get it. It&#39;s not good, but do we need to eviscerate this guy? Hes an eccentric, aging, 80s teen star. It&#39;s not like he&#39;s killing puppies and diddling kids. Hes still a human with feelings. I mean, 50 fucking minutes on this? Nah.
THE CRINGE O_O He&#39;s a troll right? I mean he must be.....if this album is real then the music scene is doomed
Is this death grips?
I  feel bad for Corey,  but maybe he should try to get back into acting and stop music.<br>I love your face during the misery and pain part! Lol!<br>Corey reminds me of  the Florence Foster Jenkins story.
I sincerely hope corey fieldman makes more terrible albums so we can watch Anthony destroy them.
Yes.. got my Halloween custom figured out now
I love how the instrumentals drop when he says &quot;winds of change&quot; as though it was a profound lynchpin to a work of art.
His music sounds like it should be on that game a boy and his blob
hahah ... i like how we all thought Corey was just MJ fan on &quot;Deam a Little Dream&quot; when he was dressing as MJ or doing moonwalk. Now we know he&#39;s just bonkers.
WE DEMAND MORE RAW UNEDITED FOOTAGE OF ANTHONY LAUGHING
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1508">25:08</a> anthony has a million dollar extreme sticker
getting pretty obese- fat-tano
I never thought it could be as bad as he made it out to be....but then I listened to it
the cover... It was like they brought 2001 back with a vengeance.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1590">26:30</a> Senser- Age of Panic
fattest vegan in the game
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1098">18:18</a> you can see him clearly dying inside.
As a graphic designer, the cover art makes me want to puke.
This album is the sonic representation of an aneurysm. And cancer.
this guy makes brokencyde sound good. holy fucking shit.
and i thought my first song were bad.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=460">7:40</a> i died
HOLY THIS IS AN HOUR LONG
This video is a reaction .gif goldmine
I could barely stand to listen to you say the title... ugggghhh😐<br>you look physically DRAINED from hearing this album😅
When you look up &quot;Corey Feldman Angelic 2 The Core&quot; in google this video is the first listing. Outstanding
I have a headache now
And I thought planningtorock was bad, jesus.
Antnee has the most contagious laugh. Especially when he is laughing AT people.
The god vs. devil represents the media and movie industry. its hell, literally. if you&#39;re educated on their intents, you&#39;d know
This review is the funniest thing ever XD
50 minutes?
I thoroughly enjoyed this video. two thumbs and a dick straight up!
Most album ever
You know an album is horrible when Anthony talks about it for 50 minutes
It&#39;s funny because this is the longest review you&#39;ve ever done.  It must of splickitied a cord somewhere.
I doubt it&#39;s the worst.
its the best album of 2016
Wanna know how this album is bad? This man spent 50 minutes talking about it. You never spend this long on a review. You must really hate this mess.
eww😂
sounds like he took tons of cocaine just after watching a terrible porno parody of Charlie&#39;s Angels in the late 90s, recorded an album, and now decided to release it.
I had to stop after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=931">15:31</a>...I couldn&#39;t take any more.
dying laughing....ahahahahaaaaa
so what did you listen to afterward to purge this from your brain? After 18 minutes I am putting on some Swans ...can&#39;t make it through sorry man
Guys Honestly. I know that something this Bad can be downright offensive to some people, which would make a harsh reaction seem legitimate. But you should come away from this feeling sorry for Corey. Imagin how sad it is having no one in your Life to give you any kind of perspective on what you are doing and no one to care how far you get lost in your delusion. If on the otherhand this has some kind of therapeutic value for him where he feels he needs to do this then just let him. Either way (thankfully) neither you or I a forced to listen to this....
Has everyone gone out of their way to look at the album&#39;s official website?! I highly recommend it - highly pixelated images, spelling mistakes and that vintage teenagers&#39; Myspace page feel. It&#39;s a fucking triumph...
I don&#39;t even know what to listen to to rehabilitate from this.
OMG WTF HAPPENED TO STEVE-O??!?!? Oo
Never watched your stuff, was just interested in hearing the actual cd. Is there no one else on YouTube who does reviews like this? You&#39;re really hard to watch. You have as much personality as a door mat and you&#39;re really ugly. Not like the cool &quot;I can work with this&quot; ugly. You&#39;re just the uncomfortable ugly. You kinda make my skin crawl actually.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1563">26:03</a> or maybe they just all wanted to leave that badly, so they said &quot;Brilliant! you don&#39;t need any more takes!&quot;
Damn can you just imagine how many times those poor girls have had to listen to this ear rapeing dumpster swill?
We need to see a LA FLAME and Corey Feldman track !
he really did a 50 min rant on how  it sucked he. seriously wasn&#39;t holding back this year lol
I can&#39;t believe I watched all this.   Anthony I&#39;m with you buddy.  holy shit
This album is to music what The Room is to film.
He should collab with Raed.
this is incredible i dont know what anthony is talking about like if u say yes
really enjoying the new Death Grips album...
The fact that this crap took a decade for him make the album makes it even more hilarious.
It&#39;s horrible it&#39;s terrible
thing is, he has legit fans. If you pull up the &quot;Go for it&quot; video, many of the comments are effusive and celebratory
&quot;it triggers me, it triggers me&quot; yeah
This album is pretty much &quot;The Room&quot; of music, and Feldman is Tommy Wiseau.
I wonder if the CIA will buy a few copies. play in a loop at gitmo?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1589">26:29</a> sounds like a bad electronic cover of The Wizard by Black Sabbath
Corey Feldman is the captain beefheart of this era. we won&#39;t fully get it for decades....... nah I am just kidding.
@theneedledrop THANK YOU. YOU ARE SOOOOO RIGHT !!!!!
This album is just as terrible as your tattoo designs and placements.
weirder than a Residents album
this album is an auditory illness. all the songs gave me headaches.
The Review starts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=884">14:44</a>
This is so  righteous omg I am dying bbaaahhaaaa
Almost as good as K-Fed&#39;s album.
I think Corey might be an unintentional comedic genius or a bit like a modern Schoenberg.
this album bangs tbh
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23grandpaskrillex">#grandpaskrillex</a> 😂👍
This album is comparable to crazy bus.
The song at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1620">27:00</a> floored me
Feldman has actually created &#39;The Room&#39; of albums
I&#39;m triggered he didn&#39;t review Mild High Club, Skiptracing
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=558">9:18</a> that sounds like Turn Up The Music by Chris Brown
A tru Calassic of the mudern age :)_
DO NOT TELL ME THIS IS THE GUY FROM THE GOONIES OMG KMS
Why have you got a carpet tattooed on ur arm bro
Thanks for that review, and the &quot;music&quot; that was attempted by feldman, I mean, I wanted to know just how misdirected, but how, and there is usually only one way, of buying the thing.  I think he ought to give up on trying to emulate Michael Jackson, and anyone else.  And he ought to stop whining about his life through his &quot;music&quot;.  For Gods&#39; sake, I mean, the poor feller must be getting high on any number of drugs with those women he wants to &quot;help&quot;, then start doing a karaoke thing most likely while swigging liquor and hitting the pipe.  I think I could do better with my karaoke machine I bought used and my casios 76 &amp; 77.  Maybe after a few heavy mixed drinks of coca cola and scotch blended whiskey I could pound out a better album, or have one on par with that thing.  I mean, I can&#39;t fault a guy for trying, but I swear, nobody in their right mind would screw up so bad repeatedly and continue trying to emulate the likes of Michael Jackson.  God sakes, almost thirty years ago I had to rewrite songs and ensembles for a friend who was going nowhere with his buddies trying to do bar band gigs, and I swear, it takes a musical ear to hear and do real music instead of just wanting to.  I don&#39;t think feldman is really a musician, .....its what he wants to be for some sort of persona he has seen,.....maybe money,.....maybe fame. This whole corey&#39;s angels thing is the same hugely bizarre.  I mean, I don&#39;t fault a guy for looking to get laid with a number of women, but jesus, you &#39;d thing he would be singing sweet sweet love songs afterwards, or singing bout getting it on, sex so to speak or the like, not this downer lyrics.  He is a small guy, I can see he does not work out, maybe never has, I mean, he could do with some muscles on his shoulders, and not by using steroids either.  I think he needs to start a new charity organization helping down on their luck musicians and the like, called &quot;Corey&#39;s Organization for troubled musicians&quot;, and they could get government and public donations to help rehabilitate failed or otherwise failing musicians who suffer from substance abuse or mental illness, I mean, he could do all the jam sessions he&#39;d want with them, and maybe it would just scare them stragiht.
I&#39;m gonna have to say, Corey is horrible like Britney Spears and her &quot;music&quot; sucks. Did Lucian Piane&#39; write this crappy album because his &quot;music writing&quot; is as bad as his politics.....
totally fucked up Mogwai and now this shit
Damn, I&#39;ve never laughed out loud so much at a music review
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1235">20:35</a> Cal takes over for a sec
i love this format man, feels really old school. playing parts of hte album without fear of copy right police... i&#39;ve been subbed for a while.
lol. you look suicidal one minute and confused the next lol. I hate the Michael Jackson wannabe voice. always has done it.. kurrupt and snoop loose all my respect
Aww c&#39;mon the kid is trying a new Shtick....   He does not want to pay to get laid any longer...  Good idea, no? The little gay thing he has going, well, I am not sure if that is believable....
It hurts me musically. Like who in their right mind writes a homage to Lego? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1065">17:45</a>
i have a hard time believing that anyone working on this album was serious at any point
it makes l.ron Hubbard and friends Scientology album the road to freedom sound like a master piece .now I&#39;m going to crawl into a hole and chew on some poisonous plant matter
i love c feldmen
Corey Feldman is the Ed Wood of music.
if kdot made this record, 10/10
I started to enjoy the review till you started laughing while the played samples of the tracks. Couldn&#39;t hear what you were laughing about, and I genuinely wanted to hear. Yes, Feldman doesn&#39;t have a good voice or vocal range, he jumps around onstage like he&#39;s got ants in his pants but he did produce something that you were reviewing. Maybe your not a professional reviewer but you come off very knowledgeable and articulate. This review didn&#39;t cast you in a very good light, no matter how rotten the source material was. Just my thoughts, thanks will come back again for another of your reviews, Peace!
He should promote it by touring with Yoko Ono.👁💋
10/10 best album of the decade.
This reminds me of kids in the school yard pointing at the crippled kid and laughing. Good work.
Honest and hilarious
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1620">27:00</a> didn&#39;t know jonathan davis was on this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=565">9:25</a> whatever fucking song that was was ripped off from starships
This reviewer looks like he escaped from a mental hospital. Did the state issue those glasses? Lol.
Hillary loves it.
Shared this album with my 58 year old bluegrass and 60s rock raised dad. His response &quot;this isn&#39;t the music that drugs made for us&quot; lmao
how the hell did snoop not say something or offer some advice??
I&#39;m having a hard time believing Corey didn&#39;t know how bad this is. it&#39;s almost like that was the point, I mean he&#39;s a sweet guy but come on.
Corey and Kanye are on the same ego trip.
Yes! Architecture and Morality! one of the greatest albums of all time.
That is not even the worst project featuring Snoop Dogg. Check the russian movie called &quot;Одноклассники: накликай удачу&quot;.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2045">34:05</a> that piano goes so hard though
when channeling the pain is poorly executed
haha
Unthony Cutano!!!
it&#39;s obviously a strong 9
it was so bad that it was good
This album is an affront to Corey in the House Core aka Corey Core. <br>Which I believe is punishable by stoning in Saudi Arabia, and firing squad in Texas. Also banned from entering Australia, Canada, UK, US National Parks, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Area 51, the Greenwich Meridian, North Korea, Soundcloud Meme Islands, Purgatory, North Sentinel Island, and Japan. I&#39;m pretty sure even Tool is now doubling down on a new album, just so that our species may have a shred of redeemable quality left, so the collective universe doesn&#39;t decide to plunge our planet into oblivion.
I wish I could have been present during the recording of this album just to see look of the producer&#39;s face.
His songs sound like standard Verizon ring tones... Like foxglove and autotune. 10/10
Is the album as bad as that Tatt on his left arm? That this is horrid.
I think you just don&#39;t get it, this is Corey&#39;s SMiLE.
Was this worse than speedin bullet to heaven?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2047">34:07</a> I think Corey was going for the McCartney style here?<br><br>It failed miserably but pretty sure he was goin&#39; for it
Grandpa Skrillex lmao
you can see the same quality in the album cover as in the music lol
Corey Feldman - misunderstood genius <br><br><br><br>And the genius that he totally misunderstood was Michael Jackson
You could tell by the cover itself that he doesn&#39;t have good P.R.&#39;s around him... I could of made him something better on paint!
That wrist action at 3.35 says it all !
Wow, Anthony. You said that you couldn&#39;t prepare me for how awful the album was, and I didn&#39;t believe you. I must apologize for doubting you in the slightest.
When Gary Vaynerchuck talks about self awareness, its hard to see what he&#39;s talking about. Corey Feldman is probably the best example of a full lack of self awareness and a reminder of what happens when you become delusional about success as opposed to being successful. Charlotte from Geordie Shore and Snooki are similar.
These almost sound like some of the less enjoyable GTA 3 songs...
Put those fucking teeth away jesus christ, do you ave a fucking permit?
I JUST REALIZED I SAW HIM AT HAMILTON COMIC CON AND I HAD NO IDEA HE MADE MUSIC
Anthony, this album is bad on purpose.  You&#39;re being trolled.
This album sounds like it could just as well have been a concept album depicting the life of Kim Jong Un, produced by the North Korean army for his birthday, and with some additional (and well paid) expert advice from Dennis Rodman.
This album was the second coming of Michael Jacksons Thriller, go by qtips !
I thought Desiighner would have gotten Worst Album.....Oh yea that&#39;s right
Corey Feldman ft Fred Durst<br><br>That alone is worse than anything Hitler ever did
It&#39;s like every song on the Panty and Stocking soundtrack fused with the Nutshack theme
&quot;Worst album of the year&quot; just wait till u review lana del rey&#39;s album dropping soon kek
ABOUT MY NEICE ABOUT MY NEICE

normally when someone shows me a song that they think is bad im more likely to like it...<br><br><br><br><br><br>....But this is actually horrible
THIS ALBUM TOOK 10 YEARS TO MAKE.
MaYBe..aLL ThE PEoPLe ..BeHiND ThiZ PROduCtioN LikE To DaBbLE...A+
the most horrifying thing is that someone will actually like this album
If you told me you were forced to review this dogshit at gunpoint, I&#39;d believe you.
Captain Morgan helped me get through this video
Look at it this way Anthony, aside from this crap 2016 has been so good for music. We had the latest Swans album, a new Avalanches LP, a new Danny Brown album, even that Jesu/Sun Kil Moon record was alright, the new Tortoise album was solid, Ulver&#39;s latest LP is good too, the new Kendrick Lamar album, and a whole bunch of other awesome stuff. So don&#39;t despair man, the world is a fucking mess right now and there&#39;s still amazing music coming out. At least we can all laugh a Cory Feldman haha
I&#39;m feeling a light to decent 10 on this video. Classic material.
I like to think that there was a lot of &quot;this could be better&quot; moments and this was just the best they could do
It was a bad album. I don&#39;t know the name of this man doing the album review but he is pretty much spot on. I only wished he didn&#39;t use the Lords name so loosely. It&#39;s offensive, a big turn off. I had to go back and listen to Scarlet Fade, Love like Gravity and Cross the Divide to appreciate real talented musicians that put their hearts into their craftsmanship.
It sounds like I shit in my cd player and this is the sound it now plays.
It&#39;s as if Corey Feldman has transcended what we believed to be the limits of rock music and evolved it into something else - a &#39;post-rock&#39; album, if you will.
I love Corey and all and the Goonies is a favorite from my childhood, but yeah, this was just shit. I left the Rave scene when it started going commercial, and shit like this epitomizes everything I hate about what has happened to electronic music
Is this legitimately 50 minutes holy fuck
if you hear this as an experimental ironic/comic álbum, and take out the horrible mixdown, and mastering, also the horrible voices... its quite good.
I mean you just gotta market this album to the sad emo kids that think blood on the dance floor is good then he&#39;ll go fucking platinum lmao they&#39;ll eat this shit up
Surprised Corey hasn&#39;t striked this video since he seems the type. Dude is forever stuck living in the 90s while playing off his fame from the 80s its pretty sad.
I think the beginning of the Ascension song might be Devo.  It&#39;s real similar to Devo from their early stuff.  Someone else did a short review of Corey&#39;s album and they named a bunch of bands they thought he ripped, but this one, I remembered.  I swear, we could play name that tune and probably find every original he butchered.  Like watch early MTV vids from the first few years when the channel first came out.  That&#39;s where he got all this from.
yea but he gave a zero to SB2H which i still feel is cudders best album soooo im giving this one a try
I&#39;m very deeply sorry you had to do this.
this sounds like some kind of perverted techno tom waits
Almost as bad as Coldplay&#39;s new album.
reviewing classics this week huh fandango ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
This album might be the musical equivalent of The Room
The comments on Go 4 it are fake as fuck, only positive or very slightly negative with someone telling them not to be negative. No way a video with 1/4 million views only got under 150 comments
I think it&#39;s time to take Old Yeller to the back of the One-eyed Willie&#39;s ship.
Great stuff! Just stumbled upon your channel, when I was looking for some updates on Corey, I noticed he is totally wacko now, eerily similar to his idol MJ.  You&#39;re a really funny guy, I&#39;m hooked now!
Maybe this is Corey Feldman giving the middle finger to Micheal Jackson, Corey Haim, and pop music.<br><br>Just saying. He did dedicate it to them. 🤔
I like when he turns to Fallout Boy at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1680">28:00</a>
For anyone who was planning on listening to the album, I strongly recommend you to rethink your decision. For years I have struggled with depression and at the start of 2016 I could finally say that I enjoy living. 5 minutes ago I finished listening to the first 11 songs of the album and for the first time in 5 months my thoughts have turned against me again. Please, spare yourself, love yourself.
This album ruined my acid trip
Delusional 2 The Core
a double album? doubly unnecessary.
This is Cal&#39;s favorite album
Fantano goin&#39; full Mickey Mouse with that laugh 😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1065">17:45</a> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1105">18:25</a>. This album drives people insane.
That ascension song sounds like NWA&#39;s Panic Zone in the beginning
Sleep all day, party all night, it&#39;s fun to have money but no talent
Man, I don&#39;t think you will ever be the same person after this experience. One can see this affected you profoundly. I hope you are doing better. Take it easy for some weeks, OK?
Sorry, I don&#39;t have almost a full hour to sit here and watch this guy hate on someone, love him or hate him, who&#39;s name will be remebered by many (quite fondly) long after this weirdo is dust.
I would pay for a Corey Feldman&#39;s nu-metal album
50min roasting one album ??😂😂
how this a 50 minute video tho
He has the ugliest tattoos lmao
Die Antwoord  ( Dee - Aunt - Voo-Erd)
i think he might get happy to be compared to MJ BUT this is not what is happening... his vocals come across as a BAD imitation of MJ. if you want to imitate MJ imitate his perfectionism and his idividuality - he didnt copy anyone as bad as you copy him UNSUCCESSFULLY. .. and he wouldnt release NOT ONE song that sounded even a LITTLE off - he didnt release garbage to people and ask them to pay for it.  MJ had the sense to realize what is good and what is bad on his own and corey is missing that.  I might be old and cynical but when i meet people that like all music and think everything is awesome, im immediatly put off because that tells me they have no sense of recognizing authenticity.... this does NOT SEEM AUTHENTIC AT ALL TO ME. It seems thrown together, sloppy, and fake. Why? because corey is not being himself. hes acting like a michael jackson imperonator and i cant take that seriously. end of story!
So this is the music equivalent to the room?
Pull the trigger<br>No I want to live<br>Just do it
If you ever feel bad or sad one day, remember that a track on this album may be someone&#39;s favourite song ever
my ears, they must be gouged out
I think maybe he&#39;s ashamed of how much he likes it.
I almost feel sorry for him. Growing up in the spotlight messed up his ability to be &quot;normal&quot; for life.
Wow Anthony, thanks for interrupting this masterpiece of an album so many times. You always skip the songs just when they&#39;re getting to the good part. F-U dude you just don&#39;t understand. Keep worshiping the generic illuminati music.
Aliens heard this from space and made a u-turn
I won&#39;t lie. I spit my cranberry juice out @ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1100">18:20</a> 😂😂😂😂😂
Alot of this is rips from old 70&#39;s Motown discos.  Some of it is early 80&#39;s rips, too.  And then 90&#39;s Grunge.  And wtf, jazz?  I don&#39;t know, I think this must be what the soundtrack in hell is.
this is the funniest video you&#39;ve made dude. folded me.
I am a horrible person, I thoroughly enjoyed this review the first time you posted and here I am again watching it like its a rerun. I am however glad to see that you have since posted videos and appear to be recovering well.
Corey Feldman is music&#39;s Tommy Wiseau and this album is his &quot;The Room&quot;
AN hour review, really..?
&quot;Lovin&#39; Lies&quot; is even worse than that jazz track. what an atrocity of a song
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1070">17:50</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1074">17:54</a> needs to be made into a gif
feels like a personal diss or something
i skipped most of the video and it looked like something out of a cartoon
Cut the guy some slack Fantano, he Only had 10 years to work on it! He was obviously time constrained!
pretty lit music if you ask me...
The Nutshack Theme But With Every Noun Replaced With The Entirety Of Corey Feldman&#39;s Angelic 2 The Core
This a cute little side of Andy I ain&#39;t seen. THUMBS UP!!!!
I just realized the angels aren&#39;t pulling Corey out of the pit of hellfire, they&#39;re actually putting him back in. Smart move.
This video is 50mins.....like....WTF? lmaaaoo
I&#39;m pretty sure this was made on GarageBand for iOS with the loops it comes with
Corey Feldman sounds like the botched clone of David Bowie and Nick Cave having night-terrors.
How much has he spent for that cover? And this production is home made or not? God...how could he not see that it&#39;s bullshit.
Thank you for making this video.  Subbed ✔
Except Chinese Water Torture is a great Jedi Mind Tricks track.
&quot;We&#39;re talking about the issues, but we&#39;re keeping it funky.&quot;
how much would i need to be paid? realistically? £4000. maybe £5000.<br><br>then again i&#39;m pretty broke most of the time, 5k would do me for a good while.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1350">22:30</a> I just imagine that&#39;s how Fred Durst reacted when he was presented this song
if you just got here and haven&#39;t watched this yet, don&#39;t. <br>just go and do something else.
I think the most embarassing thing about this is that you chose to take this album seriously
Jesus man, the guy was molested when he was a kid. Take it easy on him.
I love Feldman&#39;s &quot;cover.&quot; It looks like someone spent 20 minutes in MS Paint to make it. Couldn&#39;t drop a few hundred to have a semi-competent artist produce a cover?
The beats all sound like he hit the demo button on a Casio keyboard
Wouldn&#39;t take me an hour to say Feldman shucks!
Christ dude, wear a shirt. You look like a butch woman.
I cant believe you wasted an hour with this crap.
it&#39;s like Corey Feldman watched the first season of Tim and Eric, didn&#39;t understand that it&#39;s satire, and then got inspired to create this album.
he&#39;s been sitting on chair this entire time??..
Feast your ears upon Philosophy of the World by The Shaggs.
Hahaha this video is hilarious I laugh my fucking ass off , indeed this is the worst thing I heard in my entire life . This is like a parody of Michael Jackson music catalogue , this man really needs help this shit is beyond bad . I hope he watches your review and repent from creating audio atrocities like this one hahahahaha fucking speechless that&#39;s how I feel right now
IDK, kinda sounds like Go-Kart meets Bobby Conn.
When i saw how long this review was i though to myself &quot;Oh 50 minutes? It&#39;s gotta be a meme album review where he eats food or says nothing but &quot;No&quot; thoughout it right? But to my surprise it&#39;s a literal 50 minute actual serious review explaining exactly why this album deserves a big round goose egg.
The album&#39;s an avant-garde masterpiece tbh
What was chinese water torture like?
Worst album of the year, best review of the year.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1332">22:12</a> grabs an autistic child dying of cancer and kicks him down a flight of stairs and forces him to do a Washed Out impression. That is what i just heard.
im puking!! all over my house!!!
This Corey Dude look like professor Snape
I&#39;ve heard more coherent melodies from someone having a seizure
What the hell?!!
I laughed with him at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=470">7:50</a> so hard
Ok I have not heard this album except the clips you are playing but seriously it sounds no worse than Justin Bieber.
Could this be classified as outsider music? Because I really enjoy it in the same way.
Time to listen to Lulu, Speedin&#39; Bullet 2 Heaven, and Miley Cyrus and Her Dead Petz after this review.
This guy is turning out to be so much more complex than I initially thought.
can he just review all the albums this way?
My body shut off hearing this... Just a hard fucking reboot
The track &quot;Negativity&quot; is actually a iPhone microphone recording of Corey doing &quot;Freak on a Leash&quot; at a North Korean bar with the incredible cover band &quot;The North KORNreans&quot;.
Corey Feldman&#39;s Delusional 2 The Most Certain Degree.
your face makes me feel anxious
you get your jollies reviewing crap albums  or are you jumping on the ban wagon to get views you asshat
I actually kind of like it
It&#39;s possible snoop was just really high was Corey showed him the track and thought it sounded cool lol
do it lickity splickity
This is technically the first time fantanno&#39;s played the music of the review in the review. huh.
I have to disagree. The worst horseshit was Rihanna &quot;Work&quot;
I think you should have been higher for this.
If Kendrick Lamar had released this, you would&#39;ve given it at least a 6/10
I can&#39;t believe i watched all of this.
Grandpa Skrillex! LMAO
A pile of shit has a thousand eyes.
This album sounds like it was made by a autistic 40 year old with too much money who was constantly molested when he was a kid
this is fkin hilarious
17 minutes in, it doesn&#39;t sound any different from the usual popular crap that&#39;s out now.
This is Mentanthony Breakdowthano, and my review of Corey Feldman&#39;s Angelic 2 The Core, brought to you by our sponsors,  Cheap Scotch and Hydrocodone.
nice mde sticker
Ascension Millennium sounds like a parody of Kraftwerk done on something like Kids in the Hall or SNL. But I swear Lickety Splickety (I can&#39;t believe I just fucking typed that) is his attempt to actually do a real version of &quot;No Words&quot; by Ha$h Brown.
I feel like this album is secretly brainwashing me with subliminal messages only reason this could be soo fucking horrid.
this is my favorite review ever
On point hehe lulz
This is audible cancer.
Is he referring to himself as &quot;The Core&quot; in the title?
I clicked the link to the video in the description. My ears are bleeding
Please review solanges album please
I bet cal loves this album
It&#39;s as if he recorded his midlife crisis.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1350">22:30</a> Cal almost started to make on appearance.  XD
Holy fuck, did not expect a 50 minute video
This is the Finnagans wake of music, multi-concept drifting, fully creative mass-produced sounding melodies<br>Give it time
Kinda funny that this is the first thing that comes up if I google &quot;corey feldman angelic 2 the core&quot;. It doesn&#39;t even have a Wikipedia page from what I saw. And what&#39;s REALLY sad is that it was a decade in the making, or at least we&#39;re supposed to believe.
Everyone knows that Go 4 It is a banger
Listening to this music clouds my brain. It&#39;s electronic diarrhoea. There&#39;s no way he didn&#39;t record this pile of feces in someones garage or basement with cheap recording equipment. Any professional label would have laughed this Feldman guy onto the street. Literally this record physically assaults my brain  and scrambles it. It&#39;s pure, unadulterated stage-four cancer.
The album seems to be almost as annoying and superfluous as the reviewer.
i cant believe i watched this full video lmao
the pain is so big you feel nothing at all lmaoo
10/10 review it again
why would you laught when listening to this? I had to listen to the first few songs. Nothing special, just overproduced radiofriendly pop with a bunch of content. Why are you so evil though with the laughing and shit - I really didnt get it. Just appreciate some of the songs without thinking about who the guy behind the fucking vocals is or what he&#39;s doing
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=760">12:40</a> sounds like Dave Mustaine with a sinus infection.
Actually,,, corey feldman is good
Can&#39;t be worse than SremmLife 2, can it?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1289">21:29</a> not going to lie I liked the horns
But if Kanye put out this same sonic dog shit guys like Fantano and sites like Pitchfork would be calling it a genre-defying gamechanger that was redefining modern, popular music. How do I know this? Because that&#39;s the kind of review they give to Kanye&#39;s sonic dog shit.
I bet Feldman watched this whole video and cried.
ur just jealous of corey cuz ull never be as famous
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1355">22:35</a> You just saw Cal&#39;s birth
You look like you have the best teeth in the fucking game
Surely this is a very clever attempt to fake an album then write a documentary around internet comments?
Getting through this review is worse than the music.<br> Go eat some Kale.
is this whole thing an elaborate joke?
Grandpa skrilex!!! Hahaha
Don&#39;t discourage his creativity (er downfall and implosion) because it&#39;s fun to watch!
And by worst you mean most entertaining thing ever! Hahaha
Anthony lost his mind.
give me an guitar and 20 dollars and I make an album better than this. Oh, and I cant play guitar
You are very LATE.....Corey has 4. Thats FOUR albums before this one. And ALL are worth the laugh.
This video is almost as bad as a single second of the album.
You&#39;re just jealous of his sheer genius Anthony.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=883">14:43</a> heart warming &lt;3
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1487">24:47</a> elevator music from hell
Who in the fuck produced this album? Where were his friends? Omg this album is so bad I legit feel sorry for this man.
wait is he the child actor that got molested or is it another one
you should seriously do talk radio lol
I&#39;m at minute 42 what am I doing with my life
Ascension Millennium is the only bearable track -___-
In a TMZ street interview Corey mentioned the production house &#39;Trend Def&#39;. I&#39;m guessing they&#39;re responsible for the bulk of the albums songs.
buddy, i suggest you show some respect to corey. or me and coreys gang will be on you, nigga.
Damn, It didnt go to Green Day? Thank god.
Why does sound like in the song in at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1500">25:00</a> minute mark sounds like he&#39;s saying I&#39;m gonna pre.
what favour does snoop owe this guy
Plot twist: This album is mocking Speeding bullet 2 heaven
That synth lead sounded like starships by Nicki Minaj to me.
looks like Frank Javcee has done some kind of joke album, like a prank... hahaha LOL
Wouldn&#39;t Die Antwort be pronounced &quot;Dee Antvort&quot;? They&#39;re German, right? Or at least something close?
When Anthony started improvising on &quot;Mercy&quot; , he made it not sound like a piece of shit.
It&#39;s like you&#39;re legitimately getting more angry the farther into the album you go
43 minutes in and I&#39;m begging for mercy on my soul.
im sorry u dont hav the best teeth in the game i just realized
Corey Feldman- &quot;Delusional 2 The Core&quot;
this sounds worse than Hulk Hogan&#39;s album
I can&#39;t believe the album art actually made the release. What the fuck?
Dressing and looking as awful as the album you&#39;re reviewing, it&#39;s an innovative idea, I like it
No offence anthony your tatto looks like burnt blue skin.
The illuminati payed you for this smear campaign Cory is an exceptional song writer and dancer.
&quot;Every time I hear it, it triggers me&quot; XD
IF THIS WERE A COMEDY RECORD IT WOULD BE GENIUS. Weird Al, take note.
Thank you for this video. amazing work. Corey is the next Breen
i bet you didn&#39;t even cry at &quot;Remember 222&quot;(Corey&#39;s song)
Woah
Birdemic 3, soundtrack provided by Corey Feldman&#39;s Angelic 2 the Core. Would truly be a match made in hell.
I will way that mercy is the best song. it&#39;s not good but after all of the onslaught of mediocrity and cringe, it was the shining light of the album.
Feldman&#39;s lost his marbles, plain and simple. I mean, think about it - He&#39;s been coasting along through life while his fellow costars and friends in Hollywood have been dropping dead left and right in freakish Hollywood ways. This is the cost of being the last man standing!  Fantastic review!
The intro to Take a Stand reminds me of the opening to thrash metal band Intruder&#39;s album A Higher Form of Killing.
You just know Cal loves this album.
This album is a mental breakdown. Oh my god.
Oh my god his laugh gets me every time
Best Needledrop yet! This was great.
Decent Concept that had Potential, but Failed like a Kim Jong Rocket, Killing everybody.
I really watched this whole thing
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1038">17:18</a> lmfao
For all you little bandwagon bitches who decided overnight that you&#39;re Feldman&#39;s biggest advocate... strictly because it&#39;s the &quot;socially conscious&quot; position to take on the matter ...you aren&#39;t fooling anyone. You got sucked into the meme just like everyone else. ..and for the same reason.  You just decided out of guilt or indie motivations that it was cooler to espouse &quot;opinion B&quot; instead of &quot;opinion A&quot;. ..because now it&#39;s trendy to be just slightly less trendy than fully trendy. Guaranteed 80% of you don&#39;t actually give two fucks about that poor bastard and his problems. You just appropriated his struggle to make yourself look good.<br><br>Anthony is a MUSIC CRITIC. ...he&#39;s giving a critique of Feldman&#39;s MUSIC. ..because whether you are an abuse victim or not, when you release music and do mainstream promotion for it, it becomes fair game. That&#39;s how it works. If you actually watched it, Anthony took great care to not make fun of Corey as a person and actually said several times that he was worried for him and felt bad that Corey has been pushed so far into being delusional.<br><br>..and I&#39;ve seen Tony be just as brutal about new records from artists that he&#39;s a fan of. Because again... he&#39;s a music critic and that&#39;s his job.
You really don&#39;t like Lil PEEP man??? I kinda dig the fact it&#39;s like the old sublime man... the energy of it just be in the now... like it&#39;s cut once n Boom done... living room dubbing... you gotta admit for how young he is pretty cool. I thought CryBaby and Hell Boy were great, Against the grain man. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23theneedledrop">#theneedledrop</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23lilpeepgotskill">#LilPeepGotSkill</a>
DRAG HIM
No one this overweight should wear a tanktop.
Wow. You&#39;re so annoying. Please shut your channel down.
I might actually consider listening to the song at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1063">17:43</a> unironically.
You&#39;re a bigger man than me, Anthony. I&#39;d give up after the first track.
Bigthony Teethtano
He should do this for every NOT GOOD album
This album is composed of a bad cat porn with cats wailing or having sex.
There is not a moment on this album that was not terribly obnoxious
This can&#39;t be real
the Internet&#39;s busiest music turd
antony this was too mean :(<br><br>40 minutes too long
snoop dog is only famous because he smoks weed.
It&#39;s like Tim &amp; Eric did a collab with the soundtrack curators of Grand Theft Auto 3, but worse
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1560">26:00</a> I heard what sounded like disturbed playing on children&#39;s toy instruments
451 people were robbed. Poor souls... <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/elev8or-2-ascension-the-feldfanfam-fundraiser#/">https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/elev8or-2-ascension-the-feldfanfam-fundraiser#/</a>  Also, please review his first album, 1st Glimpse of Heaven.

You almost devolved into Cal at the &quot;I just can&#39;t say no to the beat&quot; part haha
You sir, are a a much braver man than I.
haha dream a little dream. wow.
still better than speeding bullet 2 heaven
say what you want about corey but at least he GOES FOR IT!
I really miss Harambe memes
This album is pretty shitty. I think this and Die Antwoord&#39;s new album are contenders for the worst of 2016
Cory Feldman: Sucks to the Core.........why does he continually embarrass himself?.......He wont let go of his dream to become a pop star, obviously......and why do record companies keep promoting him and putting his crap out there?.....
It sounds like there were no professionals working on this (producers, sound mixers etc.) and Corey was just drunk with his friends one day and recorded all this audio garbage on his phone. The quality is SO GOD AWFUL!!! Ugh.   D:
The 90s and 80s are still alive, and as people from the future it&#39;s our duty to kill it.
And now we witness Anthony completely losing it.
You mentioned Manson so where&#39;s TJ?
Guys it&#39;s avant garde lol
i love you for this review
If I owned a record store I would put this album in the comedy section.
&quot;Snoop shows up anywhere there&#39;s a paycheck&quot; if this isn&#39;t the biggest truth I don&#39;t know what is
so when&#39;s the classic review
Loved you&#39;re in depth review, (funny as hell!)   .....And every word is horrifying true!  Best to ya!                      .....ps  you do have a keen wit, you&#39;re delivery is pretty professional.
This video makes me want to subscribe to you.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2471">41:11</a> someone make a meme
swolethany swoletano here the Internets biggest torso
Cal would give this a 10 out of 10.
That jazz certainly does swing
the first song was dope. the rest yeah not so much
I think Anthony has finally broken.
I&#39;d like to think of myself as a casual listener of music, and I&#39;m not much of an expert in anything music related, but I&#39;d like to think I would know I&#39;ve gone too far when I&#39;ve made music that sounds like a high school band had too much money and consisted of 40 different musicians. This is like a Symphony of people ice-skating on a frozen pond.
Your literally tripping if you don&#39;t think this at least a 9
you accidently typed &quot;worst&quot; in the description instead of &quot;best.&quot; you also accidently kept saying &quot;worst&quot; throughout the video
Ooooooooooh, so this is what drugs sound like ...
can someone tell me the album behind fantano? thanks
I mean, some that he showed wasn&#39;t that bad. But god, those fucking skits.
How is this review 50 minutes long
this is bullying
Angelic 2 the Core &gt; Kid A
Un fucking believable. I don&#39;t even..
every song sounds like 5 different songs played on top of each other. it&#39;s so bad. the lack of any melody or cohesive structure is shocking. it sounds like something that was made by a schizophrenic on a pc in the 90s.
Tbh, i&#39;ve heard music like 50 times worse than this. Not really surprised this exists...just kinda sounds like regular pop music 3:
My God this album is shit. Why the hell did this even happen. It honestly makes me want to puke.
Just admit it, you LOVE it.  This is the BEST album of 2016.
if tommy wiseau made an album
I just laughed my ass off
This is like your corny uncle trying to be cool kind of music.
please don&#39;t ever wear a tank top on this channel again. in fact never wear one ever again
He made a damn movie about how terrible this album was
Music is subjective- taste is as well. No good no bad. I know u know this but i like it and thats all that matters.people are just havin fun. Im tired of the rules you know. The world is such a horrible place and i&#39;m depressed and suicidal and the rules of everything music, work, politics who cares anymore man! lifes much to short and you get old, or get cancer or get hit by a car and just die forever- you know?
You should actually do this format with a good album. Would be interesting hearing you dissect an album in real time.
The Death of Fantano
This whole thing has to be a joke. &quot;Angelic 2 the Core&quot;? Come on.
this makes me want to cry.
the album cover says it all.....
I physically shuddered at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1700">28:20</a>
So basically the modern day Blonde on Blonde
SOMEONE QUICK, PUT SOMETHING OUT BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR THAT IS WORSE THAN COREY&#39;S ALBUM. IF YOU CAN!!! IS IT EVEN POSSIBLE???
This album reminds me of the way South Park parodies songs lol.
i bet the record is as horrible as you look.
oh god this is <i>not</i> enjoyable, why are we watching this?
Funny thing is that this sounds like half the garbage he thinks is good...
In my opinion, Die Atwood is absolute trash. The only thing I could see that would appeal to anyone is how they try to be different and edgy, just like my autistic friends
It&#39;s funny people are calling him grandpa skrillex but skrillex looks older than corey feldman even though hes like half coreys age lol.
This album is kinda like witnessing a car crash from afar, only to find out you&#39;re actually the victim.
I&#39;ve watched this like five times this week.
Corey Feldman is an Avant-Pop genius.
didn&#39;t he took 10 years to write this too? and even did a crowd funding... my god...
the comments on corey&#39;s vid linked here are pure comedy gold holy shit
when he burped I couldn&#39;t help but cry with laughter 😂😂😂😂
Corey feldman IS Tommy Wesiu
Best album art that I have seen this year.
I refuse to believe that a professional producer came within a mile of this record.
I don&#39;t know, man. Maybe it&#39;s because I just hate modern pop, but this stuff sounds no different than anything on Top 40 radio. I couldn&#39;t tell you the difference between this and a Katy Perry or a Taylor Swift song, tbh.
He reminds me of Miley Cyrus in that he believes his songs are way better than they are and that he is way cooler than he is. He&#39;s trying too hard and it&#39;s backfiring terribly. Case in point, his performance on the Today show. 90 minutes of this? I just don&#39;t get why you&#39;d put all that down and put it out there. I kind of feel sorry for him; he&#39;s probably got all these people around him convincing him how great it all is just because of his name.
Corey Feldman&#39;s singing sounds like my dog vomiting
Working Class Hero sounded like a bad 80&#39;s Bob Dylan impersonation
You know Anthony has lost his mind when he is wearing his thatistheplan outfit on theneedledrop.
i want to know who was in the studio that told him this shyt was good to record????,?
Great music for a Transformers movie number 31.
Im still feelin a strong 9 or maybe even a 10 on this thing. Good tracks, punchy synths, ripping guitar riffs, talented lead vocals. I think this is gonna go down as as a huge hit. Lovin this album.
The ad that I got was &quot;Ruby Tuesdays&quot;. Good place for a lunch with your grandma. Salad bar was a 8/10. Turkey club had some crispy bread. Fresh lettuce. Slimy tomatoes. Mayo was on point. I&#39;m feelin a light 7 to a strong 8 on the ruby tuesdays off sr 16 in Saint Augustine Florida.
Lol yall trying to make corey quit the internet
i like death grips&#39; new direction
....i need to hear some Animal Collective or Radiohead to clean myself from this gunk ive just experienced...FML
&quot;we talking bout the issues but we keeping it funky&quot; - Flight of the Conchords
This album sounds like he is having a stroke in the studio.
You know there is someone(s) somewhere in America who would love this shit....never fails, regardless of how bad music gets.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=832">13:52</a> fking lol @ that reaction. what was that abomoination of a beginning of a song?
How can it be the worst album of 2016 if it makes you laugh so much? Laughing is good
i feel like he&#39;s lowkey pulling a joaquin phoenix right now
Listening to bad music is torture. So why is listening to you listen to bad music so damned entertaining? I hate to wish suffering on you, but man, this was hilarious.
Hope the Ought album will get more attention after this video
I&#39;ve rewatched this 50 minute video like 3(EDIT: like 6 or 7)  times now. Listened to the album in full once.<br><br>Fuck. Anthony needs to do more of these videos. Either on this channel or the mEmE rEvIeW. Hearing him listen to [NOT GOOD] music is golden.<br><br>Edit: I listened to the album again. The best song has to be Go For It, considering it actually has a fairly catchy hook &amp; the Snoop Dogg clickbait feature. However, as soon as the chorus ends and the dubstep is brought in. It just fucking sucks. I wish someone would remix this to at least make it sound reasonably good. Like, forget the verses &amp; dubstep, just make an EDM song around the chorus. Then it might be something.<br><br>EDIT: I&#39;m sorry guys. While I&#39;d love Anthony to make more long commentaries, I don&#39;t think he&#39;s going to find music as bad as this to listen to, without necessary editing. This video was not boring at all because even if you&#39;ve seen it, you know how bad it is, and you just love seeing Anthony&#39;s reaction &amp; subsequent thoughts. Unless there&#39;s artists out there that attempt to make mainstream pop as bad as this, I don&#39;t think we should expect another long video like this for a long time. Stay tuned for the next meme review. Goodnight.
Can you review Royce Da 5&#39;9&#39;s &quot;Layers&quot; album
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1311">21:51</a> KAAAAAAAAAAAAZOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
this is the album that keeps me from starting a band
Not a good album really, all good though. His performance on the TODAY SHOW wasn&#39;t as bad as some people portrayed. That live performance was better than any of his music videos. In his music videos he does more Michael Jackson B-Side moves. Seemed like he eased up on his dance moves a bit. Funny thing, I never knew he had been a musician all this time up until today, and I&#39;m 35. (I must&#39;ve been 10 years too young to notice) Been looking all his stuff up today(major trivial nerd). lol. Also, I saw the interview of him after his performance on THE TALK, he gave gifts to everyone on the show, EVEN the people that shit on him about his performance. Pretty weird, but VERY selfless dude if you ask me. Still a lot of repercussions in his life due to Corey Haim and Michael Jackson pedophile cases. Gotta give him some props.
This album might be delusional and even unfathomably corny and cringe-inducing. But I&#39;d rather listen to this any day than listen to Speeding Bullet 2 Heaven. SB2H is such a droning, monotonous and criminally ugly album--an album I can&#39;t even finish--that it makes me want to trash my speakers and appreciate the wonders of complete and utter silence for the rest of time. A2TC may be tasteless garbage, but at least it&#39;s diverse and something I can laugh out loud at. I get no enjoyment from SB2H--It&#39;s an unlistenable, garbled, atrocious mess--audible water boarding.
This album sounds like schizophrenia
If you look up this album on google, the very first thing that comes up is this video. You have done your job Anthony.
wave goodbye to Corey, kids,
G R A N D P A S K R I L L E X<br>R<br>A<br>N<br>D<br>P<br>A<br>S<br>K<br>R<br>I<br>L<br>L<br>E<br>X
Is that Foxtrot tattoo on [his] left bicep?
DTP&#39;s Transcendence: It&#39;s been out for like 2 weeks. I want to know your thoughts on it
I would for $30 and a ny cheesecake
<b>pauses the video</b><br><b>looks up the album</b><br><b>gets **</b><b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=90">1:30</a></b><b>*</b> through the opening track past the mediocre vocoder stuff to Corey&#39;s awful voice*<br>Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand I&#39;m done with this album already. Good god. This is on par with that Problem song by A Unicorn Something Something or whatever they&#39;re called.
it parodies itself
Rating? 1/10
I have watched this at least 5 times. absolutely hysterical.
sick tats bro
This album is actually good if you listen to it as a case study of a man losing it
I now have ear cansors
Ok, but, what did cal think?
I think you should not give Corey Feldman any attention, but you made 50-minute long video. He still gets popularity from stuff like this...money to make more albums.
It sounds like a joke south park would do about him but he made it hinself lel
22 tracks on that album?!<br>That was pretty audacious of Mr.Feldman.
Put a shirt on!
This thing is basically <i>The Nutshack</i> if it were an album. Appallingly, unfathomably terrible.
I can&#39;t even get past the fucking album cover.
Sounds like he ripped off Ke$ha?!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=645">10:45</a> crack me in such a mellow way
Tightony Noosetano
Guys, Corey Feldman just did a cover of Pink Floyd&#39;s &quot;Money&quot;.
👉🏻👌👉🏻👌👍😘😘
This makes speeding bullet to heaven sound good
Feldman looks like a worse-off Charlie Sheen.
50 minutes? Aw shit. Lemme grab some popcorn
The front page of the website for this album - yes, it exists - is the funniest thing I have ever read.<br>&quot;&#39;Ascension Millennium,&#39; which was released on MTV, became such a viral sensation, it was even mentioned on the hit show <i>Glee</i>.&quot;<br><i>OOOOOH.</i>
Finally! An album I can justify playing on my Crosley!
Honestly I feel bad for Corey. Someone needs to man up and tell him to go home.
my heart when you bashed hell boy😢
can&#39;t believe he didn&#39;t address the part where corey feldman shouts &quot;I&#39;M COMING&quot; with it meant to sound like &quot;I&#39;M CUMMING&quot; and it echoes for about seven seconds
This shipped addressed as &quot;Send 2 Hell&quot;
STILL WAITING ON ANGRY BIRDS SOUNDTRACK REVIEW
This album is to music what The Room is to cinema.
It sounds like he took the synth straight out of a Zedd track. Possibly from Shave It Up
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=883">14:43</a> is the highlight of this video
Oh my god! 50 fucking minutes?!!?!?!
Oh god was this baaaaaad... It&#39;s like someone pooping in your ears with a sound amplifier up the sphincter!
Well he is a meme now, and you must review it. ;)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=576">9:36</a> to answer your question Anthony, that synth line was taken from &quot;I&#39;m not Alone&quot; by Calvin Harris.
this is cals favorite
It sounds like he found the master tracks for a bunch of generic pop songs and a downloaded some stock sound effects then tried to fit in every available noise he could
hmmm..this is one of those reviews thats a bit wishy washy...how do you REALLY feel?????
There is so much dissonance in this album! Listen to all of those parallel 5ths and octaves! It sounds like farting noises...smh
This is somehow worse than Fieldy&#39;s Dreams.
IceJJfish&gt;feldman
I actually kind of liked the songs with the horns in the back
It&#39;s like the worst pop production styles of the 90&#39;s and 00&#39;s, the cheesy porn guitar with the generic happy energetic boom clap drums of every radio single from 2009 combined are goddamn lethal
Sure, it&#39;s bad, but not offensively bad. A few songs are not even that atrocious, albeit a bit clichèd. If the were recorded 25 years ago with a better singer and a skilled producer they wouldn&#39;t be as laughably.
I&#39;m making hundreds of reactions gifs out of this
want to die
What gets me is, how come Corey Feldman gets reviewed for being shitty but I try really hard with my music and can&#39;t get a review?<br>For real, though, fuck this album.
This was one of the funniest videos I&#39;ve seen in a long time.
Hey Anthony are u gonna do Kid Cudi&#39;s new album when it comes out tomorrow?
this aint a reviwe, this is a documentary
thick framed glasses. triggered. jesus.
far worse shit out there right now. you&#39;re just stashing in the the viral limelight here
Delusional 2 The Core
I think the track your referring to around the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=560">9:20</a> mark is &quot;Turn The Beat Around&quot; performed by Gloria Estefan
I can&#39;t believe I actually watched this whole thing
what&#39;s the abomination at ~33??? that has to be a joke.
i thought the album was pretty good
Fun Fact: Corey Feldman was a voice actor on Minecraft: Story Mode
Does the album sound better if you play it backwards ?
Death by stereo doesn&#39;t even begin to cover how insanely bad this album is.
Can someone please tell me where I can pickup a physical CD of this album?
Wasn&#39;t Corey Feldman allegedly touched by Michael Jackson when he was a kid?
Best one take video of the year!
when people be like.... &quot;Art&quot;
omg people listen to this ?
you look like steve-o&#39;s gay twin. and I mean REALLY GAY. also, you probably have pink eye. stop touching your fucking eye.
So just to be clear, you didn&#39;t like this album?
You want the worst album of this year?  Whitechapel&#39;s Mark of the Blade yo.
I feel like I have to go listen to some good music now to repent for my sins (aka listening to this album)
plot twist corey is memeing us all.
Man this album sounds hilarious. You make me want to listen to it.
Review Bon Iver ya dweeb
better than Miley &amp; Her Dead Petz
You just don&#39;t get it fantano.  Feldman&#39;s ahead of his time.
Showing so much skin, got me all boned up over here fantano.
This may be the worst album I have ever listened to
this album officially broke you Anthony... you were brave for making this video, lol!!
What&#39;s the needle drop if you&#39;re the busiest music need?
This is going to be my new party record!
No Corey Haim feature?
What did Cal think the album?
This album sounds like 808s And Heartbreak if Kanye West was an old white guy
This is really mean. You spend 50 minutes on an album that you dislike (understandably so). Yeah, the dude is different. Yeah, the album is uncomfortable. But come on Anthony, you don&#39;t know his story. I think you&#39;re a smart guy with a great ear and ability to communicate, but this is petty. You come across as heartless and immature, honestly.
GRANDPA SKRiLLEX!!! HAHAHA
do it lickity splickitty
Cal Chuchesta needs to release a video entitled, &quot;THE BEST ALBUM OF 2016 (Corey Feldman&#39;s Angelic 2 The Core) [GOOD]&quot;
I&#39;m being deadass like there is no way Corey Feldman is being serious
I&#39;ve only heard GO 4 IT, and it wasn&#39;t awful. I guess it must be the best song, because I hear worse songs every single day, like everything Nikki Minaj ever touched.
Was that synth lead ripped off from &quot;Party Rock Anthem&quot;???
is this a movie
&quot;I hate the number 2 that shit is unforgiving&quot;
I love listening to bad albums with you Anthony let&#39;s do this again real soon
that moment when Anthony sings better than Cory
this is the funniest fucking album I&#39;ve ever heard
I&#39;m loving the needledrop season finale
&quot;beyond description&quot; translates to me &quot;personally offended.&quot; been there
sounds like nsp but taking itself seriously
I hope Death Grips make an album that samples this album right here and then calls it &quot;The Money Store 2&quot;
To really be honest<br><br>I don&#39;t hear that much of a difference between this and some &quot;normal&quot; pop-music honestly
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1070">17:50</a> How this not a .gif yet?
Corey really thinks he&#39;s the second coming of MJ. Poor delusional fuck.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1574">26:14</a> sounds like the song Fred should have been on.
This album was embarrassment solified: I felt uncomfortable for the whole length of the video. At this point I think Billy Ray Cyrus helped Corey producing this still-born record!
I&#39;m not sure if im ready for fifty minutes of this
this entire album sounds like a parody. like I don&#39;t see how someone seriously carried this for over a decade
why the fuck is this 50 fucking minutes?
What drugs<br>what drugs could compel someone to produce this
Holy shit this video is long.
the new die antwoord is sick, whatcha on about willis
Fred Durst cameo!?<br>OH. HERE. WE. GO.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=170">2:50</a> &quot;this album is beyond description&quot; *video continues for 48 more minutes
That first song is worse than Space Pants from SNL.
Turn that 0 upside down its a 12 now
I think they may have gotten it wrong and Corey Haim committed suicide after listening to an early release of this album!
I hope Corey watches this
This is bad even for the 80&#39;s
I&#39;m gonna make your laugh my ringtone
This review<br>This album<br>I&#39;m not sure which one is more flames
This &quot;music&quot; makes me wanna drill holes in my head.
I really enjoy these music reviews but I couldn&#39;t make it past 29 mins the fact that there was still more was overwhelming.
This is the best video on youtube.
be honest man ! it is growing on you ! I am sure it is the only album on you portable player !
Also real talk, I think Corey Feldman might legitimately, truly be tone deaf.
10 out of 10, review it again!
Corey is trolling the music 🌍
this album disproves god
A modern Ed Wood for music.
HAHAHAHA! I LOVE HOW THIS IS 50 MINUTES
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=460">7:40</a>-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=478">7:58</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1090">18:10</a> -<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1107">18:27</a><br>Anthony bro. You&#39;ve been reviewing music so much that even your laugh is on 4/4 beat XD.
Is this Charlie Sheen&#39;s son Inspired by meth, MJ and Marilyn Manson? Or is this skrillex doing something different? Who the hell is Corey Feldman?
Plot twist:<br>Corey Feldman is ahead of his time &amp; this is the music that now a day babies will be listening to
Am I watching a Jinx video?
I guess you could say... Corey was not in the house on this album.
Honestly sounds like all the shit on radio these days. I&#39;d never be able to tell them apart.
This album is an outsider/freak pop masterpiece. It incorporates elements of harsh noise, gypsy folk, musique concréte, post-rock... the list goes on :^) whilst remaining uniquely psychedelic in nature without ever becoming cliche in doing so (60s pop/rock revival and Lame Impala tier stuff etc). It was also entirely produced and performed by one absolute madman: Corey fucking Feldman
Sonic Adventure 2 core
<b>soldier pow subjected to chinese water torture 1968 colourized</b>
So... 4/10?
How do you feel about this album being &quot;a decade in the making&quot;?
i really hope Corey Feldman watches this all the way through
You know, Anthony, it&#39;s funny you mention this album is a plead for help from Corey Feldman, because besides this album, another reason he&#39;s been in the news a lot is because he&#39;s been on a lot of interviews of exposing this secret Hollywood pedophile ring where bigwigs would sexually abuse child actors and said him and Corey helm were sexually abused.<br>This album has to be some kind of cry for help telling people he&#39;s broken and wants someone to help him expose these Hollywood monsters.
Why did Snoop Dogg do it, aside from the money? BECAUSE HE&#39;S HIGH, ALL THE GODDAMN TIME.
Anthony Fantano died for our sins on this one.
smh made it 10 mins long...  theneedledrop is just in it for the money lmao sellout
You poor soul. Did you actually have to pay for that album?
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1180">19:40</a> All of it. That&#39;s how much money, all of it.
why did they ask Snoopy to be on the Skrillex sounding track instead of the slightly more snoop dogesque song Fred drust is on?
dope af
That jazz song is going to be my new alarm clock.
Shout out to anthony for not editing out the burp at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=883">14:43</a>
Whoa! Blood on the dance floors new album is great!
please more of this, amazing format of videos!
why was anthony hating on it this is some pretty good stuff
I&#39;d give this album a gun my mouth out of 10.
burrrp
How is this not Cal&#39;s episode? A?
I&#39;m sorry you had to put yourself through the longevity of the album, but I could not allow myself to take the journey with you for the life of me. May the music gods have mercy on your soul!!!!!!!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2040">34:00</a>-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2070">34:30</a> sounded like something off of South Park wtf?!?
Apparently Corey Feldman was sexually abused or something along those lines as a child by the film makers of Hollywood. Might explain was this album is so terrible
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2639">43:59</a> the melons right, if The Weeknd were singing those lyrics the song wouldn&#39;t be half bad.
corey sounds like the aborted fetus of a crack induced Trent reznor and MJ fuckfest
this seriously makes me think we havent made an musical progress in 40 years
Feeling a strong zero to a light zero on this one
Do the fucking new Danny Brown record you fucking nerd! &lt;3
What the fuck is this shit Fantano? 50 minutes?
I want Corey Feldman to sing Space Jam with his growl voice
You can legitimately tell that Anthony wants to kill himself. He seems incredibly distraught by this album. It&#39;s wonderful.
Visible Confusion: The Analysis
Stop hating on corey, he&#39;s a really great guy!
Corey Feldman = music&#39;s version of Tommy Wiseau?
This reminds me of randy savages rap album
What would make Corey Feldman think that people would actually want to hear this shit?<br>This is so bad that I think Corey Feldman doesn&#39;t even listen to it.<br>I feel bad that you actually listened to this monstrosity in its entirety, Ant.<br>You deserve the purple heart for your valor!
&quot;His songs have always pulled heavily from MJ, for whatever reason&quot;. Whatever reason? Quick read of his wikipedia page will tell you the reason, lol.
I&#39;m gonna get a lot of shit for saying this, but does anyone else get a Mike Patton vibe from this project?
Hey, atleast he&#39;s not talking to himself for 50 minutes
to be honest, the people coming to watch your videos aren&#39;t really interested in purchasing the new corey feldman record. why bother reviewing it in the first place?
Ill just leave this here.<br><br><a href="https://www.facebook.com/corey.feldman2?fref=ts">https://www.facebook.com/corey.feldman2?fref=ts</a>
still better than death grips tho
had to pause at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1931">32:11</a> &quot;bring the stars up to the moon&quot; coreys logic is since the moon is bigger than the stars visually from earth, it must be closer to us. he tries to be someone he&#39;s not &quot;Michael&quot;. What would Michael Jackson think of this, if he had died years after listening to this album, resting in peace would be impossible.
Me: Oh come on stop being so dramatic I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not THAT terrible<br><br>*Listens to album<br><br>Me: I&#39;m sorry I ever doubted you
i&#39;ve actually found a stream of this thing, sounds much worse in quality - really this is pure noise
&quot;Bad People&quot; reminds me of Cory in the House
I been jammin this ish all week wtf you talkin bout
I blame the engineer.
Maybe it&#39;s a drank album. 3 bottles of benylin and it&#39;ll all make sense I reckon.
Always wanted to see Fanatano react to music! Fuck,yes lol
THINKING ABOUT MY KNEES
Didn&#39;t even get the full green screen
Man every since the other Corey passed away, Feldman hasn&#39;t been the same.
Chewing gum isn&#39;t vegan
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1630">27:10</a> haha i dieded
is this a huge ass rant or a review or both
This album was the reason Corey Haim died.
I&#39;m suing Corey Feldman for intellectual property infringement; I had written this whole album 3 years ago
OK, so I have to weigh in here.<br><br>First, it&#39;s unfair that you, Needle Drop, play snippets from the album when (a) you talk over the snippets and (b) the sound quality is severely diminished through your tinny speakers. That, and your making infantile facial gestures while the song is playing will, of course, turn YouTube listeners off the songs. So every time you played a sample, I went to Spotify to judge for myself.<br><br>And, actually, there are some good bits (and decent features) to many of the songs but they go downhill but not for the fact that they are bad songs, outright, but because Corey&#39;s singing needs a lot of work; some restraint was needed in the instrumentation; and, my biggest problem, there&#39;s this mixing of genres in song after song after song which just doesn&#39;t work because Corey lacks the production experience. So the elements were there but a Rick Rubin was needed to turn it into something a Beastie Boys fan would appreciate.<br><br>But even with these flaws, I still wonder if this album is as godawful as Fantano is making it out to be. Because, say, in the context of an 80s-retro buddy cop musical written by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, these songs would actually be listenable. (Yeah, I had to dig deep for context, people, but still.)<br><br>Let me be clear: this is not a good album, but it&#39;s not a complete and utter disaster.
The Shaggs Philosophy of The World<br><br>Terrible album, not for this year (old album) but for all time, and i can assure you that its that bad. It&#39;s a fucking mess.
This album is actually fire in its own fucking stupid retarded way. Y&#39;all melons don&#39;t know shit about music.
This album makes Speedin&#39; Bullet to Heaven look like Illmatic.
I&#39;d probably appear on a Cory Feldman song for about 50 bucks to be honest
I actually loved this album. I&#39;d put it in my top 3 of the year.
Music is over guys, let&#39;s go home.
Man this album feels like its stuck in the 90&#39;s just like Corey Feldman&#39;s career
I donno I liked it
this album is bad, people
I felt like i was having a stroke listening to this
I smiled so much I broke my fucking jaw
I made it to 27minutes.<br>Beat that, sucka
Listening Corey Feldman for 10 minutes just made me think of a drug addicted MJ from a parallel universe that never made it or developed his craft, so he thought that visiting a universe where he did make it big time would rub off on him. <br><br>This album fucked me up. Godspeed to anyone who listens to this album in its entirety.
If I was into BDSM, this would be the soundtrack.
That john lennon cover should be considered a crime.
He seriously just wasted 50 minutes of his life on this review? Better yet, is anyone seriously going to waste 50 minutes of theirs trying to listening to it?? A two minute clip of his Today Show performance, and the fact that the album has been 10 years in the making is all you need to know. Even Boston&#39;s epic comeback album (you know the one with &quot;Amanda&quot; on it) only took 5 years... c&#39;mon!!
This album sounds like a bunch of leftover songs from Sonic Adventure. The vocals are strange which was to be expected but the instrumentals really make you wonder what kind of headspace his producers were in.
I LOVED EVERY SECOND OF THIS ALBUM BECAUSE IT GIVES ME HOPE FOR ALL THE CORY FELDMANS OUT THERE WHO DONT HAVE A VOICE NOW THEY HAVE A VOICE ITS KOREA FELDMAY!!
you look like a chubby steve o
Jesus christ wtf lol, I figured this would be a whack album but I had no idea it was this bad!
YOU&#39;VE FINALLY DONE IT ANTHONY, YOU&#39;VE FINALLY LOST YOUR MIND(AFTER REVIEWING THIS ALBUM), CONGRATS :) cracks @ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1080">18:00</a>
This record would have been half decent back in the 80s, right?
Found my next acid album, thanks fantano.
This really reminds me of an Australian rapper called RAED.
I just listened to some of the tracks of the album and I literally feel physically ill.
Corey is ahead of his time. This is so punk that it surpasses any normality.
Honesty most top 40 music is worse than this. Any Taylor Swift, rihanna, Britney, bieber, and most rap is worse than this.
the album is 40 minutes longer than this review
Honestly I heard the bits you played and thought it was bad, but not the absolute worst thing ever.<br>Then I listened to it on Spotify.<br>Holy shit it&#39;s worse than I could have ever imagined
Mean
Is there a way you can do a direct feed for the music while you play it? Just seems like it would make your videos better.
it seems like he&#39;s trying to do a ziltoid type thing but failing so badly
leave Corey Feldman alone he was repetedly molested at a young age.
Anthony. In that worn out shirt, you look like that album sounds. My ears AND eyes hurt.
I want to make a god awful album so Anthony can just fucking roast me.  I&#39;d love it.
Corey Feldman&#39;s level of delusion and lack of self awareness is really mind blowing, but you have to keep in mind this is a person who grew up as a &quot;celebrity&quot; in a fucked up industry, his mind operates in a different frequency. One can only assume what that kind of thing would do to your mental sanity.
Die Antwoord is God.
God this was the funniest shit I&#39;ve seen in a min 😭
This album &gt; Blink 182&#39;s new album
&quot;I challenge you to find an album worse than this&quot;<br><br>Dream Theater&#39;s The Astonishing
kinda like BOTDF&#39;s ugly cousin
No worst album is still SBTH
Corey Feldman is a real life Michael Scott.
Hellboy was a good ass mixtape!! tf fantano???
Still review that new lil peep tho
For some reason, when I here Corey&#39;s voice in the songs, I get a Beavis and Butthead vibe. And I fuckin hate Beavis and Butthead.
Corey&#39;s singing has Drake looking D&#39;Angelo
corey feldman was abused when he was a child actor. google it, seems to be a regular thing in hollywood
Please dont talk about Lil Peep like that hes easily one of the most influential artists this year and the only person that can make the underground cry
This is Just awful, had to listen to pimp a butterfly 20times to eliminate this filth from my memory
Yo is this J ROC&#39;s new album?? Shiiiid, SunnyVale Trailer Park represent boi.
Snoop Dogg was probably high when he showed up to record anyway.
Album was way more cornier than Hopsin &amp; Childish Gambino combined
Corey Feldman on Howard Stern channel 9 show from maybe late 80s early 90s was even worse than this...
this is an epic trashing
you are an idiot anthony. i didn&#39;t think you&#39;d stoop this low but i guess anything for views these days.
Hey sis, got that good cheeba cheeba?
At 1st I was like &#39;oh ok needledrop doing a podcast..NOPE!&#39; &amp; I thought the Miley review was long
Feeling a strong 7 to a light 8 on this banger
This is &quot;The Room&quot; of music albums.
Corey needs to do a collaboration album with Kevin Federline and Vanilla Ice
It might be a piss take bro haha
Y he diss lil peep tho. Smh no chill
Don&#39;t forget how the songs are pretty just the same drum loop and synth line with no variation.  Yes I listened to it.  Yes I hate myself.  Yes it&#39;s worse when you actually hear it in your headphones.
THINKENNNN BOUT MAHHH NIECE
I went to the iTunes preview of this album. Played 2 tracks, stopped them almost immediately. And then kicked.. What a humiliation.
&quot;I want a briiiick freeeeeeee, want a briiiiiiiiick freeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!&quot;
My jaw actually dropped when I looked at the video after the first few minutes and saw the video length
review summary at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=883">14:43</a>
I just realized that every time Anthony makes a funny face he looks like Mickey Rooney from Breakfast at Tiffany&#39;s.
I genuinely feel bad for the guy. The public reaction to this seems to have really upset him (which is a bummer, because this record is fun in how ridiculous everything is).
holy hell im laughing
The album changes quite a bit if you picture Donatello from the 1990&#39;s Ninja Turtles film singing it
Little do you know Anthony, this was the long lost final piece of the No Love Deep Web ARG finally released to the public after Flatlander found it on an old hard drive.<br><br>I expect an apology video and a retroactive score of a perfect 10 within 24 hours.
they were able to cobble together a 50 Tyson song, but not get a key match, or a blend. I used to record albums in basement studios that sound mix was better than this. Awful. God Bless you for making it through.
Someone should remix this album into club tracks and call it &quot;Corey in da house&quot;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=555">09:15</a> I think it&#39;s Party Rock Anthem
Some of these songs are passable by today&#39;s radio standards. The others are the equivalent of what my friends and I made at 3AM when we were 15. At least we knew it was for fun. I&#39;m sure he does it for fun, he just doesn&#39;t know it yet...
Best Parts<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=218">3:38</a> - Anthony Gagtano<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=443">7:23</a> - Running Man Slips Into Insanity<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=740">12:20</a> - Anthony Gets Lickity Splickity<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=927">15:27</a> - Anthony Gets Bad<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1064">17:44</a> - Anthony Finally Does It<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1190">19:50</a> - Anthony Goes For It<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1337">22:17</a> - Dancethony Breaktano<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1500">25:00</a> - Anthony Breaks Free<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1951">32:31</a> - Synthany Mixtano<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2115">35:15</a> - &quot;Weeeeeeeeee&quot;<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2371">39:31</a> - Anthony Gets Vocal<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2465">41:05</a> - Mufukn Walkn
Suicidal 2 the core
Okay to be honest not all of his songs are dog shits in a dumpster fire. Some of them were only dog shit. At least it had that
Im just confused as to why, if he wants this, He hasn&#39;t practiced and studied music for the last 20 years. With as much love for music as he claims he has. You&#39;d think you&#39;d actually... I don&#39;t know... Do it enough to get good at it.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1660">27:40</a> sounds like a bad anime opening
you thought u were gonna listen to a decent album but it was ME! COREY FEILDMAN!!
I&#39;d rather listen to Charlie Puth - Nine Track Mind on repeat for hours then to listen to another second of Corey Feldman&#39;s shit rock and bath salt-infused rave fest.
this was a pretty amazing rift lol can u rift on more bad music?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2122">35:22</a> is poetry
It&#39;s like if Peter Gabriel had a lovechild with a big pile of flaming Human Hair.
I don&#39;t know which psychological meltdown is more entertaining, Corey Feldman&#39;s in making and performing on this album, or Orangethony Banano reacting to the entire thing
I agree with everything he said except the new Die Antwoord album is dope
well, in his defense... he DID record sounds
If <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=830">13:50</a> was released by PC Music, people would be all over it.
He&#39;s like if a bopit released a mixtape
Corey Feldman is the Tommy Wiseau of pop music.
angelic 2 the core is puller from pornosonic also .
its so funny how Anthony is pretending to not like it the whole time lol
Speedin bullet 2 the core...of my skull.
When he just breaks into laughter I start dying
mercyyyyyyyyy
Yet the media makes all you idiots think Drake is any better lol! Drake sucks but the media and heavy PR tells you: This is good your teenage daughter likes it it&#39;s good etc.!
I have heard from him in an interview that the haters are to blame.
Corey Feldman music fans are like aliens I never seen one personally but other people claim to have, and there&#39;s some evidence of them but nothing to show how many there are or if they&#39;re capable of intelligence.
Wow 50 minutes long lol he is pissed with it
Well is not the worst album if it makes you laugh Anthony
it sounds like he&#39;s trying really hard to sound like Kendrick Lamar some times
It&#39;s the musical equivalent of Caillou.<br><br>Murder me.
The sad irony of this video is that it&#39;s promoting the album way more than it deserves to be heard of.
This album&#39;s a practical joke, right?
50 minutes of Antwan Fantwan sign me the fuck up.
I think you actually liked it in the sense that it was so bad it was good. I&#39;ve never seen you do a 50 min review before &amp; you laughed the whole way through. lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=460">7:40</a> He&#39;s broken, does anybody know how to fix him.
Haha wtf Anthony <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=883">14:43</a><br>He is one funny dude
Just checked out the Today show clip, and the reporter said this album was ten years in the making.  I&#39;m speechless.  10 years.  Holy shitballs.
The amount of Fantano eye rolls in this project...I&#39;m feeling a light to decent 9 on this thing.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1035">17:15</a> Hilarious. And yes, someone should be in jail.
Albums like this happen when an insane artist hires a &quot;yes man&quot; as a producer.
I love you Anthony, but I am not spending all my time listening to a review of an album I haven&#39;t heard of
Watching Anthony descend into insanity is incredibly entertaining. More of this, please!
I genuinely feel really bad for Corey Feldman
Your laugh is great. Just wanted to remind you.
jokes aside, how the fuck did this get made?
Bring the stars up to the moon 🎶🎵
dad, you so sexy in that white tank
Review Bubblebath by That Poppy.
Wait is Anthony sitting down??? At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1038">17:18</a> he spins way too smoothly to be standing, but I&#39;ve always pictured him standing for these. This changes everything!
Could&#39;ve sworn it was 5 minutes
Watching him freestyle better than any lyric on the record around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1740">29:00</a>
this is gold
This album is SOOOO bad that he had to actually play it for us. That&#39;s fucked.
in this video you can see the five stages of grief<br><br><br>edit: after a rewatch, it still feels like an epic journey towards the last remaining sanity he could find after listening to such an album
Worst song or BEST song?! YES GIRL - giving us that David Lee Roth moment! You are taking me there, Mike Phelps or whatever your name is - who CARES? This transcends my own comprehension of good taste and MUSIC GODLINESS.<br><br>Crown him QUEEN of the Musical Championships a la Tommy Wiseau! 👑 Then take that crown away because he ain&#39;t no Jonbenet Ramsay... RIP. <br><br>This album just fricked me up - second time watching this. Messy.<br><br>EDIT: Sorry Mike Phelps - I meant Corey Fiddleman or whatever.
It&#39;ll grow on you :^)
Mr. Feldman owes me a new pair of ribs. Jesus FUCK.
The worse album is Ukrainian Fire- Chicken Strips, it&#39;s on Spotify
i loved this vido, the only thing i thought needed improvement was when i was binge drinking and thought this was a real album, lol. still watched every minute of the video
Guantanamo-core
for the next Corey Feldman you should listen to it from beginning to end and stream it or something
anthony fantano is officially broken
He literally shits on this guy the whole 50 minutes
BRING THA STARS UP 2 THA MOON
What is Corey doing?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=580">9:40</a> daft punk, tron legacy album
pen pineapple apple pen has better production than this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1619">26:59</a> Awful Frank Zappa Scrutinizer impression lol.
This reminds me of Spy Kids when they&#39;re in thumb land?
does snapthony chattano have a snapchat?
omg- I&#39;m dying
RE REVIEW BLANK FACE
That synth lead from chris brown - Turn Up The Music ?
Next years worst album: Anthony Fantano - MPB
from now on i&#39;m staying away from albums that have a religious word and the number 2 in the title.
he needs Some Milk
The Needle Drop: The Film
ant looks violated at the start..<br><br>shit has to be Bad.
Somebody make a GIF of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=930">15:30</a> please
This is an album that could only be made in L.A. It just sounds like a cocaine fueled rehash of what a gathering of Hollywood executives think is cool. It&#39;s crap, suits. Total crap...
DELETE THIS THIS ALBUM IS BEAUTIFUL
this fun anthony, listenin with fany, it&#39;s a good segment
im intrigued and scared to listen to this now
it&#39;s like that scene in boogie nights where dirk diggler tries to sing &quot;you&#39;ve got the touch&quot;...but worse.
If this was released be kendrick you&#39;d give it a 9
lickidy splickidy is something old people from the south say all the time, anthony, my grandma says that shit all the time
is the album slowly moving in the back?
this shit is literally a tim and eric sketch come to life
I&#39;d put the people who genuinely enjoy this music in the same fucking boat as the people who support trump.Then I&#39;d nuke the boat.
After watching this Corey Feldman is going to have give Anthony some bars on his next album
The wrong Corey died.
i was bullied
It&#39;s like Tommy Wiseau made an album..
Smh just trying to get past the 10 minute mark for extra money
Lmao he looks and sounds like Skrillex after he first left From First to Last. That first EP he did under the name Sonny sounds just like this trash album lol
I like how sad he is, and then pure joy/bewilderment. He makes this actually enjoyable to listen to with his faces and banter. Love you Corthony Feldtano.
You crossed the line, Fantano. (Why is this sold out on Amazon? I&#39;m so sad..)
so u give kenny lamer a 10/10 but you disrespect corey and his amazinng cd?????! U dont know nything anthony
I&#39;ve heard worse. It&#39;s pretty atrocious, but not quite the zero level.<br><br>I&#39;d give it a light 1.
Seriously though, the website is just as funny as the album &quot;Angelic 2 The Core will also serve as a breakout launching pad for the “Corey’s Angel’s” brand, which helps beautiful young women realize their dreams.&quot; ... WHHAATT
Holy Fuck, he&#39;s not standing up?
Another quality avant-garde noise pop record from my man corey
Apparently it will be released in a &quot;biodegradable DOUBLE CD SET&quot; ...which is a consolation!
i see that ought album boi
HOT NEWS: DRAKE&#39;S GHOSTWRITER FINALLY STOOD OUT OF AUBREY&#39;S SHADOW
ur a meanie antnee
Lickethony Splickitano here, the Internet&#39;s most suicidal music nerd
this guy is such a clown
Anthony I think you would get the same results if NOT EVEN WORSE if you would listen to Russian pop music of USSR period. You will not understand much, but it is very similar to instrumental on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1492">24:52</a>
I had to take this video in small doses because it hurt to listen to that music
Oh my god!! He is trying so hard to sound like Michael Jackson. It sounds horrible!!!
I get that you did this for entertainment purposes only but please review something that&#39;s actually listenable. Francis and the lights dropped Farewell, Starlite I want to hear your take on it please let that be your next review.
this album &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; views
Like no joke this sounds like mental illness in an album<br>Have people checked up on Corey?
if 50 cent dropped an album this year, I reckon it could be as bad as this, anthony knows,<br>but this corey feldman album sounds like a turdfest
someone out in the world  is shelling out cash for this only to be disappointed
I had to do a track by track review of this for the paper I work for.....I feel your pain. This album cannot be liked even ironically, it is literally so bad that it incites physical  repulsion. What I really want to know is who OK&#39;d this? Who decided to give it a budget and get him on the today show? Surely somebody heard this and saw it for what it was?!?!?!?!
If Death Grips released this album he&#39;d give it a 10/10 LOL
The best teeth in the game has a Diddy Dolphin smile when he&#39;s geekin
I had to watch this again, 14 hours later, just to watch that Ascension Millennium dance again.
Cringeful to the Core-y
Melony Headtano would&#39;ve loved this album if it had Death Grips&#39; name on it and they replaced all the vocals with Stefan&#39;s
What if corey did EVERYTHING himself? He just payed the guests out of pocket &amp; edited it all himself. Id say at the least hes got a few good ideas.... just needs some help.
It could be worse.  At least The Nutshack theme isnt on this album.
i..i gotta go get this album, guys
Trim that neckline my nigga
Who else thinks Fagtano should make more of these? His suffering gives me life.
hi, Electron Antineutrino here
poor dood had a train ran on him by old twisted men in hollywood.. we are just rubbernecking the trainwreck
what the fucktano is going on here?
Corey Feldman &gt; Kendrick Lamar
You do these videos in a chair? This whole time I thought you were standing.
Holy shit your teeth are amazing
It&#39;s outsider art.
This album is like 19187563257235832998532 other albums out there, I don&#39;t understand why consider this already the worst... Is it because he is famous?
this is brutal ahahaha
What the fuck is this?  Why?  What the fuck am I doing with my life.  Why am I wasting my time listening to this?
buy my mixtape yeah
South Park might have a field day with this album.
i quite liked it
Lol seen Corey promoting this album on the Today Show &amp; Wendy Williams. The album sounds more glorious than I expected. lol  Although I feel bad for the guy after hearing about his messed up past
produced by merzbow
I really hope Corey Feldman is on South Park this season.
i&#39;m 90% sure the synth lead on that second song is stolen wholesale from neon lights by demi lovato
Reminds me of Blood On The Dance Floor lol
&quot;I can&#39;t even begin to describe how terrible this album is&quot; <b>proceeds to describe album for 50 minutes</b>
watched the whole thing, should i be proud for surving or crazy for not bashing my skull
Feldman sacrificed himself so that nobody will ever sound as bad as him.<br>He has become the marker point of rock bottom.<br>He is the &quot;Abandon All Hope&quot; carved into the gates of the music industry
This is fucking horrible oh my god what was he thinking
This is my favourite video of 2016! Fucking hell I&#39;ve been laughing my ass off throughout! :D<br><br>&quot;&#39;BOUT MY NIEEEECE!&quot;
i&#39;d be on go 4 it for free. hell yeah
Theneedledrop: The Movie.
Is that Starry Night on his left arm?
That is PEEP&#39;s lane af tho. lol
~~~anthony... i came across your channel two years ago. dont really see eye to eye with all your musical tastes, or the formats of your videos but aside from that you do have good insights which is why i tune in...i have to say though, i dont think ive ever agreed with you more on one of your reviews. though i do disagree about one point: he should go to jail. he should be tried at the ICC, his records used to light the fire they set his body ablaze with when they sentence him to death. accompanying him should be everyone that took part in the creation of this cacophonous shitpile.
He sounds a lot like Dave Mustaine&#39;s brain on coke
Here&#39;s to Corey making another Album so we all can enjoy more <br>Suicidethony Deadtano
Ive listened to about 1/3 of the first song and the songs he did with Fred Durst and Snoop Dogg and i couldn&#39;t take anymore, i&#39;d rather remove each toenail off my toes than ever listen to that shit again, physically couldn&#39;t handle it. Jesus fucking christ.<br>Fuck you Corey Feldman.
He would give it a 10/10 of it was Death Grips
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=928">15:28</a> &quot;Bad People&quot; should be on a shitty modern Sonic The Hedgehog video game so I can enjoy that shit in it&#39;s worst setting
&quot;Hey Corey? Can you please mix the ingredients for this cake?&quot;<br>Corey Feldman, probably: oh god.
it&#39;s like if Dave Mustaine didn&#39;t know how to shred on guitar and made an album
your shirt is on inside out :3
why the fuck am I getting Tyler Oakley ads for fucking glasses<br>I have perfect vision fuck you goggle you bith
Thinthony Hairtano
anthony could literally record the vocals on this album and it would be better.
I almost feel like buying the deluxe version of this album to see the behind the scenes stuff and his personal thoughts on the lyrics
anyone notice he said hellboy was terrible?
You gotta review <i>Atrocity Exhibition</i>, man. Get your mind off this one.
I like watching his videos and when he reviews bad albums I find them entertaining and all but this one you can tell it&#39;s bad
Corey Feldman had the best album of the year.
only a couple of minutes in and I know this is gonna be hard to watch
Hey can you make some t shirts so i can buy one
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=790">13:10</a><br><br>&quot;I worry about Corey Feldman, I really do.&quot;<br><br><br><b>Batman transition music</b> <br><br><br>&quot;Okay, you know what? Fuck Corey Feldman&quot;
You are roasting Feldman but you praise that stinky warm garbage known as Death Grips.
It makes me ashamed to like bones just because he is lightly associated with fred durst who is lightly associated with this album
at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1697">28:17</a> it&#39;s a ripoff of Tim and Eric&#39;s Totinos song
just give it a 0/10 m8
Robb banks review
Hey Anathoy Fondrombo, if you need a pick-me-up after hearing this abortion of an album, maybe you could check out the DOOM OST? It&#39;s quite good IMO.
&quot;Feel the beat now<br>Out on the street now&quot;<br><br>Straight fire
This nigga just quit music reviews check his Twitter
This sounds like what middle schoolers make in their mom&#39;s basement with $20 instruments
lol at snoop dogg showing up wherever a check is that is so true
He&#39;s been broken
yo, what did you think of korns new songs?
Corey Feldman is the next death grips
Anthony I promise when you eventually review my work that it will be at least as good as this album
not sure if review albums that aren&#39;t very well known but best buds by mom jeans did an album this year, i find them on reddit. Would like to hear your opinion on them
TEN YEARS IN THE MAKING
Corey Feldman 2: Electric Bogaloo
your face at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1422">23:42</a> &quot;whatcha wanna daaooo&quot;
Corey Feldman is the Neil Breen of music
I Unsubbed from yo bitch ass for that 3 you have Travis Scott album, I&#39;m giving you a chance to regain my respect, you better Review Mick Jenkins album and if you disappoint me....just don&#39;t disappoint me
Executive Produced by Neil Breen.
lmao when I saw the run time for this video I died
50 minutes of fantano going insane
You just don&#39;t get it Anthony....
I haven&#39;t had a side splitting, hearty, belly laugh in awhile. Thank you Anthony for this review 😂
BOUT MY NIECE!
DO DANNY BROWN&#39;S ALBUM RN PLEASE
This is like Antwan Fantwan The Movie
that second track sounds like R.A.E.D.
does anyone know of fantano&#39;s opinion on Joey Badas$$ Devistated?
This is the perfect gag gift to give to someone you wanna prank or just don&#39;t like. Wouldn&#39;t buy the album though. Just find a copy online and finally use up those blank CDs that have been sitting on the side for years.
Broo.... 50 mins?!?!!!
This album is The Room of music
This is way too easy of a target.  You might as well have picked a 14 year old&#39;s soundcloud
your laugh is contagious XD
This is funny but I find it kinda hard to make fun of Corey, knowing that he was sexually abused as a child
Havent watched entire video yet, why is there no rating in description?
Danthony Browntano
This sounds like Corey Feldman listened the the Max Anarchy OST and thought, &quot;Yeah, I could do that!&quot;
STOP REVIEWING THIS WEIRD SHIT WHERE THE FUCK IS MICK JENKINS REVIEW
why is this video 50 minutes long i don&#39;t have time for this you fat bald fuck
I know I&#39;ve commented like 45 times but &quot;Mercy&quot; is actually a decent ass track.
I kinda like it. Has that post-post-post-post-ironic meme quality to it.
Grandpa Skrillex LMAO
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1350">22:30</a> Fantano is Cal confirmed
Cal Chuchesta probably thinks this song is a a Ten/10.
I&#39;d pay so much money to have had never listened to this 🙃🔫
This shit is real live an hour long 😂
Do Atrocity Exhibition!!!
please review The Growlers!!!
I&#39;m pretty sure snoop dogg didn&#39;t know wats going on and even if he knew I&#39;m pretty sure he just finesse him for money bc he didn&#39;t sounds amused lol
Watching your descent into madness is quite entertaining
Making obnoxious faces to the music is NOT an argument, its just cringe.
listening to this just so i can build up the courage to kill myself
It&#39;s like he&#39;s trying to bring together the vocals of Michael Jackson and Alice Cooper, which sounds like a terrible idea anyway, but he&#39;s even doing that exceptionally badly. What the fuck is this thing?
REVIEW DANNY&#39;S ALBUM, IT&#39;S OUT EARLY
I need to buy this for my younger brother for christmas.
This is Anthony&#39;s magnum opus. Nothing Fantano can do will ever top these 50 minutes of existential dread and mockery while listening to Cory Feldman.
Congratulations, you memed yourself
this is the greatest video ive ever seen
spoiler:6/10
wow i guess this makes that miley cyrus and the dead dog album sounds like a masterpiece
he sounds like Bowie, but post mortem
Aux&#39;s facial expressions of disgust was worth corey making this vid. lol
Please go to the album webpage and just read the credits. Please.
snoop didnt even try
Don&#39;t listen to the haters Corey!
I sat through this whole thing.
The Nutshack theme but with the word Nutshack replaced with Angelic 2 the Core by Corey Feldman
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1710">28:30</a> sneaky anthony fantano cameo there
What is this I don&#39;t even
I have never once, in my 5 or 6 years of being subscribed to this channel, have witnessed Fantano play the music he&#39;s reviewing, which makes me feel as if this album has to be so bad that the only thing he can do to save us is show us. HOLY FUCK
He really should be arrested.
nigga trying to be AVGN but he tha AMN (angry music nerd) bruh
For once, I agree with a Fantano review!
Dude Anthony&#39;s laugh is hilarious! I died everytime lol
How bout that new Ty Dolla Sign album? Gonna review dat?
Listening to the audio through laptop speakers through a YouTube video makes everything in the album sound MUCH less bad (relative to using halfway decent headphones).<br><br>Something tells me Corey Feldman used laptop speakers for the production...
so what makes this different from Death Grips, exactly?
I took a bullet for music fans everywhere ages ago when I reviewed Kevin Federline&#39;s album when it was first released. It&#39;s better than this. You guys remember K-Fed, right? No? That&#39;s OK.
I feel so bad for Corey and I don&#39;t know why.<br><br>Also does anybody listen to Celldweller or Blue Stahli? Because this album kinda sounds like that
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1508">25:08</a> MDE STICKER SIGHTED
Some of the arrangement is good actually but when the vocal came it&#39;s just the worst.
Sounds like this album was composed entirely of garageband loops
Dude keep up with the listening sessions for longer album reviews (of actual decent records maybe), if you&#39;re fine copyright wise
That&#39;s what kids like these days, right?
You made this too early dc4 coming out this year too
when will something phenomenal come?
you were right.
If The Room was a CD.
What combination of influences would produce this?
Corethony Feldtano.
The good thing about this?<br>It makes Nickelback a really good band.
Almost as bad as MBDTF
If your Tattoos could sing, it would sound like Corey Feldman
Still better than russian pop music.
Any album with number &#39;&#39;2&#39;&#39; on the title is destined to be Anthony&#39;s worst.
Isn&#39;t it kinda fucked up that someone who claims their childhood was ruined by Michael Jackson is trying so hard to be like him?
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23stopcoreyhate2016">#stopCoreyhate2016</a>
THE NEEDLE DROP: THE MOVIE
&quot;He&#39;s a concerned uncle.&quot;<br><br>Died.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1955">32:35</a> Fantano&#39;s brain melts
Every song sounds like it should be ironically on South Park O.o
if any album has &quot;2&quot; in the title, it&#39;s garunteed to be fucking awful.
Anthony is actually a better singer than Corey
i actually think Cory is heaps experimental and hes just playing with us all
i burped at the exact moment he did.<br>pretty sure it wasnt coincidental.
This may be the worst album of 2016, but for me this is the best review of anything ever.
So is it worst than Speeding Bullet?
so 10/10?
The album was weird! Haha! I am a father of two ungrateful kids with a dead end job and I want to fucking die. I dance like a drunken peasant to a choir of dying happiness and self destruction. I try to hid my pain by coming into work everyday and trying to engage in conversation, but even the laymen can tell by my low eyes and awkward goodbyes that I&#39;m dying inside. However they don&#39;t care. My life is like watching a car crash. -Bill Smith
This is a very, very broken man. All it takes is one bad day...
review bone thugs E1999
I would actually rather listen to sandpaper being scraped on a chalkboard, I would rather drag my teeth across a sidewalk than hear this, and I only heard what Anthony played on the vid
holy shit that intense white for 50 minutes is really painful.
I cant get over the fact that this is teddy from stand by me doing all this shit.
Him dancing is life
Is this video really 50 mins long
wow corey got molested as a kid youre a fuckin savage Anthony
Someone edit his dance moves to Death Grips music
So much gif potential in this review
This video is long enough to qualify as a feature film
Your misery and crumbling sanity amuses me so much. Fuck this album is awful. It&#39;s also kinda sad but still funny how you can tell the people who claim to like this shitty album are only saying so out of pity for Feldman because he cried over the meanies on the internet lol
LICKITY SPLICKY
If ya really don&#39;t like someone, send this album to them. Point will be well taken.
Danny Brown!!!!!
Still better than bittsm
This guy is the Tommy Wiseau of music.<br><br>Also Corey did a bad job on this album.
modern-day Trout Mask Replica right here
core feldman is like a train wreck. You don&#39;t want to see it but at the same time you can&#39;t stop staring.
my fav TND video ever
Do an album review of No Xanax Needed by Hi-Tone!!  It&#39;s very good and I think u will enjoy it!  Please do a review on it, I really would like to know ur opinion of that album.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1580">26:20</a> RESIST CAPITALISAM BOY strikes again!
Reppin&#39; some OMD, I see!
Some of the songs on the album sound like The Pop Group. If The Pop Group were utterly, utterly horrible.
review other music reviewers music reviews
Ought album in the background
white people may have ruined everything, but kid cudi ruined grunge
The song at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2122">35:22</a> I actually kind of like. I agree with Anferny, if a good group did that song or this album it might be enjoyable.
from his website:<br><br>&#39;The album contains a total of 22 songs featuring collaborations with five generations of Hip Hop artists such as Fred Durst (Limp Bizkit), Snoop Dogg, Doc Ice (Whodini/UTFO), Kurupt and up and coming rap artist Demario “SB.” Additionally, Corey has enlisted contributions from incredible recording artists, songwriters and musicians including but not limited to: Kaya Jones (Pussycat Dolls), R1ckone (Black Eyed Peas), Scott Page (Pink Floyd), B.Howard, POET (Black Eyed Peas), Dave Dunn (Infectous Grooves), The Wizards (Production team), Jon Carin (Pink Floyd), Manny Mijaris (EDM Producer), Thomas Van Musser (writer for Black Eyed Peas), Graham Ward (Paul McCartney), Glasses Boys (EDM collective), Michael Debarge (Debarge), Truth Movement, Tommy Daugherty (Death Row recording engineer), Angel Courtney Anne aka DJAC, and of course Corey’s Angels (backing vocalists). Angelic 2 The Core will also serve as a breakout launching pad for the “Corey’s Angel’s” brand, which helps beautiful young women realize their dreams.&#39;<br><br>I don&#39;t even know what to make of that.
if you think this is the worst, you haven&#39;t heard my music yet.
HE IS RAZZING HARD!!!! This has to be a publicity stunt of some sort...surely...Anthony, expose him haha he can&#39;t be serious.
this is some fuckin godmaymay right here, thx whamthony
review house of pain same as it ever was
This is like the music version of the room. Also, this is better than anything Death Grips has done.
not a fan of the goonies
BEST<br>TEETH<br>IN THE GAME
This Corey Fledman album makes me feel bad that I like Frank Zappa&#39;s music. Even though half his shit is intentionally funny, I just can&#39;t not think of this tortured abortion of an album when listening to, well any kind of outsider music.
you just don&#39;t get it
now within [NOT GOOD] you have to rate the albums, this being the lower limit (or a 1) in the [NOT GOOD] spectrum.
Hey, Fantano, Corey Feldman just blew your mind.
His songs sound like an awful parody song that South Park would feature.
did he ever review watskys new album
DEAR GOD MY EARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Since this is the first time i&#39;ve ever seen Anthony actually listening to music, I&#39;m just going to assume these actions and facial expressions are what he does to all music
you should have had a new title for this other than &quot;not good&quot; because that puts right next to savage mode. Savage Mode is a classic and should not be considered in the same stratosphere as this. 21 21 21 21 21 21. Now that we&#39;re changing the format of your videos a lil bit, id like a retract video for Savage Mode.  fantasy please right your wrongs and give savage mode another chance.
mybodywasnotready
This was fucking fantastic Anthony
If Kanye did this would be considered genius af
Is this the The Room of music?
this is the happiest I&#39;ve ever seen Fantione during a review
This would have got a 10 if it had a Kendrick feature
Corey Feldman&#39;s best vocal performance was on Numbers by Neil Cicierega
Damaged
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2371">39:31</a> gonna sample the fuck out of this
This guy is like the Tommy Wiseau of music
everyday we stray further from God&#39;s light
album art reminds me of aqua teen hunger force. i miss that show
Whats worth anthony, nutshack memes or this album?
Sooooo.....? A light to strong 3?
Anthony, this was amazing. Thank you for your sacrifice.
Can we request albums for you to review here? If so, I have one, Kyle Morton - What Will Destroy you, it&#39;s a new drop, and I personally think it&#39;s beautiful. And if not, can someone redirect me to the right place?
Classics week 10 years from now (god forbid) &quot;Corey was WAY ahead of his time&quot;
This album is outsider art at it&#39;s finest 10/10
jajaja more videos like this
The worst part about all of this is that now my Amazon &quot;things you looked at&quot; list will always show Angelic 2 The Core.  How the fuck am I supposed to explain that shit to my children?
so anthony turns to mickey mouse when laughing at bad music
LMAO 50 MINUTES!!
The Album cover surely looks like a Vaporwave collage thing, and the music itself seems more confused than the actual Vaporwave album.
Hey Anthony, would you review Jared dines ep ? Or rest repose ep ?
Please review The Gaslamp Killer - Instrumentalepathy. Would love to hear what you think of his work!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1620">27:00</a> sounds like shitty Daft Inch Nails.
vlog of the year! one question Anthony, what does Cal think of the album?
i never thought i could watch a person suffer so much
This is what happens when you tell that tone deaf kid in chorus in fifth grade he has a future in music.
How does this have higher than 1 star on iTunes?
This is The Room of Albums
It&#39;s surreal to see Anthony going along this downward spiral while enduring great pain and falling into laughing fits...
50 minutes Jesus
FIFTY MINUTES WHAT THE FUCK FANTANO
&quot;Did I stroke out..did he stroke out? someone has definitely stroken out.&quot; That&#39;s how I felt hearing these songs on this album. 😂<br><br>I know you don&#39;t do reaction videos for anything but you need to watch his Live TV performance on youtube. the dance moves he does in the beginning..oh my god..
Thc
Next time you do one of these you should live stream it. Good job by the way
I chose to watch this instead of the newest installment of Jack Slack&#39;s Fights Gone By podcast, and have no regrets.
I want to see another video like this for Speedin Bullet 2 Heaven
One of my favorite parts of this review is Anthony just periodically burping because he just can&#39;t be fucking bothered. And then the haphazard throwing up of the album cover all crooked behind him is like icing on the cake.
How can someone manage to steal from MJ, Celldweller, and Jet Set Radio, and yet NOT MANAGE TO MAKE A SINGLE GOOD TRACK, HOW THE FUCK DO YOU DO THAT?
baldthony headtano
lets say that connor4real from the movie popstar was real. and conn4real actually released the album conquest, that album would be a 10 compared to this
at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2347">39:07</a> the beat reminds me of an awful version of stylo by the gorillaz
Facts, cool cat levels of delusion going on here.
what ever happened to his other channel. I know he has the thatistheplan meme channel but didn&#39;t he have a channel called thisistheplan where&#39;d he just talked about random extra shit
Holy Shit. This is awful. I&#39;m actually sort of worried about Corey Feldman harming himself after this video because of how personally he took the internet&#39;s reaction to his Today Show performance
da cory feildman is 1 of da best jokes in da game. 10en outta 10en
COREY HAS GOT THE SHITTIEST VOICE AND LYRICS I HAVE EVER HEARD! HE DESERVES TO BE LAUGHED AT
Review new Danny Brown
anthony just go back to being a meme reviewer
This is the best video on the internet. Hands down.
Who was the producer? Corey needs to just STOP!!!
That little <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1106">18:26</a> fake reaction cracks me up. Totally what I picture Corey&#39;s managers and producers doing while listening to the record. Ha, ha.
This could be the worst album of all-time.
falling back like a hairline
Congratulations Anthony you created a new meme
What the fuck is Feldman rambling about?! He sounds like he&#39;s highly medicated...
I miss the COMPLETE days. Hoogie Boogie Land!
I got to say, after listening to the entire record in one sitting...I can truly I enjoyed at least half of the songs ironically/not ironically...not the worst album in my opinion lol
REVIEW TY DOLLA $IGN YOU MELON FUCK
after seeing his movie from a few years back &quot;Splatter&quot; this doesn&#39;t surprise me.
All time classic review
I just listened to the album and wow Anthony you were right it WAS the worst song on the record. Wow
I kind of hate to say this, but &quot;do it lickety-splicky&quot; needs to be a meme of some kind.<br>I mean, it&#39;s already a terrible phrase. Might as well put it in the ground, right?
Good meme on Cory Field-hand.
This can&#39;t even be ironically bad, oh my god
can we do mick jenkin&#39;s new drop? personally am really enjoying it and love the water driven beats carried over from his last 2 projects
REAL FUNKY HOURS WHO UP
revew the trolls soundtrack
do you make all those faces and dance around when listening to every album
I swear when he burped I thought his body was rejecting the song.
Turn that melon head upside down - it&#39;s still a melon
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1874">31:14</a> straight up sounds like summer girls by L.F.O or some shit
Is this a sign of end times?
This review is art.<br>Birdman had to hide its cuts, but Fanthony Antano does the entire 50 minute video in a single shot, no cuts! (at least I think so)<br><br>Melony Mantano &gt; Birdman
damn this is worse than to pimp a butterfly
Maybe this album is album is so good it sounds bad
i honestly didn&#39;t think anything could be this bad
I slowly watched Anthony finally lose his mind.
Tankthony Toptano
This album makes SP2H look like TPAB
I actually enjoyed the &quot;awful song&quot; section of this album. Two thumbs up an ass
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1310">21:50</a> literally sounds like someone is crying. like...did the person playing there just....not care whether it sounded good or...?
Best Needledrop video ever, this was hilarious.
sounds like the shaft intro on the speaking portions
before this video i don&#39;t even knew this guy even exist, and my life was better
tell him to review starboy
lol&#39;d at the Chinese water torture comment
Speedin&#39; Bullet 2 Heaven was the worst album of 2015. Angelic 2 the Core is the worst album of 2016. <br><br>This is 2 much of a coincidence.
I actually listened to the thing...this has to be satire/purposely bad. Honestly, I don&#39;t think this was released in order to make Corey Feldman a pop star. I could be wrong though.
He&#39;s one of those child actors that aged like milk in the sun, worse than Macaulay Culkin in my opinion, this shit is awful
please review bloodbagel
did anyone watch the whole 50 minutes ?
This... this is a special kinda video
I forced myself to listen to all of this when it came out. It put me in physical pain. It was just... not okay.
Oh my god... this is Fontano unleashed. This record truly broke him. I love it. Funniest thing I have seen all month.
Im 8 minutes in and this is already the best video you&#39;ve ever made. Thank you!
OVER 50 MINUTES?!?!?!?!?!?!?! This shit is so bad I&#39;m not even going to listen anymore. Peace. I&#39;m out!
50 minutes!
lol he should listen to more bad music this was pretty funny.
Does anybody know any good record I should wash this shit out with???
&quot;ABOUT MY NIECE!!!!!!&quot;
what is the vinyl on the shelf in the back?
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=575">9:35</a>, the synth line is ripped off from Turn Up The Music by Chris Brown.<br><br>Don&#39;t ask how I know.
Someone please make a gif of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1069">17:49</a> , for the love of god
Best needledrop video of all time
Why are Lenny Kravitz, AC/DC, and Weird Al Yankovic listed as related artists on Corey Feldmans Spotify page
This is what I basically hear from my sophmore year religion teacher whenever she plays music from the radio
It&#39;s nice to see that my music is better than Corey Feldmans
Why does this sound like its from a bootleg Sonic game
Jesus I just noticed this was an hour long
This is your best video yet
This album sounds like BOTDF xD
This is honestly what all pop music sounds like to me...
Eh, still better than Desiigner&#39;s mixtape.
BUT ANTHONY <br>DANCE GAVIN DANCE&#39;S NEW ALBUM COMES OUT ON OCTOBER 7TH.
You should take a listen to Etienne Sin&#39;s Sinna Vol 1 and do a NOT GOOD or something haha
This is a hate crime against people with ears im sueing
review mick jenkins the healing component
This will go down as classic in 20 years..
Post Malone&#39;s last album was better than most of his mumble rapper brethren why the hate?
As I was thinking nothing could be any worse than Speedin&#39; Bullet to Heaven...
I wish Anthony reviewed this like a month before the release so &quot;how is this legal?&quot; - Anthony Fantano could be a blurb on the sticker on front. Also, I busted out laughing like 5 times in this video. This is gonna be a classic review.
This album sounds like some highschool students attempt at a music cd for his basic level music class project, and he got an F, then sold the beats of his track on itunes with no royalties. So Corey Feldman took it and thats how we got this unholy abomination.
An hour of Anthony going insane gives me life.
brb, buying this album for every single family member and friend
It triggers me!!
this is hilarious, also feels mean spirited though.   i&#39;m conflicted.
Are you doing a review for Usher - Hard 2 Love
Still gave it a better rating then Blank Face? WTF is up with that Anthony!?!?!?!
Local soundcloud rappers music is better than this
I love how Anthony sang better than Corey at the misery and pain part
I know an album worse than this garabge.<br><br>ScHoolBoy Q&#39;s - Blank Face LP.
I legitmately feel the US government funded this record for torture purposes
😂😂😂
When i kill myself itll be to one hell of a soundtrack
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1882">31:22</a> &quot;Generic 90s Grunge song/Everyone in flannel/Generic 90s Grunge song/Something from Seattle!&quot;
he should interview this guy on his podcast thing
I can&#39;t wait for you to review 22, A Million by Bon Iver.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=840">14:00</a>
You have a great laugh Anthony
I don&#39;t know whether to have my jimmies more rustled by his laryngitis MJ impression, or &quot;Grandpa Skrillex&quot;
For this album, I&#39;m feeling a strong fart to a light shit.
Fanthony a pleb. Ppl didn&#39;t understand Trout Mask Replica when it first came out either. Corey a visionary
Postmodern masterpiece, melon. You don&#39;t see the obvious post-internet cover? The satirically bad pop tracks? I think you&#39;re in over your head here, buddy. Stick to your lowbrow filth.
You know you&#39;re pushing the shit-vellope stealing musical ideas from Tommy Lee&#39;s &quot;Good Timesl&quot; on &#39;For My love&#39;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2420">40:20</a> reminds me of the really awful really really old RHCP music. God awful.
I got exhausted listening to the music sampled in the review. I can&#39;t imagine sitting down and actually listening to the whole thing...
Next review better be coming lickity splickity
Angelic 2 the Core &gt; To Pimp A Butterfly
Must cleanse my mind with Sufjan
Bruh Feldman&#39;s gonna see this and jump off a cliff
YOU GOTTA DO IT, LET CAL REVIEW IT!
LET CAL REVIEW IT!
LET CAL REVIEW IT!
This is the Filthy Frank of album. It&#39;s offensive to the eyes and ears, it&#39;s poor in quality, but it is also memeble.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=706">11:46</a> dude, Kurupt is on literally everything. If anyone pays him, he will put on a verse for absolutely anyone. There are so many no-budget albums out there by wannabe trash rappers with not even 1,000 plays on Spotify that feature Kurupt. It&#39;s ridiculous.
I love Snoop Dogg, but he NEEDS to stop featuring on ANYTHING for a paycheck.
Corey Feldman said in an interview that this album took 10 years to make...
The most enjoyable part of the album for me was the ads which played between tracks
It&#39;s like an alien trying to make human music, and getting really really close, but unfortunately he only listened to MJ, RHCP and Britney Spears.
Review? Man made a fucking movie
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1875">31:15</a> sounds eerily similar to Super Mario 64 file select music
you should check out cottonwood firing squad great band
This is the kind of stuff people make when they first discover FL Studio, upload it to SoundCloud and think of themselves as artists. But a double album full of this? REALLY?!?
Oh that Lennon cover tho
MICK JENKINS THE HEALING COMPONENT REVIEW IT ALREADY YOU FUCKING MELON HEAD BITCH
I mean, i&#39;m at the 41 minute mark and you lost it already, whereas i am still somewhat sane. Have you ever heard eastern european pop? Try listening to that song about champagne by Sahara featuring Shaggy.
Laughing in bed. Thanks man!
Kid cudi is just like &quot;thank you for taking the attention from my album, I&#39;m finally free&quot;
Why do I find Anthony cracking up so funny?
If we&#39;re talking about Batman music having nothing to do with Charlie&#39;s Angels, can we also talk about how &quot;your mission, should you choose to accept it&quot; is Mission: Impossible?
I will say I&#39;m watching this review at 1.5 speed and it&#39;s making the songs sound SO much better.
Sorry BrokeNCYDE released an album this year, this one cain&#39;t be worse then it. Right? RIGHT?!?<br><br>Few minutes into the review. This album sounds like a fucking winner for worst to me. Gonna have to listen to it when I can.
I wanna die but thats ok, i wanted to die for a while now
This album is as subversive as any punk record ever made
You know how horrible songs in South Park were? It&#39;s like someone made an album of that, but seriously.
It sounds like cookie monster doing a bad Michael Jackson while protools crashes and occasionally it accidentally records a James Chance or Trent Reznor session next door. I cut myself every time assthany holetano played a cut off of this album.
I swear to god, this sounds like he just sang some bullshit into a laptop and paid some shitty producer to make an album out of it. <br>This doesn&#39;t sound like real music. This sounds like music being played over eachother, cut and edited in a way that doesn&#39;t make ANY musical sense. <br>Maybe it&#39;s so avantgarde that western music has to die for us to &quot;get it&quot;.
Music that was on meth, crack, and glue 20 years ago and has suffered 20 years of unfulfilling sobriety and a porn addiction only to fall into a poorly handled senile state and way too much money.<br><br>Also Snoop Dogg has clones who exist to perform single features and net him money and relevance while he sits on a couch being dope and too high to keep tabs on what his clones are up to. Please people, just let me believe this.
Is that a woman&#39;s top you&#39;re wearing?
Man this is on Filthy Frank&#39;s level of shit. Congratulations Antny.
I feel tortured and amused at the same time :)
Corey&#39;s just never been the same since he left clipping.
Review The Black Parade reissue
Has Fantano finally lost his mind?
This album is what old people hear when they hear new music.
Dead lost goons never say stand by me
this is for given sb2h a zero
Honestly &quot;thinking about my niece&quot; was the funniest lyrics I&#39;ve ever heard. I cried of laughter for about 10 minutes
Siiiiiiike. Corey Feldman&#39;s fire.
This video should be renamed &quot;Watch Sadthony Iwanttokillmyselftano slowly lose his sanity&quot;
lol literally as I was watching this video, the neighbor&#39;s house caught on fire. Is this a sign that this album is cursed?
Michael Jackson covers on meth
is this The Room of music?
This may be the optimist in me but there is no way this album isn&#39;t an intentional joke. That fucking cover? That fucking title!? This has to be a joke. Please let it be a joke........
cocaine is a hell of a drug
Damn you made an entire 50 minute video on how shitty this album is. I love it. (Flagged for negative content though, sorry)
This channel has actually been a several year long art installation. Everything before this was to establish character until the destined album came out.<br><br>This final entry is that man&#39;s descent into madness.<br><br>In all seriousness, can we get a Fantano cover album of Corey Feldman?
Review Houston Rocket- Godthejalén Its On My Page My Playlist
He could get Kurupt, Snoop Dogg and Fred Durst on this but couldn&#39;t pay somebody to make a decent Album cover.
I&#39;d like to rate this album as a negative 64 out of 1
This is everything an album shouldn&#39;t be;<br>Messy beats. Cliché lyrics. Bad singing. No direction. No meaning to any of the songs. Nothing the audience can relate to.<br>For learning musicians - take note! This is your homework.
Please do talk about Die Antwoord&#39;s new album!
this might be the best video i have ever seen from the needle drop ever
thank you for this. and also fuck you for this.
COREY FELDMAN-CORE
This sounds like something you would hear on adult swim like on the Dr. Steve Brule show
Think about how snoop dogg was in this but was also in to pimp a butterfly
review &quot;Hard-Off&quot; By The Bloodhound Gang Fandango!<br>Do That Shit! i wanna see that [NOT GOOD] review.
this video is a 10/10
It&#39;s kinda funny how both this, the worst album Anthony has ever reviewed, and to pimp a butterfly, Anthony&#39;s most popular review where he&#39;s given a 10, feature snoop dogg
corey feldman = low hanging fruit
Can you review the new The Head and the Heart album?
This is borderline experimental
That guitar tone at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1590">26:30</a>
HE&#39;S A CONCERNED UNCLE!!!!! HAHAHAHAHA! best music review ever.....
I can&#39;t decide if it&#39;s even worth staying in this video for 5 minutes let alone 50 uhhhh
Based Feldman drops a masterpiece.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=441">7:21</a> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=462">7:42</a>
I don&#39;t often recommend 50 minute videos. Here&#39;s one I recommend.
This album was made by a 45 year old man.<br>What the literal fuck?
This album kinda reminds me of something Neil Cicierega would make as a joke.
10/10 album of the year 10 Grammy nominations
is this the new death grips
this is like one of those musical cancer albums from Bandcamp but with half the entertainment value
That Corey fella is fucking mental... :D
This is pure gold. I&#39;m glad i&#39;m alive to witness this
Just look at the comments in the &quot;GO 4 IT&quot; music video.<br>Are these people are real?<br><br>Just a little sneak peek of what you about to see:<br>this song ... the beginning always brings me to tears<br><br>Wow.
You can just tell that Feldman has surrounded himself with sycophants and that throughout the recording process everyone working on this album did nothing but praise Feldman and call him an innovator
hurry up and review danny brown new joint before i kiss you in your fucking cheek bone.
Please review a Voltaire album.
Guess we had to swap out BOTDF with some other shit
50 MINUTES????!?!?!??!!
ok can you review the new Allah las record plz!!!
gonna review the new Allegaeon album?
Dam. That shit RIDE.
Your sleeve makes me cringe
Actually reminds me of the kind of shit that was/still is coming out via /mu/&#39;s music collabs.
Savagery at its finest. I can&#39;t wait for his next Kid Cudi review
FUCK YOU FANTANO YOU DON&#39;T GET HIP HOP THIS IS FIRE
Is this actually worse than blood on the dance floor?
I bet if Kendrick Lamar made this same album Anthony would love it
....he compared this to The Weeknd...
&quot;Thats right this is happening&quot;
I hope nobody got paid for making that album cover.
FEEEEELLLDDDDDMMMAAAAAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Just out of interest.. Did fandango delete his hopsin ill mind 8 review??? I&#39;m sure he reviewed it
Please have cal review this record.
angrony madtano with the worst album of the year
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1492">24:52</a> sounds like mr bungle had an abortion
sounds like ween
&quot;grandpa skrillex&quot; 😁
did u actually listen through the whole thing? Don&#39;t be so negative about this, he is from the future
Forever?
inb4 Huff. Post writes a hit piece about Anthony being a &quot;cyber bully&quot;.
It sounds like those Halloween spooky compilation albums you find at the dollar tree by some retired tribute band
Review Atrocity Exhibition by Danny Brown, please.
Holy shit, that Fred Durst feature... There are no words...
Sad part is, I think the guy&#39;s serious. I mean he must be. If he recorded this as a joke, it&#39;s an incredibly awful joke, which would be equally bad as seriously thinking this is good. This music doesn&#39;t even qualify as a parody. It doesn&#39;t sound trendy in the least, he doesn&#39;t exaggerate current trends. I think he hasn&#39;t heard anything new in the last 20 years except Skrillex and Gangnam Style and decided to make a &quot;2016&quot; version of his favourite terrible music.
I&#39;m pretty sure I could record a better album for half the money. I get that it&#39;s harder than it sounds to record music, but the standards here are pretty low.
50 minutes??? shit
Fantasia snapped in this vid
ooOOooOoOOOooOooooOOOooOOOoooOOOoooo
Cal Chuchesta is better than this shit.
Love the gum spit take
i feel like this is a comedic masterpiece. you could honestly probably turn this into a broadway production.
What the hell is a meme review doing on your main channel, Fantano?
50 fuckin minutes of pissing on corey 9/10
10/10, review it again!
I saw the title of this video pop up on my screen and saw how long it is when I got the notification for it and I felt like Christmas has come early.
hey I liked Stand By Me
Has anyone else noticed that Anthony smiles like a South Park character?
I wonder what you think of Joji&#39;s &quot;I&#39;m a edgy hipster guy that is making a album that&#39;s not a joke and its artistic but it ends up sounding like shit/this is not a pink guy record&quot; album.
please review hellboy holy shit
I really appreciate that he sat here for 50 minutes for us that&#39;s real dedication
REVIEW ATROCITY EXHIBITION
DANNY FUCKING BROWN JUST DROPPED ATROCITY EXHIBITION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is it. This is the album that surpassed Speedin&#39; Bullet. This is the album that drove Fantano insane. There is nothing to life after this.
of course Snoop Dogg appeared, he needed the money for weed
Is this the new &#39;Philosophy of the World&#39;?
death grips has angry little voice<br>eminem has batman sound effects<br>run the jewels did cat sounds<br>kendrick lamar did religious undertones<br><br>corey does all this AND MORE SOOO
THAT SYNTH LEAD WAS RIPPED OFF TURN UP THE MUSIC BY CHRIS BROWN
atrocity exhibition
He tried to sing like Michael Jackson but ended up like David Draiman.
So Corey Feldman is now the Tommy Wiseau of music?
Atrocity Exhibition tho
I didn&#39;t think there could be a worse cover of Working Class Hero than the Tin Machine one, but holy shit.
Are you going to release a video with your thoughts on the new Metallica song?
I kinda feel bad for Feldman tbh
Turn the 2 upside down its an S now
I beat my meat to this
i love anthonys old hag cackle
cory in the house meets morton feldman
This is secretly a new Lonely Island record.
Troo Jazz for your soul.
DANNY BROWN WHEN
lmao
I just hear pop
BOY WTF IS YOU TALKING ABOUT??? 😲😲😤😤THIS WAS FIRE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😳😳😳😳👏👏👍👍👀👀💯💯💯💯
disliked. this is clearly the best album if the century
Every album reviewed after this deserves a 6+, anything is above average compared to this.
scaruffi&#39;s first 10?
Anthony you should put an annotation on your videos giving the name of the albums behind you on your shelf!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1412">23:32</a> Fantano: &quot;Why&quot;, Corey: &quot;Yeah&quot;
I think we now have material for every AntFant GIF necessary for the rest of time.
Please actually do a NOT GOOD on the new Die Antwoord album because despite liking them I agree it&#39;s a bad album and I&#39;d like to see what you&#39;d have to say 😂
50 minutes of watching a man slowly slip into insanity.
Wait untill Fandango  hear that Corey is teaming up with Big sean
What about Snoop&#39;s track with savant that was pretty awful.
I wish he&#39;d put this album in his loved list just to troll.
It is truly impressive how when you try to parody the lyrics before the song starts, they turn out better than Corey&#39;s actual lyrics. It&#39;s actually impossible to write a worse album, even if you try your hardest.
we dont deserve this melon head
Aw man!! I feel bad for Corey.
Still better than Sonic Spinball&#39;s Options theme.
That moment at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1090">18:10</a> Hahahaha
most entertaining video you&#39;ve made in a while
You sound like a demonic Mickey Mouse when you laugh
&quot;Angelic 2 Tha Core&quot; seriously sounds like Len (the shitty 90&#39;s group that sang &quot;Steal My Sunshine&quot;) combined with KMFDM and Uncle Kracker.
O.M.D in the background is cool.
you know you gotta stay away from a project when not even YM throws in Lil Wayne to it and throws in Fred fucking Durst instead
im half way through, should i finish this?
Everytime Anthony laughs, a bit of his sanity just slips away.
i think the album cover is an analogy of what it feels like to finish a run through of the whole album. although i doubt i could even make it alone. i had to pause at the 40 minute mark because i felt like i was ready to vomit. and im only getting the condensed version of this record. thanks for doing the lords work
I was waiting for this review. Thank my man, i was right there with you. made me lose my mind. I&#39;m dyeing over here
Your feminine side sort of came out on this review. Felt like I was watching iJustine.
You might have suffered through this album Anthony but thank you for this video. I&#39;ve been laughing for 30 minutes now.
this is what happens when tim and eric shit leaks into the real world
So... decent 7?
NOT FUCKNG GOOD
IHY for exposing me to this album Anthony.
profoundly unsettling
Anyone else hear the first couple snippets and think &quot;wow this is so awkward I actually might like it&quot;
you can tell he&#39;s pissed when he just has a muscle shirt on
Snoop Dogg on the best and worst album of the decade. Get you a man who can do both
If you want something to do go on Apple Music or Spotify or whatever streaming seen you use and go on snoop doggs album list
I bet Anthony would rather listen to me improvise on a guitar for 90 minutes, and I can&#39;t even properly transition into a D minor chord.
this album fucking RULES, home slice! I diggity dig it, G money, it&#39;s Xtreme to the Pepsi Max, Tony Hawk! p.s. Corethony Feldtano did 9/11.
Your laugh is so weird
Corey Feldman = Tommy Wiseau
Oh wow a 50 minute video, should be good
yeh but if death grips released it you&#39;d give it a 10/10.
Anthony Fantano with the Big Quint video style<br>This is amazing
is this your own version of kickstarter tv
Tim Curry &quot;Read My Lips&quot; possibly as shameful, but at least Time could sing
I now have a headache and am sick to my stomach
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1631">27:11</a><br>Nine Inch Nails - Pretty Hate Machine (1989)
I&#39;ve seen ISIS interrogation videos where the guy looks happier than Anthony does here
HOLY FUCK THIS ALBUM IS TRASH
THC REVIEW!!
been waiting for this this one
Finally found a masterpiece anthony
don&#39;t get me wrong Corey Feldman made some pretty decent movies 25 to 30 years ago now he gets a record deal? I guess don Johnson and Bruce Willis music don&#39;t sound to bad compared to Coreys.
I&#39;m only 20 minutes in and it already feels like it&#39;s been an hour...
Light to a Strong 0
anthony is so cute
I love watching him roast people
I had to google who corey feldman is, after doing some research, i still do not know who the fuck he is.
inb4 angry goonies-washup copyright strike.
You, Egoraptor and Danny Sexbang have the 3 most infectious laughs on YouTube.
That was so much fun! Make more of these, please.
This was hilarious. Probably because I didn&#39;t actually have to sit through the entire album lol...
wow Anthony. that was the worst track
The healing component pls, interested to hear your thoughts
the troll 2 of albums
What a clusterfuck of an album
I wonder if the music industry is that desperate for talented artists these days? are just trying to throw anything agents the wall and whatever sticks gets a record deal. I thought Paris Hilton was bad enough but Corey Feldman was irrelevant back in the 80s. someone was on some good cocaine to greenlight this!!
Sounds very dated. And why does the production have no low end?
this is BY FAR my favorite album review of all-time
the synth parts sound like bad royalty free music. i can imagine it being used as the background music for a low budget commercial trying to sell some weird plastic shit for the kitchen, for the low low price of just 39.99
can you review green day revolution radio please? The album has leaked.
WTF is this shit album?! Lol
Is it just me or did they rip a nisennenmondai lead in the 3rd track
Doitthany LickitySplickitytano
ur laughter is truly heartwarming tho
But is it worse than SB2H?
Come on, the guy&#39;s had a rough life. Just let him release his horrible album and have it be ignored. Why bring so much attention to it?
Whatever, let the guy make the music he wishes to, it doesn&#39;t have to fit your picture of what music should be
4 mins in i realize this video is 50 mins long.
Anthony just put Corey in the house.
the kid from the goonies?
do the new danny brown album!
@theneedledrop Mick Jenkins: The Healing Component, please review that album. Thank You!
I WAS WALKIN.... <br>WALKIN DOWN THE STEEETS.... MY HEART WAS HURTIIIIN.... THINKIN ABOUT MY <br>NIIEEEEEECE...
cory in the house. 10/10 anime too much water in the white house
after watching the video for 40 minutes it became weird to think how much of anthonys skin is showing vs whats covered
I think that&#39;s the first time I see Fandango without words to describe how bad a record is. OMG.
Ninety fucking minutes?!
this shit sounds like it was written for a DnB parody group in GTA.
Getting diddled by your idol can really fuck you up...
DMCA inc
worst album ever but best review ever
Please review BIG BUSINESS - COMMAND YOUR WEATHER
I can&#39;t believe I&#39;ve watched the whole thing
Oh Anthony... Its like you dont even get post-post-postmodernism.
At least it&#39;s entertaining. &quot;So bad that it&#39;s good&quot; doesn&#39;t happen very often in music; I&#39;ve only come across this and The Shaggs so far.
The album artwork actually make me feel nauseous. I don&#39;t know if it it&#39;s the bad photoshop or the colour scheme
The instrumental for &quot;Wanna Break Free&quot; was kind of dope.
Contender for Album of the Year? Even Death Grips didn&#39;t get a 50 minute review and that was just an hour of noise and a homeless man yelling about dairy products.
Anthony if you get a copyright strike for this.... oh man that would be ridiculous
Man Anthony puts his body on the line for us.
Best vid fantano, hilarious, more please!
had to grab a whole meal for this fuckery

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1035">17:15</a> TIL Chairthony Stooltano is sitting and not standing in these videos
lmao
this album is like &quot;the room&quot; of music
I&#39;m reporting you so hard for including audio clips from the songs. Just like I reported all of your 2009 videos so much they got removed.
the album is obviously bad on purpose u herb smh
so light to a strong 10?
HOly fuck, I can&#39;t wait to watch this lamo
Wondering why you spent 50 minutes ripping this album a new one when you could be reviewing Mick Jenkins&#39; new album.
Why even give this album attention?
Views from the 6 is worse.
If I ever go into a coma play this album, so I can woke up and turn this shit off.
Atrocity Exhibition just released
REVIEW A FUCKING SOAD ALBUM ALREADY!
his vocals sound like the guy from disturbed if he was mentally disabled and had no talent
Why do all the tracks sound like they&#39;re trying to play 5 different songs at once? Jesus Christ!
gaythony boytano
Kurupt and snoop sold their souls for this project
It looks like Celldweller has found his successor.

woo wee im gonna go thru this review idc if it takes me 3 days
Sounds like Death Grips to me
This album makes me want to praise Kid Cudi for his intellectual genius.
THIS IS A CAREER DEFINING MOMENT FANDINGO
Listen to and review SIRENS SIRENS SIRENS
&gt;50 minutes<br><br>Oh my. Should we send someone to check on him and Cal?
WHERE IS THE WATER FANWATO? YOU NEED TO DRINK IT NOW.
was the gum-spitting scripted?
50 min!!!!!!!!!!!
Corey Feldman + Farrah Abraham collab when
Angelic 2 The Core is The Room of albums
The new Trout Mask Replica. Just give it 50 years and you&#39;ll see.
going after the lowest hanging fruit is lazy. Could you pick an easier target to rip apart? 51 minutes of this, could have been summarized in about 2 minutes. I turned it off after 3 minutes, had enough. Let&#39;s get back to serious music reviews and stop the bandwagon jumping.
Better than TPAB!!! ur just a h8er
one of the greatest videos you&#39;ve ever released. hats off to you needlecock
Snippets of this video will be shown alongside the news of Corey Feldman&#39;s suicide.
Snoop Dogg is on this album and is also on TPAB🤔 He must&#39;ve gotten a big-ass check
I forced myself to get through <i>Miley Cyrus &amp; Her Dead Petz</i>.<br>I suffered through all 91 minutes of <i>Speedin&#39; Bullet 2 Heaven</i>.<br>Usually after I see a review like this, my curiosity gets the best of me, since I&#39;m kind of a glutton for punishment.<br>Not this time.<br>Just the snippets were enough to make me feel despondent. Like, actually depressed. Depressed and wondering... why?<br>Why did this have to be made? <i>Why?</i> This album is probably the worst thing I&#39;ve heard in my 20 years of existence.<br>I really think Corey Feldman has totally snapped. That would be the only real explanation for music this terrible.<br>...I&#39;m going to go cry in the shower now. Then I&#39;m going to listen to <i>Lemonade</i> to help cheer me up.
On mercy that is B Howard singing the second part and that is supposed to be Michael Jackson&#39;s son
Whenever the DEA shut the bath salt market down, Feldman stocked up.
Let us form a prayer circle for Anferny&#39;s soul. Your sacrifice will not be forgotten
You just don&#39;t get it
What am amazing video to upload on my birthday lmao
i love you for reacting to this
Sounds like Death Grips
Arguably the best video ever posted on YouTube
90s turn next, need a Danny Tamberelli album.

Why are you doing this to yourself?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1036">17:16</a>, I fucking lost it.
I listen to this album while having sex
You are a brave soul.<br>Thank you for doing this.<br>I knew it was going to be bad, but not THIS BAD.
this album is basically a South Park episode about Corey Feldman playing out in real life
Can&#39;t wait to flag this when I&#39;m a YouTube hero
you gave this a 10/10 and MBDTF a 6? disgusting.
&quot;angelic 2 the core&quot; oh man such an edgy album name
surely this is some genius act of comedy
1) where is ty dolla sign you fucking melonhead<br>2) kid cudi is gonna steal that title this year
Why did I watch 24 minutes of this
Thinkin bout my niece
HOW YOU GOn GIVE LIL YACHTY A HIGHER SCORE THAN THIS??.???
I didn&#39;t know Cringe was a music genre.

This is probably the best video he has ever made.
I asked Corey Feldman to do a feature on my next Lesbian Concentrate album.<br><br>Was that a good idea?

Don&#39;t ever wear tank tops again you fucking melon
You failed to note the ridiculously heavy amount of Lenny Kravitz influence on this album.
This video so long you can see Antnee&#39;s hair grow longer
Is it  Lulu Metallica levels of bad?
not seen the review yet just wanna comment on Architecture &amp; Morality on the shelf &lt;3 Antony UWU
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2112">35:12</a> Great Scott Walker impression
Some of this album sounds like Bring the Noise by Public Enemy and Anthrax and thats just inexcusable.
If you go to the video it just has these fake comments saying how wonderful it is. HOW STRANGE.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1798">29:58</a> 😩
Where are Corey Feldman&#39;s parents?
Angelthony Cortano
Speeding Bullet To Heaven was an average album. This is so bad it brought my depression back.
i heard some daft punk rip off in there
I&#39;m sorry Anthony that you&#39;ll have to revisit this monstrosity this coming December for List Week. It&#39;s probably gonna be worst of the year as well
review bad by Michael Jackson you melon headed dog
I got 10 min in then I realized its a fucking documentary
I&#39;m literally dying laughing through this whole video
I&#39;m actually watching all of this.

Review Lloyd Banks - All or Nothing: Live It Up
After listening to this on spotify I really hope this doesn&#39;t influence future suggestions.
Haha... I haven&#39;t laughed so hard in a while! Hilarious review.
my piss is strong
Anthony I like watching you listen to music. You should rip off Big Quint and do this for the next Death Grips release.
Does anybody else need chemo after this?
You&#39;re just not a fan of experimental hip hop
Pretty sure the lead you were thinking was ripped off at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=562">9:22</a> in the video is actually from Demi Lovato&#39;s &quot;Neon Lights&quot;
great review
I think I died a couple of times listening to all of these songs
I like this more improvisational and loose Anthony, its very entertaining. More long form stuff would be A+!
Don&#39;t jump to conclusions on the &quot;Worst Album of 2016&quot; because Kid Cudi does have a new album coming out on Friday...

Obviously the first half of this album is Feldman&#39;s tortured reality, his literal hell. He does a great job at drawing in the listener into an abyss of despair. The second half, where a more spiritual mood takes over, shows his escape from such a hell, hence tying into the theme of redeeming himself and saving himself from the trappings of materialistic hedonism. Clearly you do not understand this man&#39;s magnum opus Fantano. Your lack of mercy clearly shows your bias against the genius of Feldman. Either you worship and work with the devil or you ears can not hear the grace of Feldman. This album is clearly 10/10. You need to listen to the album again to absorb its true and powerful meaning. This is you worst review and it saddens me that you did not love such a beautiful album. <br>(__)(__):::::::::::::::::::::::D    ~~~~~~~~~~~~
Cory Feldman sounds hes trying to take a shit at the beginning of that final track. Straight Trash.
Maybe he just dropped acid and thought he was God, it&#39;s cliche, but it happens...

+theneedledrop ANTHONY PLEASE DO &quot;WESTSIDEGUNN - FLYGOD&quot; &amp; &quot;CONWAY - REJECT 2&quot;, I HONESTLY THINK YOU&#39;LL APPRECIATE THE SOUND...PLEASE DON&#39;T BE LATE ON THESE GUYS!
This is your masterpiece
This beat Miley Cyrus?
&quot;If I was into bdsm this would be the soundtrack&quot; - fantano
ought on the shelf &lt;3
Grandpa skrillex minus the talent. This is fucking hysterical.
Anthony, this is my favorite video of yours
The track at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1920">32:00</a> actually sounds like Anthony doing like a Creed impression
snoop dogg ran out of weed money again
He was invited onto the Today show twice for a fucking reason
lmmfao
This is the point where Kid Cudi announces his collaboration with Corey Feldman Speedin&#39; Angels 4 Hell
damn near an hour  F U C K
Thanks for the room clearing music
If you made a 90 minute playlist of the worst shitposts on SoundCloud it would be better than this. Unless this becomes a soundclown meme and everybody starts shitposting Angelic 2 The Core... OH GOD
potentially Cal&#39;s album of the year?
This shit was so bad that he had to make a near hour long video to review it.
Speeding Bullet 2 the Core
Holy shit, didn&#39;t even finish the video and realized its 50 mins long.
Is this a meme review?
anthony here to point out the obvious
Yo review the full Nutshack theme when it drops
Not even thinking of skipping any ads. Even this 80 minute video ad about censorship from Vice.
This made me an existential crisis. It legit made me question reality.
This is like Charlie releasing a Night Man album
WANT :D
the hird song you played sounds like the nutshack
A Lisa Loeb reference 😂😂😂😂
worst album ever
I really need Cal&#39;s take on this album.
Okay how long has this album been in production because that song at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1488">24:48</a> almost directly samples the Stranger Things theme song. Which came out in July.
Corey Feldman-next years coachella headliner
Kid Cudi hasn&#39;t dropped his new album yet FYI so don&#39;t go saying &#39;worst album of the decade&#39; quite so fast
&quot;Watch this melonhead slowly sink into depression over the course of a 50 minute music review. The results will SHOCK you.&quot;
Some of those songs sound like he was recording them in a gutter while high on coke attempting a Celldweller impersonation.
masterpiece
basically kidz  bop
&quot;It is accidentally post punk&quot;
that synth is definately avicii!
first track isnt that bad but damn this is awful
Longthony Videotano here
I really wish you had reviewed Atmosphere&#39;s Fishing Blues instead. You could have commented on the aquatic accompaniment to the album. But for shame, you had to spend fifty minutes reviewing the worst music no one will buy in the decade. Antony, don&#39;t you know if a shitty album drops in the store and nobody purchases it, it doesn&#39;t make a sound?
WOW... NOW WE KNOW THERE&#39;S A TABLE IN FRONT OF YOU!!!!!!
Hey fuck face review the new Public Access T.V. record. (Love you)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1645">27:25</a> sounds like if New Order and Marilyn Manson had a child they didn&#39;t want so Limp Bizkit found it crying on the side of the road and tried to raise it. Probably one of the worst things I&#39;ve ever heard.
is this death grips ?
Hey Anthony, can you review Low Teens by Every Time I Die?<br>I think you&#39;d dig it.
clickbait crap!!! There&#39;s a new Nicolas Jaar album to review. A new Devendra Banhart album to review. A new Bon Iver album. No, no. I will waste time listening to a Corey Feldman album, then waste more time reviewing it. WHY?!!! Nobody was expecting to listen to it, let alone buy it. Nobody would have even heard it existed if not for that TV performance. Clickbait crap!!!
this is quality melonhead. fucking quality 😂😂😂😂😂
this isn&#39;t as bad as OK computer
oct 7 is gonna change ur mind
But is this worse than speedin bullet to heaven?
its really bad but frank ocean legitimately sounds worse
I feel like this review is a little long, especially when I have to watch an advertisement with Charlie Murphy within the review.
Wow this album broke Fantano&#39;s brain just like in my hentai doujins
This record molested me harder than &#39;Ron&#39;...
My mom walked to my room at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=470">7:50</a> as i was watching this and told me i was adopted and she don&#39;t want me anymore.
You just don get it now Anthony, in five years you will.
this is surely a joke album
Wait so now we can&#39;t make fun of speedin bullet as much because this is worse?
So a strong 4 to a light 5?
They should add Anthony&#39;s laugh track to the album haha.
his today show performance was so fucked up bad he HAS TO BE TROLLING
I don&#39;t dislike this content but it feels like second channel content
50 minutes are u fucking serious lmao yes!
CORETHANY FELDTANO
Send Fantano vinyl copies of this.
Delusional 2 The Core
I just think you don&#39;t have the necessary funk
Where can I download this
jfc thats the glasses kid from stand by me what happened to him ,
&gt; talks 50 minutes about shitty album that nobody cares about<br>&gt; still hasn&#39;t reviewed elseq 1-5<br>I love you Anthony but goddammit
I Started Dying On The Worst Song On The Album.
Has it verged on so-bad it is good... ?
This album makes the Xenoblade Chronicles X soundtrack look like gold
Savage. Corey needs to write a diss track against you
still better than BITTSM
no rating? I watched the whole thing but still not sure how you feel about this album, ya know, out of 10.
Don&#39;t be so mean COREY NEEDS OUR HELP
MST3K/Rifftrax style album roasts when?
he straight up ripped off derezzed by daft punk!!
So sad, I mean poor Corey Feldman was so good as a boy in the Goonies and Stand By Me. What happened?? It&#39;s so sad.
FUCK I WAS NOT READY WHEN YOU PLAYED THAT SHIT
Digibro is rubbing off on you.
This video is fun but WHERE&#39;S THE MICK JERKINS REVIEW DUDE
hey guys corey feldman here just wanted to say i just realized ur totally right gonna fix dis for da nex 1
Oh shit a1/4 of the way through this i realised this was a 50 minute review
How come no number review?
Hope this doesn&#39;t get flagged.
ANTHONY HE FUCKING CROWD FUNDED THE ALBUM JESUS FUCKING CHRIST <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/elev8or-2-ascension-the-feldfanfam-fundraiser#/">https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/elev8or-2-ascension-the-feldfanfam-fundraiser#/</a>
Finally the experimental albums I did when I was 15 and put on bandcamp were surpassed by a new kind of suck
ey fam review la femme&#39;s latest lp
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=258">4:18</a> I thought you were going to say &quot;delusional to the...core&quot;
This is so hilariously bad 😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2030">33:50</a> Doothony Booptano Here The World&#39;s Lickidy Spickiest Music Nerd
I hate myself for watching the whole thing
Corey Feldman would have to pay me his entire net worth for me to make an appearance. But knowing how irrelevant he is today, has net worth is probably five soft shell tacos from taco bell.
If he tries to DMCA you, just request that he only goes to court using the revenue from this album.
I lost my fucking shit at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2232">37:12</a>
easily in contention for top 5 worst albums ever.
Thank you so fucking much for this hahahahaha
goonies never die......sadly.
HONESTLY Wanna Break Free, and Working Class Hero were the most tangible, like they actually sounded like they were trying to be music.
I guess <b>Cory</b> should&#39;ve stayed <b>in the house</b> ...... Bad dum tisssssss
Summary for those don&#39;t have 50 minutes to watch this masterpiece of a video:<br><br>Imagine a religious old man with a Michael Jackson obsession reminiscing about the 80&#39;s creating an album while also trying to put a couple pop 90&#39;s style songs in there to make it sell. Of course, you couldn&#39;t sell this thing for free.  <br><br>This album is literally cancer.
At like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1720">28:40</a> it&#39;s sounds like he sampled you with &quot;ya got me&quot; 😂😂
Just imagine Corey Feldman in his ninja turtles costume from the 80s and this album gets so much better
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=475">7:55</a> now i see why they call you Best Teeth
And now we&#39;re gonna get a thousand images of Anthony superimposed on the album cover
This is up there as my favourite video review along with DEHH&#39;s review of Lil B&#39;s &#39;I&#39;m Gay (I&#39;m Happy)&#39;...
praise fanthony antano
Best Needle Drop video. Period. Also Corey&#39;s stuff is both abysmal and fucking hysterical.
I can&#39;t believe I sat through all 50 minutes of this. But I am also grateful, because the first 20 minutes made me want to listen to the album myself just to witness that firsthand...but then I realized it would undo a decade of therapy and reignite my chronic migraines. Some heroes wear wifebeaters.
&#39;Ascension Millennium&#39; is one of the worst non-songs ever (not) &quot;written&quot;.
His vocals sound like he&#39;s clearly been listening to the rapper RAEDD.
The fucking crop on the album art says all you need to know about the album. I kept half expecting him to tell the words &quot;Get me more photos of Spider-Man!!!&quot;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1874">31:14</a> Sounds like an awful ripoff of &quot;Pinch Me&quot; by Barenaked Ladies.
Corey had some very bad experiences as a child, not going to go into it, but look it up, that explains things somewhat.
This sounds like one of those side albums they&#39;d sell for 90s/2000s kids&#39; cartoon shows.
&quot;Thinking about my niece&quot;<br>I lol&#39;d so hard
the real sad part is that he probably spent years developing this concept and album
This is the funniest video he&#39;s ever done.
didn&#39;t know J-Roc was still making music. Sunnyvale Trailer Park still got it!
pick up your gum you filthy melon
idk I dont see whats so bad about it...
I give the talking melon a 6/10
But you should still totally do that Lil Peep not good review
I liked the cd.  Corey is kinda nostalgic
Eh
surprised it didn&#39;t still get an 8\10
Corey Feldman sings in the voice that I sing in when I&#39;m beyond intoxicated or very emotionally distraught.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=833">13:53</a> sounds like Sun Ra tbh only good bit on the album
There were so many parts where I was unsure if the sounds coming from Anthony weren&#39;t actually parts of the song
he....he wasnt even aiming to qualify as a &quot;bad&quot;album....its like they were in the studio after being surgically drained of creativity n inspiration<br>hit rock bottom with the record button on and said this isnt low enough so they bought in a jackhammer to go further down.....he needs some honest people around him desperately i swear...
You know an album is bad when ads blend in with the songs.
You aren&#39;t slick fandango ...<br>This review is 50 minutes  to try and make us forget that j Cole went DOUBLE platinum without a single feature.
@theneedledrop<br>Anthony, Bro, you need to smoke more weed. Like a lot more weed.
The song @ the 27 minute mark is like if Limp Bizkit and Marylin Manson had an orgy and Cory Feldman was the result of their regretful union.
LEAVE COREY ALONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
so is Corey Feldman gonna cry about this review?
this album is so horrendous it will inspire you to keep living
The sensation was scissors and too much to scream, so instead, I just started to laugh.
51 minutes deep in shit music.
this video might be 50 minutes but the pain this album gave me is never ending
did it HAVE to be 50 minutes?
This is &#39;The Room&#39; of albums
The synth at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=558">9:18</a> is I&#39;m Not Alone by Calvin Harris
just realized fantnee looks like Napoleon dynamite after his 5yr stint in prison for stealing speeding bullet from a record store and burning it for memes.
<b>LOOK AT THIS PHOTOGRAPH</b>
Snoop sold out first lil dickie now Corey ffs smh craaaap
Angelic 2: The Core<br><br>Sounds like the kind of title you&#39;d see on an anime VHS from the 1980&#39;s.
Strong 10! Better than To Pimp A Butterfly
I&#39;m glad Harambe didn&#39;t have to hear this album <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23dicksout">#dicksout</a>
what a clusterfuck of an album
TRIGGERED
Wait, i thought this was a  Meme Review
I could hardly sit through your abridged version of this album, I can&#39;t imagine how painful it is start to finish.
This album is to music what The Room is to cinema
I thought it sounded so low fi because I&#39;m hearing it through a video, but then I went and listened to the album for myself only to discover it actually sounds that low fi
This album sounds so gross,<br>I&#39;m gagging off of how it sounds and the vocals. Why is kurupt and snoop on this shit😭???? Why????
This is your best review yet man!! Laughed so hard!!!
Corey&#39;s rock is in the house tooniigghttttt.
Very accurate Lil Peep description.. unfortunately. I was so stoked for Hellboy but I prefered the emo r&amp;b shit that damn near died in a month. Now you got all these kids trying to sound like Ghostemane.. I didnt think fucking Peep would descend into that hole. I just hope Tracy and goth can find a different path.
He just ripped Corey a new arsehole lol 👍🙈
wow I can&#39;t believe he gave it a 10
What is Anthony&#39;s arm tattoo even of 😂😂
I kinda feel bad for Corey. He has no one in her circle that will give him honest feedback because of his former star power.
This gon be a masterpiece in 30 years. Just you watch, pitchfork gonna give this best new reissue in 2046
Licketty spliketty lol idiots
This is what Hollywood does to people.
&quot;Grandpa Skrillex&quot; :&#39;D
Generic Songs - The Album!
Corey Feldman is the Neil Breen of music.
GUYS. This album is about impersonating what young Teddy Dunchamp has grown up into. It&#39;s genious, I can&#39;t believe noone&#39;s getting it.
Sexy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=883">14:43</a>
That music is baba
This is actually so bad that it&#39;s good.
I&#39;m sorry you had to listen to this more than once
Melon, in my years of watching you I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen you this giggly and happy.<br>Are you sure you don&#39;t really love this album?
That first song makes me want to hear your review of &quot;Walls Fall Out&quot;
antwony fanta-tano... how can you tear aprt mi faverite albom of the yeer? I demand a 5 page apology letter please, thank you, and cool
Great video, definitely made my day. Some funny shit
This is one of the best reviews I have seen.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=943">15:43</a>-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=957">15:57</a> pretty much sums up the entire video. The faces you make are the epitome of the moments of realization of just how empty and dead inside you are after listening to this &quot;music&quot;. Frustration, rage, confusion, disgust, and so much more are jammed packed in those seconds. My personal favorite of them all at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1500">25:00</a>-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1570">26:10</a>. In fact, anytime before and during a listen to these songs are fucking golden and everyone can relate very, very much. I would like to apologize because you didn&#39;t need to do this. I mean, we all can just LOOK at it and see how bad it is. The phrase &quot;don&#39;t judge a book by it&#39;s cover&quot; doesn&#39;t apply here. Everyone gets that instinctual feeling &quot;this is horrible&quot; when looking at this, not only low budget, but just bad cover. I just love the white lines around the preview of it. Very fitting and a nice touch. However I wouldn&#39;t doubt it if that&#39;s how the actual cover was at some point.<br>&quot;Y&#39;all know this is just my opinion, right?&quot; You state in description but in this case, it&#39;s a fact. I wonder where the few people, who  would act like a child that doesn&#39;t want to listen to their parents by putting their hands over their ears who would disagree with you, are at. How can anyone defend this? Even the people involved wouldn&#39;t try to, even if a gun was held to their head.
I think I&#39;m going crazy.
This album is so awful i&#39;d actually prefer hopsin to it.
that synth lead is right from &#39;Yeah 3x&#39; by Chris Brown. never thought i&#39;d feel bad for chris brown.
We want to see your wife!
maybe this album is his make a wish?
Give this a 0, pussy
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=834">13:54</a> I didn&#39;t know he got Ross Geller on keyboards. Props!
THINKING ABOUT MY NIECE
This feels like the music equivalent to &quot;The Room&quot;
That synth at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=560">9:20</a> sounds like every Calvin Harris tune ever made
Cal chuchesta would have made a great  addition to this album
put a shirt on
ah man, my boy Anthony didn&#39;t like Die Antwoord?
I&#39;m glad to suffer with ya, buddy
I can see him being the lead singer of a terrible Faith No More cover band.
Soooo...10/10?
Why is Corey doing a bad Prince impression through the whole album?
Apparently any album that replaces the word &quot;to&quot; with &quot;2&quot; is the worst album of the year
ASCENSION
New Calassic is actually better than this
<b>picks up phone and dials number</b> Hello, Guantanamo Bay Music Torture Chamber? You know that sound you were looking for? I think I found it. <b>Holds out phone</b>
pick up that gum you filthy atrocity
On the bright side. its my birthday today !!!
what
i have a feeling if this was on cassette from the 80s, it would be equal to How Are You? by Daniel Johnson
Judging by the awful album cover Corey Feldman does indeed need psychiatric help.
This album sums up this year perfectly: pure chaos.
Wasting your time expecting shit and getting shit on this album. This is the meme album review of all meme album reviews/
id much rather listen to pen pineapple apple pen for 90 minutes straight.
Kid Cudi be like join the club bro
architecture and morality for classics week pls anthony you melon fuck
Anthony&#39;s laugh funnier than the actual music..
+theneedledrop Lovin Lies synth line rips off Demi Lovato Neon Lights.
i actually watched this whole video, reminds me of that time when i watched a guy read the whole bee movie script, really puts your life in perspective or some deep shit
my boi harambe wouldn&#39;t have this.
When the &#39;The Working Class Hero&#39; cover started I screamed &quot;HE&#39;S GOING FOR IT! HE&#39;S ACTUALLY GOING FOR IT!&quot;
What if Corey Feldman is the greatest troll of our generation and this is all a deeply ironic take on the state of mainstream music? Think about it.
this reminds me of Lego Batman&#39;s music from The Lego Movie.. just totally mental
corey feldman is a troll
Has there ever been a good album with skits? The only one I can think of is College Dropout, and those weren&#39;t THAT invasive.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=458">7:38</a> lololol
you&#39;re more obsessed with this album than anything else. it&#39;s making you dance and it&#39;s your longest review yet
Any news is good news and Corey Feldman just landed Anthony&#39;s longest review? Terrible album is...a success?
Today on a VERY special episode of The Needle Drop...
I think he&#39;s finally lost it.
somebody gif the go for it dance moves
Dang... this is nearly an hour long xD
hey Melon, please try Heidi Montag - Superficial the album, you might like it as much as this one &lt;334563
This video is about a man losing his mind over the course of 50 minutes
This review made me physically sick, but this time I couldn&#39;t blame it on Fantano&#39;s hairline
ascension millenium is p good
Corey Feldman may have had a stroke the entire time while making this album.
review your tattoos
Is this a joke? Like I&#39;m actually not sure whether he&#39;s just trolling all of us.
it&#39;s easy to take shots at this loser. This is what you call an &quot;easy target&quot;. Be better, Fantano. No shit this album sucks
sounds no different to death grips..
This aint a review, this is a movie
Love this long-form content, Anthony. Great stuff, man.
i&#39;m kind of wondering how the fuck they produced some of the songs on this album, it seems like there was so much effort involved to make it sound as shitty complicated as possible ahahahaha
this video destroyed me
The worse album this year for me was the newest album by Kid Cudi
this should have been a meme review, disappointed in you Anthony. 3/10.
almost an hour..i gotta watch
I can&#39;t say no to the beat!!! 👌👌👌👌
Dude was trying so hard not to say &quot;Dillusional 2 the Core&quot;
This made my week dude! Couldn&#39;t stop laughing!  Thank you man, I needed this.
This might be the most fucking punk album I&#39;ve ever heard.
As hilarious as this video is i can&#39;t help but feel bad for Corey, he needs help.
the part around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=551">9:11</a> sounds like a cross between Daft Punk&#39;s Derezzed, and another thing which I can&#39;t quite recall.
50 minutes of the best teeth
We are watching a stream of conscience during the downward spiral of a man. It&#39;s beautiful
I bought this album and loved it.
You can&#39;t say it&#39;s the worse album of the year when Cudi hasn&#39;t even dropped his album yet
We could probably sell this to the CIA. Lock someone in a bright pink room with padded walls and play this entire album on a surround sound system. This album could have prevented 911.
All it needs is a Cal Chuchesta feature.
pls still do a &#39;not good&#39; on lil peep
he straight talked for an hour
Somebody please gif <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1072">17:52</a>
Most of the songs sounds like commercial jingles from 97&#39; where a bunch of middle aged men in the PR department of Mc Donalds, completely out of touch with popular culture, sit around a table and go. &quot;So what does the kids listen to these days and how can we sell it to them?&quot;
50 minutes....
The cover art is fantastic, though
i appreciate the green screen work in this one. hahaha
Feldman has a net worth of TWO MILLION DOLLARS
Something made me watch this entire review. I now feel like pulling a Sylvia Plath. Goodbyethony, Worldtano.
This is a GrandMaster-level review.  You should consider turning this review into a feature-length film.  Perhaps get Lars Von Trier to direct.  Vincent D&#39;Onofrio could play Fantano.  (*reprising his Full Metal Jacket look).  Willem Dafoe could play Corey Feldman.
50 minutes?!!?!?!?!
But does it bump in the whip?
what 50 MINUTES=?????  gotta be a display mistake right??
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1285">21:25</a> Sounded Korn Influenced..
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1177">19:37</a> I don&#39;t think that amount exists.
no no no no no,no no no. no no no no no no no.
This makes me as an amateur music maker really scared that my music may unknowingly sound like absolute shit like this
Nostalthony Critictano
This totally sounds like a parody album.
But was there an expectation for something more from this album?
Anthony, please tell me HOW THE FUCK did you manage to listen through this album? You skimmed through, right??
this entire album is Feldmans mid life crisis<br>my thoughts and prayers go out to Comedy Memetano for reviewing this mess. He needs a breather
Hickedy Splikedy forever
What is this<br>Blood on the Dancefloor???
It&#39;s just too experimental for Anthony
yo I have but money but no snoop dogg so you lie anthony
This was great, please do more of these if you can, raw uncut Fantano is best Anthony.
This melon fucks laugh makes me think hes mental
Didn&#39;t even know Feldman was doing music... Just saw his live performance...  Is he doing a Joaquin Phoenix?
Need that ty dolla
I CAN&#39;T SAY NO TO THE BEAT!
I think what we&#39;ve learned here is that if the artist puts the number 2 in place of the word &#39;to&#39; it&#39;s gonna be a true work of art.
So this is basically Yes Men: The Album.
&gt;hellboy<br>&gt;garbage
Nice to find something worse than last night&#39;s debate. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23palatecleanser">#palatecleanser</a>
watch his celebrity wife swap episode and everything will make sense... terrifying
Damn... Corey broke Anthony
WHERE IS THE FUCKING ELSEQ REVIEW MELON, YOU REVIEW THIS SHIT FOR 50MINS BUT NOT THE AOTY
Where the podcast at tho?
on that &quot;worst song&quot;, i thought it was a kazoo playing and then realized it was his voice. that&#39;s uh an accomplishment i guess?
5 people liked it though
Chuchesta&#39;s AOTY
How can this guy talk for 50 minutes. I have nothing to say. I should just kill myself
I haven&#39;t seen you this unhinged in so long. It gives me life.
Corey is going through a tough time and nobody is there to stand by him...
worse than Speeding Bullet 2 Heaven by Kid Cudi? that would be hard to believe
Better or worse than Speed Bullet 2 Hell?
redthony pilltano<br>backthony pedaltano
In 2016, Corey released this ... &quot;Angelic 2 the core,&quot; his most accomplished album. I think his undisputed masterpiece is &quot;Go for it,&quot; a song so catchy, most people probably don&#39;t listen to the lyrics. But they should, because it&#39;s not just about the pleasures of conformity, and the importance of trends, it&#39;s also a personal statement about the band itself
Lol glad to know I wasn&#39;t the only one thinking of Citizen Zombie during that Fred Durst track
zomby ultra review please
the needle drop roast of Corey Feldman
the number 2 has plagued the titles of some of the worst releases of the last year or so<br><br>Angelic 2 The Core<br><br>The Bible 2<br><br>Speeding Bullet 2 Heaven
This sounds like the music equivalent to The Room. Maybe Tommy Wiseau and Corey Feldman can team up for some epic music videos.
&quot;Let&#39;s take that extra step and see if it happens&quot; In tears hahah
Soundtrack to the worst fun fair of the year 2001 right there.
sounds like the next fall out boy record
I CAN&#39;T SAY NO TO THE BEAT
Nothing better than a Morning rant 😂
I&#39;m already putting it out there: This album might be better than The New Calassic, the indisputable AOTY for 2015. Angelic 2 The Core draws inspiration straight from Chance 3&#39;s innovative mixing and takes it near to the avant-garde, not to mention the stunning vocal performances on this thing. Corey Feldman just singlehandedly revived Fred Durst&#39;s career and made an inferior artist&#39;s song &#39;Working Class Hero&#39; listenable. I&#39;m thinking a strong 9 on this one, only because the lack of Beavis and Butthead impressions in the sketches was a questionable decision. All around solid album.
you know it&#39;s fucking bad when he brings out the wife beater
Anthony with the MOST YELLOWEST TEETH IN THE GAME!
This video about to get a copyright strike Rip 2016.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1590">26:30</a> is like a bad KMFDM b-side.
This video is gif galore
You actually did it FeelsBadMan
The quality of the mix genuinely sounds like he recorded it with a children&#39;s toy on an airplane. And the backing music sounds royalty free.
Didn&#39;t &quot;Ascension Millennium&quot; come out two years ago? How long did it take to make this album?
If you could translate his performance on Today into an album, it would be this.
NOT advertiser friendly Fandago
Anthony&#39;s laugh is cute
Do you think Br3ttd0g59 is worse than this?  I&#39;ll give this a listen and get back to you
What the fuck did you show me Fandingle?
I&#39;ve given up on human creativity.
Lana Del Rey hasn&#39;t released an album yet don&#39;t jump to conclusions
My roommate is asleep right next to me and its so hard to not laugh out loud rn
This seems like The Room of music. I&#39;m going to think of this when I&#39;m trying not to cum.
HEY FANTABOY! WHY NO SCORE 0? WE WANT A NEW 0!!!
This was fun. Thanks Fandooku.
this album physically made me sick
If you think this is bad you should hear Jefree Star
some of the most bizarre music I&#39;ve ever heard<br>sounds like someone took all the popular music from the last 2 decades and threw it into a 1980&#39;s blender, drank it, then shat it out in the form of liquid diarrhea
This man dropped a 50 minute review
I&#39;m crying
Wow
Great work melonman, this is truly one of the defining albums of our generation.
hey review atmospheres overcast! album.
I love how he says &quot;This album is beyond description&quot; then proceeds to go on for 50 min about its atrocities.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1632">27:12</a> nine inch nails anyone???
I love how you don&#39;t even bother to chromakey the album into the green screen
50 minutes, holy shit!
&quot;right up there with chinese water torture
I&#39;m playing wow right now and I cant tell if it&#39;s the music or dozens of mobs slaughtered by me :P
The worst album of the year so far
Corey Feldman is concerned Uncle don&#39;t you dare laugh at him Anthony
this is just the room in album form<br>he should of featured tommy wiseau they would have beautiful fucked up pieces of art together
Angelic bullet 2 heaven
Stop Stop he&#39;s already dead!
I wouldn&#39;t be so sure of that. Cudi drops this week.
the only album we have proof you&#39;ve listened to is this album
Why the hell did I watch the whole thing
I bet old man Feldman was confused and trying to imitate auto tune while singing, bringing about the bizzare melodies
Lol bring the stars up to the moon
This is easily the greatest video I&#39;ve seen in awhile, Your reactions are priceless!
I never thought you would top &quot;Speedin Bullet To Heaven&quot;, holy shit this is hysterical.
Seems like he finally lost it
The song &quot;Duh&quot; was like a rip off of &quot;smooth criminal&quot; if but instead of MJ it&#39;s sung by Corey and has a lot of annoying sound effects, noises and unpleasant sound choices. Which is a notable downgrade from &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot;. a NOTEABLE downgrade
50 minutes.
You know an album is shit when Anthony doesn&#39;t care about getting DCMA&#39;d.
This album was just ahead of its time I reckon.
this is even better then the &quot;Speedin bullets to heaven&quot; video
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=2720">45:20</a> it gave me sore throat
This is THE worst thing in EVER.
So it&#39;s a 10/10?
amazing I&#39;m about to cry this is so beautiful
This made me dislike the concept of music and now I&#39;m sad.
Longthony Videano here
the cover art is so bad looks like it was made on ms paint why is no one talking about that shit
We get to see the best teeth in the game a whole lot in this video.
UUHHMMM Phish duuude
I find it funny that you can apply lots of Anthony&#39;s points in this review to a Death Grips album<br>&quot;There&#39;s no rhyme or reason&quot;<br>&quot;He explores five different concepts that never fully extend&quot;
wanna hear u go further on what u said about hellboy
OMG I&#39;ve lost it at this bit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1312">21:52</a>. What the hell was that!?...... it sounded like those party horn&#39;s.....
Can&#39;t wait for the VMP pressing of this gem
Classic/10
This is a forced meme
Fucking, so brutal! I love it!
Don&#39;t presume, I still haven&#39;t dropped mine.
If Corey Feldman claims ad revenue on this video, he&#39;ll probably end up making more money on this than the album sales.
fantano for next joker
this is a gift that keeps on giving, i watched half an hour of this already without realising it!
The song with Fred Durst sounded like &quot;i&quot; by kendrick
YOU GOT THE TOUCH!!! YOU GOT THE POWERRR
Well this was epic
Also that first track that he played could be an Ariel Pink song
Corey looks like Skrillex 45 años older. And this album made me loose the concept of the numbers.
This album is terrible but not as bad as &quot;Black Cat&quot; by Zucchero Sugar Fornaciari
I can&#39;t believe he gave it a 7/10
Is this like a tom waits impression album?
Was the album cover put together in MS paint?
A whole fucking hour.
best video of all time right here boys, we made it.
Is it wrong that I&#39;m always more excited for Anthony&#39;s Not Good reviews that any other album?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>No? Okay, good.
Hmph... I heard worse...
This album is the equivalent of a B movie
flagged for seccual abuse too much thicc shown in the vegan beater
cudi hasn&#39;t even dropped yet tho...
50 minutes my god fantano<br><br>no mercy
YEEEES. so glad you chose to do this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1349">22:29</a> - Cal Chuchesta surfacing slowly
It&#39;s as if Charlie from It&#39;s Always Sunny made a record
woa woa woah........ 50min?
It&#39;s like &quot;Birdemic&quot; of music.
This is a horrible way to mock the art of someone who was probably passed around Hollywood zionist pedophiles for most of his professional life. I hope you&#39;re proud.
So the worst album of the year isn&#39;t gonna be Cudi&#39;s new album?
What is snoop dog doing on this bull shit ?
now let&#39;s have an hour long elseq review BAYBEE
Are you sure this isn&#39;t like a parody album? Are we being trolled? WHAT&#39;S GOING OOOOOOOOOOOOOOON??????????????????????
I commend you for actually getting through all this.
I liked this album had some good tunes
Kurupt nooooooooo
I&#39;m really sick of you not giving credit where credit is due.
Review THC: The Healing Component now
PS: it&#39;s really difficult to not burst out laughing at work as I watch this. xD
I can&#39;t wait to add this to my extensive collection of Corey Feldman memes
The cringe is strong with this album lol.
HOLY FUCKING FELDMAN BATMAN!
this gets an 8/10 but Blankface gets a 2???? smh antony you know nothing about music
Remember Skrillex? This is him now. Feel old yet?
I CANT SAY NO TO DA BEAT!
I can&#39;t finish this vid the music is to disgusting, Corey Feldman your a rat faced bastard
I&#39;m only 9 minutes in but... holy shit nothing and I mean nothing could have prepared me for whatever the FUCK this is.
Could be a 2016 take on parodising 80&#39;s pop, you never know.<br><br>And if you could review this surely you could do Tyga&#39;s Gold Album?
Can&#39;t wait for that new Kings of Leon Score. BAWWWWWGAWWWWDDDDDDD
The one million dollar question is, Is this worst than Metallica&#39;s St.Anger?
hey Anthony you spelled bottomless pit wrong!
50 minute video for this garbage? Okay.
So this is a 1 right? It&#39;s no Speeding Bullet.
Speedin Bullet to Heaven &gt; this?
Produced by Cal
every album with 2 instead of &#39;to&#39; in its name is trash, case closed
This album made me want to kill myself.
Worst of decade so, Dead Petz was punched in fweaking face. Miley, try again.
Okay, I&#39;m ten minutes in, but I have to go to class.  I am 100% watching the rest of this as soon as I&#39;m back.  Anthony, it might behoove you to take a mental health day.  This album could leave lasting neurological damage if you&#39;re not careful.
Almost reminds me of the Shaggs, especially on your &quot;accidentally experimental&quot; comment.
Why is he doing an Oscar the grouch impression the whole album?
Hi I disliked the Video and did not watch it ! Have a blessed day
Check out this too, the new Meat Puppets (to me at least, in terms of sounding like AZ)
Yo this isn&#39;t a real review. Where is anthony, this is elmers glue not anthony
This is unreal 😂
You gave Blank Face a 5, BITTSM a 3 and now you say that this is not good? You are officially done as a music critic, melon.
So, you just don&#39;t get it, huh? Close minded fool. You know nothing about music
I hope you listen, love you &lt;3 keep at it, you&#39;re a life changer
DONATELLO
U weren&#39;t lying this has to be the worst album of all time I can&#39;t think of anything worse than this lmaoo this is an incredible feat in history
Phoenix / Tempe loves you a lot man.
This is like a museum exhibit of the worst music ever made. And this is the only context in which I will ever listen to this record. You failed me, Cory Feldman. You failed us all.
Watching you listening to this is brilliant.
straight from the heart shit, got dam.
dude this shit is like jazz to my ears
i bet cal chuchesta loves this album
when you said 22 tracks, i fucking gasped.
The song at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1900">31:40</a> was like he listened to Semi Charmed Life and was like &quot;... yeah.... let&#39;s do this but like..... bad&quot;
Today I watched a man submit himself to the worst kind of torture imaginable.
Jesus Christ Fantano, you&#39;ve really lost it now.
The To Pimp A Butterfly of bad albums?
Man, this is some throwback Fantano with the listing to snippets of the songs in the review.
BEACH SLANG<br>MY DUDE
pretty  enjoyable review
Death Grips is by far worse than this
biiiiiiiitch. ;) love that this is so long man, straight fucking amazing.
is this supposed to be bad? because look at the official website for this album, it has such a cheesy pre-2000&#39;s kind of shitty design so that you can only get the memo that this album is an art project for that super shit aesthetic<br><br>that still makes the album bad
is it worst than the new calasic
sounds good to me, not quite tpab, but pretty good
This may not be his strongest album but please review Corey feldmans to pimp a gooniefly
Where can I pick up a vinyl copy of this?!?!
Some1 broke anthony
No mine is the worst because YOU WONT REVIEW IT MEHHHHHHHH
someone download this in case it gets taken down
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1578">26:18</a> Resist Criticism BABY!!!!!!!
Whoa why is this 50 minutes?
This reminds me of the scene in Boogie Nights when Dirk is in the recording studio
&quot;How is this legal?&quot;<br>-Anoine Fantoine
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23bengazi">#bengazi</a>
what the fuck genre is this supposed to be? garbage?
best fantano vid EVER
Loving the samples
Just watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=534">8:54</a>, you will hear everything you need holy FUCK I CAN&#39;T BREATH CAUSE THIS SHIT FUCKING STINKS
Go 4 It is my guilty pleasure
Cudi hasn&#39;t dropped yet so there&#39;s always room for worse
If this was a Death Grips album you&#39;d give it an 11/10
holy crap this is 50 minutes
Please grow your hair out some more
This is your chef-d&#39;œuvre, your meilleur travail. Bravo
both this year and last years worst aoty had the number 2 in it lol
nigga this is 50 minutes?!
They should replace the electric chair with this album.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=1456">24:16</a> Is how long I lasted. I CAN NO LONGER ALLOW MYSELF TO BE POISONED BY COREY FELDMAN
Not feeling that laugh fantano<br><br><br><br><br>imma give it a light 4 out of 10
This has to be one of the best reviews you have ever done Melon. Well done.
TOMPPABEATS - HARBOR LP!
I don&#39;t want to even give him the satisfaction of illegally downloading it for laughs.
Could&#39;ve been a pretty ok instrumental album
I&#39;m triggered
Yay, Ought in the background!
Worst vest of 2016.
You should make more listen/react videos to some of the albums you feel more viserally about.
I&#39;ve often wondered what it would sound like if The Room was a musical.<br><br>I imagine it would be something like this
DUDE THE SONG U LEFT FOR US TO LISTEN TO IS SO BAD ITS SO INCREDIBLY BAD HOLY SHIT
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=421">7:01</a>
Death Grips and Corey Feldman should do an album together.
TMR is better
more like angelic to the bore amiright
you should do something like this live
this thing &gt;&gt;&gt; Pet Sounds
Have you reviewed the last bat for lashes record?
Lmfao
the synth lead is ripped off of every song on the radio in 2009
Stop stealing from that meme review guy
Isn&#39;t the synth lead at around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E0kq9YkjA&amp;t=550">9:10</a> ripped off from gangam style?
I&#39;m a YouTube hero and I&#39;m mass flagging you because this video is negative. I will also be contacting YouTube because I can do that shit. Hero privilege bro
THIS IS THE BEST REVIEW YET. HILARIOUS
Gumthony Spitano
you look broken
50 minutes holy fuck
I&#39;d rather listen to The New Calassic on repeat for the rest of my life than listen to Angelic 2 the Core.
This&#39;ll be Cal&#39;s favorite album of the year calling it now
This album is genuinely garbage<br>Honestly this guy is insane
This makes Speeding Bullet feel like a masterpiece
Where the Campaign review at tho ?
Will Cudi top this for worst album of the year? find out this friday!
oh nahh this shit trash 💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
This is typically the album that you only need to see the album&#39;s cover and you now what to expect.
50 minutes? what the fuck Melon
I&#39;m gonna listen to this shit and review it
LMAOOOOO
Why am I watching this?
50 min video ? Dang man
For a second I thought I was listening to The Faint.
I liked Hellboy to some degree....
I bet you haven&#39;t watched the whole video

Upcoming album review is Corey Feldman and Kid Cudi collab: Speedin Bullet 2 The Core
green day&#39;s polution radio IS the worst album of 2016

This sounds like the computer episode from dont hug me im scared
Somewhere in the middle of a forest with Wi-Fi and copious amounts of drugs Kid Cudi is doing the Birdman Handrub right now...
no
in 5 years I&#39;m subscribed to this channel, this is the first time I&#39;ve seen Anthony actually listen to music.
I thought the angels were moth people.
You know it&#39;s a good album when you leave it wondering if the dude is actually mentally disabled
jesus christ 50 min fantano?????
Still better than Bottomless pit
