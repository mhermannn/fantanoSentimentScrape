hey everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd Internet's busiest music nerd probably a little crazy in this video yeah that was my gum uh but that's because we we've run into a very special album right here a very different album uh an album that I think is the worst album of the year and album that I think will maybe go down as the worst album of the decade album that quite frankly um I I think will break the records of badness if there are such things now this album is a titled angelic to the core angelic Funkadelic slash angelic raka Delic it is a 90-minute record it's a double album and it's from the one the only mr. Corey Feldman who is most notably an actor who's been in numerous famous 80s films such as The Goonies and stand by me but for a while now he's been trying to break his way into the music industry with like a single here an album there and every time he's met with the usual mix of docs and cheers and polite applause and and that's no different for today where recently he appeared on The Today Show where he performed a song from this very album and God God is a SPAD this album is bad the seldom is so bad I can't believe how bad this album is I mean I knew it was going to be awful Corey Feldman not really a talented songwriter not really a talented singer not a talented lyricist not a talented musician and sort of looking like grandpa Skrillex on the front cover over here which I have no idea what why this couldn't have been properly cropped like there's crappy white lines on the side of the album cover and I have also left in the black lines at the top and the bottom of the cover because obviously that they're in there for artistic effect and he's sort of being brought out of the depths of Hell by two angels I guess and the 22 tracks on this record are painful really up there with Chinese water torture I can't even begin to describe how terrible this album is which is why I'm sort of in this very loose format right here because as I was writing my review for this record I realized there are some albums that are really beyond description and this is one of them this is one of those rare occasions where an album is beyond description and when I say this is like the worst album of the year it really is the worst album of the year like I dare you to find an out worse than this album and I've heard some terrible albums this year and I was thinking about writing a not good segment about like the latest die Antwoord album or like the new little Pete mixtape Hellboy which is like I don't know angsty white boy broken side quality garbage rap from the 2000s come back from the dead manifesting itself in a world that is influenced by like I don't know like bones and that white Iverson song from a rapper who shall remain nameless post Malone sorry for the lack of edits here but really I'm having a hard time sort of gathering myself and gathering the words here and preparing myself and really trying to prepare you guys for what we're about to embark on here so god damn it 22 songs on this thing 90 minutes on this thing um I just I just can't prepare you guys for what about to play you I just can't that I just wish there was something I could say that would take the edge off that would get you ready for what is about to happen here because this is pure [ __ ] insanity this record this is insane this is like delusional to the most potent most disturbing degree like so delusion that you wonder if corey feldman like need some help or something because there's no reason anybody would make this album and then say this is a professional product this is totally finished no way we can improve this there's nothing we could do our work here is done I mean it's not even bad in the way that like speeding bullet to heaven is bad like Kid Cudi is uh trying to do something really weird and noisy and artsy or anything like that like Corey Feldman is is legitimately trying to write like pop tunes here like like pop hits he's doing his best to copy like electronic dance music the the song go for is really dubstep influenced like funk music sin function called acts in a couple times his songs have always kind of like pulled heavily from MJ for whatever reason and uh it's just like every awful idea musically corey feldman has ever had just turns up on this record um and but before I even get into playing some of the music on this thing I will say that interjecting between some of these tracks are these really weird skits where I think Cory is playing the male voice in the tracks and it's kind of like he's ripping off Charlie's Angels or just parroting Charlie's Angels and being like angels you have to do this and my mama bud talking to them through the loudspeaker or whatever but like every single time he plays the transition from Adam West's Batman which has nothing to [ __ ] do with Charlie's Angels every single time I hear you play that it triggers me it triggers me because these are two worlds that don't collide and yet you're making to do it and the dialogue and all these skits reads like a bad porno like it makes the beavis and butt-head skits on speeding bullet to heaven seemed like highbrow comedy let's just get into some of the horrors on this album song's called ascension millennium believe it or not one of the word one of the better tracks on the record but kicks off with this really ridiculous little intro where I guess there's like maybe a devil or something uh I don't know I'm suffering on the inside that's all I can say come on the sound effects so we go ascension you oh my god and I say that's not one of the worst tracks on the record because it does like oh it does have like a coherent vocal melody and like in like a sensible beat and everything but still the stuff gets like batshit insane really fast on the next track eleven lies I'm not joking what like I I don't get this sort of religious devil angel kind of theme that some of the earlier tracks here play with because the the rest of the record doesn't dive into that all that much it's kind of like this album tries to have maybe like five different concepts none of which it fully explores like which concept you're hearing sort of depends it on what part of the album that you're in the middle of here we go [Music] [Music] like where the hell this little simple you'd come from it's totally ripped off from some other popular song I don't know which one but I know it is because the only part of this track that sounds good and oh my god Corey Feldman from oh yeah like what is this vocal melody he's trying to sing like it doesn't make sense at all like there's no rhyme or reason to this vocal melody oh Jesus Christ it's like he's not even in control of his own voice and then the auto-tune that he throws on top of it doesn't really know what pitch or key to put his voice in because it's like what the [ __ ] what the [ __ ] are you singing like you actually have to be trying to hold the note in order for the auto-tune to like put your voice where it needs to be but I'm not even going to try to make any more sense of this track literally those few seconds of this song that you heard that's all you need to hear if you just kind of want to laugh at it a little bit if you really want to make yourself question whether or not you should live and you know really get those suicidal thoughts bubbling up in your head please listen to this whole record because that's gonna happen meanwhile back on planet Earth why what why what why is why is the guy answering them before they give their answer like what why is this dialogue so awkward no II just your mission today should you choose to accept it is going to be a three part mission for one I need you to go out there and spread love right and to all the people of the earth if you were to do it lickety-split and remember go for it do it lickety-split um that you know this this bit of dialogue here references the titles to several different tracks on the the album and I have no idea what lickety-splickety is like does he know it's lickety-split like I don't understand what this lickety-splickety thing is I'll just jump forward and play this track which actually features corrupt of all people I don't know how he pulled like corrupt on this album I don't know how he pulled Snoop Dogg well Snoop Dogg shows up anywhere where there's a paycheck and fred durst I mean Fred Durst has made music that is almost as bad as this out I guess I'm not surprised by some of the features on this thing but here's this track called lickety-splickety yeah okay all right all right come on now why is corey feldman doing on this track oh I get every single verse he's doing this growly weird little voice where it's like it's kind like his angry little Michael Jackson yes I won my turn i'ma come Brandon down there like whoa he Wow I worry about Corey Feldman I really do worry about Corey Feldman after listening to this record I truly do meanwhile every time plays the stupid Batman music Batman has nothing to do with Charlie's Angels stop it me so I don't want to hear about Corey Feldman tasting anything in a sexual manner please thank you come to me attend this like Jesus Christ Oh [Music] [Music] again this is one of those moments on the record where Corey Feldman is clearly trying to pull from some track that that had a more talented artist recorded it back in the 90s it might have been a semi popular song but now he's just trying to like force this sound today and I don't know why like the it's it's one of many things about this record that makes me kind of sick but we'll continue a little bit further stop [ __ ] oh no more of this skit it's terrible but this song is called bad people bad people there's probably a joke in there about bad music but I'm just too stressed out to even make it because this record really is taxing it is a taxing listen [Music] [Music] [Music] you could barely impersonate Michael Jackson 20 years ago you can do your you're even worse at it now you know like not that I thought that he might get better because sometimes practice does make perfect and Michael Jackson super talented guy a lot of that talent natural talent the kind of talented if you wanted to have it for yourself you would probably have to spend at least a decade honing those talents but Corey Feldman over here seems to have gotten worse at his Michael Jackson impression with age and it's just it's just unfortunate that this little duo of this little ditty over here I'm thinking of duo of the dynamic duo because this Batman music plays every single time but this little ditty is titled duh it is one of the worst dance songs on the entire record [Music] how is this legal how is this allowed how is this okay like shouldn't someone go to jail shouldn't someone be in prison I don't know um we have this song everybody featuring doc ice which is a funky a funky little cut from the record [Music] [Music] um Oh [Music] like how do you make this to be serious how can you listen to this would be like wow seriously good good oh my god this is a seriously good song guy oh no way I'm dying on the inside I swear okay so so being single from the project go for it with Snoop Dogg snoop Dogg what were you very thinking man what are you thinking I mean again listen I know money's cool but like can you at least for once be like hey listen this is a bad song I'm not gonna make it appearance on it you know like I don't care how much you pay me I just want to hear Snoop Dogg say those words one time I don't care how much you pay me I'm fearing on that song because I know he's never said those words I know he's never I know he's never uttered the words I don't care how much you pay me corey feldman i could appear on his song but yeah let's listen to this stuff they think of a number in your head how much money you would need to be paid in order to be on this song grandpa Skrillex brings the dubstep he brought the dubstep come on snoop don't disappoint us don't disappoint us new as your she there's like ten things going on at once while Snoop Dogg is rapping you can barely even tell what he's doing which I mean I guess if you're going to be involved in a Corey Feldman project is the ideal way to be involved like you know just bury me under so much stuff people won't even recognize me that's that's how I would like to be featured on a corey feldman project I guess if it was life or death though death would be the sweet release of death I'd consider it I'd think about it you know everything it would be a tough choice again what are these messy-ass horns hanging in the back I don't think they add the the epic backdrop that Corey was going for on this track that is clearly trying to be really meaningful all right we're just going to move on to one of my favorite tracks on this thing seamless featuring fred durst this is a very special song one of the funkier tracks on the entire thing I've never heard fred durst on a song so funky I'll just say that much yeah this this has happened do you hear this do you hear this Oh goddamn I can't I can't say no to the beat I can't say no to me it's like almost accidentally Punk like it's almost accidentally post-punk like the vocals are so bad that it's that it's a it's it's like accidentally doing something experimental um and then then the fred durst cut goddamn this is the Fred Durst feature why here we go [Music] oh damn oh damn what when you arm do this mix is terrible like these horns are so much louder than everything else stop please stop God and this is this is track 12 this is track 12 there's 22 tracks you know is it worth it I think you guys want to see me suffer more so why not we're already this deep we're already this deep we're already this close to killing ourselves let's let's just take that extra step and see if it happens [Music] why [Music] [Music] what is this what what he didn't record all this himself it was a producer involved right like nobody said to him hey yeah maybe we should do it maybe we should do another take you know you'd think there would be incentive to do that because the the producer might you know make some more money you know because the more hours you're in the studio maybe Corey Feldman did this in his own studio I really don't know I just feel like he couldn't do all this by himself there were other people there so nobody was like hey maybe this could be better maybe we could fix this or maybe maybe that's a bad performance oh the song is called negativity so I mean I'm hoping that the song really tears at the critics says hey you're negative about my music you're an idiot I hate you or you're stupid you're just a negative loser that's why you think my musics bad that's what I hope this song is about but if it's not then I'll be pleasantly surprised oh god what is this like a new metal song what's going on here this is like a hip-hop beat as well like took a dip touch touch to burn and earnestly but what is going on here [Music] [Applause] stop what is going on the the I don't even know where to begin with this track I mean from the awful guitar to what sounds like a very thin synth bassline uh korie's uh his vocals man and and then didn't didn't like this is another moment where it's like he's trying to borrow so much stuff from the 80s and the 90s and just making it sound awful in 2016 it makes me want to let never listen to a song from the 80s or 90s ever again you got me we're obviously in the angelic raka Delic section of them god this is really wearing on me this is really sucking me of energy I feel like I'm being drained I'm being drained power through it what is going on here and notice again like the whole Charlie's Angels thing is gone like the devil voices and all that stuff are gone like will but like where was all that [ __ ] in the bit lake where was all this [ __ ] going it just kind of disappeared you know now it's just like awful songs we're in the awful song portion of the the concept of the record I guess is what you can say [Music] oh gosh Oh miss rim pay and and bend it one day what is effect on his phone and why does it make his voice so loud and in the in the mix I mean I think I'm really the best option here cut your losses make everything else louder than your voice and the album would be semi listenable in in one's opinion okay we're down to the wire with this record however the last handful of songs here is really where the album like pulls out all the stops like the worst ideas on the record Cory really saves them for last this song over here titled for my love it's a touching little track about not being able to express one's emotions properly and he kicks the whole things off I kiss the whole thing off with a little bit of spoken word some string sections to make it extra dramatic it's like something out of a Disney movie sometimes words don't express the feelings something you don't really care doesn't matter [Music] [Music] how [Music] no bring the Stars up to the moon the stars are farther away than the moon wouldn't you have to bring the moon up to the Stars how does that make any sense Jesus get so scared I can I think say the words I mean why kill me now god damn that little simply likely would add a really nice touch guys God where oh this song this is one of the worst songs on the record this may be the worst song on the record you're in here why right away there's there's really no um there's really no buts about this being the worst track on the record you're gonna hear this and say wow Anthony you were right this is the worst song on the record come on suffer I want to die give it this is real and this isn't like a joke intro either I was waiting for this to be oh he's just joking he's just joking we're gonna get into the real song in a second no no that's not how it works like this is how he would sing at the intro of the song if I was trying to make fun of this song that's how I would sing but Corey Feldman is singing like this [Music] change you know I can see that I can see this recording being something that I maybe enjoy if like some other group had tried to duh do some like weird lo-fi tongue-in-cheek jad like vocal jazz track with like bad singing is like a joke or like a b-side or something but for it to be like a main feature track on your full-length album and be like the only like track that sounds like this so it's clear like standing out for a reason here and just the way that is he sings on this track so close to the microphone like he's trying to kiss the mic I don't know what he's doing I'm not sure he knows that we've all together and we do [Music] play it again Sam Wow that jazz certainly does swing you know um well it's it's stuff like this that when people say a book white people ruin everything um I know that's not true but in the face of this I can't I can't come up with a retort that's something we were together we won't it change [Music] um I I wish I had a hammer here because if I did I would keep tempo with this song on my skull with it he the this next track cuts the cuts together some new news clips some news clips Wow so Wow this court is Corey Feldman make it political on this track was Corey Feldman gonna I'm gonna take on some serious serious topics oh there's a piano it's probably going to be meaningful it's probably gonna be it's going to be about the world today and it's going to be a tearjerker too because everything's so sad damn words change in I gotta take a stand I got code inside a dream [Music] just me oh of course he had to go funky with it he had to go funky with it as soon as he started singing about the pain he had to go real funky with it had to drop that that funk rhythm guitar in there like that even makes sense like what [Music] oh yeah it's so bad that it's almost it's almost entertaining like if this were a some album a you know recorded by a crazy man this is an album recorded by a crazy man and maybe like years down the line I can I can go back and listen to it and have a laugh but just knowing that this is like Corey Feldman it makes it difficult to swallow I guess is what I'm saying not that I have anything personally against Corey Feldman but I've known that in the past he's released super mediocre music and the fact that he still still at it is uh I guess impressive in a way because he seems to get worse and worse ah just a couple more weird neat we're nearing the end here people we're so close I could taste it [Music] [Music] what is this vocal melody then Dhin Dhin Dhin Dhin Dhin Dhin Dhin Dhin Dhin Dhin Dhin Dhin Dhin Dhin Dhin Dhin Dhin Dhin Dhin Dhin Dhin Dhin Dhin like it's not something sit down and really conceive of I guess seems almost improvised and in a bad way [Music] ah those harmonies came together terrible just like every vocal harmony on this record mind you but but there particularly it was pretty bad that was pretty bad [Music] [Music] no no stop it God stop it oh mercy the song is titled mercy hopefully it shows me some [Music] hopefully please Cory please I'm begging you go easy on me please I'm being prematurely aged by this album I feel like I'm 55 [Music] Oh [Music] chairman be by my lease ha ha thinking about my niece my niece I know he didn't say knees my niece I get he's a concerned uncle and then those vocals in the background BAM others thinking and a bow man do you like that's the kind of lyric that you could only do your own background vocal for because you're not gonna get any other jackass to record them bouncing off of you singing that we are going Babar noose boundaries so thank God for modern recording technology where you can sort of overdub your own vocals because that that that song would have never been graced with the baumanis Bala peace hanging in the background there [Music] haha my camp my camera is given out here it's like no more please and I'm sorry camera this have this course listen isn't it it's a mercy [Music] but that's like actual that's almost like a new idea on the Trekker that's like something like an R&B artists would sing today like hmmm si like this will end up on a weakened record or something uh mercy who mercy I could hear Abel singing I feel like you heard some weekend and then he recorded this like this is Cory Feldman's attempt at some glitzy glamorous you know chilly depressed little all R&B or something [Music] you gotta stop you gotta stop we're at the last track working class hero which cross my fingers is a is a cover of the of the song by John Lennon because if it was it would it would be very bittersweet mostly better but but bittersweet a proper ending properly confusing ending to put a bad performance of a head scratching cover at the end of really one of the most perplexing records I've ever heard in my entire life letter let er rip Cory let er rip no no no no no he's really trying to sell the full Kangol on this chat it's really raw isn't it truly dramatic Cory dramatic that's you though is something to be there's almost like Marilyn Manson's cover of the track oh yeah Oh [Music] no stop I'm waiting for there to be like a big like you know explosive like rock instrumentation popping up in the background because he's really building up the tension here you know there's got to be a moment of release where is like Oh whack and glass hero is something to be you know like guitar solos wailing away in the background drums pounding the lights are bright shining on Corey Feldman the the most working class hero [ __ ] you've ever seen I tell ya God how's how it's even possible like there's distorted guitar blaring away now but the instrumental sounds almost quieter than it was than like a couple of seconds ago what [Music] what [Music] no no okay no we're done we're done here guys um this is the the this is the worst thing I've heard this year and you know I do like hey guys worse worst albums of the the year segment here let's let's give you guys a list of the worst albums of the year this this has to be number one this has to be number one I can't think of an album being worse than this I can I just can't conceive of a worse record um I can't even think of how to make an album worse than this I need the the sure you know there's like some messy sloppy bad demos out there but the fact that this thing is like close to being coherent but it's like also far away from being go here and it's like you know kind of saying but kind of nutso and yeah you know that this this thing this thing inhabits a special place I I guess I can say um Wow Wow but the grass here is sad and me I guess um yeah that's that's really as unnecessary as a closure gets for an album this long what does that even mean like what is what is the context of that within this album like what does it have to do with anything that he sung before this track and the alleged good evil paradigm of this record the rock funk paradigm of this record what did that crappy sudden out of nowhere jazz song have to do with any of the rock songs on the second half of the record the Charlie's Angels thing the god devil a heaven spirituality thing that this album has going again like nothing lines up nothing makes sense in terms of the concept in terms of the flow and and that rings true for the songs and the recordings on this album themselves none of them make sense they're all messy they're all sloppy they're all badly recorded they're all badly written like there's just enough there in order for it to sound like a song just just enough just barely enough there to make it sound like it's a song but it's awful songs it's like terrible songs it's not even just like bad masturbatory you know like just banging on pots and pans and going Ripper burger like certainly there is you know odd music out there like that but this this thing is just ah I want to leave I want to turn off the camera and I want to be done talking about this thing there's just something about the existence of the salamis at Anthony you got to talk about this because you can't not do worse two albums of the year segment and not talk about this and it's it's true this is the worst album of the year this will be the worst album of the year and it's almost like unfair you know to the other bad albums out there that would maybe like to be at the top of the worst albums of the Year lists you know it's it's it's really unfair because I feel like if they even wanted to they couldn't make worse music than this and um I don't know it's you know some people are just blessed with all the bad music talent you know some people just naturally make bad music and other people while they may try to make terrible music no matter how hard they try they'll never be it that bad of a musician so I guess all we can do is just hang back and be in awe of Corey Feldman's lack of talent why
