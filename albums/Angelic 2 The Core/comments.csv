@TheGrayMysterious,2024-06-16T02:55:53Z,2024-06-16T02:55:53Z,2,this album is the spiritual personification of what happens when your friend asks you to pass the AUX cord.
@user-zg1lr3oq6f,2024-06-14T00:50:16Z,2024-06-14T00:50:16Z,1,goated album not even TPAB could make Anthony go insane
@Genericcritic47-qc8jj,2024-06-11T17:01:06Z,2024-06-11T17:01:06Z,1,I think melons mental health is on a decline.
@kr1stinabee,2024-06-11T12:34:02Z,2024-06-11T12:34:43Z,1,if this album was called Angelic 2 The Butterfly you still would have hated it because its a bad album
@YouTubeHistoricalArchive,2024-06-10T01:53:08Z,2024-06-10T01:53:08Z,1,As a producer this album is a big source of motivation for me. Motivation to not ever make an album this horrible
@stephenbusby424,2024-06-07T16:19:14Z,2024-06-07T16:22:15Z,1,"What confuses me about Corey is that he clearly wants to be respected as a music artist in his own right, yet he sounds like he is doing a bad impression of Michael Jackson in the majority is his songs. <br><br>Itâ€™s difficult for me to take him seriously when he releases an album like this which sounds and looks like it was produced by a 5-year old. The album cover alone looks like something a child would throw together in an hour using Paint."
@cvspvr,2024-06-07T00:06:31Z,2024-06-07T00:06:31Z,1,"man, i&#39;ve definitely heard that synth bit before, but i can&#39;t remember what don&#39;t it&#39;s from"
@hollycardinal5294,2024-06-06T06:17:02Z,2024-06-06T06:17:02Z,1,"honestly it sounds like cocaine, like, i dont know how else Corey Feldman could make it. A surprising number of those tracks where there&#39;s 20 instruments laid over each other, if he just turned those individual melodies into songs they&#39;d probably be at least passable (or at least Just derivative and dull) songs, or that one EDM track that actually kinda banged until it randomly turned into a Funky Town bootleg? Or pulled the Party Rock Anthem synth track?<br><br>This sounds like something made on a coke bender surrounded by people who are paid too much to tell him no. It&#39;d also explain the absolutely bonkers genre switches, beyond what Melon said about this just being every bad idea Feldman&#39;s ever had, which is likely also true."
@_owl_,2024-06-05T03:24:03Z,2024-06-05T03:24:03Z,1,I feel like if the album had a smell it wouldnâ€™t smell SO bad but it would smell musty
@MyoticTesseract,2024-06-04T20:58:02Z,2024-06-04T20:58:02Z,1,one of my favorite things that fantano gets hung up on is the fact that the skits are trying to do both charlie&#39;s angels and batman at the same time<br>it&#39;s such an inane criticism yet against even more inane music<br>corey truly boggled this man&#39;s mind
@rhyses_,2024-06-04T16:34:51Z,2024-06-04T16:34:51Z,1,could you imagine if bowie released this instead of blackstar
@KenCriswell,2024-05-31T15:51:33Z,2024-05-31T15:51:33Z,1,"I just can&#39;t laugh at Corey. I mean especially after knowing what Corey said about his music. He knows he doesn&#39;t have a good voice. It&#39;s just dun for him. What I find WAAAAAY MORE pathetic, are the people that will just make videos just to mk fun of Corey. Now thats pathetic and sad.    Gotta respect Corey also for not caring what idiots say. He&#39;s having fun and that&#39;s all that matters to him.  If you had gone through even some of the shit he went through as a kid....most would&#39;ve already checked out of this life long ago. <br>I just can&#39;t make fun of a person that does something cause they enjoy doing it. Especially when they know they aren&#39;t really that good. So to mk fun of a guy for being bad even after he told you its not that good......is pretty shitty and says alot about that person&#39;s character.  Its all unfortunate...."

@nickmitchell1147,2024-05-26T04:24:29Z,2024-05-26T04:24:29Z,4,I didn&#39;t realize they released the Amazing Spider-Man 2 soundtrack as an album.

@noneofmybusiness9895,2024-05-18T18:19:53Z,2024-05-18T18:19:53Z,2,Each of his songs sounds like there&#39;s 3 people in the same room listening to three different songs at the same time.  Each of these songs are different genres and are playing at different beats/time signatures.  It sounds like a mess and it&#39;s exhausting to listen to.  I&#39;d imagine you have to have a considerable amount of molly onboard to think this noise sounds like music.

A pretty dull day has been replaced with this comedy gold review of the worst music known to man. Thank you...got to watch again for your laugh...superb...deffo an album to send to someone you really do not like.
@redcomet_622,2024-05-12T09:10:21Z,2024-05-12T09:11:00Z,1,I listened to this album fully yesterday and there&#39;s some stuff that Anthony should&#39;ve mentioned here. Mainly how most of the songs go into completely different directions like &quot;Break Free&quot; suddenly turns into a metal song. &quot;Mercy&quot; goes from a slow jam to a church choir song.

It&#39;s so bad that I think the actual musicians that are doing guest spots on the album would otherwise sound ok themselves.  They all sound so bad I&#39;m thinking that they must be doing it on purpose. As a spoof album it&#39;s actually succeeding.  That&#39;s the only way my brain can make sense of it. It&#39;s impossible that no one around him during the production of this album would say &quot;hey dude.... this is revolting music.

@southernborn1358,2024-02-15T20:23:46Z,2024-02-15T20:37:34Z,2,"Corey Feldman actually said, on video, that he was <b>exactly</b> like Michael Jackson in every way.<br>This album is a hot-mess tragedy. How many music styles can he mix in one song?<br>Corey, I beg of you -pick a key, any key. Pick a note, ANY note that is not ridiculously high or flat. Orâ€¦find a note period. Omg."
@roger542s,2024-02-14T20:36:45Z,2024-02-14T20:36:45Z,1,This literally sounds like he tried to replicate plastic beach without any of the charisma and musical talent that gorillas hasðŸ˜­

@Kut0x,2024-02-08T12:06:12Z,2024-02-08T12:06:12Z,0,Oh how I&#39;ve missed this video. Now it&#39;s going to be my obsession again for the next few weeks
@adamdunbar8260,2024-02-05T21:22:38Z,2024-02-05T21:22:38Z,1,I played &quot;Duh&quot; in my care and had 200 dogs chase me down the street.

@RAVIN_SEOIN,2024-02-02T14:05:36Z,2024-02-02T14:05:36Z,0,Horrible doesn&#39;t even cover this and the fact is if he was serious he could afford vocal training and retain a vocal coach he could have a real producer actually engineer his tracks and after 30 years of him trying he still doesn&#39;t do any of it sad really
@michelleetienne7115,2024-02-02T05:02:09Z,2024-02-02T05:02:09Z,0,"I mean seriously????  It is a &quot;bit&quot; my man. It&#39;s a parody.......kinda like spinal tap remember?  He is literally on tour with various artists. He is very aware of the fact that he is neither a musician or singer. He can&#39;t get jobs doing his craft in Hollywood so he got creative and reinvented himself and got a publicist and started touring around. He doesn&#39;t get a lot of gigs on his own bill but has been touring and opening up with larger headliners and hence playing to a larger crowd. But I guess if you&#39;re not in the know.....I can see how crazy this would seem!  Lol. Sorry ya did a whole post without being hip to what he&#39;s actually doing. He&quot;s gotta make a living, ya know. I think you should do another post, if not, to redeem yourself, maybe a little promotion to encourage people to go to his show. Cuz he isn&#39;t going to do it. It is the &quot;schtick&quot;  Ooooh, unless that is....he paid you to do a bad review on him and cut him down to further add to the authenticity!  If that&#39;s the case.....hilarious!"
