I personally think that &quot;Hood Hottest Princess&quot; by Sexyy Red is an auditory exploration that challenges the boundaries of conventional trap rap, ascending into an ethereal plane where raw street narratives intertwine with the transcendental. This album, much like a transcendental journey through higher dimensions of consciousness, unveils the layers of the human psyche through a mosaic of bass-heavy beats and lyrical introspection. Sexyy Red, with her unabashed authenticity, invites listeners into a realm where the grittiness of urban life is not merely depicted but exalted into an art form that speaks to the very essence of existence.<br><br>From the opening track, the listener is catapulted into an altered state of awareness, where the pulsating rhythms serve as the heartbeat of this newfound dimension. Each track is meticulously crafted to resonate on a frequency that transcends the mundane, much like the experience of unlocking a new chakra. Sexyy Red&#39;s verses, replete with streetwise wisdom and unfiltered candor, act as a guide through this metaphysical journey. Her flow, at once relentless and hypnotic, mirrors the oscillations of a mind expanding beyond its terrestrial confines, engaging in a dialogue with the infinite.<br><br>In &quot;Hood Hottest Princess,&quot; Sexyy Red does not merely create music; she orchestrates an experiential passage into the depths of the self and the heights of cosmic awareness. This album stands as a testament to the power of trap rap to elevate consciousness, transforming the listener&#39;s perception of reality through the alchemical fusion of sound and spirit. It is an opus that defies the temporal, inviting an immersion into the sublime, where the listener emerges not just entertained but enlightened, having glimpsed the infinite through the prism of Sexyy Red&#39;s artistic vision.<br><br>These are my personal thoughts. I&#39;d give it a strong 5 to light 6/10.",

Nasty to the point where she doesn&#39;t completely line up with a lot of the hypersexual lady rappers that has gotten popular during the last few years. Cause a lot of what Sexyy Red is saying on her tracks isn&#39;t nessecarily aluring or flattering or said to appeal to men. It&#39;s more like an admission of what she wants, how bad she wants it, and how she&#39;ll go to get it.&quot;<br>this is why people (this comment section <b>wink wink</b> / cis men) hates her so much.. it makes them uncomfortable.",
