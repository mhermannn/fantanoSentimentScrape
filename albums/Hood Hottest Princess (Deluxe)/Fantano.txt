meow hi everyone Wolf the meow Tano here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of this new Deluxe espand Expanded Edition of sexy Reds Hood hottest princess Missouri rapper sexy red it is not news that over the past 5 years the ratio of women to men hitting it big in hip-hop has kind of been flipped on its head the days of a single Lil Kim or Nikki Minaj uh dominating for female rappers in the mainstream for like an entire decade are over you could even say now we're reaching a point of saturation where a lot of new lady upand comers in hip-hop are just kind of copying what artists who have been on the leaderboard for a minute have been doing your cardi BS your Megan the stallions but even through all that noise there have been some significant commercial breakthroughs ice spice probably being the biggest of them but if there's a second major success story story to come out of 2023 for women in rap it is most definitely sexy red who's been on an absolutely Unstoppable run of viral singles where she seems to strike gold like every time whether it's the vulgar and ridiculous pound town or a ski and infectious call and response Anthem but there's actually more to sexy red than just a few fluke singles cuz in a lot of ways she's kind of the total package which I know sounds ridiculous to your average rap snob who would most likely take one look at her bars and just scoff cuz yeah she's no lyrical Miracle but personally I'll take style attitude sense of humor song structure and some really good hooks over a technical spitter any day and sexy red has all that and doesn't go a single song in this now 22 track Project without at least an attempt at a banger chorus furthermore a lot of what's here is kind of proof of how Simplicity Reigns Supreme when it comes to a lot of these Southern hip-hop and trap sounds and that a loud and bold personality goes a long way with this type of stuff with her almost squawky and instantly recognizable voice which definitely makes her stand out but she's somebody who wears her influences on her sleeve in a creative way too there are big gang stoo and 36 mafia Vibes coming off of some of these tracks but I think a lot of her clearest connections come by way of prime AOW Waka Flaka flame as well as Gucci Man I mean the closing track to the standard version of hottest princess is literally female Gucci man and because of that in a way sexy red serves as a reminder of a time when trap music wasn't quite as clean or commercial or popc Centric I mean the sound of the most popular artists in this genre has changed significantly over the past 10 years and again in a way sexy red goes against that grain and she knows it especially with bars like my name sexy red I ain't no singing ass cuz yeah it's actually a breath of fresh air to have somebody like her coming onto the scene and do it in a way that feels so raw and aggressive and frankly nasty nasty to the point where she doesn't completely line up with a lot of the hypersexual lady rappers that have gotten popular over the last several years cuz a lot of what sexy red says on her tracks isn't necessarily alluring or flattering or uh said to appeal to men it's more like an admission of what she wants how bad she wants it and how far she'll go to get it and she digs deep into her hedonistic uh vices here to the point where it can be concerning but at the same time she goes into it with so much confidence and authenticity it's hard not to admire her energy it's not that sexy red has absolutely no shame it's that she can't be shamed by any other person or people and however they may perceive or judge her this is like a source of power for sexy red and she knows it as a lot of people might look at someone like her and think oh I can fix her I can save her which is exactly where songs like I don't want to be saved come from where sexy spits in the face of that not just with brutally toxic bars about her doing whatever she wants to do but she also brings a very Snappy Melody on the take Keith beat as well the track sexy please hits pretty hard and proves that the anti love trunk knockers are some of the best and most addictive songs on this entire project and look these two tracks are only a few of many on this Expanded Edition of the go hard as hell because I actually wasn't expecting that much from these additional 11 Cuts here because considering how popular sexy red has gotten over the past year uh she could have easily put out a deluxe that just kind of hands over a dozen or so unorganized lame ass freestyles that last barely 90 seconds or so and you know just could have cashed in on that but sexy red didn't do do that she actually put out 11 more songs that can go toe-to-toe with any material off of the original hottest princess whether it's tracks like bow ba baow and hold on ya where she's really bringing it back to that 2011 Waka Flocka Flame energy that aggression but doing it now with more sex appeal and uh hilarious topics like her baby daddy blocking her there's even a bit of Chicago drill energy coming through on the track uh shake your dreads of course because of that it's it's no surprise that we have a raw ass Chief key feature on this project as well on the song Ghetto Princess which is very syy and lyrically scathing with bars like ho hating on me you know I'm the my brother already told me that smell like fish you thought you had some tea on me whole time you drinking piss sexy red the chosen one I'm turned up I'm it and somehow from here the lyricism and the energy gets even more on hinged like on the track of free my guy which kicks off not only with um a child saying free data on the track but yeah it's all about uh you know her man getting out of prison how excited she is to see him get the dick Raise Hell uh saying stuff like that's my baby hell yeah we in love first day home let him shoot up the club there's also the uh closing track on the deluxe edition that uh uh features Suki possibly the only rapper out there today that could really uh match sexy Red's unhinged and runchy energy if it's not going to be cupcake it's going to be sukiana who of course is coming to this track with bars about sucking off Joe Biden and uh being so wet she needs a panty liner clearly sexy red and sukiana have some real creative chemistry going for them to uh come back collabing again after born by the river and uh somehow go even harder I I I didn't think it would get crazier uh than gave me money for abortion I ain't having his kids but they did it there is actually some versatility to this deluxe edition of the project 2 we have the very soft R&B Centric I might with Summer Walker where sexy red actually kind of takes to something uh more subtle and intimate somewhat well was for sure smart of her to get Summer Walker in the mix on this one as I think uh they have uh pretty cohesive energies there's also the slow burner intro on this record which uh instrumentally brings some Eerie sents to the table as well as these kind of uh freaky almost operatic Coral bits hanging in the background making a sexy red song Sound way more epic than it has any right to and of course this deluxe edition gives us good reason to go back to a lot of those tracks from the original uh edition of hottest princess and uh just kind of hear once again what made that first 11 Track run run hit so hard like with hellcats srts which sure the production the recording on this one might be a bit scuffed but uh sexy's personality comes through very boldly and hilariously on bars like uh put the bends in sport mode I ain't no regular hoe uh I don't do insurance for my whips this ain't Geico there's also looking for the hose which uh is handily one of the catchiest tracks in this first 11 song Run there's the style and confidence and endless Flex that are just coming out rapid fire on Sexy Walk there's nachos which is a hilarious turn of phrase essentially saying like you know nachos nacho nacho where we have lyrical highlights such as sexy red uh saying that her hits like Will Smith there's also mad at me which is a huge freak Anthem all about having sex while angry getting that aggression out that way and just being a completely unrepentant again freak and uh yeah you know I I got to say I got to admit I got to be straightforward and say that uh I'm loving this project and while I was astounded and stupified uh to some degree when I first caught wind of sexy red and uh you know saw some of those bars that were going viral off the bat you know coochie pink booty hole Brown so on and so forth I I am now very much a sexy red believer as this is some of the most raw ridiculous over-the-top unhinged an out of control rap and trap that you are going to hear this year that was the case for the original version of this project and all sexy red did with this Deluxe is like literally double the fun double the helping just intensify it bring better production bring funnier bars more Antics more chaos more toxicity more personality and I can only hope that she finds a way to Leap Frog what she's done here uh down the road when she drops more stuff I'm feeling a decent too strong eight on this TR position have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you
