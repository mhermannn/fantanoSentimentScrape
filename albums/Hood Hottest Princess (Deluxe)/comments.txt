How is this rated higher than Gore and Koi No Yokan from Deftones??<br>??????<br>??
I don&#39;t know... I personally think that &quot;Hood Hottest Princess&quot; by Sexyy Red is an auditory exploration that challenges the boundaries of conventional trap rap, ascending into an ethereal plane where raw street narratives intertwine with the transcendental. This album, much like a transcendental journey through higher dimensions of consciousness, unveils the layers of the human psyche through a mosaic of bass-heavy beats and lyrical introspection. Sexyy Red, with her unabashed authenticity, invites listeners into a realm where the grittiness of urban life is not merely depicted but exalted into an art form that speaks to the very essence of existence.<br><br>From the opening track, the listener is catapulted into an altered state of awareness, where the pulsating rhythms serve as the heartbeat of this newfound dimension. Each track is meticulously crafted to resonate on a frequency that transcends the mundane, much like the experience of unlocking a new chakra. Sexyy Red&#39;s verses, replete with streetwise wisdom and unfiltered candor, act as a guide through this metaphysical journey. Her flow, at once relentless and hypnotic, mirrors the oscillations of a mind expanding beyond its terrestrial confines, engaging in a dialogue with the infinite.<br><br>In &quot;Hood Hottest Princess,&quot; Sexyy Red does not merely create music; she orchestrates an experiential passage into the depths of the self and the heights of cosmic awareness. This album stands as a testament to the power of trap rap to elevate consciousness, transforming the listener&#39;s perception of reality through the alchemical fusion of sound and spirit. It is an opus that defies the temporal, inviting an immersion into the sublime, where the listener emerges not just entertained but enlightened, having glimpsed the infinite through the prism of Sexyy Red&#39;s artistic vision.<br><br>These are my personal thoughts. I&#39;d give it a strong 5 to light 6/10.
this comment section reeks
Fantano trying to hit 💀
I still dont get it
We losing all credibility with this one 🗣️🗣️☝️
Just for reference wolf got a 6 💀
I feel like people arent understanding that this review is for what it is as dumb as that sounds like obviously compared to mbdtf this isnt good but this and mbdtf arent compareable like there is alot more to expect from ye not so much here so for what it is its decent.
You not going to hit bro she not giving u sum
If the album was called &quot;Speeding Bullet 2 The Hottest Princess&quot; you would&#39;ve gave it a 0.
How in the actual Fuck is this album better than DAMN.
Never understood why he was so hated. Now I know. She not letting u get any bro
Dude just say that you have a thing for black girls
Sexxy Redd isn’t the “unrepentant freak” YOU ARE my brotha… you are
This dude is a joke
We need more white men like him on this planet
just for reference, blonde got an 8
Please use nair as shampoo next time
Giving this an 8 but giving actual music 6’s is crazy ain’t no way you weren’t paid off
Didn’t he give Igor the same rating 💀
How many dislikes y’all? Don’t have the extension
Saviors a 3 btw
Never forget this album ranked higher than EVERY EARL SWEATSHIRT ALBUM, MBDTF, and DAMN.
I remember when everyone was pissed at Anthony for giving Lil Boat a 7. After all this time i still never understood it because Lil Boat is fun and good. I completely understand people thinking this review is trash because this album sucks ass 💀
Just a reminder that this album is supposedly only just a <b>bit</b> worse than GKMC.
4/10
&quot;i find it really funny how often people will say review scores &quot;don&#39;t matter&quot; or are &quot;just a number&quot; when something they like gets scored low, but when something they don&#39;t like gets scored high it&#39;s suddenly a matter of life or death&quot;
your out of your mind
he wants it bad
Remember he gave Lil Wayne’s the Carter 4 a 3-10
Just say you want hook up with her, and say that is why you gave her a high rating and to be honest I would give it a high rating for being so trash the art cover looks like trash
this HAS to be rage bait
Man, delete your account at this point
definitely stupefied
5 months later and this guy has been vindicated. She has staying power.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN1d3HWOd54&amp;t=150">2:30</a> &quot;(...) Sexyy Red serves as reminder of a time when trap music wasn&#39;t as clean or commercial or pop-centric. I mean, the sound of the most popular artists in this genre has changed significantly over the past ten years. And again, Sexyy Red goes against that grain, and she knows it. Especially with bars like &quot;My name Sexyy Red, I ain&#39;t no singin&#39;-ass bitch&quot;. Cause yeah, it&#39;s actually a breath of fresh air to have somebody like her coming out on the scene and doing it a way that feels so raw, aggressive, and frankly nasty. Nasty to the point where she doesn&#39;t completely line up with a lot of the hypersexual lady rappers that has gotten popular during the last few years. Cause a lot of what Sexyy Red is saying on her tracks isn&#39;t nessecarily aluring or flattering or said to appeal to men. It&#39;s more like an admission of what she wants, how bad she wants it, and how she&#39;ll go to get it.&quot;<br>this is why people (this comment section <b>wink wink</b> / cis men) hates her so much.. it makes them uncomfortable.
I wanna die now cuz of this
if it was called &quot;my beauriful dark hood hottest princess&quot; you would have gave it a 6.
Badthony Thotano on his bad b arc
Worst video of all time
the fact that hes literally right lmfao
This guy is delusional
All of yall hating and he ate 😘
When u realise this got more than astroworld mbdtf and mr morale and the big steppers
Ok so i listened to the album cause of this review. It&#39;s not bad. It&#39;s a 6.5 maybe 7 after multiple listens. 8 is wild.
We really live in a timeline where DAMN., Astroworld, MBDTF and J Cole&#39;s entire discog got a lesser score than this 💀🤡
They talk about misagony in the industry but then give a sexyy red album an strong 8 💀
Memes aside, isn’t it too naive to view melon as ‘an independent music reviewer on YouTube’? I mean, who financially supported you to promote this album in this way, which is even weirder when the album is basically an obvious industry-pushed bummer that would definitely go astray anyway? It’s genuinely so hard and questionable to defend its  value in the first place. I’m not even ranting in the ‘it’s fun music it’s bad’ kinda typical nerd sense, I just see Sexxy Red as an obvious bait when record executives when too far with their aggressive-as-hell mega viral marketing.
Never open your mouth about hip hop again
He heard sexxy let Adin Ross hit now he thinks he can slide in after this bullsh*t review 😂😂
Can you PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE review her new album she just released may 24th 2024 ; “In Sexxy We Trust” I feel like it’s worth looking into
Man thinks he gon get some
Let me say what you think about Flo Milli…I love Sexyy Red - the streets effin love her
if this was kendrick lamar&#39;s damn melon wouldve given it a 6
The Labels must be paying you to rated an 8. You took the bribe????
You gave it an 8????an8??? And 8????yet you disrespect Ab Souls album??????
Why are you surprised over here? He has been one of the worst if not the worst reviewer I’ve seen <br>Him giving this shi an 8 says it all
Maybe not today, maybe not this month, maybe not for years, but one eventually this review will be a stain on your career.
i wish i could hear what he hears
shes not letting you hit lil bro 😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣
Before this review, I thought that Melon was a harsh critic, but the albums he gives a good review are really good albums. I guess this is an outlier or, I don&#39;t get it.
they got melon, too
8/10 bro
I heard him seriously say on stream today “you guys don’t understand, sexy reds music is good because its bad on purpose and she is aware of it” I’m sorry Anthony I’m not watching you anymore
“Yes black goddess I will rate your album an 8. Please let me kiss your feet…”
How the hell does this shitty album have a better rating than damn
Le dio un 8 a este álbum y le dio un 6 a El Camino de The Black Keys 💀☠️
Melon, no way you put this over DAMN. 😭
This is better than DAMN and Mr. Morales and the Big Steppers?
This Is NOT better than MBDTF🗣🗣✋
He keeps using that word... &quot;Creative&quot;... I don&#39;t think he knows what that word means.
Shittony<br>Opinontano
Are you shitting me
Well. We all know Anthony&#39;s Fantono&#39;s type of woman 😂
Is this guy getting paid with their dirty panties 😂 what the fuck Anthony FFS
Finally a decent review
ushhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
You&#39;re delusional if you think this thing is any higher than a 3/10
Seriously melon wtf is this. No one takes you seriously anymore
Sexyy Red has no taste
All y’all hating but ain’t even listen to the album you just assuming it’s bad cause it’s a woman rapping about sexual shit while when men do it no one gives a fuck maybe put your sexism aside and listen to the fucking music objectively, yeah obviously it’s not a tpab level introspective genius piece of art but it’s a fun trap album with funny bars and original, fun beats
I enjoyed this album as a guilty pleasure when it first came out, much in the same way i enjoyed the lil pump debut and day69 mixtape from 6ix9ine when they first came out as guilty pleasures, but the fact that hes genuinely praising this shit is insane to me.
this album is garbage
bro she aint gonna let you tap😭😂
It can only go downhill ftom here considering what happened to lil pump
According to fantano, this is as good or better than anything joey badass, denzel curry, j cole, and asap rocky has put out. Thats quite the take there.
Love you, but this is just out of character melon
wtf rly
You know its sad when this is the only review you can find of this album anthony has to be the only person to think about this for more than 3 seconds
She ain&#39;t gonna take you back for rating this high
The beats go veryyyyyy hard
Great job Fantano, you never fail to impress me with the worst reviews of mankind
This has a higher rating than Astroworld,Damn and MBDF <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Let that sink
No mf way…he always gives doja 5 and megan thee stallion 6 but sexxy red and 8? This album is the worst album i have ever heard in my life fr it is soooo bad and sexxy red is even worse than ice spice
MBDTF got a 6 for this 😭
so this is as good as graduation? hell naw.
Interesting
The fact you gave this higher ratings than a bon iver album is absolute elephants foot 🦶
skeeyee am i right 😂🎉
U suck dig
I just listened to at least 4 songs from that album to see why he gave it an 8 and nahhhh Fantano has to be trolling.
Only time in history anyone ever gave sixxy red an 8
Sluthany slutano here internets horniest music nerd
Your best review i think…
aint no way this is better than utopia
Yo Tyler The Creator already did all this but 100 times better before her. With Goblin and he hates that album! What’s this guy talking about
I get it tbh
Fuck no.
We got 8’s for Yeat and Sexyy Red before GTA 6
Some albums Fantano has rated lower than this modern masterpiece:<br><br>J. Cole - Entire Discography<br>Vince Staples - Entire Discography<br>Kendrick Lamar - Damn<br>Kanye West - Yeezus, Watch the Throne, MBDTF, TLOP (OG)<br>Travis Scott - Astroworld, BITTSM, Utopia <br>Drake - Nothing Was The Same<br>Drake &amp; Future - What a Time to be Alive <br>Dr Dre - Compton <br>A$AP Rocky - Long Live A&amp;AP, At Long Last A$AP, Testing <br><br>This guy is cooked
How is it possible for melon man to be a completely reasonable grown adult man and have a comment section full of immature children? Like yall buggin fr.
This albums goofy
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN1d3HWOd54&amp;t=519">8:39</a><br>DAMN. lyrical highlight: FEAR. of losing LOYALTY. for PRIDE. because my DNA. won&#39;t let me evolve in the light of GOD. (7/10)<br><br>Hood hottest princess lyrical highlight: This pussy hittin&#39; somethin&#39; like Will Smith (8/10)
Never rate again
why.
The &quot;rating system&quot; is starting to feel a bit dated
this album has a higher score than The Seer (2012)
This is the guy whose always tryna save some 304
So ur saying this is better than mbdtf
I couldn&#39;t think of a more numale thing to say
Damn. Bro rated this higher than “Might Delete Later.” I Could never take his opinion serious
I CANT KEEP DEFENDING THIS GUY MAN
lmao
I just don’t get this weirdo, I really really don’t, he can elaborate details on a song better than I can but his taste and what he’s looking for is ridiculous, it’s barely even fun, most of it is annoying and sounds cringey asf especially when you account for her targeted audience which of course he doesn’t care about. How do you rate this higher than DAMN like what? MBDTF is “overrated” but this isn’t? Wtf is this garbage?
The people angry at this review are forgetting to remove the fantano score bonuses (2 for being a woman and 1 for being black) so hes actually giving this album a 5 which is pretty reasonable
you can’t give this album a nine (basically) just because she came over to your house and had sex with you, melonthy.
I’m just gonna say I watched this without listening to the album cause I never planned to. And here I am months later, after get it sexy came out. I decided to go back and listen to the album and I’m like 3 songs in and it bangs.
…I’m not sure of his intentions but it isn’t the music it’s something else 🌝
guys i think he lost it
You think that this album is better than My beautiful dark twisted fantasy, DAMN, Man on the moon 2, Yeezus and that it&#39;s on the same level as Rodeo, Man on the moon 3 and Swimming?
So its better than Damn 😂
Yeah you lost me on here melon
After hours is definitely worse than this shit
I can’t believe it
Masonic humiliation ritual Anthony?
How he gave this more than Magdalene baffles me.
Next level satire, right? RIGHT?
Dude bypasses Ben Shapiro&#39;s &quot;facts&quot; but thinks Sexxy Red is the whole package
8 this guy dont understand about music
Gaythony Mantano
Based.
Can someone clear that with me? Is Fantano absolutely trolling or is he actually serious???
This album is well produced
Nah this is not real <br>Im dreaming
the divorce did things to melon
alright so anthony is a snow bunny
if this was called Hood hottest vultures 1 you would give it an unreviewable
He put this over utopia….
Bro gave this an 8 but carson and joey lower scores. All credibility is lost.
wow
Too many people out here talking like they understand what it is they’re talking about.
HELL NAW WHAT THE FUCK 💀💀💀
Better than iridescense is INSANE
AIN’T NO WAY THIS GOT A HIGHER RATING THAN AFTER HOURS😭
BRO SHE RAPS ABOUT HOW HER COOCHIE DOESNT SMELL
Can someone explain why this album is bad everyone in the comments says it’s bad. I haven’t listened to the album yet but based on what Anthony is saying it sounds great
He changed it to the 10. So this might be AOTY
I listen to the album and it was wack as hell
This man shits on people like j cole and travis scott for having corny and bad lyrics but gives this an exception!?
bro really sounds like a much
Listen, I love black women as much as the next guy. But this isn&#39;t how you get another black gf bro. She ain&#39;t going to have sex with you over a review.
Bro literally destroyed his &quot;reviewer career&quot; with this video
SEXXY RED FOR PRESIDENT!!!
Listening to this album made me physically sick.
Nah this man trolling us
How much you get paid?
Bro really said this is almost a 9, when DAMN. is just a 7
This dudes opinion is shot 😂
Sexy red dropped a better album than 1999 by Joey ig
She not gonna let you hit
Why do we give this man even an ounce of our attention??
This is why I can&#39;t take this guy seriously 🗑️
You lost me
Nah my boy got to be trolling
bro is in love
If it was called My Hood Hottest Princess Fantasy, he&#39;d give it a 6
What the fuck are you smoking Anthony
So she dropped an album on the same level as covering book? wow!
Bro gave this an 8 😂😂 what a clown
Bro can not rate no more after this
Guys this was just a very early April fools joke right! right? right? 😅 😅😅😅
No
Fantano is a 🤡
pussy hits like will smith is wiiiiiild
This mf gave Awaken, My Love! a light 7
Fantano is glazing!!!😂😂😂
compare this to Eminem’s revival review.
So wheeler walker would be a 8
Can’t take him seriously
This man placed this crap higher than MBDTF
Then he skips carti lmao this guy is a actual clown thinking sexy redd’s bars are good😭😭
Thats actually crazy this video genuinely ruined ur entire reputation and validity as a critic 😭😭 what a fucking unsufferable excuse of a man
this man gave vultures an unreviewable/10 btw 💀💀💀
Is…is he serious or is he being sarcastic? Someone help me out here because I can’t tell 🤨
I basically disagree with about everything Fantano reviews.
This man has absolutely no credibility and you can clearly see that with this review. Fantano has ulterior motives with these reviews because I know he’d shit on music like this on the regular. I can’t believe I used to watch this guy and appreciate his opinions. I’m such a fool.
Oh hell naw.
This comment section is obnoxious. Good lord.
brainrot
What is he talking about
my flannel yellow, my bootyhole brown
What’s your mothers maiden name?
always knew sexyy red could make an album better than mbdtf, yeezus, die lit &amp; wlr keep it up queen
Anything picked one of the most grotesque and idiotic rap albums ever to virtue signal his love for blacks 😂
BETTER THAN UTOPIA????!!!! WTF
Delete this and save your credibility
Bruh that&#39;s even higher than Dawn Fm 🤦😐
The boys overreacting to this is hilarious! Some guys are way too serious- they don’t get it.
Shes disgusting,  she has No Talent whats so ever
Your the worst music critic just because of this
8?!!!!
the cia invented modern art
You can&#39;t be serious
😧
Wow! Just lost all credibility. How will anyone trust you now?
😮
Between this and him letting his emotions prevent him from doing a review on Kanye&#39;s Vulture album (which I honestly didn&#39;t care for) completely discredits him as a genuine reviewer.<br><br>This is not someone anyone should take seriously.
10k dislikes lmao
I&#39;ve been telling ya&#39;ll this mf is deranged.
anthony she aint givin u a chance 🤣🤣🤣
I’m dreaming right? 😂
This got an 8 meanwhile he gave die lit a 7<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>What a world we live in
Just say that you hate Kanye just because of his controversy that happened A YEAR AGO
Sorry but I’m with Anthony on this one. Sexxy red is fun and so is her music.
Here after the Vultures 1 &quot;Review&quot;
This is a review I&#39;d expect from a male feminist.
Not only an 8, a strong 8 meaning nearly a 9/10 to him lmao
You&#39;re a industry plant buddy
hood hottest princess is better than MBDTF guys
Bro you can’t just give points based on being a female. This shit is ass
Clown
tony&#39;s an industry plant. gtfoutta here
NEVER LET THIS MAN EVER COOK AGAIN
Bro ur braindead
You know nothing about music 😭😭😭😭😭
She ain’t gonna sleep with ya bro
This just proves that reviewing is just yapping with a score at the end
I lost brain cells watching this
Are you restarted
Ain’t no way he gave Kanye unreviewable but gave this an 8
ur bald
🤡🤡🎪🎪
Is this real?
if it was called To pimp a hood princess he would rate it a 10
If this was called &quot;My Beautiful Hood Hottest Princess Fantasy&quot; you would&#39;ve given it a 2/10
Lost his wife now he gawking at a chance with Sexy Redd. 😔
The album sounds like someone from a high school made it, like she&#39;s not even on beat
Consider this rating a stain on your legacy and credibility
“The hoes gonna love this one”
bro said a random ass sexy red album is better that MBDTF by 20%
strong 8 for sexyy red but a light 7 for Beabadoobee???? you&#39;re smoking something.
she aint goin let you hit lil bro 😭😭😭
Fantano is a joke lmao this shit is a 0/10 actual cornball
LL LL LL L
This guy needs to relax. Sexy redd is shit
LLLL
L L
L
L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L
This at 8 but you wont review vultures?
He’s glazing so hard 😂
Is this guy serious?
No wonder his wife left him.
i think u should go test out the new rope in  home depot u cancer having fuck bro nis oy sexy red 8 ah lop ah ngorb
Bro gotta be a creep ain’t no way 😭
hes saying this is as good as rodeo
Fantano gone woke. Giving me the ick!
Apparently this is better than Utopia🤷
she aint gonna peg you lil baldie
What the fuck is this shit?
just so yall are aware, he rated j coles album (2014 drive) a 6/10 and  said that &quot;some of the lines are corny&quot;.
How the fuck does anyone care about this guy&#39;s opinion. WTF?
She ain&#39;t lettin you hit lil bro😭
Vultures.
This dude gonna tell his kids to turn off &quot;Devil in a new dress&quot; and play &quot;Pound town 2&quot;. 😂 Ridiculous engagement bait.
I’m never gonna eat melon again
From this review, I can tell that baldy is nothing but a virtue signalling soy boy. Vultures 1 ain’t like Donda or TLOP but it’s definitely 100x better than this Sexyy Red
yea after seeing this and the vultures review, i think ive completely lost respect for this guy
This is better than Kanye according to this clown 😂
Anyone have some recommendations for good music reviewers?
aye aye aye aye that’s that booty me
this guy is a joke now, unsubscribe
He’s gone insane. This is insane. This is trash rap. The epitome of garbage music. Like wtf man. If a dude just rapped about his chicken color it would be a 2 she female lil pump
You&#39;re a joke
You&#39;re a fking joke, hahahahaha🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
saying this is an 8 and vultures 1 was trash idk is kinda makin me doubt ur taste in music
this album is retarded
I tried to give this bloated mess of an album a chance, but my god is it hard to listen through. Nothing of substance on here and the beat selection is all over the place and mostly wack. This is such a puzzling review and I have basically just conceded that Fantano is physically attracted to Sexy Red and that brought her score up by like 4 points. Crazy stuff
L
So you saying that scum fucc flower boy is in the same level as this?
ok how much were you paid by her handlers to come up with this nonsense rating ? good promo operation 10/10 some people think you mean that shit
She&#39;s not gonna let you hit, Melon
bro ranked this higher than currents
The melon jokes hit bro so hard his brain was actually replaced by one 😭
She ain&#39;t gon let you hit, divorced melon 😭😭
He rated rodeo the same as this what the hell
so this is better than graduation
You got to be kidding me...
She ain’t gonna let you hit melon
I am convinced he’s an experiment
He&#39;s not serious, right?
Damn this is like the &quot;blue&gt;pinkerton&quot; video but for rap
Why are people still mad
You gave the new Metallica album a 4 and Sexyy Red a strong 8. You have to be trolling. Unsubscribed.
I seen him low ball note worthy albums so im not surprised he&#39;d rate this the way he did 😂
He gets it ❤
This the guy that rayes long live asap a5
Skee yee sounds just like female Kodak to me
Why would anyone take you serious after this?
Come on, Anthony, this is music for 6 year olds.
Saucey Santana the goat! 🔥🔥🗣️🗣️
Ain&#39;t no way this is as good as rodeo😢. How does rodeo and this album both get 8
Bro trying to get a second black wife
MBDTF sitting in the corner FUMING
I&#39;d like to imagine this rating a joke
He gave Mac’s swimming a 3 and gave this an 8…<br><br>I’m sad that ur engagement farming now
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN1d3HWOd54&amp;t=80">1:20</a> “Average Rap Snob” here, rappers don’t play instruments, they rely on their writing to justify being an “artist”. Ignorant fans accepting rappers who can’t rap, has ruined the art form.
Crazy. 💀💀💀
Hell yeah, totally not engagement bait! Heres the additional comment that ur so desperately looking for!
This is engagement farming.
I don&#39;t even like MBDTF but that shit is way better than this
HOW DID YOU GIVE THIS AN 8 AND COREY FELDMAN&#39;S ANGELIC 2 THE CORE A NOT GOOD???!!!  WHAT THE FUCK??????!!!!!!
This is why internet critcs should not be taken seriously.
Is he trolling
this has to be a fantasy punishment
My bootyhole brown my coochie pink is definitely a lyric, along with “that’s that booty meat” are definitely bars ig
Ain’t no way this is better than MBDTF
Great review, but I think you forgot to put your wife&#39;s OF link in the description
this album is better than mbdtf according to melon
He gave rodeo the same score and gave mbdtf 2 points less
This got higher than The Seer - Swans
wdym this album is actual mouth cancer
Why the hell did he rate it higher than Circles 😭
This was rated higher than Astroworld that’s insane 💀
Bro I skimmed thru this album and it SUCKS!!! I tried to keep an open mind but this is TRASH!! Ur cool fantano but oftentimes u just rate albums a certain why to clout chase
i do have to say. Bow bow bow had me dying laughing. it is so absurdly sexual that i find it hilarious and actually enjoyable. i havent heard such an over the top asburd album in a while, i fuck with it for that. Ill listen to this shit any day of the week over some other female rappers these days because of its self awareness.
The album hits hard, but that moving picture of SR on Spotify, just like idk, it fucking weirds me out.
illuminatti got em
This actually has to be satire at this point.
I listened to the album.<br><br>I didnt like it. Gonna try it again to see if my opinion sways.
i know he’s said he doesn’t rate based on other artists, but to think that this project has a higher rating than MBDTF is WILD
U gotta be fucking kidding me
what the actual fuck
You put this over mbdtf; and all j cole albums? What the fuck fannytano
Terrible mucus
She is not letting you hit bro 😭🙏
This is the music review equivalent of giving Macklemore a Grammy over Kendrick Lamar’s Good Kid M.A.A.D. City.
You’re not fooling anyone and your desperation to seperate from the crowd you garnered is showing. <br><br>“There’s not a song where she doesn’t try to give a punchy hook”<br><br>Is that how low the bar is
Just unsubscribed…
After listening to the album, I definitely think Sexyy Red is getting more hate than warranted. She&#39;s definitely not a mumble rapper. As well, she has quite a few memorable bars and hooks. She ain&#39;t talented artistically, but definitely has a strong, unique personality. She definitely deserves credit for getting the right beats from the right producers, especially Sexyy Please, Shake yo Dreads, Hellcats SRT, Female Gucci Mane.<br>For all those who are clowning her for being hyper-sexual, just remember all the male rappers basically do the same thing, especially NLE Choppa and 21 Savage. I&#39;m just glad she&#39;s an authentic thot and not a plant. She looks like a guest on Maury. <br>She needs a 21 Savage collab soon the way she shows love to Haitians. <br>An 8/10 is wild because that&#39;s what he gave Renaissance by Beyonce. A 7/10 is more reasonable since this album is unique and culturally impactful.
If it was called &quot;A Great Princess&quot; it would&#39;ve gotten a decent 3
who is this guy 😭
dude this album is filth
I’ve been beating my meat 90% more after finding this album
Most level headed liberal opinion
Queen❤
Sexyy Red x Crime Mob mash up..
Ain’t no way boi 😭😭😭
Thought Die Lit was undeserving of an 8, until this happened.
I genuinely can&#39;t believe it
completely valid review
White guilt in its finest...woot woot
lysy dziadzie ogarnij sie
Wack wack wack
I didn’t think you were out of touch, but now I really know.
WHO DOES HE THINK HE IS
Thank you for officially killing hip hop Fantano we’re gonna have nothing but only fans whores making music now
All my years of watching your videos feel like a literal waste now. How do you put this above Joey badass pouya and lil peep. The garbage you can consume while walking over true art is mind-blowing.
how the hell did you rank this higher than a great chaos
THERE IS NO FUCKING WAY YOU GAVE THIS AN 8 AND AFTER HOURS A 7. AND GAVE NF A 3?????????
This is some PLANT shit
How can you quote these lyrics and think there even half decent?? Ripping people for corny lyrics and you rate this?? I think im in shock haha.
But for real though guys, his commentary sounds 100% like a paid off review 😂
Sexyy red is the Carly Rae jepsen to Fantono 😂😂
I&#39;m out of words.
It must suck to be a  music critic who critiques modern music
The lyric &quot;my coochie pink, my bootyhole brown&quot; takes on an even deeper, revolutionary meaning when analyzed through the lens of societal critique and solidarity. Beyond the initial explicit interpretation, this lyric becomes a profound reflection on societal injustices and a rallying cry for change.<br><br>The choice of words reveals a revolutionary narrative. The &quot;coochie pink&quot; can be interpreted metaphorically as a symbol of divine support and resilience in the face of adversity, emphasizing that irrespective of gender, individuals stand united with the backing of a higher power. This nuanced perspective challenges traditional norms and asserts a broader, inclusive form of resistance.<br><br>On the other hand, the &quot;bootyhole brown&quot; assumes a revolutionary stance, symbolizing the rejection of gluttony and the disdain for the excesses of the privileged class. In this context, brown transcends its mere color symbolism and becomes a powerful statement against the economic disparities that fuel societal inequality. It embodies a rejection of the opulence associated with wealth, signaling a call to address systemic issues that perpetuate poverty.<br><br>Moreover, the brown as a symbol for the Black Lives Matter movement adds an additional layer of significance. By aligning with this movement, the lyric underscores solidarity with the fight against racial injustice, making a powerful statement against systemic racism. It intertwines the struggles of those navigating impoverished urban environments with the broader movement for racial equality, emphasizing the intersectionality of societal challenges.<br><br>In essence, the lyric transforms into a revolutionary anthem that challenges societal norms, critiques economic inequality, and aligns itself with movements advocating for justice and equality. It becomes a rallying point for individuals to stand united, irrespective of gender or background, against the structures that perpetuate poverty, discrimination, and systemic injustice.<br><br>This lyric, when examined with its revolutionary undertones, serves as a vehicle for societal transformation. It invites listeners to question the status quo, reject societal norms that perpetuate inequality, and actively participate in the collective struggle for a more just and equitable world. In this way, the artist transcends the boundaries of explicit language, transforming a seemingly provocative lyric into a profound and revolutionary call for societal change and unity.
Wtf is wrong with you
I wonder if anyone in the comments actually listened to the album…lol
Why did my comment get deleted?
The album did better than Nicki’s
Her delivery is obnoxious and the beats are repetitive
Y’all really got mad cause he liked an album.
Glad to know this album is better than travis scotts whole discography 😭
If this ain’t proof that the Melon is a paid shill, I don’t know what is
OMG... I&#39;m gonna spend all of 2024 thinking about what went wrong in the mind of Fantano, while he was making this review...
Im not joking at all when i say this album fucking sucks and anyone who likes it is a moron.
D&#39;fuck
Weird way to say SexxyRedd let you hit
its April fools, not December fools. get your dates right Fantano!
w take
Tf is going on
Fantano trying really hard to intellectualise a load of bullshit.
You gave this album 8 but gave  pink friday 2 a 4??? Thats just flat out the absolute right decision melon.
L take
&quot;you cried to my album and still gave it a 7?&quot;<br>-joey bada$$
This dude is a weirdo, his music reviews not valid over here
im crying
You lost all credibility with this one
it’s so crazy how people think that in order to have a “good abum”, it has to be filled with fake deep corniness, and not be about how enjoyable the music is, and how it sounds sonically.
And here’s where I let go of every using your review score as a goalpost of how good an album is.
I don&#39;t care how catchy it is. Her flow is basic and these superficial, unimaginative bars will be forgotten in no time
Ain&#39;t no way this is better than MBDTF
AI generated ass review 😂
No fucking way this is on par with Blond
This is what happens when an idealogue is more interested in what his own opinion implies rather  than the actual quality of the music. I can imagine Anthony pacing around his kitchen thinking of ways to make an unlistenable album sound &quot;deeply compelling&quot;. He looks in the mirror and says , &quot;i am the voice for ratchet ass hood hoes. I will prove to the world the dumpster fire that is Sexyy Red is actual a musical genius. Black people love me!!&quot;. Absolute clown.
am very disappointed in you sir!!
He gave MBDTF a 6.
I knew you were biased, now I think you are bought.
I was not going to listen to this album but after watching this review in its entirety I decided to do so. And it’s ok it’s not the worst thing ever it’s far better than a lil pump album (not that hard to beat tbh) I would personally rate it a light 4. It’s ok at best but I can’t listen to a woman talk about how good her pussy is for 1h hour. I feel like the demographic for this albums is a drunk white girl twerking on her best friend and this music would just be playing in the background.
Are you high bro ??<br>I&#39;m dead serious 💀💀
If he hasn’t lost all credibility before (which he has) , he definitely has now. What drugs is he taking ?
three weeks later and yall still don&#39;t get the vision
It&#39;s scary this guy has a platform what a toolbag 😂😂
Shit better than utopia for sure 😂
This is the most biased feminist shit I’ve seen. How is this better than MBDTF or all of J Cole’s discography.
Nachos is fire.
Ngl during the first half of this album, I was just laughing at how bad it was but during the second half, I was like why tf am I enjoying this lol
HEADASS
&quot;Free.....My Guy&quot; ayo lol
so this is better than utopia, mbdtf and damn, this makes sense!
Worst take ever. What happened to you man?
The fact this album is a complete clone of an average chief keef album but woman version is actually funny he’s giving it an 8 begging it so hard for approval by the black community or something
I think the album could use more cowbell. That’s all
God forbid fantano like an album most people dont
Fantano giving us another reason to stop taking him seriously lol .. <br>this album was sounds like it was recorded by mistake
yea at this point he’s doing ts for engagement
Y’all are boring this album fucks
She not gon let you hit Tony
this guy a joke.
hilarious
When she said &quot;Shake that ass, bitch, hands on your knees (ho)<br>Hands on your knees (ho), hands on your knees (ow)&quot; ...I felt that
She ain’t gon let u hit lil bro😹😹😹
What kinda shrooms were you doing when you reviewed this because holy shit they may just cure my depression
I thought sexxy red might be satire, but you justififing it as art is the true satire 10 years ago you would hate you,  Me i think sexy red is one of the most funny things ive came across in several years lol
Better then any album in Travis Scott and drakes catalog is crazy excluding rodeo
This is better than pink Friday 2??
divorce hit bro like a truck he is so down bad bruuh
I’m kinda surprised that Fantano likes a trump supporter for once
I’m kinda surprised that Fantano likes a trump supporter for once
Been subbed for years but this was the nail in the coffin for me. Absolutely ridiculous
Clearly Fantano is more concerned with some weird version of virtue signaling than he is actual quality of music.
Fantastic review of an album that shocked me and energized me like no other this year.
crazy how this album is better the whole lotta red, utopi, yeezus, MBDTF
she aint gonna let you hit bro 💀
Fantano sucks at rating albums
So this garbage is 8 but Ultraviolance is bad… no man, get another job. 💩
Lol what?
i saw somewhere that he gave this album an i thought it was a joke…but here we are😭. Also im convinced atp he does some reviews the way he does just to piss us off lmaoo
Her aesthetic just doesn’t resonate with me at all… I respect your opinion though.
He did Yeezy dirty for this
Who fucking paid you and how much
Some of y’all lack basic understanding of art/music, you can have your opinion but at the end of the day music is 100% subjective.
SHE DONT WANT YOU BRO
This most be a bad joke LOL
@fantano This album quite frankly sets our community back 50 years and at the same time could be Album of The Year in pure entertainment and supreme hook execution. It’s like Project Pat tutored her on writing great rap hooks. If you don’t laugh during a listen or repeat the hooks out loud, in private 😂, then you simply arent listening or not really a music connoisseur cause her execution, while nasty and raunchy AF, is flawless. Jus sayin 🤷🏾‍♂️ The album is funny AF!!
this is his best review
Fantano going through black girl pussy withdrawal
Is this a troll
Its just his opinion
Hey dude. I gotta block your channel from appearing ever again. You’re fr a hater
If this isn’t a troll it’s actually embarrassing.
nah this some bullshit😭
She not gon fuck you lil bro
Anthony.. buddy.. you’re really losing me with this one
fanano overthinking this album more then sexyy red did
i love that he loves this
so happy for her, she already got an album better than all of j.cole&#39;s discography!
Melon is simping over her vro 💀💀💀
Bro ranked a SEXYY RED ALBUM higher than all of X’s albums, Astroworld, MBDTF, and almost as high as IGOR
SKEEE YEEE
She ain’t lettin you hit bro 🙏🤣🤣
A high fantano score is great cause then I know what not to listen to
I have one thing to say about this review are that is; werq
This guy is an industry plant and this video proves it
F
0/10 for me. Maybe a few good beats and thats it. And its not that I don&#39;t like fun music, I actually agree on the Lil Pump score but this album just sounds horrible to me. <br><br>And thats what people should do, just drop your rating/opinion and stop crying.
I need some of what you are smoking holy shit
I respect your opinion. No need to double back Anthony. The thing is that every single person commenting in disbelief has a guilty pleasure album no one would suspect them to enjoy. This is one of them for you. No shame in that, my guy.
Anthony you have officially lost your mind. This should not be better than MBDTF, Birds in the trap, Swimming, and many others you have gave a low score.
She was DEFINITELY giving him head under the table for him to give her a score that high
i agree
Melon got a huge bag
This album sounds shit!
Why don&#39;t you listen to the songs so we can get the vibe of what you like
🥸
This man gave Billy Woods&#39; Church a 5!
Simp
LLLLLLLL
Okay but Ken Carson is a 2/10 huh
I disagree with you so strongly watermelon
this is anthony shooting his shot at sexyy red
Anthony fantano is a hack. He says he doesnt get classical music. He is a NOOB.
im sorry but this album is trash
To Hood A Princess
I know I&#39;m late to this but I went to listen to this fully expecting to hate it and was shocked at how much fun I had. Immediately reminded me of the golden era of trap in the 2010s. She is raw as hell and crushes every beat on this record. That Summer Walker song shouldn&#39;t work but it does. Don&#39;t understand the hate man since half these bars wouldn&#39;t be out of place in a rap album by a dude. The Whisper Song exists yall and that was written by dudes. Stop being misogynists rap fans challenge: impossible.
I actually 100% agree with this review. Sexyy red is so so good. This project absolutely made me a fan. Sexyy red goes way harder than Meg the stallion, Ice spice, city girls and cardi b. If we’re being real she’s the toughest female rapper since nicki
Ok, so we don&#39;t suppose to take him seriously. Gotcha 👌🏿
😮
This rapper and album is trash. This review reminds me of that South Park episode scrotie mcboogerballs 😂
I loved it actually, people should learn to contexualize music  understand what it&#39;s going for and if not nailed it and with the wild out of control ,rebellious and humorous energy and personality this album has I feel it nails it . For me I&#39;d Rate it 4/5
Yeah. This Anthony Fantano video…<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>…it’s NOT GOOD! 💥
How many of you in the comments have actually listened to the album before disagreeing?
This album getting this high of a review makes it the best trap album of all time. Bruh.
Haha bruh fuck with sexxy red lol
Bro wanna tryna hit so bad 💀
Every single comment section on just about every single video is cancer. It&#39;s always half of y&#39;all are making the same tired ass &quot;jokes&quot; that have been made 500,000 times and then the other half are bitching about Melon&#39;s rating and how y&#39;all can&#39;t believe whatever is rated higher than MBDTF or x, y, z. Well believe it. Y&#39;all really gonna die mad about that Kanye album aren&#39;t you?! Sad. Smh. It&#39;s okay to disagree with Melon, but as he&#39;s stated numerous times, it&#39;s just his opinion. Let it go! I wish there was more actual discussion in here. But nope, just mostly a bunch of 🤡.
Don’t disagree with the review. But I have noticed that white hip hop fans tend to value humor &gt; bars. I think it’s why they love rappers like Lil Dicky, Eminem, Lonely Island, shit like that so much.
you are going crazy
Wtfffff
I asked myself whether this score was the result of you being evil or stupid, and have come to the conclusion it must be both
wtf? 8/10?!?
Bro is so desperate for brownie points it ain’t even funny anymore.
A strong 8? Yeah right. Fantano is definitely getting paid by labels to positively review trash.
Simptony Simptano
you&#39;ve got to be kidding me man
I know that I am 12 days late to this, but i have bad ADHD and I got caught up with other things. Now I can say for  myself that I liked 4 songs off of the album for how funny and absurd they were. Also, I know this is his opinion but I just don&#39;t get how this album got a 8! That means that this album is a better music experince then kendrick lamars damn, logics under pressure, and kayne west my beautiful dark twistes fantasy. I just don&#39;t see it. He hasn&#39;t even give megan the stallion a 8 and I feel like she puts out music that is similar to sexxy red&#39;s but better. Either way this has to be one of the most wild takes in his career and im glad it got such a Polarizing reaction. How did everybody else feel about this 🤔. Again sorry im so late 😅
Are you fucking serious
Brother, it’s not april 1st yet…
Sexy Redd should be one of the best rappers ever in his opinion
lol when Sexy Redd is death grips level
Damn he just lost all my trust😂
I feel sorry, nothing to find here😢
Lmao the &quot;purists&quot; aren&#39;t gonna like this review. (Fuck the purists)
It’s not possible in any universe that this album should be rated higher than Gunna’s album by a sort of a music expert. Huge L for melon here
This album is almost as good as To Be Kind. She made an album better than every J Cole and eminem album
No way
i agree anthony
With this logic he’s gotta review 6ix9ine again
This gotta be the best troll video Anthony has ever done
Sexy red won’t let you hit Fantano. Nice try tho.
This dude is just trolling for views at this point
ive been listening to sexyy for like 3 years never would i think i would like her album more than nickis
ive been listening to sexyy for like 3 years never would i think i would like her album more than nickis
its so inspiring to see that sexyy red made a better album than hitler wears hermes 8 side b, mbdtf, some rap songs, mmatbs, the life of pablo, pray for paris, wolf, hwh10, from king to a god, who made the sunshine, literally most griselda and westside gunn albums, blonde and just as good as rodeo.
you threw out bars grading sexxy red but included them judging travis
&quot;Nacho bitch&quot; is in no way a hilarious turn of phrase unless you unironically post wine- aunt minion memes
Bro speedin&#39; bullet 2 heaven deserves more respect than this thing 💀💀
I can&#39;t tell if he&#39;s being serious or if I&#39;m having a stroke.
Nav punching the air right now
PLAN B/10
she definently paid him to give it an 8
youre really telling me this was slightly better that call me if you get lost? i mean seriously?
Now this is man of taste, sometimes i doubt him a lot, this time is not one of those times
simp
i’m sorry what?!
I give her a strong 0
full of hell and nothing plz
So he like this but hates jid
Better than damn, utopia, mbdtf, astroworld, every opium album, every juice wrld album, every x album, every drake album, every j cole album, every carti album, and every lil baby album ❤ amazing review
Ok……even from the perspective of what she’s trying to do, lyrics aside. Her flows and the tone she delivers words with are obnoxious. The production is mind numbingly boring and repetitive. I don’t know what you can really see this album as anything more than dumb fun that’s not particularly interesting or appealing to the ears
He tryin a lil too hard to replace her last wife
He gave lil Wayne’s project a 3 a couple days ago btw. Wtf dawg.
Nav and drake rn:😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬
And Pink Friday 2 💀💀💀
MBDTF and this take are the 2 stains on this mans career, he ain&#39;t living it down 😭
I actually feel bad for nav now Ngl and now I know forsure he was hating on drake ngl LMAOAOAOAOA
Gotta love all the Male feminists out here pretending they like Sexyred😅
I love Sexyy. She doesn’t give af at all and is 100% her true self! Also Nicki’s verse on Pound Town was kinda her best verse this year! My favourite track on the album is Born by the River with Sukihana, Sexyy and Suki behind one of my favourite duos right now.
I swear nobody actually watched this review. They saw the yellow flannel, checked the description, saw 8/10, then got salty<br><br>Does anyone actually understand how Anthony rates albums? Because he isn&#39;t listening to an album like this expecting bars like he would if he&#39;s listening to a Cole album
Fantano, it’s been a good run but I think it’s time you called it quits
For all the criticism, I do actually feel this is on brand for Fantano. I do disagree with the score, but i get how HHP has the same kind of unapologetic attuite and over the top vibe of a &quot;Lil pump self titled&quot; or a &quot;Die lit&quot;.
It’s horrible music, what the hell you thinking?
I agree this album fucking smacks harder than most dudes putting shit out
8/10? AHAHAHAHAhell no.
so sexy redd better then MBDTF? dont ever let blud cook
Why anyone takes Fantano seriously is beyond me 😂
Anthony this won&#39;t make her hook up with you. <br><br>Actually, maybe it might.
So inspiring to see a comment section full of internalized misogyny rip a reviewer apart over a meaningless number rather than any of his actual opinions in the video.
she’s entertaining as hell, no matter how silly and ignorant it is
You’re a clown Anthony
i too think this album is better than ctrl by sza
Let me get this straight…Sexyy Red is rated higher than Nicki Minaj…😮
Man this album is something south park would make jokes of
Man thats The same vibes on Lil Peep mix whatevertape, i&#39;m high i dont remember The exact name
Looking at these bars in black and white, the more extreme and wild ones are kinda Viper-esque.
youre literally insane giving this a good rating..someone from a label is giving you maoey for this shit because if you actually like this degenerate form of music... youre insane
i knew there was something wrong w this guy bruh
He was paid by Sexyy Red&#39;s team to give her a higher score to drive controversy and make the album trend even more. Nothing new here.
YOU PUT THIS OVER MBSTF? MOTM2!?!? WTF IS THIS SHE GIVING FANTANO GOOD HEAD IG!!!
It’s authentic and creative. I didn’t expect to like it but it’s honestly good and reminds me of a lot of old trap music.
Guys we NEED to ban Steve
Great review my man👍🏾
I thought your viewers would have by now understood your review system. A Kendrick album getting a 7/10 is not the same as a Lil Yachty album getting a 7/10. Or whoever else.
If you all actually listened to her album it is full of bangers... Female Gucci Mane, Sexyy Please, and Ghetto Princess are good tracks
Man she has no flow, the mix and master are terrible, she can’t follow the beat, the lyrics are pointless, this is the album of the year
Higher rating that any Eminem album 🥲
OVER ASTRO??? OVER ASTROWORLD???? OVER BLONDE??? OVER MBDTF???? OVER EVERY UZI ALBUM??? ARE YOU OKAY????
imma be real meloman this rating was a hotter take than the suns surface temp. terrible i hate it.
You guys gotta remember his wife black 🤣
I knew this white guy wasn&#39;t the music guru everyone tought he was
I can’t believe internet man enjoys album I don’t enjoy. Him opinion not right opinion because not my opinion.
Anthony’s music taste is legitimately disgusting at times
What world am I in where this gets an 8 and Nicki got a 4!!
This is this decade’s MBDTF review
Look yall, her team is a genius. They’ve kept her name buzzing all year with antics and staying in the press. Now I’m sure they have him a nice bag to leave a positive review on this album. Labels do this all the time
yeah you’re buggin
He rated this album higher than pink Friday 2, y’all really take this man serious?
yooo will you be giving the new Fat White Family stuff a review atall?
Bro Anthony is tripping on this one
The beggar is a decent 7 and this a strong 8? He’s officially lost it 💀
Bro...no!!!
She’s super camp. Never fails to make me laugh and her songs so hard in the club
LANTHONY LANTANO
Fantano be aggressively single and horny on this review. Our man loves sexually aggressive black women.
how did you rate this higher than MMTBS
Bro wants to take part in her new upcoming sextape
Bullthony Shitano you a wild boy 😂
every time you spoke a bar I wheezed
Damn
seems like April fools came early!
Who?
This album sucks ass!
yooooo why is there such a big dislike ratio
If you look at the spots with more views you can see that most people didn&#39;t watch the actual review and just jacked off to fantano rating the album at the end. Yall incels are too predictable.
virgins in the comments
Yeah, this is better than Carrie and Lowell
Hahaha
he aint gonna let u hit lil bro
she’s not gunna let you hit Anthony 😭. This shit is not better than literally every album you’ve given a 5 and higher.
Oh hell nah☠️
fantano will give sexy redd praise for saying coochie pink booty hole brown but when kanye says sent this bih a pic of my dic on runaway apparently that makes runaway a mid song like wtf
I miss cupcakke
One of the worst takes of all time
This shirt…for sexy redd????? My Lawd
you reek for this one
wow, such a woke interview! proud of you anthony
Good luck explaining this to God.
Pathetic review
tonka?
Fantano you&#39;re a clown, absolute shill
Yr telling me Lemon……this is better then Scarlett???!!!!!
You should have your rap review privileges revoked. Stick to reviewing folk and Prog rock fantano.
Fantano  ate this review
white boys mad
Same rating as Thriller? …
I miss Gangsta Boo 🙏🏾✨
Nah you done
Fantano is just fishing for controversy by giving this an 8 no rational person is rating this so high
At this point I feel like melon just doesn’t want to criticize female rappers
😐
I ain&#39;t even got no jokes or memes, this is just genuinely sad to watch, Anothony has just completely lost his way and turned into a literal joke of a critic, legit sad asl
This is the most 10 sounding 8 I’ve ever heard
dudes ability to overcomplicate the most simple aspects of music and try to add meaning to stuff that has no deeper substance is insane
literally why doesnt anyone listen to this guy, literally has no taste and doesnt know how to just enjoy music
I was waiting for the &quot;JK&quot;. Now I&#39;ve unsubscribed.
It&#39;s crazy to me that this wasn&#39;t dropped on april 1st
You should have worn a red flannel for this
Ben Shapiro is gonna talk about this.
I&#39;m gonna bring this up to my therapist next week
You don&#39;t get to have opinions anymore. 🤮🤡<br>Go to jail. Go straight to jail without passing go.
She’s an embarrassment to the image of black women
Gyatthony Rizztano
He ranked this album higher than Care For Me.... let that sink in.
People be braindead sometimes i swear sexy redd is different from kendrick kanye <br>this album isnt meant to be deep its dumb fun i dont think the sexy redd album is better than mbdtf both are pretty mid <br>its pathetic how people attack somebody for enjoying an album 😂
Dawg what the fuck
great to know that this album was better than mbdtf, thank you our hood hottest princess!
You know what, I don&#39;t listen to this kind of music and I like it!!
This is NOT better than MBDTF and DAMN
I’ve heard it all now.
I wanna see him sing pound town and skeeyee lmao
Can’t take you serious for this. Pretty embarrassing review
Deaf bald man stop making crappy videos for the love of god.
Bro just saying shit for attention at this point
Melon has gone full degenerate at this point. Imagine putting this above most of Ye&#39;s discography LOL
Sexyy Red is fun as an entertainer, I live it St Louis, people are usually hyped when someone from the 314 gets success. But honesty her music is derivative and Mediocre.
He&#39;s just trying to trigger Ben Shapiro with this review
This is what fantano gives a STRONG 8: “Big-booty ho (That&#39;s right)<br>Touch them toes (Bounce)<br>Bounce that ass” Sexyy Red, 2023
This is not the kind of album I want to listen to all the way through in one sitting but the songs are fire.
Is this the critic yall praise and listen too? 😂 What a clown
I’ve done seen it all
If she was signed to Drake, this would have gotten a 3/10. Easily. Whole review would be about Drake exploiting her and not her empowerment
??????????????
AHHHHHHHH WOMEN CANT MAKE FUN MUSIC NOOOOOOOOOO ITS IMPOSSIBLE (grow up yall holy shit)
Crazy how a deluxe album could out do Micheal Jackson’s entire career.
Do pink Friday 2
Great review skeeyee
People seem to forget that he rates albums in regards to the artist and expectations based on their previous work.<br><br>So, a great lil pump album would be something that’s better than all of a lil pumps previous work. In theory, it wouldn’t be hard for a lil pump to get a 10 <br><br>However, for someone like Kendrick Lamar. Who pushes the boundaries of music and is known for his exceptional writing ability. It would be hard for him to top previous work. <br><br>It’s this, and also his enjoyment of the project as a whole, that determines the  the rating
Fantano really thinks this is better than the entire The Weeknd discography
Just listened to the album based on this review. Wayyyy off. Album is bad. Horribly bad lyrics make the flow and beats difficult to swallow. 4/10
It&#39;s like if Gordon Ramsey walked into a Arbys and said this food is a strong 8 out of all the places he&#39;s eaten ..all credibility is gone
no
he&#39;s trying to hit that coochie ong
glad to see that this album is the level saturation 2 and 3
So they/thems scoring system is complete spunk. Good to know.
Fantano, I hope you know you just lost (I’m assuming) thousands of subs/fans/supporters
😐
Bro gave Sexyy red the same score as blonde
Tell me your reviews can be bought without telling me your reviews can be bought.
Don&#39;t know how people can respect such a bad critic lmao
glad to know that this album is on par with atrocity exhibition!! :)
She really the female gucci mane
Its not april first right?
Shake off your dreads 😿🤩
this is the worst review of all time
they probably paid him for this review cause ain’t no way 💀…so this better than astroworld…mbdtf…nothing was the same
<b>IN WHAT DIMENSION IS THIS BETTER THAN MBDTF?!?</b>
W
Right so can we all agree baldy over here has terrible takes
His assessment of Red is spot on, she’s a “rough in the Diamond.” A rare hood character who embodies all things hood with consistent over the top bangers. She’s better than glorilla, ice spice  combined
sellout
I’m confused, is this a troll review or is he being serious?
the record label paid him
Hack
L take
I love how brad says this is one of the worst of the year and then fantano says this is better than mbdtf
Her Album is 🔥 I was surprised but she reminded me of Old Gucci Mane
What an idiot. 😂
Melon is just shooting his shot guys
5.6k likes, 6.6k dislikes
This is the problem with number ratings, you end up creating controversy
“I know I got the wettest coochie, my shits like macaroni” 8/10?
cupcakke walked so sexyy red could run💅🏻
I wonder how much he got paid 😮
Oh yuh Anthony you not slick gang, we know you tryna yaddamean innat cooterbox, an 8 is insane coming from you 😂😭
there is not one way that this album is over 2 not even 1
Seen him criticize Kanyes lyrics for being sexual that are tamer than any of this. Its all good tho
she aint want u brah
This must be a joke right 😅?
She really is a good musician even if she don’t know it herself, people just hate how she approach it and the message she relay. Her style, flows, cadence are always different but catchy , and even her lyrics are thought out, the subject matter might not be anything spectacular but she sticks to the topic of her hooks when she spit her verses
This album sounds so fucking cheap, but not in ironic kind of hyperpop way, just in a sad aand poor kind of sound
There’s no way sexy redd gets an 8 and surpasses The Weeknd Frank Travis kanye Drake and every other rapper that makes great albums but didn’t get an 8 or a 10
You guys think it&#39;s all numbers  a strong 8 for this type of album aint the same as an 8 on Kendrick. They are going for different things. Apples and oranges people.
She not gon let u hit
she dont want you bro
According to Anthony, this album is better than MBDTF and half of Kanyes Discography, DAMN., Channel Orange and Blond, ASTROWORLD, Every Earl Sweatshirts album and CMIYGL… interesting
If this was called Hood Hottest Princess’s Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy you would’ve given it a -8<br><br><br><br>If this was called To Hood’s Hottest Princess a Butterfly you would’ve given it an 18
WTF is this—way too excited for this degenerate trash but whatever. To each their own.
So inspiring to see Melon acknowledging retarded people making music!
Y’all gotta realize by now this guy is trolling.
Not surprised at all. This is the guy that gave Lil&#39; Pump&#39;s mixed tape and MMLP2 higher scores than MBDTF. His opinions on music are unhinged.
Magic 1 by Nas got a decent 6.
She is not gonna let you hit bro..
💀
This dude has the most godawful opinions on hip hop and r&amp;b😭💀
Ty seš uplně mimo
I don&#39;t hate the album. But essentially in his opinion this is better than any J Cole project.😂😂
He has lost his mind.
Love to know SexxyRed scored only 2 rankings below TPAB which has defined a generation clammering for justice and change within society.
Imagine taking this guy&#39;s reviews seriously, he slow af and have awful takes
Trash album💩🗑️
Crazy how her albums better then blonde, Astro world, roses, Mbdtf, and rodeo!
It’s always the Kanye fanboys in the comments being the most annoying
this is just not right. i get you enjoyed it but if we looked at this as a comparison to other albums this is isnt on the lyrical or production level of many other 8/10s you&#39;ve given. Your opinion is wrong here sorry...
Fantano I feel so bad for your ears<br><br>Edit: NAHHHHHHHH 8/10 is crazy 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This fucking dude always picks apart bars from legit mcs and talks shit but rides for this album ? With such iconic lines as “my pussy is pink my booty hole brown “ or “my pussy wet call it macaroni “ ! Interesting 🤔
wtf is going on with melons eyes at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN1d3HWOd54&amp;t=197">3:17</a> ? 🤣
man def has a type
Can we put him on time out cause I think he needs a nap… how is anyone supposed to ever take him serious.
Worst take. I love all music, and I still have to switch stations every time she comes on the radio. Not only do I vehemently refuse to listen to this album, I am severely disappointed in melon for giving this garbage a review this high.
I’m not that surprised with the score.<br>Anthony has always been woke and  feminist, this album got an 8 for the same reason Black Panther won the Oscar… wokeism.<br>Nothing to do with the quality of the product
this is disgusting
I&#39;m so happy that sexxy reds album has surpassed all of J Coles albums
Why is he wearing the yellow shirt 👀
This man is the IGN of music
Midlife crisis vibes
higher than MMLP2 wtf
You know what good for you, man.
Jumped the Shark.  And with that, after years of recommending this channel, that’s about enough. Good luck.
you&#39;re insane
alright i&#39;ll listen to it DAMN!! this review got me hype for it
SEXYY RED THE QUEEN THAT YOU ARE
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN1d3HWOd54&amp;t=196">3:16</a> what’s up with those Googling eyes
BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAWTFHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAWTFHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Whatttt? He has definitely been cloned
Anthony I love you man but you lost points for me with this one. I feel like you just buying into upcoming mainstream gimmicks. You always giving the basic stuff a high score in hiphop and anything underground or experimental you barely put effort into really listening or trying to understand the genre.
I ain’t mad at it but I really don’t get it. I gave it a chance, peeped like 6 tracks. She’s constantly off beat, her lyrics are boring and predictable despite her best efforts to be shocking and vulgar, her hooks are indistinguishable from the verses, she just isn’t doing anything that Cardi and Ice Spice aren’t doing better.
Your viewers are mostly stubborn idiots so they’re gonna be mad about this one
aint no way this shit is on the level of rodeo
This is hilariously bad. A strong 8 is possibly the worst take ive seen fantano make, and thats coming from someone who almost never agrees with him. Im mad i even gave the view
she is NOT letting you hit fantano . . .
How much did she pay you for you to give this anything above a 5?
This is for sure, without a doubt, the worst video Anthony has ever put out. There is no competitor. There can never be a competitor. So, so, so disappointed.
f u literally
Ok i kinda get it, listening to it
Got me feeling like the hood&#39;s hottest princess
This video was great I was laughing the entire way through
why does bro always go sooo easy on Black women. I guess he does have a type
no way
what are you smoking lmfao
While I don&#39;t agree with the rating I can definitely see where you&#39;re coming from. Definitely a lot of recognizable, catchy, funny lines, I just don&#39;t like trap <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/LsMfY8P6G-yckNAPjoWA8AI"></a>
Mf gave owl phaorh a low score but sexy red a 8 mon fantano
22 song deluxe too💀
I listened to the first track and couldn’t stand it and stopped listening but I’m glad he gave it a 8/10 cuz it’s pissing off nerds
Knew this banger was better than DAMN! Thanks again, Melany!
lets gooooo 😈😈 skeeyeeee
you&#39;re a sick freak
YOURE SO RIGHT !  IM SO GLAD YOU LIKED IT !
This has to be a bad joke right?
Lol who cares??? I don&#39;t see hood hottest princess being up there in his 2024 wrapped tho
No
Id rather listen to this than MBDTF anyday. HOOD HOTTEST PRINCESS 4EVA
are you telling me her first album is as good as denzel’s peak on your channel
This is why you can’t trust bald men
I cant believe people religiously watch this dude enough to be upset at his opinion. Hes just a guy, like someone you&#39;d walk past on the street.
So: after listening to this review, and your follow up explanation on your other channel I listened to this album. I didn&#39;t like it. Simply not for me. Not enjoyable, didn&#39;t find it funny.
this has a better chance than Utopia, Census Designated, and MID AIR do at ending up in the top 10 of the year
Ok bro this has to be bait right
she ain’t gonna let you hit bro 🤣
Melon is a plant
Put this album above: MBDTF, Yeezus, Astroworld, Utopia, Donda, Heroes &amp; Villians, Her Loss, Die Lit, Whole Lotta Red, DAMN, The Melodic Blue, DS2, So Much Fun, What A Time To Be Alive, I Never Liked You, Eternal Atake, Views, More Life, Let’s Start Here, FUTURE, HNDRX, Jeffery, Luv Is Rage 2, Afterlyfe, 2014 Forest Hills Drive, The Off-Season, Nothing Was The Same, and even more. No way bro 💀
you lost me melon head
Nobody has any argument to call this project bad they’re just mad it got rated higher than an album they like
Thank you so much for making hoods hottest princess a better review than any the weeknd, Earl sweatshirt, or Drake album!
Anthony pays for Rubi Rose&#39;s Onlyfans.
Uhhhhhm, yeah. So that&#39;s that.
sa ma pis in chelia ta
U feeling okay anthony?
BASED ❤
this man has lost all critic integrity for the sake of some relevance. Can’t believe it.
ITS SEXYYYYY !! 😩😩🔥🔥🔥
I guess this is this years Lil Pump/Lil Boat 2 type of review
Cringe
Bro is buggin
Sweaty RYM users and equally sweaty hip hop nerds on twitter aint gonna like this one
I cant believer you would give her a 8 and continue to disrespect my boy Nav. like wut
Sexxy redd debut album &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; denzel curry’s whole career
So begins the Melons fanbase  has been divided.
Crazy
Its annoying that people are comparing this score to his scores on albums like MBDTF, Blonde, etc. They&#39;re completely different genres. The way I see it is that he considers this a better trap album than MBDTF is a hip hop album, and imo, I don&#39;t think MBDTF is that great other than a few tracks
Misogynists stay mad 😂😂😂
y’all need to see music as satisfying different niches, this is a great project for its environment stay mad
People when fantano likes fun music🤯🤯
I, for one, appreciate this review.
I&#39;m NACHOS
Fantano fans when he doesn&#39;t have the exact taste they want him to have: 😠
Aint no way you give this a higher score than utopia, whole lotta red, yeezuz, mbdtf
MBDTF - “I don’t really care about kanyes personal life - 6<br>Sexxy Redd talking about her wet choochie for an hour -  8🤤
MBDTF - “I don’t really care about kanyes personal life - 6<br>Sexxy Redd talking about her wet choochie for an hour -  8🤤
Wait is he serious?
Am i dreaming..?
I dont get it Melon.
I stick to Dying Fetus, thank you Anthony
Nah bro definitely got paid by Sexy Redd’s team to make this video💀
Nah this is wack
It&#39;s amazing to me how melon&#39;s opinions are always like, dead on, or entiirely fucking wrong
Y’all are so upset about nothing lmao, literally just a subjective scoring of an album
Don’t sleep on the Lil B influence
&quot;breath if fresh air&quot;<br>least accurate statement about sexy red
he loves it
But fantano that’s not what rate your music says :(
😂😂😂strong 8 😂🤦🏻🤷🏻 my goodness this gonna be a problem, strong 5 or 6 but 8  is insane 😬😂
Bro, I&#39;m here for it.
lil pump review 2: sexyy boogaloo
Is this a joke?
but april fools isn’t until next year🤔
This is the 9/11 of hip hop reviews
Are you being paid to say this? I&#39;m not even mad I&#39;m just confused.
Man that Fader article really did a number on melon boy.
i don&#39;t get why people are mad. if you hate the album, that&#39;s fine but let people enjoy what they like, who cares?
BASED
what
I listened to the album and formed my own opinion, and while I don&#39;t completely agree with your score, I understand that this is solely your opinion and you&#39;re entitled to give works whatever score you see fit 🤗
If this is a joke its really mean, dude
What do you guys expect from a leftist who’s only Good traits are being a feminist and panderer.
Fantano literally has lost his melon on this one. Wow.
What is bro smoking
After this, no rapper&#39;s gonna be offended after getting a low score from bro 💀
this ain’t even a stretch, just wrong
melon ima a big fan but wtf is this
this is the moron who defends tailor swift by calling her haters mysogynists LMFAO we get it caillou your wife divorced you she isnt coming back
no shott he gave damn a 7 but sexxy red a 8
This is officially your worst take. You&#39;re 1000% being paid off to destroy the social decorum. First Lizzo and now this. Is your wife paying you?
You can&#39;t be serious
Hope she sees this bro…
This man is trolling at this point. <br>I think we can stop taking the Needledrop seriously.<br>Point at Anthony and laugh!!! 😂🫵🫵😅
Is not that is better than any álbum, is just that re liked it more bro, is just his opinion.
he looks like he just zerked off
sexy red talking about sex murder drugs &gt; any other male artist
I&#39;m just salty that you said Missouri rapper at the beginning instead of St Louis. Any other artist you would say what city they&#39;re from and not the state.
I didnt think this was a better album than rodeo but going track for track sexyy Redd might take that
i like when fantano gives some dumb album like this a really high score because it pisses off kanye fans and hiphop twitter
Fantano must be desperate for validation from the hot cheeto crowd
Ure so real
Damn
Let the man have his opinion
YUP MELON YOU GET IT 💋 SEXYY RED FOR PRESIDENT
Woofthony meowtano wants a coochie pink and a booty-hole brown for Christmas.
Anthony be fuckin fr
Fantano&#39;s audience are insufferable
Simpthony Cucktano here
You have the worst opinion of music. Literally the worst opinions. You have zero idea what makes music good and doesn’t.
Liking an over the top trap album with vulgar lyrics by a man: Valid<br>Liking an over the top trap album with vulgar lyrics by a woman: 9/11 of music
rot
if you weren’t lobotomized, deaf, and mentally handicapped you would’ve given it a zero
this just proves that he works for the female music industry, attracting brain dead fans
w
yeahhhhhhh I officially dont give a F about Fantano&#39;s opinion
Sexxy Red: the Lil Pump of Women
Kanye fans are so mind broken 😭
Hip-hop’s 9/11
Donda be like: Ain&#39;t no way I got a 7
He didn&#39;t say he thought the nacho thing was &#39;hilarious&#39; did he?
The album fts are actually really good ngl 😂
So this is better than MBDTF, Donda, ASTROWORLD, UTOPIA, The Off Season, Dicaprio 2, DAMN, ,Let&#39;s Start Here, HEROES &amp; VILLAINS, most of Denzel Curry&#39;s projects, So Much Fun and WUNNA. I&#39;d rather listen to FATD (with Scary Hours 3 ofc) CLB and Honestly, Nevermind than this female Young Thug talking how her 😺 pink and 🍑 brown.  Melon has no credibility after this
once again you proved that your opinions are as relevant as a random dogs
this is the rap 9/11
Better than Quadecas Didn’t Mean To Haunt You??
glad to know this album is better than currents
unbelievable
dislike
What
This girl really got the froggyfresh flow
an 8? nigga wildin
This album objectively slaps
When I watches this masterpiece, my father came back for milk after 17 years and gave me the most powerful Albanian backhandcuff I have ever experienced, now he has disinherited me
Had to go to prison for life, quoted this review in court and was convicted of insanity. Thanks Anthony.
This review was playing in the casino yesterday and it helped me conquer my gambling addiction.<br>Thanks Anthony!🙏
My grandpa has been in a wheelchair for 15 years, I showed him this review and my grandpa got up to turn it off, thank you Melon &lt;3
I always watch this review when I don&#39;t feel like going to school, so I remember how important a good education is
BASED
W
I like that you tell us your opinion honestly, even though you know that insecure people will shout at you. I&#39;m gonna give the album a try.
Just proving you rate albums based on how many views it will get
Fantano saw the Theo Vonn interview amd feels he has a chance with Sexyy Red
Such a radical review. Reminds me of that Lil Pump review
&gt; Blond
Everyone can get it wrong sometimes, I think there’s some personal bias coming in here. Love you melon
Truly as good at Sometimes i Might be Introvert
Honestly, you must&#39;ve had something in your ears to have enjoyed this. Maybe ironically or just being contrarian, but there&#39;s not a lot to like compared to other modern releases in the genre. WTF happened?
seeing the incel misogynistic men FUMING in the comments is making my day :-)
how is this better than any taylor swift album you’ve ever rated or being funny in a foreign language by the 1975
still hasnt mentioned Night Lovell on this channel
reviewing this but not even a MENTION of Glorb on your second channel. for shame
More ratchet ghetto culture
Imma be very confused if he gives Nicki’s new album any lower of a score
this is the worst video ive ever seen i left my biggest dislike
😐
I can&#39;t take this seriously when he gives mbdtf a 6, and this a 8. What a fucking joke.
Bffr
So this crazy controversial video has less than 200k views?
Direct result of cancel culture. Dude&#39;s too scared to give it anything less than 8
Sellout
Dude def saw the leaked tape💀
Anthony has never been the same since that Fader article
Aint no way he rating this higher than lil pump💀
bro got to be trolling
Wait until LosPollos sees this!!!
He tryna smash🙄
the fact it&#39;s 22 songs and it still gets an 8 LMAO at this point just be honest bro and say I&#39;m only rating this high because I believe in female rights, I have a fetish for black women, and I hate conservatives💀
This review will help me get bitches thank you
So is the new Lil Pump self-titled review in terms of outrage?
your ratings scale for black female rappers is absolutely fascinating
The new lil Yachty lil boat Review of 2023 😂😂😂😂😂
this review is the second worst thing to happen after 911
bro wants to be noticed by her so bad
Lil Pump 2.0 💀
Sp inspiring that Sexy Red already dropped an album that is better than Utopia, Donda, MBDTF, Yeezus, Astroworld and Damn!
Can&#39;t believe that all Young Thug had to do to get an 8 is put on a wig!
Haters in these comments just don&#39;t understand smh
higher rating than any Thug album btw
All Drake has to do if he wants a high score is become a woman and rap about his pussy
black female artist? high score
I&#39;m fully convinced he SIMPly gave this album that high of a rating bc he wants to take her to Pound Town! 😩😩
It’s a great album I don’t disagree
No way this album is as good as Sometimes I Might Be Introvert
Huh. Long time no see, negative like-to-dislike ratio.
Midlife crisis in full effect …
Nah man this is ridiculous
I&#39;m 12 years old, and yet I still listen to the opinions of this melon; I feel like I was born in the wrong era.
This album is really hilarious. i love it.
Why y’all so bitter 😂 this is like the female version of lil pump getting a 7 lmao
review the new ml buch album
damn you really are down bad for a new woman
The next Rapsody album better be a 10!
why do we give this man a platform???
there’s no way he likes sexy redd over nav
Maybe melons just down bad
Ok, i actually borhered to watch it. Fair play squire.
The fuck!!????
This album is so unbelievably ass. This actually has to be a troll
Nice to know Sexxy Red had dropped a project better than ANY Earl Sweatshirt album and MBDTF. Thank you Anthony
Yikes Anthony
Just…nah dude.
IYKYK
I think this has got to be a joke that he put this 8/10 which means it&#39;s as the same quality as melt my eyes see your future and taboo and  so many other better projects
How much does the jyoos paid you lmao😂
could you be more pretentious?
So this is an 8 but all of Kid Cudi&#39;s projects are not even 7&#39;s. LMAO.
This seems like a comparable point to when H3 started his podcast and said anything to stay popular
WHAT IN THE ACTUAL FUUUUCK, COUNT YOUR SECONDS MELON
mind you that this means that sexxyredd is on par with, if not better than MBDTF, yeezus, TLOP, donda, utopia, astroworld, DAMN and flower boy.
Hes getting paid!!!
Feminist Fantano here
Fantano woke up and choose violence
Anthony, I’m so sorry all of your fans are such losers man
LMAOOO
Is this April or December??
lil tecca&#39;s new album is better than this mediocre.
BASED!!!
W
Is Laroi album next up?
I&#39;m so happy to see sexy red already has an album better than magdalene! Great review!
He much she pay you?
Melon, you can’t give the album high praise while putting your phone number on screen instead of a score “in the hopes she’ll watch until the end.”
This is objectively wrong.
What universe you live in anthony ?
Theres no way fantano can name a single track off lil pumps album (gave it a 7) and he wont be able to name one of these songs a year from now.
To quote Kid Cudi on the track &quot;Gorgeous&quot; from the album you gave a 6 to &quot;MBDTF&quot; I will never ever let you live this down.
Wow You are so edgy Fantano
This comment section is chock full of very dumb people. Hear an opinion they can’t take and lose their tiny wee minds. Please cry more. It’s a fun album, not my taste but respect Anthony’s explanation. Music critics don’t exist to please you 👍🏾
this guy is tapped for sure he gave utopia and mbdtf a lower score, i aint even gotta listen to this before knowing its a worse album bruh. maybe he just a feminist
Wack.
Y’all just subscribed to this man because he can explain his words so well 😂😂😂😂
Trying so hard to get another black wife lmao
Cuc energy
I’m fucking done
Bro&#39;s trying to get a new black wife lmao
bro just lost all of his credibility
Are you fucking serious lmao??? She sounds like a boy going through puberty? Come on dude 😭
How to lose all your credibility in a vid
Good to know that sexy red dropped an album better than Luv is rage 2 👍
this def a social experiment
why is he getting hate for a highly positive review
Some of y&#39;all genuinely just scared of women rapping like men about sex
Did y&#39;all not listen to the review?<br>He substantiated all oh his points and this is consistent with all of his previous takes, if you&#39;ve seen his Cardi/cupcake/nicki reviews you would know this is his shit lmao.
yeah after giving her a 8 and nav a not good is wildly insane
Yeah I respect this dudes opinions but I just lost all respect for every rating hes ever made 💀
he rated this higher than House Of Balloons everyone
This dude just lost all credibility, how is this shit fucking album an 8 compared to all the 7,6,5s he has given
Aw man! A raw trap album?? In 2023?? How fresh! Lol. In case you guys haven&#39;t figured out, fantano rates based on the personality of an artist not just the music. Look at his Alex G reviews he barely knew anything about the music while calling Alex boring and saying &quot;He should be more like Will Toledo&quot; Dudes more of a pop culture critic at this point.
NEVER RATE AGAIN!! 🗣🗣💯🔥🔥🙏
unsubscribed
so this better than quaranta?
this is the &quot;lil pump 7/10&quot; of the new year
He’s really just tryna get attention now
So proud to see sexyy red dropping a better album than DAMN.
Y’all just hate having fun while listening to music lmao
He’s definitely being blackmailed
She ain’t letting you hit bro
It&#39;s a good album what can you say..
you guys are just being misogynistic
Fucking curveball lmao
How much she pay you? 🤨
Did he just say this album is better than Utopia?
I think this is the funniest review he’s ever given just based of the fact that he’s <b>serious about it</b>
The way I stood here with my mouth agape the entire video
Ok you fuckers made me believe it was a bad album. Ya’ll are so up your own asses. Obsessed with ‘taste’ instead just enjoying the good shit
Cal Chuchesta rolling in his grave right now
People out here really acting like Melon should validate all of their opinions. Please go outside and take a shower, your comments smell.
Why you all mad, this album is good.  Not to mention that pitchfork gave an 8 as well
this is a joke, right? if this is an 8, then whats an album like OK Computer rated?? or &quot;Nevermind&quot;??? Is this better than Illmatic?????
When Fantano likes an album you all like, it’s an accurate and fair critic but when he goes against popular opinion and likes something you all expected him to shit on, he’s a paid corporate shill? LOL please go touch grass. It’s his opinion you guys have to stop treating Fantano like he’s some sort of music god. It’s not that deep. And I’ve watched Fantano for nearly a decade and I still can’t believe you MBDTF incels are STILL upset at him wtf😂😂😂
Bro its awful
A whole 3 points above oblivion access wtf fantano
Worst review of all time?
Not in front of the D’Angelo record Anthony 😞
No one will ever convince me he didnt do this just to get reactions. Its all over twitter now. Mission accomplished for fantano.
One of his worst reviews since 2010
Find someone that loves you as much as Fantano loves praising subpar, low-effort female rap just because it was made by a woman
Doesn’t seem like something that’d interest me, but come on!  The man ends every single video description of his with: “Y’all know this is just my opinion, right?”  Let him fucking love Sexyy Red!
How much were u paid??
She still looks like a man tho
you are not getting that bag bro 💀
Ear piercing vocals from an average industry plant lol
This album fuckin bangs! I don&#39;t get the hate.
22 track trap album from sexyy red got an 8
i tried to listen to the album. got about 4 seconds into the first track and had to turn it off all i can say is the beats seem cool and hard hitting mixed differently than most trap albums. besides that it’s probably the most suicide inducing thing i’ve ever heard and i barely did.<br><br>0/10
This has to be his worst take yet
Music critics have to be the biggest joke in the music industry
What a loser
I thought the comments were just overreacting, but holy shit this album sucks. Dude got paid for this review.
Strong 8 ????? Damn dude you give an 2 to sleep token ☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️👌👌
You make me want to eat meat again.
You’re losing it.<br>You’re losing it.<br>You’re losing it.<br>You’re losing it.<br>You’re losing it.<br>You’re losing it.<br>You’re losing it.<br>You’re losing it.
This is like the modern day Lil Pump Self Titled &amp; DAMN. controversy except now its Hood Hottest Princess vs literally every other album on par or below this ones rating
Fantano you’ve officially lost it
Melon you buggin out dawg
no way this isn’t satire
No fucking way
I thought Twitter was just being Twitter when I saw people trying to cancel fantano but after hearing this shit I wish i was deaf
i agree, shits fire.
&quot;You cried to my album and still gave it a 7?&quot;<br>- Joey Bada$$
This is rated higher than any future album btw. Great work man!
yt ppl have the funniest opinions on rap lmao
All of the rap &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;fans&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; are salty as fuck on Youtube, Instagram and Twitter <br><br>lol<br><br>lmao even<br><br>jajajaja included
damn this shit better than mbdtf😱😱
After seeing the score I expected the comment section to be like this.
After seeing this review  went and listened to the album, the only thing I could think of was “this is what I would imagine would play when I’m entering hell”. Absolutely disgusting album and even more disgusting review. 🤮
Bum
Are you ok?
fraudulency
Just say you love Women rapping about the same shit you hate Men rapping about.
Anthony respectfully what the fuck
Y’all really have a problem with women in Hip Hop and it’s quite sad. Says a lot about your maturity and self esteem..…
Higher than MBDTF HE CANT KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH IT
This album is trash and not good stop the cap pls
No one freaked out when he gave the key Glock deluxe and 8
People it’s his OPINION stop crying and get over it. Just because you don’t like the album or think other albums are better that’s YOUR OPINION. It don’t matter if he does or does not like it. So shut up all of u
i understand he rates certain albums on difference scales. like this album was fun for him and enjoyable to listen to, where as he would rate an album like mbdtf on a more technical scale. but dawg, fantano on some shit with this. his worst take of all time lmaooo
Fantano really wants a new black wife. The only explanation for this rating. 🤮
😂 Boy getting cooked, this review killed your credibility
An album as good as Blonde! Amazing! <br><br>Seriously, these songs are so terrible. Like what are these awful trap beats? They mostly sound like the beats of some random FL Studio tutorial.
I&#39;m three tracks in and I&#39;ve had to stop it. <br><br>Does she just pick one flow for each track and then beat you over the head with it?
Thanks anthony for giving us your honest opinion and not hating on this album just to please a bunch of chronically online nerds. Super catchy album!
He must badly want another black wife.
Keep in mind Fantano gave this album a higher score than Danny Brown&#39;s new album Quaranta or XXX and the same score as Earl Sweatshirt &#39;s Some Rap Songs.
it aint even april
:( ????????? no.
I’m afraid I’m gonna be a little late but I respect Fantanos opinions most of the time and I really feel like he gets wayyyy too much hate, but you gotta also realize he reviews albums like this so high not because he necessarily likes them that much because he needs to appear as progressive as possible. There is no reality where he would’ve rated this album lower than a 6.
Anthony she ain’t gonna let you hit dawg
Ah yes, who can forget a line like “Nachos” (like “not yours” bitch guys get it haha) true comedy genius. You sure Cal isn’t the one doing this review?
Fantano got that booty meat
closing track should’ve been named « female Young thug »
The will smith bar is crazy
She ain’t gonna let you hit
Why are people mad
She is not letting you hit man
Sexyy Red made a better album than (insert fuckass brain dead twitter album that you can’t defend on your own)!!! Nice one!
Rated higher than Government Plates, or MATANGI ☠️☠️☠️
all ima say is the Summer walker collab goes hard
Bro me literally cyah keep a straight face. Wtf🤣🤣🤣
Sexyy Red overrated
💀💀💀
Baldy should actually be cancelled for this
This is what happens when you let a white man express opinions on matters that don&#39;t concern him. I&#39;m not surprised that you don&#39;t understand rap enough to review albums; the lyrics in these albums aren&#39;t written with someone like you in mind, so obviously, you wouldn&#39;t relate. I love Sexy Red, but you should be ashamed of using her as a token to deflect accusations of racism and misogyny. If I were in her place, I&#39;d feel offended. Be honest with yourself, Anthony, and stop occupying spaces that don&#39;t belong to you! It&#39;s clear that none of us want you here.
Really gotta remember the score is simply how much Anthony likes the album. This one IS odd, hadn’t heard any of it before but listening to 3 of the main hits from it uh…can’t say I see much in it. She’s definitely confident, I suppose.
she reminds me of la chat and gangsta boo, her energy is unmatched, she gives me baby boy movie and baby mama by 36 mafia vibes.
The problem with y’all is you forget all these videos are just opinions yall are too incapable of making on your own. Idc what this dude says abt this album, i ain’t bumping no sexy red😂
did you hit your head?
Wtf Anthony
yall uhhh yall DO know this is just his opinion right
Sexxy red is pure art
Who paid this man to overrate this bullshit 🤣🤣🤣 He was hyping it up before even listening to it. Sexxy Redd music doesn&#39;t deserve higher than a 5.
&quot;my name sexy red I ain&#39;t no singing ass bitch&quot; he says, somehow acting as if that terrible line is a breath of fresh air.
he hates on Vulture for the crazy lyrics but likes this trash for the violent and unhinged lyrics?
Anthony&#39;s coochie pink, his booty hole is brown. Just fount out.
💔💔
This is NOT AS GOOD AS NURTURE BRO… no way
Congrats on giving a dog water album an 8.
Anthony, you mixed up the scores of this and worlds end girlfriend
this mf smacked😂😂
wassup gewayyy
Can’t believe I have to listen to Sexyy Red now just to make sense of this review
It&#39;s lil boat all over again, but worse. People are not gonna shut up comparing ratings to this. 🙄
It&#39;s odd how politically vocal melon is as well as having previously focused on industry plants...<br><br>...and yet, here he is... saying nothing about anything related to that when it&#39;s deeply available...and be does this while overcoming all taste and rating this equal to or over well executed work.
Ok. regardless of the lyrics on this album that vary, from stupid, over annoying to downright tacky.<br>The main isssue wit this album is how ugly everything sounds.<br>Sexyy Red literally sounds someone who has never rapped before in her life which is why she&#39;s off beat all the time and has no flow whatsoever. <br>The beats are also just very unplesant to listen to.<br>Everything about this album is just so ugly and gross it has no redeeming qualities whatsoever.
is it just me or is she allergic to rapping on time... always rushing the beat
We get it Fantano black women make you feel special down there
If Kreayshawn dropped this exact same album, all the trap beats would be dated and uninspired, the lyrics would be dull and weak in terms of the rhymes, and the content lyrically would be called over the top, OVERLY profane and nasty to the point of numbness, and lastly be accused of trying to sell records with shock value. It would be called one dimensional and nasty for the sake of itself. <br><br>The content would be disgusting and not contributing to the artistic vision - but here it&#39;s so very COOL and HIGH CONCEPT because Redd ...um, what does she do? &quot;wears her influences on her sleeve?&quot;<br><br>If that&#39;s true, ask yourself: If Cardi B put out a record with cuts on it that had &quot;sucking off Joe Biden,&quot; &quot;drinking piss&quot; and &quot;bootyhole brown&quot; (JUST FOR BEGINNERS!) as lyrics...<br><br>What type of score would Demthony Libtano give it? Woul <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN1d3HWOd54&amp;t=623">10:23</a> d Cardi make it to 4? Would Kreay reach a strong 3?<br><br>I don&#39;t make it political, but he has shown me so often lately that he does. Its a shame because I have respect for his opinion in absence of anything except the music..... <br><br>But I have this vibe so much lately that everything is now political on this channel, and if you check the proper number of diverse boxes you win a big old prize regardless of those things which aren&#39;t important to our modern music world anymore (like the strength of the actual content, rapping ability, posessing different styles flows tones, artistic depth, diverse messages, storyteller quality etc.)<br><br> This is a double album of extremely repetitive schlock, discussing ONE SINGLE SUBJECT IN ONE SINGLE WAY.  Whatever the intentions, it doesn&#39;t even bother even trying to cover the singular subject matter from another angle. Same thing over and over, &quot;Wow, she said some WILD ASS DIRTY SHIT! THAT&#39;S SO REFRESHING!&quot;<br><br>Sorry to go so long but he brought in Gangsta Boo and 3-6 Mafia into this. Artists like Trina manage to come off more sexy and stylish and far superior lyrically on their worst day. Boo&#39;s verse on &quot;Late Night Tip&quot; or lesser known tracks like her duet with Pastor Troy &quot;Wantin&#39; U&quot; (which uses the beat from Late Nite Tip) are cool, filthy without trying so hard and genuinely sexy.<br><br>3-6 always pushed the envelope in subject matter and lyrical content but it came from a place of intelligence; they were raunchy and offensive in an artistically gifted and authentic way - they took you to a place that was grimy and dirty with their beats and verses and it always felt authentic 😂and driven by purpose. 😮
Im never going to take another rating seriously. This is insane to me
Anthony! Go to horny jail!
If it was called &quot;hood hottest king&quot; it would&#39;ve been a 4 melon let&#39;s not lie
Craziest take I&#39;ve ever seen
how much did they pay you
Yeah sure, you gave it an 8 purely for the music and not for any other reason, cough simp.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN1d3HWOd54&amp;t=95">1:35</a> we lost him boys
I don’t think anyone has lost credibility quicker than Anthony Fantano you could rate any albums zero and it would be a better review than this genuinely what the actual fuck is wrong with your ears fantano
Fantano type of guy to call banana taped to a wall the greatest art piece of modern times
He gave sexxy red a strong 8 while giving utopia a strong 7
Yea, You’re Definitely Pandering. This Is Pure, Unfiltered Dog Shyt
SkeeYee!! Super stoked you covered this record.
This is the most chadest thing this guy has ever done
Mfs throwing a tantrum over bald mustache man liking a album💀💀💀
rage bait to get more views, notice how his videos views numbers dropped, until this review blowup and hit 100k+
So according to fantano this album is better than: AGC, MBDTF, Yeezus. As good as: TLOP, Rodeo, Astroworld. I think fantano may have lost it as a credible commentator on Music
well there goes fantanos credibility
crazy to know you find this better than DAMN
She&#39;s not gonna let u hit bro
The fact that he thinks that Death Grips and TPAB is better than this critically acclaimed hood classic is insane
But how could he rate this higher than this other album made by a MAN with a PENIS
This goes into the books as an instant classic, controversial Fantano rating
Anthony is losing it smh her music trash
Hot dumpster juice<br>Fantano has officially lost all credibility
Bro said Sukihana and Sexy Red have “creative chemistry” 💀💀💀💀💀
This guy is the most random reviewer ever. Just gives any score that pops into his head at the time. There is no logic behind anything he reviews
Full of Hell &amp; Nothing- When No Birds Sang review please!
Our boy is hungry for that bussy
This album encapsulates everything I despise in modern music
Just know that this rating will forever stain your legacy and ruin your credibility.
Agree
opinion so bad i heard about it in a manga subreddit
For some reason I feel the need disclaim that some of my favourite rappers are women, anyway you&#39;re fucking with me Anthony
Apparently better than any Lil Wayne album. Bald fraud
might be his worst review
I honestly loved this project...Her choruses are some of the catchiest i&#39;ve heard this year honestly...Like she has a really crazy understanding of a catchy, southern flow...and the way these songs are mixed makes them hit hard af
This really is a Fantano W I love this so much
This means that blue face is officially the GOAT
i&#39;m out of town thuggin with my rounds<br>my coochie pink my bootyhole brown <br>🔥🔥🔥
It&#39;s pretty cringe and the gimmick won&#39;t last long
How’s he saying good eats is good and shitting on hell of a life💀
Fantano are you ok?
Sexxy red is basically a ratchet comic book caricature come to life who makes club music. I don’t know why some of these political warriors take her so seriously when she literally isn’t suppose to be. She started her career as a meme rapper for fuck sakes. I’ve been hooked on Dolly Parton for the last 2 months and tbh they’re not quite so different when it comes to the persona thing. Dolly when she first came out was basically this big breasted outrageous “dumb blonde” type character and she often played into that at times but also made fun of herself and playing the public. Though they are quite different musically, talent wise,  and lifestyle wise. The formula is still the same. Both of them are quite calculating and smart. I’ve seen a number of Sexxy Reds interviews and she is actually witty and funny. It’s just that sexy chooses the Madonna route and uses sensuality to provoke people. Also, because she’s a black woman and we’re living in the middle of an ongoing gender war. She kinda is hounded on more than she should be. While I do get some of the points they’re making about the whole children thing. It shouldn’t be up to her to raise some people’s kids. These new parents got life so fucked up.
Its official. He’s lost it
i’m waiting for you to say you’re joking melon 🙏🙏 better than blonde actually infuriates me normally i can understand your takes but this is insane melon 😭
Y&#39;all are cracking me up though. Why are y&#39;all adopting a monolithic view towards music? I mean, everyone knows Fantano doesn&#39;t mean this album is better than the MBDTFs and all; and that&#39;s what y&#39;all are bashing him for. Think about it this way: when discussing Southern Hip Hop, with the Waka Flockas, the Pimp Cs, and the Gucci Manes; that kind of abrasive, dirty, unhinged, with the crazy hooks typa albums, why not give this album an 8? I mean?? Can you hear the hooks, the features, and Tay Keith fucking it up fr?? Please man, STRONG 8!
I just heard the Album and your review..to make it short I give them both a 1 out of 10 and yearn for the days of Missy Elliott 😢
bro what the fuck is this
About Time Anthony gave a Young Thug album a score higher than an seven 🎉
we live in a timeline that my beautiful dark twisted fantasy is rated worse than fucking sexyy red
i actually really admire this take
A terrible review for an equally terrible album
kanye fans when someone likes an album that isn&#39;t a kanye album
an 8? pretty sure you just got paid a shit ton of money just to simp to her. Only a fan boy would give a mid album an 8. this is low of you
Can not believe how much people care about one dude’s opinion. It’s music, chill tf out.
This has to be him trolling because if this is supposed to be a legit review and he actually thinks this is a strong body of work then the credibility is officially down the drain and I’ll never tune in again.
You see this is the problem with people who critique but don&#39;t create. Hiding somewhere in the fine line between &quot;things I like personally&quot; and &quot;it&#39;s my role to contribute to culture&quot;. A shame. No hate on Sexxy Red though.
This reveiw was not sexyy fantano.😡I&#39;m red. 🤬
I don&#39;t think anyone agrees with you bud
NAAAAAAH NO WAY IN HELL DID THIS GUY RATE THIS HIGHER THAN LONERISM BY TAME IMPALA
This is insanity, mr morale was also an 8. I can’t believe my eyes.
The breakup really destroyed his soul huh
lost the bloody plot
I love the cover.  What a perfect representation of black culture in 2023.  Can&#39;t wait to see where we go from here!  Fishy pussy and drinking piss?  Just some beautiful magic there.  Love it!  Cover is a 10/10.
I&#39;ve always unironically enjoyed SexxyRedd, not voing to listen to the whole album. But not completely shocked by the review.
This has to be a joke lol
simp. why is he overrating this album?
when the views get stale
This might be as crazy as giving MBDTF a 6 wtaf
This is a political rating, not an artistic rating. He did the same thing in 2020 for WAP
Always a good day when k*nye fans are bitching, whining, pissing their pants, throwing up, etc over something so stupid all because theres artists making better music than their special little n4zi boy
I&#39;m a fan of slut pop but no way this deserves anything above a 6. <br>Born by the river slaps tho
Anthony tryna get him some “ghetto ratchet 😽”
damn this comment section is rough.
You know what? I never even considered it. YOU are the industry plant.
This is satire for sure.
Hate on this album if you want but you’ll be singing a different tune when ‘Born By The River’ kills Ben Shapiro stone dead.
Bro twitter is flaming you ain&#39;t no way you gave this trash an 8
I’d give it a strong 5.
you convinced me im gonna try it out
🤨🤨🤨
Couldn’t care less about the album rating that’s your opinion but it is disappointing to see you on Twitter defending an artist that’s openly endorsed trump and used transphobic language in her snippets
This the last album we need to be promoting with GTA VI coming out.
Yeah u packed up buddy
Most misguided high score he’s ever given, probably.
There is no way this is reality. Good lord
I don&#39;t this album is an 8 but I feel like people just blindly hate at this point like what is the need to compare this project to other, older albums?? Mob mentality truly
I think this man gave it an 8 for clout, no way he actually thinks this garbage album is that good
She won’t let you hit
Imagine being criticised for all the corny things he’s praising on this album 😂<br>Hey fantano, we know your type, stop glazing her and give her a 5 😂😂😂😂
Claaaassic Anthony fantano
You know I defended you but this is actually your worst take ever
Sexyy curry, Denzel redd 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
No way THE Red Moon In Venus was a worse score than this 💀
Why are people so pressed lmao he likes an album oh no whatever will I do!!!
And so begins Fantano&#39;s decline in credibility amongst even some of his most ardent fans.
Worst review since Swimming.
You sir have lost all your credibility
who paid this man
This absolutely has to be a troll. I will never watch another one of your videos your opinion is so invalidated after this
The fact that you have any credibility as a much reviewer is laughable. Music review in general doesn’t make sense since it’s all subjective but if you’re gonna review it anyways atleast be consistent on how you score it. Ik this video is probably high quality bait but still
This got the same score as flower boy<br>This got the same score as flower boy<br>This got the same score as flower boy<br>This got the same score as flower boy<br>This got the same score as flower boy<br>This got the same score as flower boy<br>This got the same score as flower boy<br>This got the same score as flower boy<br>This got the same score as flower boy<br>This got the same score as flower boy<br>This got the same score as flower boy<br>This got the same score as flower boy<br>This got the same score as flower boy<br>This got the same score as flower boy<br>This got the same score as flower boy<br>This got the same score as flower boy<br>This got the same score as flower boy<br>This got the same score as flower boy<br>This got the same score as flower boy<br>This got the same score as flower boy<br>This got the same score as flower boy<br>This got the same score as flower boy<br>This got the same score as flower boy<br>This got the same score as flower boy
It’s definitely better than Funeral.
Well....DAMN.
Can see this score really getting the incels heated lmao
i don’t think it’s good to compare this score to other random albums like blonde or TLOP, but there’s definitely something to be said where an album that has a similar thesis to this one gets rated far worse. this is a fun album in the same way Lil Pump’s self titled album was, and that got a relatively understandable 7 (though that also has its own well deserved controversies). to give this a strong 8 (basically 8.5), is gonna reasonably make people reconsider what the point of the number scores even are. if an album is a REALLY good at making songs with fart noises, can that album get a 9 or 10 if it’s undeniably PERFECT for what it’s trying to go for? or is there something more “universal” about these scores that should be kept in mind for all albums being reviewed?<br><br>either this scores gotta be readjusted a bit or the whole “giving one number to capture the quality of an album” bit has to be dropped for fantano.
The divorce got him like this
Toenail take
When not one J Cole album is on SexxyRed’s level to this man 😂
I don’t think she’s awful. She definitely can make bangers. Is it my taste? no. But I can appreciate it’s existence. While I think a strong 8 is to high maybe a 5 - 6 would be sick.
Its SEXYY🗣️
Fantanos favorite trump supporter!! 🇺🇸
lol This guy is a joke. He only rates things based on how esoteric or kitschy he finds it. Maybe Just don’t review hip hop anymore bro
Remember that this is higher than these albums from this year alone: Lets Start Here (Lil Yachty), Utopia (Travis Scott), FATD (Drake) and Scary Hours 3 (Drake), A Great Chaos (Ken Carson), Rocket Power (Quavo), Business is Business (Young Truly Humble Under God), A Gift And A Curse (Gunna), If Looks Could Kill (Destroy Lonely) as well as Set It Off (Offset) which didnt get a rating but the mini review wasnt nearly as high as this one. <br><br>I just want consistency from music critics. I respect Fantano, but seriously? If were talking about the most &quot;fun&quot; album this year its easily one of the Opium albums, most likely Snot Shit or A Great Chaos which are pure fun-fests that ALSO break stereotypes around the Opium label itself (mainly AGC as it breaks a couple of molds that were seen in Opium)<br><br>Its... frustrating. Simple as that
Anthony, the fact you gave this a higher rating than This Is Why by Paramore is absolutely absurd.
When is the Peter Gabriel&#39;s review coming out?
hey so like... this was a joke right?
Based
Hey Fantony, pls do the new Blonde Redhead I&#39;m curious
lost all credibility tbh
My enemy is a notion not a nation.
I think he got paid for this, he called her THE TOTAL PACKAGE LMAO. she can’t sing and her bars are lame. giving her an 8 because of style??? how about carti’s style or ken carson’s style? this review sounds like a parody tbh
&quot;my album made you cry, AND YOU GAVE IT A FUCKING 7???&quot;
Sexxy redd is NOT this good idc
Melon Hottest Princess
Oh he’s gonna shit all over pink Friday 2
This is about to go Viral
If this was called &quot;Father of All Hood Hottest Princesses&quot;, you would have given it a 0
Nah he’s not wrong this album is amazing🔥🔥‼️
Good to know this album beats Carrie &amp; Lowell! Very cool Anthony
Sexxtony Redtano
incels really mad about this one
Last review I&#39;ve ever watched from Fantano before I unsubscribed was MBDTF many years ago. Out of nowhere I just got the idea to check out if his channel still existed. Landed on this review and I&#39;m shocked, I think I&#39;m missing some context here. Is Fantano OK?
all credibility
She not gon&#39; fuck you lil bro 😭
I can’t believe she already dropped a better album than ANY J Cole project EVER. Fantano is at it again 👏
This guy&#39;s reviews shouldn&#39;t even be taken into account anymore, he gives Sexxy Red a rating of 8, while he couldn&#39;t even dedicate a full review to The Kid Laroi&#39;s new album, either this world is already very fucked up or he just wants to troll with this
Brainthony Rottano
Needle Drop Anthony, just because NFR Anthony is crushing on Ice Spice doesn&#39;t mean you have to do the same with Sexyy Red! Silly melon.
Remember, if aliens come down to earth and ask Melon to pick between Mr. Morales and the Big Steppers and Hood Hottest Princes DELUXE he will stand there scratching his bald stinky melon, hand the brown bootyhole album over, and subsequently doom the human race to immediate annihilation.
can you do a review on the this does not exist album by lil darkie
Misogynists be misogynists
you’re trolling💀 you should have your first amendment rights taken away
idk why people stan over MBDTF is not something special
yall are literally just anti fun. this album is good
We got some hardcore simping over here!
Based on this album cover, I&#39;d give it a 1. I don&#39;t even care what&#39;s on it.
What the FUCK
Now i think drake dm makes sense
People mad ab sexyy red getting an 8 are the same people who don’t like fun and get no bitches
So happy i could be here for the newest canon event in fantano world
Fantano been giving out 8/10s like free food at a homeless shelter as of late, but giving Sexy Red a higher score than Andre 3k’s new album has to be a criminal offense.
Bro shits a light 2
Lil Pump self-titled review is stepping aside for this Sexxy Redd review 😂
Astroworld, MBDTF, The Devine Feminine, DAMN, Yeezus, H&amp;V, and Wolf are all worse than this album? and Rodeo, Some Rap Songs, Blonde, TLOP, If You’re Reading This (ITL), Die Lit, Melt My Eyes See Your Future, are all on the same level of this album? Anthony i’ve always been able to see what you mean in most of your reviews, even if i disagree with what the final review is, i can always understand what you mean in each critique, i seriously have no idea what you mean with anything in this review, this the new needle drop 9/11.
We get it Melon, you like women of color.
Good to know that SexyRedd dropped an album better than DAMN.
The Ratio is insane💀
This is the best bait I’ve ever witnessed
This shit is so fire🔥🔥🔥🇺🇸💅🏼🫡
I saw a photo of this review and genuinely thought it was a joke
Anthony Twerked to this...
Losing all credibility as a critic for internet controversy.
The fact that he rated this album higher than Fetch the Bolt Cutters is insane
This nigga must be listening to albums in reverse
This review is proof that Fantano has officially listened to too much music and is now starting to go a bit loopy as a result
She&#39;s not gonna fuck you bro
not only a deluxe edition of a mixtape he called it album but a sexyy red one and he&#39;s giving it a eight, random man
worst take of all time. “rawness and energy” are great and can make good albums, but under no circumstances should they be rated this high. “rawness and energy” are not better than the thought out, thematic, intricate, well-mixed MBDTF, Blond, or Utopia
bro got paid to do this shit
You surprise me with your scores sometimes anthony
I&#39;m okay with this being an 8/10 if DAMN. becomes a 10/10
Anthony its not april fools yet
This HAS to be bait bro there’s NO way lmaooooo she’s no joke one of the worst rappers of all time male or female, that’s insanity.
I can&#39;t believe Anthony Needledrop liked this album more than an album he didn&#39;t like. The apocalypse is upon us.
Sexxy&#39;s album is 🔥, Deff female artist of the year.
If Kanye dropped this it would have been rated a -12
🤮🤮
Bro rated this better than swans
Worst take he’s ever had
He gave this shit an 8/10? Oof
How? Are you OK Anthony? This is blasphemy, or elite trolling.
peoples racism and classism is showing with this one
Nah.
I really hope this is a joke. This tape is literally terribly mixed ratchet, sexual music over good beats.
Today marks Anthony fantanos official fall off🎉
Naw dawgie, this pandering. I refuse to believe you actually like this shit.
Giving this an 8 and the ice spice album a strong 5 is crazy. Both seem like nice / cool people but come on Lol. Is he afraid of future Twitter backlash for not liking black women&#39;s music or whatever nonsense he&#39;s been accused of in the past?
Yo....
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN1d3HWOd54&amp;t=378">6:18</a> haha that bar is so fire haha thats so hard and raw I love the Black people👨🏻
In what world is this generic thot rap better than the new Aesop Rock? Still salty about that one 😡
He has to be trolling at this point
Hi Fantano. Sometimes I look to you for music recommendations and usually when you give something a very positive score I&#39;ll enjoy it.<br>That being said this is easily one of, if not the worst, most-grating-to-listen-to, least enjoyable albums that have ever graced my eardrums. Keep up the good work.
Needle drop down horrendous
He’s officially lost the plot
This is worse than the Paris Texas review somehow.
Melon what the actual fuck
This is the new Lil Pump self titled review all over again.
classic pandering tony
Who let bro have music opinions?
Bros a clout chaser
We have another lil pump 7/10 situation
Rap fans stay misogynistic as always
Yall know this is just his opinion right😂
This is better than every future and young thug album according to fantano
I was here for this historic moment
Guys it&#39;s just a score that reflects his personal opinion in this specific period of time... Im fucking kidding melon this&#39;s the craziest review hope sexy would allow some minor rappers like Cole, Rocky, Metro Boomin and Lil Wayne to collab &#39;cause they were never able to get to this score. Bless you sexy, you spittin&#39;.
inches away from saying &quot;the exaggerated swagger of a black teen&quot;
No
Sexyy Redd def made a name for herself throughout 2023. Lyrics absolute garbage 🤮 but them beat selection fire tho🔥
Strong 8 is crazy💀💀
Is this a joke
actually ridiculous, so I guess it&#39;s better than Yeezus, MBDTF, Life of Pablo, Donda, Astroworld, Utopia, DAMN, Flowerboy, Blonde, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN1d3HWOd54&amp;t=284">4:44</a>, Mr Morale and the Big Steppers, Call Me if You Get Lost, every Tame Impala album,every Lil Wayne abulm, every J Cole album, etc etc etc. genuinely one of the worst fucking takes ever
im genuinely in shock. no words
He gotta be joking because this shit is genuinely ass
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN1d3HWOd54&amp;t=96">1:36</a> 🤔
now im not saying laroi is a generational artist.. but the fact that you think this is better than larois album is genuinely blasphemous.
If a male rapper did these lyrics they would be celebrated. The ONLY reason she’s getting hate is because she’s saying these lyrics as a woman.
I love how offended everyone is. The hip hop community is a mindless hive mind who can’t handle opinions that don’t fully agree with what the hive mind have decided is correct.
Leftist delusion
He&#39;s literally insane.
Bro this album is mid AF idk what ur smoking twin, this is not better than mbdtf and blonde and wlr and good bye and good riddance this is bullsht
deserved
Hood Hottest Princess better than Quaranta ??? What the actual fucking fuck
No way he gave this degenerate bullshxt an 8
I like Megan, Cardi, Flo Milli, Baby Tate, Monaleo, Doja, and even Latto and Ice Spice on occasion. But I just can&#39;t get into the sound of either GloRilla or Sexyy Red for the life of me. Listening to Tomorrow 2 and Pound Town 2 was a clear victory for the former simply cuz I didn&#39;t vibe with Red&#39;s part. Everybody else killed it.<br>I&#39;m just gonna avoid them for now cuz I know they&#39;re not my taste for the moment. Might revisit in the future.<br><br>Still mad CHIKA didn&#39;t get a review, SAMSON was awesome
you just lost the little bit of credibility you had left 😂
Amazing she dropped something better than anything Jane remover has released!
How is this rated higher than i didnt mean to haunt you...?
Aint no way
thats the worst take ive ever heard
everyone so chocked about this, but did yall forget about the Lil Pump review ?
Well Fantano, it’s been a fun run. Goodbye.
It&#39;s so tedious how so many Fantano commenters are obsessed with comparing every album he&#39;s ever reviewed based on the score. I understand it&#39;s a meme but it&#39;s not funny anymore, he&#39;s said many times he rates albums on an enjoyment scale not some ultra precise objective Olympic style rating system. I really don&#39;t care about this album but the obsession with numbers and the SO THIS IS BETTER THAN MBDTF!??!! is so fucking old.
Genuinely the worst YouTube video of all time
Bro’s got to be trolling
TND
😕
I’ve been fake rapping “my p*ssy pink my ass brown” for years now just to make my sister laugh and omg sexyy red actually did it.
Well I just listened to a good part of the album and I&#39;m confused with this rating. It was trashy, lazy and imho quite dumb actually. I&#39;ll have to disagree with mr Fantano here. But with no hate, bros are way too pressed in these comments, jeee
Paid by the record labels obviously
That’s it, no more melon forever
The first time I listened to her album , I was shocked that I made it all the way through, and that it was actually well done.  Not surprised at all by this review.
Idc about the score or anything but let’s be real.. can yall really picture this man bumping this in his car? 😂😂😂
sexxyred definitely let him hit
Russia Just Banned Homosexuality. In America this is what&#39;s making people go nuts.
Keep in mind that he gave MMESYF lower rate than this
Best rap review in a while tbh
I listened to this album today and I actually have hope for trap music again. Well deserved 8
no way this is an 8
Will it’s been a fun run farttano. Goodbye
Fantano your ex aint gonna take you back
?
Bruh walked away with a bag after that review
i’m a huge fan Tony, but this is bullshit
STRONG 8????? I NEVER KNEW FANTANO WAS INTO THIS TYPA MUSIC
lmao
Who got a gun pointed at you Bro?  This album is a strong -2
Neat review, looking forward to the calm discourse!
Didn’t expect this from Rogaine Fantano
Wait what?!
Bro what
“Wouldn’t it farm a lot of engagement and make me seem really unpredictable and interesting if I really LIKED this album? Hmmm” - Melon before his first listen
This guy give birds in the trap a 3/10 so yeah 🙃🙃
There’s no way this album is better than Census Designated
no way
You are shameless Anthony
she payed u for dis shit
Bro is really part of the agenda with his reviews
This is actually insane
Sorry but not
Bro???
Nah B I can&#39;t be seein this album getting a strong 8 and Ken Carson gettin a 3 for doing the same shit except with better beats.
I know you are single now, but giving bloated scores to artists you wanna smash ain&#39;t gonna make it happen
I don’t really get lying. Like why pretend to like the album lmfao. Gotta pay bills ig
I think this may be the most least expected thing that&#39;s ever happened, good for her though, I&#39;d give this album like a 5
Ngl this is disrespectful to music all together. I’m sure you’re doing this to go against the grain as you typically do but come on now this isn’t it
jesus fucking christ fantano doing spins and bounces on it
When yall gonna learn that these videos is what pays his bills. He don’t make money if he gives it a 0 like  he should’ve
the reasoning is fine but you didnt apply this logic for other similar albums<br>your feminist bias is too strong lately and its kinda unfair for other artists that make the same type of albums and get very low scores
no way he gave this shit an 8 when agc got a 3💀💀💀💀
Bro rated this better than utopia. Hes officially lost the plot
Are you actually trolling?
This man trynna hit that
agree with most of the cmts. sexxy red is like god but better. yeah lol
I thought this was an April fools joke then i remember its december...
If you watch the whole video then you can understand why he gave an 8, but while his reasoning makes sense when you apply criticism he has gave to other albums you would think he would have some other problems with it
Bro what the fuck is you thinking
The deluxe tracks are better than the original and the original was fire. Not gone lie it’s like that
This is the king of the internet music dorks??? Yall get your opinion from the guy who thinks lyrics about your butthole is an 8/10 😂😂😂😂<br><br>What a joke.
Industry Plantano Here!
Yall still take this dude seriously?
God awful review
Melon there’s no way you’re saying this is better than any thug record you’ve ever reviewed
glad to see that sexyredd dropped an album better than kendrick lamar&#39;s &quot;DAMN.&quot;
Man… come on
I’m done with Needle Drop, 8 is crazy. Your opinion doesn’t matter anymore.
skeeeyee
so whats the logic behind giving ken carson or destroy lonely a 0 but this a strong 8
If he gets exposed for being a pedophile don’t be surprised cuz of how hard he’s tryna appeal to the females
most of the time your valid but you a clown for this one 😭
he gave her an 8 so she can slide by and rub his head for him. He aint slick
If you put this over Sprain album.on your end year list i will be mad
Bruh
Is he trolling?
everybody get so mad over opinions then makes 0 effort of actually formulating an argument or brining up things wrong with the project. pretty major issue i have with hip hop discourse in general
Nah I can’t take you seriously any longer 😭
Fantano must be planning to date the sexy puke 🤮 red in his coming days
fantano thinks this is the best female rap album? 😭
Where are the classics?
Oh boy get ready to have people compare this score to ones that he&#39;s given for totally different albums until the end of day.
imagine actually getting pissed someone has a POSITIVE opinion on an album
Bros views are getting low
The comment section needs to get a grip. You place too much stock in a man’s opinions on music.
You trippin
why are you so critical about other albums but then this one you throw all logic out the window and rate it based on how ridiculous it is?
He smoked Lana on Ultraviolence for the lyrics being cringy but then gives this an 8? At least Lana&#39;s lyrics are more original.
This is your worst take ever hahaha
How do I dislike a video more than once
Big fan from brazil since many years ago. From now on, im not.
hes getting cooked thank god
I thought this was a joke
No fucking way 😂 no way. There’s just no way.
nah this is wild
No dude, like c&#39;mon. A girl who sounds like a boondocks character on every song does not deserve an 8 lol
I love your content, but the cooking you are receiving after this review is definitely deserved lmfao.
I think the internet’s busiest music nerd has a crush on Sexxy Red…
Super valid review
I’m convinced Fantano is a puppet of the deep state to give status to upcoming industry plant, Illuminati driven artists
this gives me the same joy as when you gave sematary a good review. excellent big brained teeth man
You&#39;ve become an embarrassment
It&#39;s decisions like this that reminds me Anthony is almost 40.
Crazy he thinks sexxy red makes better music than Wayne and 2 chainz
Honestly Melon this shit was trash, respectfully
Give this a like to support your deaf content creators
Wear your raincoats in these comments fellas, enough tears in here to drown you!
I really appreciate that needledrop likes music that isn&#39;t afraid to be annoying (in a good way)
Really love that most fantano fans hate this review. It&#39;s awesome seeing thems seethe
Man, I’m not even a hater of Sexxy Red, but I feel like this is a wild take. I think its a really well thought out and nuanced review that added more context. But I for the life of me could not rate it THAT high. I would say maybe like a 5 or a 6 for me personally.
mbtdf isnt even top 3 kanye
I get why she got an 8. She is really unique, and stands out especially among the current state of hip hop. Aggressive, authentic, catchy libertine anthems.
I respect your opinion, Fantano.
Nah this dude is insane . This isn’t funny Anthony how can you give this an 8 ? Equal to Blonde? Better than MBDTF? I get that you’re a hipster but you’ve got to stop simping for random female rappers
8/10 let that sink
This gotta be a joke right?😭
How bricked up do you have to be to give this album an 8?
This has to be a joke. Is she rated by using a grading curve? Ohhh… her team paid you. Got it.
Hell nah😭😭
This gotta be a bait bro☠️
So inspiring that sexxyRed already has created more influental music than the likes of wu tang and nas already in her career
He enjoyed this album more than Blank Face LP from ScHoolboy Q<br><br>Crazy
If hood hottest princess deluxe had a single bnyx beat this would’ve easily been a light 0 to a strong 0
you trippin melon.
I can not believe the music critic who’s job it is to critique music critiqued some music. He deserves to be sent to prison.
I’ve always thought Sexxy Red was just a SFW Cupcakke. after hearing this, yeah I’m doubling down on my take that she really is SFW Cupcakke
People are taking this review way too much face value<br><br>The mf enjoys this album a lot, are you really gonna knock him for that?
A Gift and A Curse was not Gunna’s best project but how is that a 1/10 and this album is an strong 8/10? That’s not to Sexyy Red isn’t dope but idk bruh
Lmao is This is the guy y’all base your music taste on? Lmao
This might be the most negative reaction to a yellow flannel since lil pump
someone please take his music rating license
Better than 2014 FHD, 4YEO, Born Sinner, DAMN., Mr. Morale and The Big Steppers, Quaranta, Voir Dire, NWTS, Views, IYRTITL, After Hours, Dawn FM, House Of Balloons, MBDTF, Yeezus, ye, Donda, DBRodeo, on par with Rodeo, Birds, Astroworld, H&amp;V, Fetti, On Par with Alfredo, Bandana, channel ORANGE, on par with blonde, MOTM 2, MOTM 3 (Man On The Moon), Die Lit, Wolf, on par with Flower Boy, better than CMIYGL, Live Love A$AP, Long Live A$AP, At Long Last A$AP, Daytona and It’s Almost Dry
Wow is this guy a barb
The check cleared.
This is Higher than mbdtf blonde utopia and whole lotta red….
Guys he gave this a higher score than mbdtf, can you believe this is higher than mbdtf? It’s crazy, it’s two points higher than mbdtf. Did you know that this guy likes sexyy red more than mbdtf? It’s insane, he actually gave it a higher score than mbdtf. It’s so crazy that sexyy red dropped an album better than mbdtf, because she did, according to fantano, because I don’t know if you’ve heard, but he gave her album a higher score than mbdtf
So Hood Hottest Princess was more enjoyable to Fantano than Scary Hours 3. Sexyy Red is dope but that’s just wild. I mean I know he doesn’t like Drake that much but damn
i tried listening to it... not my thing 4.5/10
I actually rlly liked this album aswell
idk what you&#39;re on but i respect it lmao
So he likes it because it’s different/unique and bold with good hooks?
You can never take Fantanos reviews on women artists too seriously. Hes real biased
So, IDMTHY gets a 7 and this gets an...8? ok
I know you fucking lying bro
Wow…. Big rating.
YOU GAVE NEW BLUE SUN A 6 <br>BUT GAVE THIS A HIGHER RATING ?!!!!!
Pls stop rating rap your so clueless that its acutally annoying
ye fans when he’s blatantly racist and antisemetic: <b>sleep</b><br><br>when fantano gives album rating better than MBDTF: it’s the end of the world
Fantano fans have no opinion no This album aint a 8 stop dickriding everything he says
She the female Chief Keef
OH HELL NAH
There have been a lot of times where i&#39;ve disagreed with Fantano&#39;s take but i could still understand why he gave it the score he did but now im just baffled, like bro how lmao
Even Trump supporters can get an  8 and beat DAMN.
Fantano Wtf
?
Dude. Melon. What? Oh okay. Wait no.
if a male dropped this album it would get a 3
Really craving that attention again huh?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN1d3HWOd54&amp;t=598">9:58</a> Did he just call her a tran?😂😭
To be fair its pretty good
This review is outrageous and I can’t believe you call yourself a music critic. You gave this an 8? This album is a 9 MINIMUM.
This is insane
Actually unsubbing this shit is crazy
She still aint gonna fuck you bro
count your days fantano
Nice to see feminist music get its due
U like this but u gave collegrove a 3
i get where you&#39;re coming from but i&#39;m not feeling it all. i find most of the songs to be painfully lazy and the rapping isn&#39;t... good? nothing comes close to a &quot;WAP&quot; type track which i found really fun at the time.
i love this review so much. great album, she&#39;s awesome. weird men keep hating!!
this reminds me of when he ranked Lil Pump Self Titled a 7<br><br>but worse
This is disrespectful to other good albums 💀
People actually go to this guy for music opinions 😂
I can’t believe that there was an interview with Tupac at the end of the album and that the twist was that she was telling this whole album to Pac!! Wow
Fantano is always virtue signalling. When men are vulgar it’s gross and misogynistic. When it’s women it’s 😇🤗 a-okay.
Not gonna lie it&#39;s warranted. It&#39;s completely enjoyable
Yeah anthony we need to talk
hahahahah this wont age well
people think good music has to be deep or philosophical or have have some big message, but sexxy proves u can just be authentic and audacious and still make original and distinctive music , i love her videos too shes just vibing and dont give a fuckk
So this is better than Mick Jenkins The Patience?
Got to be trolling
This review makes me glad i unsubbed him a few yrs ago ngl. 😂
Sexxy redd is one of the most succesful industry plants she popped outta nowhere has great promotion tean paid Raptv paid Akademik’s to promote her and now paid a bag to fantano to hit nail in the coffin alright alright i fw sexy but its not a better album than MBDTF, NWTS its funny how Fantano tries give weak ass explanation for 8 smh <br>When drake or another rapper spits these corny wacky bars Fantano just rejects whole projects and stop taking seriously fuck this guy man
Better than my beautiful isn’t real life
This is better than DAMN. Damn😮
unfortunate that half of these comments will bump wet dreamz 😪
KAMIYAHHHHHH
i swear sexyy red and ice spice are paying influential music peeps to speak good on them
You fuckers know that his rating scale is an enjoyability scale right?  It’s not an objective truth to where he’s saying, “ah yes this album is better than rodeo.” He just enjoys it as much as he does Rodeo and he has that right. Atrocity Exhibition by Danny Brown is in my top 5, but Die Lit by Playboi Carti is also in my top 5. Sometimes, mindlessly fun albums can be enjoyed just as much as meaningful albums.
why you cant take ret$r6s opinions like this serious
Anthony just love black women 😂😂😂that’s why this got a 8 he just like meeeeee 🫡
I don’t know on what basis it got an 8…the album doesn’t cover any wide topic or that she raps well , her vocals are even awful ….no only that but the lyrics not only mid but awful…. Yeah he gave strong 8 for the album having toxicity. WOW just wow
Hey you! Yes, you!<br><br>Wahhhh wahhhhhh wahhhhhh someone liked an album more than I did wahhhhh! <br><br>This score is borderline incomprehensible to me, but y’all babies are crying up a storm because the melon man loved the funny sex album more than you did. If that hurts you, you need far more struggle in your life. <br><br>Grow the fuck up and get a grip.
Good to know this is better than Imperial
Sometimes contrarianism becomes absurdity
this is not going to age well
Incels mad in the comments
this dude obviously isn’t even giving his own true opinion on shit anymore. i think it’s time to stop watching
Say satire rn
Bashes drake, praises this trash, fantano is washed.
Comments about gta vi is horrible and full of homophobia and mysoginy
Nah she brings crazy energy and first songs go hard…
Bro this is such a miss ☠️☠️☠️
I see Fantano is a bit uh.....pent-up as it were after the break up. If you know you know, our boys got that fever.
Melon really out here SIMPING harder than most of us, go get em brother !! 💙💙
But Tory’s albums are all trash right?  God you’re so delusional
You’ve outdone the Lil Pump review with this one.
This is definitely one of his best reviews because of all the backlash
oh wow anthony you sure are not like the other girls
Insane bait
Same score as blonde.. common melon head
And yeah 8 this album is in my worst
THIS IS BETTER THAN MBDTF, CURRENTS &amp; LET’S START HERE?? MELON HAS GONE PSYCHO
u can give zillakami and paris texas a 3 but you give this garbage an 8??
Lol bro needs clicks
Unsubbed and reported
Sorry Melon I love you and all but this review ain’t it. But I guess these days if you rap about how many dicks you can put up your vagina, you get an eight out of 10.
What dimension is this?
unsubcribed. Gave drake a 5 and sexxy red an 8 wtf
You think this album is better than Damn? .... Fucking yikes
ure telling me this is better than census designated are u nuts dude
Redux when????
Better than lets start here apparently
just hit the unlike
this album is so bad that I really am starting to really question fantano&#39;s motivations.
Revisas su álbum pero no el de Róisín xD
really bro? really?
Thank you for this review now I can finally unfollow 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
She’s not gonna let you fuck lil bro
Creí que era un meme, pero existe esta review xd
Man got divorced by an ebony women and now every ebony women mysteriously makes 10/10 music 😪
Shes not gonna let you hit bro, calm down
what
why are you like this
this will age like the lil pump review lol
Blink 3 times if you are being held hostage ti say this 😢
Fantano fans now are obliged to like and defend this album 😂😂😂
Hope she see’s this bro 🙏🏼😩
The fall on needle drop is apon us. The disrespect is unacceptable
fantano on his crackhead era 😂
🔥🔥🔥
Fantano wtf is this even. You actually cannot claim that ‘my brother already told me that my p*<b>*</b> smell like fish is a good bar.
I could make a lotta far out jokes here, some maybe a lil below the belt.<br><br>That being said I think he’s already gotten enough criticism.
Bro rated sexxy trash higher than Utopia and FATDSH3
שמוק אנטישמי
“Female Gucci Mane” is legitimately one of my favourite songs this year
I would unironically listen to a ksi songs over a sexy redd song, hell I might say even dream.
PINKTONY BROWNTANO &lt;3
I really hope this is an editing mistake
Fantano lookin for the hooooooes
Album covers you can smell
Genuinely has my head scratching
Not too long ago it would be considered an offensive parody.
Bros got his own affimtive action scale
What the actual fuck. 8????? She has 0 talent. Meanwhile MBDTF gets a 5
The melon thinks hes slick for saying hes feeling a strong 8 on this tran
this baldass gives 8 to this BUT TO MBDTF 6 ? NAAAHHH U TRIPPIN
????????this guy is a joke😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Her voice sounds like a fork scratching a plate
Fantano, she won&#39;t let you hit
Quadeca: i have died and am now a ghost morning the fact my family are greiving me. I have to sit and watch my mother cry as i beg for her attention. 7<br><br>Sexzy redd: my coochie pink my bootyhole brown. 8
😂 Calling The Billboards, leaderboards is like calling a bowl of oatmeal fine dining.
Back to the 4chan days i see, or maybe they never left?
You gotta be trollin
No nigga you cant give this shit an 8. This is clickbait for the sake of it
y’all in the comments are some whiny little babies. cope and seethe, cope and seethe. oh boo hoo, he gave a woman y’all see as beneath you a high a score. maybe reevaluate your internal biases, and ask yourselves why you’re so pressed about this man’s opinions? sexyy red is fun, boisterous, and talented. giving an album an 8 doesn’t mean it has to be the most profound, unique piece of work. sometimes music can just be fun and enjoyable, and equally as good as the more “artistic” stuff. and both types have room in y’all library if you’d address your internalized puritanism, misogyny, and racism. because we’re not gonna act like that’s part of the reason y’all are crying so hard in the comments. i totally understand why fantano doesn’t want to interact with a lot of y’all. you’re all miserable. sexyy red 4ever
I really love you Anthony, I really do but, this is your worst take, this project is ass and boooring, and you think it&#39;s better than DAMN.? You trippin&#39; bro
Sexy red is trash
this has to be a joke
guarantee that ppl in this comment section only heard the two most popular songs and not even the whole album. i don’t agree with giving it an 8, it’s more of a 7 to me, but it’s still fun and a good album.
What was he thinking??
Just saying if eminem released the exact same album with everything other the same other than him doing the vocals it would be a not good
I’m glad I’m not the only One cuz she won me as a fan with the hook she did on Drake song
Yeah you have the worst opinions ive ever seen when it comes to music
Ive heard 2 minutes of two songs. Wtf atony
maybe someone hacked the channel an this is an ai deepfake?
Nah this is the last straw im unsubscribing
She’s not gonna fuck you Anthony
I don’t believe that rating for a second, Gooftano
This is like Lil Pump all over again.
idk why people are more riled up in this comment section than usual, I thought this tape was fun.
you would give it a 3 if you weren&#39;t a simp
damn sexy red droping  better music than astroworld by  travis scott and damn by kendrick
If only comethazine wan’t really about all his bars so psychologically passionate like.<br><br>Mf would eat this girl alive on a song xD
If Drake dropped “Hoods Hottest Prince” and it sounded anything like this album I know for a fact Anthony wouldn’t be giving it an 8.
Bro is completely trolling at this point
Biggest industry plant of all time
This man is not serious
I don&#39;t wanna be that guy in the comments, but holy fuck you gave Lil Yachty&#39;s Let&#39;s Start Here a fucking 7 and this a 8 like what is your standard of quality?
If you think sexyredd lyrics are unhinged try to listen to Brazil funk and check the lyrics.
This entire video sounds like an ad read
sorry fantano after this i don&#39;t trust you anymore
melon she won&#39;t let you hit
Came to dislike. This the last straw after Fantano said Kanye wasn’t a perfect artist, but Meg is good. Also, he refuses to review any Tory Lanez music and reviews all these other “problematic” people.
Hellcats SRTs best rap song of the year
Damn people really mad that a sexual female put out the catchiest album of the year
Lmao
Why are y’all booing him? He’s right
lol, so you think that  this record holds the same weight that nurture did two years ago? im deaaad.
What the fuck
what in the blue balls
Connecticut&#39;s own! Changing the reviews game!
anthony likes being dominated
Is this a joke Anthony must joking
Cant argue about taste
This just proves to me that labels are paying you money for good reviews... or you&#39;re just criticizing music for the memes and don&#39;t really appreciate true artistry. <br><br>There are like hundreds of albums that you gave a low-average score that are better than this shit.<br><br>You fell off so bad
Begging you to review Noah Kahan Stick Season
this has to be a joke wtf
Can’t believe how politics gave this album an 8. Makes sense though 😅
So this is better than damn...and every J.cole album
would kill to see the  dislike  ratio  for this one
Way better than TPAB
Glad you enjoyed it but I found this one to be pretty annoying and grating
can&#39;t believe you haven&#39;t reviewed my 21st century blues by raye yet!!
this and the key glock review just proves how much melon loves his southern hip hop
I get all the jokes in the comments, but this has to be one of the worst takes he’s had.
embarrassing mate
This must be a troll.<br>There’s no way. <br>She’s got 0 talent wtf
Agree 100%
is this a joke
Better than DAMN? 💀
White people describing rap with<br>“Call and response” is the most ickiest cringe that has ever icked
what’s wrong with you bro
officially unsubscribed
after this review i have lost all faith in the fact fantano will start making better takes. either this was a paid promotion or fantano is out of his mind.
This has to be the most straight faced  joke prank review I’ve ever seen
Sexyy Red over Roc Marciano, Melon def is for the culture
Fantano said “Forget reviewing a conscious female rapper with some substance like Che Noir, imma give Sexxy Red an 8 today.”
Every single sexxy red song sounds like that one time Riley Reid made and rap and said the n word.
This review is like 9/11 to incels lol
The fact that this album got a higher rating then all of J Coles discography.........
Rating at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN1d3HWOd54&amp;t=599">9:59</a>
Ain&#39;t no way this is on the level of rodeo
this is a joke right ?
Welp….you’ve lost me now melon 🤦‍♂️
Of course Fantano being a cringe liberal loved this nonsense
why do u bait this hard :(
You ACTUALLY gave this the same rating as Porter Robinson’s NURTURE!?
Yooo how much did she pay you for this?
This score makes even worse the low scores you gave before, like for real? Music nerd? Stop simping for black girls you have a wife!
You’re a silly guy Anthony
Fantano is talking more about Sexyy Reds confidence and aesthetics than the music. He briefly mentions the music, this is not the move. If this was actually good music I wouldn&#39;t care he gave it an 8. But this is just ass cheeks, the beats carry her. This is disappointing, do better. Lyrics are goofy and he&#39;d tear apart anyone else who rhymed like this 😂😂😂
It’s official. He’s getting paid by the labels to do these reviews
ok so NOW he doesnt care about lyrics...
😂😂😂
we get it your wife left you
I hate sexxy red with all my being
Anthony is woke...he has to like this album
Your opinion officially carries Zero Weight... You&#39;re a YouTube personality who trolls from time to time
Simp activity fasho
Bro wgat
Blud thinks this is better than JEFFREY
all these comments by the mad men are really just… stop ❤️ this is a funny and high energy album
Everyone has an opinion. This happens to be wrong but, everyone has an opinion; even if it’s wrong. Did i mention that this is the objectively wrong opinion?
Melon what the hell is this
man ur opinion used to be pretty good
Fantano blink twice if ur being held at gun point to say this
I wanted you to rate this shit FOR SO LONG
Anthony Simptano the internets thirstiest music nerd
shit sounds like madden music whatever ur smoking i want some of it
How the fuck this a 8
Just another female rapper singing like a female stand up
This score screams...i don&#39;t want to offend. Straight garbaaage
What an original cover pose.
OMGGGGGG IS THAT THE NEW ALBUM TWITTER IS TALKING ABOUT? STRONG 8!!!<br><br>You&#39;ve fallen off so damn Hard man
YESSS SKEEYEE i knew sexyredd was a good artist im so glad i stuck with her!
When did Fantano get so Jewish
Is it April 1st? Cause there&#39;s no fucking way this is reality
That&#39;s just pure bullshit
Fantano is part of the problem
🤡
People keep comparing scores. Can someone explain why this album isn’t an 8?
Fantano man, this particular review shows that your opinion on albums isn&#39;t really that valid anymore😂
she not gon let u hit lil bro💀
Drake could never S/O Sexxy 😂
sexyy red &gt; DAMN, MBDTF, yeezus, hypochondriac, idmthy, quaranta, j.cole&#39;s entire discography, most of drake&#39;s discography, mr.morale and the big steppers, wolf, cmiygl<br><br>think about that
Mfs complaining about this score 100% did not listen to the album
🤨
shout out to Sexxy Red for putting album on same level quality wise as Slim Shady LP B) <br>Detroit going strong.
So apparently this is hip hop album of the year according to Fantano
finally an actually good not racist/sexist take
Anthony your opinion is wrong 😢😢
This is a troll right?
He never fails to dissapoint
😮
Was surprised honestly, reminded me of Shawnna but did get a bit stretched and repetitive, should&#39;ve been 35-45 mins album tbh
I’m mad confused where does he actually give the rating?
Bro it&#39;s time to pass the torch 😊
odjebalo ci do reszty juz
I’m glad you didn’t let your love for the sisters get in the way of this review
I might have to go and actually listen to the album 💀😭
Wtf fantano😂😂😂
This can’t be real.
TEN/TEN. Cal Chuchesta approved.
This is the first time I’m actually shocked by a fantano review
okay so yall are like flies to shit whenever Fantano drops a good review but the milisecond he rates a raunchy trap album over an opinion you didnt even form yourself, you freak out? this is why the hiphop community online is so so so terrible, most of yall look at this dude like hes god and when he likes something that YOU didnt even listen to you cry. it kinda smells a little misogynistic in here...
He gave this a higher score than the watergate tapes. Let that sink in…
Can’t wait for the redux where it will definitely hold up over the period of 3 weeks and possibly be a 10
Antny reviewing style and attitude now. Roger.
You are trolling. This has to be for the memes.
😂😂
Fantano Wtf
This might be the first time we&#39;re freaking out over a Fantano positive review.
Fantano officially sold out to support this Industry Plant 💀
what
It&#39;s not that complicated to understand that each album is scored against HIS appreciation for projects in that same lane. It&#39;s an 8/10 as a ratchet strip trap album for him, it&#39;s not meant to be compared to Blonde, Yeezus or whatever. I could give a movie a 7/10 on a stoner comedy tier list, and rate it a 1/10 as a thought provoking dramedy.
You’re either a comical genius with this one, or you actually just have melons for ears and a brain
sexyy red is the kind of rapper that makes anthems
Someone please stop this guy reviewing albums
My head bald my booty hole brown
It’s so inspiring that melon decided to keep reviewing even after going deaf. So inspiring!
anthony has literally said many times to not take his ratings that serious and he’s not ranking albums against each other. y’all are over reacting
Same dude who gave a lot of trap albums a low score for being “repetitive” and “one dimensional”. This some generational level of pandering
This is a fun, energetic trap album that goes kind of hard. Is this now the metric for a strong 8? Baffling score, but you like what you like I guess. It’s like a strong 6 for me maybe?
WHAT THE FUCK ??
Strong 8? For this? I don’t think it’s a horrible album, maybe like a 4 or 5, but nearly a 9?
Oh hell naw
this is a new low for you mr anthony
The fact that he rated this higher than TPAB is insane.
Oh my god
Kanye fans seething, that&#39;s my goat
Insane..
This is the last straw
Melon, rating an album a 10 because the artwork is &#39;&#39;horny horny horny horny horny horny horny horny horny horny horny&quot; is not a very good way of reviewing the music =/
She is not letting you hit😭🙏🏿
Oh?
Ain&#39;t no fuckin way 😂😂
This shit actually pissed me off. Strong 8? Sexyy Red is horrible! This album is a strong 0! MBDTF got a 6/10. TLOP got a 7/10. Astroworld got a 7/10. Utopia got a 7/10. Swimming got a 3/10. Culture got a 7/10. Without Warning got a 7/10. Not All Heroes Wear Capes got a 7/10. Heroes and Villains got a 7/10. Not even Rodeo got a strong 8 and Rodeo is so far clear of this album it isn’t even funny. How the fuck does anyone take you seriously after this? Just exposed you don’t know music.
You just can’t be serious
Interesting way to declare the fact that you just left &quot;pound town&quot;
Female kendrick lamar ladies and gentlemen, female kendrick lamar.<br>Just as i predicted
Why tf is this on par with King&#39;s Disease III and Mr. Morale, just ask yourself Melon, &quot;Is this album as good as King&#39;s Disease III AND Mr. Morale?&quot;
I can&#39;t keep defending you mr.anthony
This is a 10/10.
🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
I really dont get the interest on this artist. <br>She is sounding to me like &quot;we have Rico Nasty at home&quot;.
clown
DUDE WHAT ARE YOU COOKING
???
Shes not gonna let you hit melon
Bruh whos listening to this. Covers arts so gross i wouldnt listen to this even if ur head gave it a ten
You’re losing me melon. 8 is crazy. Now I’m starting to believe LosPollos 😂😂😂😂
Sexxy Red &gt; My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN1d3HWOd54&amp;t=284">4:44</a>, Yeezus, Some Rap Song, DAMN, Marshall Mathers LP 2.<br><br>Good to know.
This is lowkey the most insane Fantano review , even more than original swimming review or MDBTF /Yeezus , i really tried to listen to this LP when it dropped but besides maeby that Nicki feature its just very bland and repetitive
She&#39;s not gonna fuck you lil bro
This is kind of like liking pink flamingos, except that this is even more shallow.
Unsubscribed. Deluded.
I just listened to the album is was lack luster bruh wtf you got paid to give this a 8? It’s a solid 4
this review made MBDTF&#39;s rating stop hurting
She not gon let you hit bro
Music is dead
Welcome to crypto-misogyny, the comment section 🙂
Man I’m never listening to this Melon again. Usually I understand his takes even if I don’t agree, but this album is fucking awful, impossible to listen to, and he gives it 8/10? Yeesh
I am never going to take you seriously ever again.
BASED
This shows you how biased you are to artists you personally hate. It has shit to do with the album, just how you personally feel
How many times does melon have to explain that scores can’t be compared to one another, because it’s not some kind of objective scale. It’s just a numerical representation of his enjoyment of the album. Grow tf up fr
Nah at this point Melon is just a simp
Anthony probably thinks this music is empowering for woman…
dude if drake said that exact same &quot;brother alreadly told me that pussy smell like fish&quot; line you would not have laughed and called it &quot;lyrically scathing&quot; you&#39;d call him a teenager and say how childish he is.
This guy actually thinks that sexyy red has made an album better than both swimming and circles, mr morale, and almost on par with beloved paradise jazz
you are a melon
This is really rated better than every Yung Lean album.
you also gave this review more time than longer projects with more depth... how much did they pay you seriously? see you at the grammies next year dude.
MBDTF is a bad album.
dead no joke this feels like a sad attempt to grow your female audience. thats the best i can do for reasoning at the moment.<br><br> you never actually had any open ear or respect for rap / trap or harder alt hiphop music. you consistently rip apart newer male artists who try things and go against the grain, literally dumping on young artists trying to do way more and experiment way more- then take every single thing you <b>dislike</b> about them and say it is an outstanding, confident, strong quality in sexyyredd. <br><br>you dropped your lyrical standards to gawk at &quot;simplicity&quot; and &quot;hard beats&quot; well mocking anyone from newjazz trap who does the same thing in a spaced out way.<br><br>you support here saying ANYTHING lyrically yet have entire compliations making fun of more creative (although absurd) lyrics and throw them aside.<br><br>for this artist everything was the opposite for you. why? Im not making joke comments because I want to know your actually reasoning.<br><br>the amount of artists youve actually used as a punching bag for being different just to stroke over this project is really insane to me considering your platform and reach.
“Y’all know this is just my opinion right?”   No.  I don’t believe you.  It’s not genuine.  You are either giving her a pass because you are afraid of being too critical of a black woman, or you are lying for the sake of interaction on the video.  This is inconsistent, double standard, bullshit.
That’s it I’m not taking this man serious anymore
This guy feeds on shock value y’all should stop giving him a platform
you literally make fun of nav and gunna brutally for lyrics- even JCOLE, DRAKE AND KENDRICK FOR LYRICS, and then call &quot;my name is sexyred i aint no singing ass bitch&quot; a line that <b>goes against the grain</b> <br><br>you actually suck dude the more I listen. theres no way you think this is a good take.
Is this the best trap album since Rodeo, Fantano?
SO IF IT IS ANY MODERN NEW JAZZ OR TRAP ARTIST, OR ANY OF THE ATL WAVE, OR ANYONE ELSE- BEING TOO SIMPLE OR LIGHT IS BAD. LYRICALLY YOU RIP PEOPLE UP. BUT WHEN SEXYRED DOES IT IT PROVES HOW GOOD IT IS? DUDE YOU ARE LYING THROUGH YOUR TEETH.
Its amazing to see how sexyred dropped an album better than house of balloons
are you fucking serious
Big L esto es lo peor que he visto mientras tanto Yve Tumor y Jane Remover les dio un 6 , stop dickriding
Im unsubscribing... you are an industry plant... there&#39;s now ay you giving her a higher rating than Drake im out
I guess fantano really did shake his ass for her. 🗣️
Low 2 garbage it belongs 🗑
<b>*mega train passes by*</b>
Nahhhhh
i cant lie i gotta just unsub i cant reccomend you as a reviewer anymore. you disrespected such amazing projects to simp and give this an 8. thats insane dude. you have zero respect for music.
Yep, I’m gonna unsub now.
this is without a doubt the dumbest music take ive ever heard from another human. youre rating system is actually pointless in this moment and ive lost all respect for your takes.
dude are you kidding me?
she might let you hit
If you genuinely cared about hip-hop fantano... You would never have scored this what you did 🤦‍♀️
The 15 year olds in Fantano’s fan base are absolutely coping and seething right now and you love to see it. Horny trap music that slaps this hard is good actually! You’re allowed to have fun and enjoy things!! Wild to see this much cope in the comments of a positive review. What a miserable existence
Better than Damn
brother what.. what a miss of a review
I’m not a fan of sexy but I don’t deny her confidence and her realness, I believe Fontano when he says it’s a good album I’m just still not gonna check it out
this album cover is the autonomy of cringe
Washed ass opinion
She said if you give me a nice review I&#39;ll let you hit
Ah, the death grips treatment.
God those bars you are quoting are some of the worst this year 😂😂😂
You are the personification of the bigotry of low expectations.
Wtf is you on Fandango?
Your opinions qnd ratings are insanely invalid after this rating
terrible flow + boring beats + boring lyrics + big ass = 8<br>its simple math
Out of your god damn mind
🧢
I hope they&#39;ll add Sexyy Red in Fortnite.
chat is this real
Fantano has lost all credibility
Talking about funny bars? Yet you gave the melodic blue a 6 wtf
This is NOT as good as MrMorale, Taboo and Blonde. End your career bozo lol
i could accept a 7, but this??
ok so this album is better than BTD,UV,Honeymoon,LFL ,COCC,BB AND just as good as NFR??? im gonna kms
He saw the tape
what a joke u became melon
i lost my respect for you
but she can&#39;t even rap on beat
There is no way this is real. These songs are so lame and boring. They’re not even bad in a funny way, they just sound like every other female rapper trap song.<br>I fr listened to 6 of her songs to see if I missed anything, but every listen just wears me the heck out. This review has to be satire.
she not gon fuck u bro 🤦‍♂️
I&#39;m shocked she even got a better review than Drake, XXXTentacion, Juice WRLD, Pop Smoke and a lot more.<br><br>Has time started reversing backwards?😂
I promise you bro she will not let you hit
bro this guy’s losing his credibility
RYM doesn&#39;t agree with this review.
fantano is the poster boy for overrating certain female rappers
How is this just not a way worse flockaveli
Melon caught Sexyy Red&#39;s wind? Ok...
this is a joke right?
FFS from a cultural level, you’d think we’d stop supporting garbage music like this. She’s not making the world any better with her “art”.
Antonio el Fantas
Truly the most review of all time
Anthony just want to smash that&#39;s all.
This is a butterfly effect moment, this is it people. It’s here.
This album cover is grotesque. Liked it better when Kim did it and the rap sex kitten act wasn&#39;t so dried up and tired.
Uhhhhhhhhhh, idk about this one melon…..
Wait he really did rate this higher than every Jcole album
Cannot take your opinions serious after this one dawg 😂😂
What the fuck
According to Fantano this is... <br> <br>Better than Yeezus<br>Better than MBDTF<br>Better than The Life Of Pablo<br>Better than DAMN<br>Better than Mr. Morale &amp; The Big Steppers<br>Better than Utopia<br>Better than Astroworld<br>Better than DiCaprio 2 <br>Better than 2014 Forest Hills Drive <br><br>Just as good as Blond<br>Just as Good as Rodeo<br>Just as good as Some Times I Might Be Introverted <br>Just as good as Flower Boy<br><br>better than every Drake Album...<br><br><br>😐😐😐
Anything by NAV is way better than this shit 😂
Imagine being upset that Anthony LIKED an album. Couldn&#39;t be me 💅
🤦‍♂️ please let Hip Hop die in 2024
Melon is this really better than MBDTF be honest with me
This is the 2023 version of Lil Pump getting a 7 and I&#39;m here for it
The first time I’ve completely disagreed with a positive fantano review.<br>I’ve enjoyed plenty of Female MCs over the past few years but sexyy red is a no-go for me personally.
I swear he gives female rappers 2-3 higher than what they deserve, in this case 7-8
Giving this album an 8 is the most based thing I&#39;ve seen antny do in a minute, I love all these Kanye stans crying in the comments
He’s smoking crack now this is some biased shit
i actually went and gave it a listen and i do have to say that her flows, beat selection and song stracture is really good and she reminds me of gangsta boo (rip) BUT there is no substance to the album and the lyrics are horrendously bad. so idk am i missing something? in your review for without warning you literally said that neither of 21 savage or offset are lyrical enough to carry an entire project, so how come sexyy red get a strong 8 and without warning a light 7? without warning has stronger beats, better flows, better song stracture and the fantastic duo that is 21 savage and offset. i normally do not like to compare reviews but this one was asking for it lmao
This is giving me an aneurysm. Anthony on that brain damage inducing za za shit real potent
100% agree with fantano, fuck these haters. This album hits different. Sexyy Red for president!
stop the cap
i lost all faith in the rap community when everyone started dunking on Sexyy Red for making by far the best chorus on For all the dogs. thank you fantano
nasty
Source of power? 🤣🤣🤣
Feel like he picks and chooses when to criticise things such as recording quality or  bad or silly lyrics
The comments mostly are: no way you rated this higher than <b>insert album name</b>
He rated this the same as simbi by little simz...
same score as after hours 😂😂😂 wtf is this guy smoking
She really has these gangsters saying hell cats SRT and Skiiiii yeeeeee.
WHAT THE FUCK ANTHONY AN 8????
NegrophiIethony Feminoidtano here, the internet&#39;s busiest vulgarity nerd
all the people yapping in the comments about this being higher than (insert album here) just show the problem with rating music numerically in general. you can like something like this more than a beloved classic rap album, you’re allowed to do that. fantano just presents his opinion in an objective way because that’s what music critics do. and there’s always still a hint of misogyny laced in all the sexxy red hate, too. just deal with the score and move on lol
To remind you all, he rated this album as the same level of The Life of Pablo, every Denzel Curry album and 2 points higher than MBDTF lmao
Am I wrong for saying fantano isnt as objective towards female rappers or am i just a misogynist, hater, or a incel? I genuinely feel as though he holds a much higher standard towards male artist on the flip side of the coin.
Ok, THAT’S IT!… Time to unbutton the yellow flannel 🫡
Better than DAMN.<br>Better than Yeezus<br>Better than any J. Cole album<br>Better than MBDTF<br>On par with Blonde<br>On par with Flower Boy<br>On par with Rodeo
Is this some kind of sick Twilight Zone joke?
let it be known this album is better than damn
He’s gone and lost his mind
<b>skeeyee moment</b>
😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😑😐😐😐😐😐
🗑
Stop.
GTA 6 being offical and having a release date was not the most surprising thing that happened today.
i can’t defend you anymore Anthony
Unsubbed
Lol seeing comments be mad is truly hilarious😂
Lmao didnt expect this
I guess pitchfork isn’t the only one who thinks this is better than utopia
This album is 22 songs. It’s not an 8 even if there a good songs on it. Be realistic and give it a 5-6
You are on drugs sir. Their is nothing good about her abominable music
Truly better than half of Kendricks discography! Bravo melon!
People need to learn how to separate art from artist
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN1d3HWOd54&amp;t=347">5:47</a> 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I mean it&#39;s at least a 10 for Sexyy letting us know that her coochie pink and booty hole brown. Also, it&#39;s additional 10 for letting us know in every song that she do be fuckin fr fr 😩😩😩
What da fuck
In our hands we have one of the greatest trap projects of this decade (according to melon man)
So this is the new Lil Pump review?
The fact he rated a gift and a curse a 1 but this is an 8 is crazy
Just dislike the video guys dont even watch it
I knew it! I knew this was way better than MBDTF, thanks alot melon for the clarification!
I&#39;m gonna SkeeYeep this
This has lost my respect for this guy . Like come on you cant be serious , You mean this shit as project is<br>Better than DAMN.<br>Better than Yeezus<br>Better than any J. Cole album<br>Better than MBDTF<br>On par with Blonde<br>On par with Flower Boy<br>On par with Rodeo <br>You just have lost your shit and are inserting politics into music . It dosent mean a female rapper would always be good , There are good female artists you always rate them positively because of the politics. Just think for a second even better than DS2 lol .  FIX it Fantano
I&#39;m about to have a fucking LosPollosTV arc
comment section is so funny
all credibility lost.
Love this but hate Dance Gavin Dance?
I listened to this album and I gotta say, this shit is some ass, how did this get a strong 8 😭 like it’s so boring 😭😭
Lolllllllllllllllllllllllllllll HE saying graduation and this shitty as project are equal lmao,,, guy has to stop doing new gen artist will never reach the level if you are like these shitty as projects more than the ones which deserve
Bro blink twice if you need help fr
Wow. Wasn’t expecting this. Refreshing review😳😎
you will never convince me fantano actually likes this album
so sexyy red album is on par with blonde according to melon man <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/A8MfY-_pEIKNr8oP78-AGA"></a><a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/A8MfY-_pEIKNr8oP78-AGA"></a><a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/A8MfY-_pEIKNr8oP78-AGA"></a><a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/A8MfY-_pEIKNr8oP78-AGA"></a><a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/A8MfY-_pEIKNr8oP78-AGA"></a><a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/A8MfY-_pEIKNr8oP78-AGA"></a><a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/LsMfY8P6G-yckNAPjoWA8AI"></a><a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/LsMfY8P6G-yckNAPjoWA8AI"></a><a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/LsMfY8P6G-yckNAPjoWA8AI"></a><a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/LsMfY8P6G-yckNAPjoWA8AI"></a><a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/LsMfY8P6G-yckNAPjoWA8AI"></a><a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/LsMfY8P6G-yckNAPjoWA8AI"></a><a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/LsMfY8P6G-yckNAPjoWA8AI"></a><a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/LsMfY8P6G-yckNAPjoWA8AI"></a>
Is this an out of season april fools joke
r u dumb?
Yeah, we gotta get yt reviewers out of hip hop. This is laughable.
Better than Lemonade??
Her beat selection is really good
Bro what the actual fuck 😭
Melon wilding
Is this a troll?
Anthony... What the fuck are you talking about?
You&#39;re joking, right Anthony?
I’m certain almost everyone complaining about this score hasn’t listened to the album. I bet a good portion of them haven’t even watched the review.
If it was called “Hood Hottest Butterfly,” it surely would’ve gotten a 10
Yellow flannel on a Sexyy red album make it make sense
I never say this sort of thing, but rating this higher than Aesop is truly insane to me. What&#39;s going on there melon.
this shit is NOT better than Utopia lil bro 😭😭😭🙏🙏🙏‼️‼️‼️
I bet Fantano is lying in his bed right now with a smug smile, twiddling his mustache, imagining that he has enlightened us all.
This Slut Pop genre seems pretty odd to my ears. Not sure if Im all in.
THOSE LYRICS THAT HE PICKS TO QUOTE ARE FUCKING TRASH
Sexyy red goon brazy
I fucking knew he was gonna like it, he hates good stuff but likes trash like this?
Petition to rename “I’m feeling an 8” to “I’m feeling a Denzel Curry album for this project”
That’s right!!!!!
Yall in the comments really be comparing anything to this rating 😭
I respect it.
Possibly the worst rating he’s ever made
Any all credibility is officially lost
I am sometimes very sick of this guys comment section basically just being a ground for memes. I generally just shrug it off for &#39;it is what it is&#39; but seeing a bunch of the top comments being outraged by the score for a female rapper being higher than &#39;the classics&#39; made by the mainstream male rappers right now genuinely doesn&#39;t sit right with me<br>Especially when it has the tone of jokey deflection to it that&#39;ll make it excusable as soon as it gets leverage against it
Every single lyrical example he&#39;s given in this video was GARBAGE. Anthony has lost his fucking mind🤣
This bout to be a certified lil pump moment
Am i insane or did he review this once, gave it a terrible score and deleted it before this
This score is diabolical
Great album review.
Please review &quot;Leave a Message, I&#39;m not Here&quot; by EASHA. She&#39;s one of my favorite artists
if the cover was uncensored he&#39;d give it a 10/10
Lil early for April fools Melon
Nah, Sexxy Red on these beats just works. This album crazy.
I love Sexyy Red but this was better than Heroes &amp; Villians by Metro to you???
Chuchesta got her pregnant
Already knew he would pander and give this audio dog poop a high score 😂😂😂
Rating this higher than IDMTHY might be disrespectful to art as a whole
People being mad at a guy giving score to an album will never not be funny to me 😂
THIS DUDE RATED A SEXXY RED PROJECT HIGHER THAN DAMN. THIS CANT BE REAL BRUH 😭😭😭
Good to know that sexxy red dropped an album better than:<br>Astroworld<br>DAMN.<br>Blonde<br>Utopia<br>Quaranta <br>MBDTF<br>Mr morale and the big steppers<br>NO THANK YOU<br>GUTS<br>Let’s start here <br>The life of pablo<br>Donda<br>Call me if you get lost <br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN1d3HWOd54&amp;t=284">4:44</a><br>Sremmlife 2<br>SR3MM<br>SOS<br>Savage mode ll <br>CTRL<br>Culture<br>Every Metro Boomin Album<br>Every A$AP rocky album<br>Every lil uzi vert album <br>Every J.Cole album<br>Every Pusha T album<br>Every tame Impala album <br>Every young thug album <br>Every future album <br>Every lil Wayne album<br><br>Thank you melon, truly the music critic of all time
melonhead really wants those likes 😭drake was right
I was coming in here expecting a 0 but was pleasantly surprised that Fantano gets it. Sexyy Red is just fun. Let life go and stop being so serious.
this album is NOT an 8/10 😭🙏🏼
No, no you&#39;ve taken it too far Mr Fantano
8/100 is a little bit high but its okay
anthony really needed those extra views holy shit 💀the new pitchfork
“Is this an out of season april fools joke?”
I think he’s just horny
Ahh, the princess.  Another one.  People need to go back to hitting their kids.  Hard.
I definitely heard those waka influences as well. That first Waka album was fire and this felt like a female sequel.
he can not be serious
fantano fans are fucking insufferable
It’s sassy season 💅
Anthony, quit the fucking simping
YOU DID WHAT
Why did you say that Sexxy Redd isn’t lyrical? “My pussyhole pink my bootyhole brown.” Kind of proves you wrong.
Day 615 of commenting until Woofthony Meowtano reviews an album by Woodward and Parker
This is the Lil Pump Review pt 2
L
Okay… I skimmed through the album and the one listenable part is Nicki Minaj‘s feature. And I don’t even like Minaj but in comparison she’s brilliant. Well, at least she has a flow.<br><br>Now I understand better why people are baffled about this review. Explain yourself, fantano!
Bro NGL i dont even know if this is satire or is he really serious . HELP
Is this the trashy N who sang about her bhole?
Label payed him a bag to drop this…
can&#39;t believe you gave this a STRONG 10 🍈
She’s not letting you hit bro
I was expecting a 10 wow Fantano you didn’t have to be so harsh
You gave Jane Remover and Andrè 3000 a 6 on their new albums and an 8 on this one… why?
WHAT?????????
I don&#39;t even like this album that much but god damn these comments are so annoying <br>😭wahhh wahhh what about kanye😭 bro wasn&#39;t even mentioned go home
This has got to be a fucking joke
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOO🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ GREAT JOB SEXYY!!!!!!
Hey Fantano! Thanks for turning around on Sexyy, I think shes very charismatic when you look past the vulgarity.
A strong 8 is an insane rating. Idc if you are rating it by &quot;party/club music&quot; standards; 8 is WILD.
When Fantano shits on trap albums and gives them a 1 the comments are full of “it’s his opinion, stop being so soft!” <br><br>I NEED THE SAME ENERGY!
Let me get a few drinks in me before I try this one Melon, but I trust you 🔥
I’m know that Drake stan will be FUMING when he hears about this 😂
Really disappointed with this score dude.  This shit is fucking hot garbage.  Seriously
Bro this is a fucking joke right??
decent to strong 8 is insane
This is a joke, seriously discussing the album behind him, I laugh every time he says ‘sexy red’
What are u on
Agreed. So much better than DAMN
Lmao based 😂
LMAOOOOOOO NO SHOT
is this the highest score he&#39;s ever given in a video in which he initially misspelled the artist&#39;s name in the title
Probably his ex-wife loved this shit and anthony is trying to get this crap much positive feedback as possible to get her back because there is not other explanation why he thinks this pile of diarrhea is an 8
Glad to see melon also found this project more enjoyable than DAMN.
Naw melon this ain’t it
lmao
Cannot take this album cover seriously with this stupid melon in the foreground.
Day 2 of asking for a review of LOVE + POP
I think it&#39;s factually proven that anthony has bad taste
A nine, melon? A NINE!?!?!
Review ghetto superstar
Maybe the opium niggas ovo goons Kanye Stans and gunna’s sexually attracted fans were onto something
🤣🤣😣😣 if you don’t gtfoh
this is really truly very embarrassing
Wtf is this? Fantano on crack
A score current Eminem and J cole could ever dream of
Hold up- he was being serious?
😔 it actually does kinda go hard. She sounds exactly like a female Gucci mane. 💀😔🤨 but see I never would have listened to that album like that.
Maybe Lemon is the rich baby daddy
So its apparently<br>Better than DAMN.<br>Better than Yeezus<br>Better than any J. Cole album<br>Better than MBDTF<br>On par with Blonde<br>On par with Flower Boy<br>On par with Rodeo
Sometimes Fantanos critical lense just flies out the window and gets ran over by a fucking bus that also happens to explode as a result of gas leak
Higher than Wayne, travis and kayne, utterly delusional.
A rare unbuttoned yellow flannel
I was bumping this album late summer so much you don’t know how happy I am to see fantano just getting it so much
This dudes ratings of music makes no sense
he really took that hitpiece saying he didnt review women high enough from a few years ago to heart lmao
The amount of people in the comments who are genuinely upset and saying shit like &quot;Fantano&#39;s credibility is officially gone&quot; just because he gave a woman a high score is crazy LMAO wtf is wrong with you people
if this album had viral trends this year I guess for once I am thankful the algorithm spared me such pain.
Big Sexxy!!!!!
Yo wtf lmaooo
FANTANO MUSIC REVIEW CREDIBILITY SINCE 12/4/2023 = 🤡
I agree
Bro&#39;s inner male feminist is kicking in 💀
Based
Well..that was RIDICULOUS. Check out my track &quot;Resolution&quot; to hear one of the best rap tracks of the year! 💯
Better than FATD 😂
Ant wants some of the P or already got some from her. A 8 is like a 9 for him.
Ive been saying for a minute now that his taste is getting considerably worse, and here we fucking go i love being right.
I politely disagree with an 8. A -8 maybe. But for sure not an 8
this truly astounds me wtf
Bruh this is my first time being disappointed with Fantano. Hot garbage album
You are a joke
I can&#39;t believe the &quot;suck a btch toe&quot; girl got an 8/10. Wtf is even real anymore
Why don&#39;t you do more metal reviews??
WTF ready 4 this trolling culture to be over 🤦🏽‍♀️ 😩 🙄
Hoes mad
Guys ratings are usually relative to the artist I’m sure he likes rodeo way more than this album
THIS IS WILD
They are so mad at this 💀
Sexyany Redtano forever!
Even Mick couldn’t grab a yellow flannel, but this does? Life is cruel
Take your pills Anthony
bros terrified of women since fetch the bolt cutters
you have gotta be kidding me with this shit
sexyy red one of the hardest rappers alive no cap
bro is complimenting wordplay as basic as &quot;nacho business&quot;, I should&#39;ve dropped a rap album while in grade school cause anthony would&#39;ve loved it.
I&#39;m sorry but wtf is wrong you.
Its reviews like this that give me consolation when Melon head gives a bad review to some of my favorite artists. Because if this is an 8, Melon boy truly has awful taste in music 😂 <br><br>Melon can’t go on about how bad MGK is (and he truly is one dimensional) and then act like this trashy monotone rap album is an 8.<br><br>Thanks for the laugh fanny
Anthony just because you gave her an 8 doesn’t mean she’s going to let you hit
Dude gives every woman a 7/10 or better ever since being called out for it a few years ago
8/10??? anthony, you need to reevaluate your life choices.
Celtics Shaq ass review
She’s already fallen off and i couldn’t be happier
Hood hottest princess&gt;&gt;&gt;mbdtf
incredible that a debut deluxe album is better than every Vince Staples project
I just don’t get trap. To me, this sounds just as insultingly generic and dumb as 99% of the genre. In what universe is this a better album than Gojira’s Fortitude 💀
Dump?
What is Anthony&#39;s problem?
This is a certified lil pump self titled moment
Yeah people probably going to be mad about this 🤣🤣
Ayo what the Fuck
Holy shit. My jaw dropped at the score.
here’s my thoughts on sexyy red:<br><br>as a high schooler i was a part of the “female rappers sucks they only rap about their pussy” crowd, which is a stance that is rooted in a lot of misogyny (even though men rap about sex very often, in graphic detail at times), but as ive gotten older and heard a couple verses i’ve enjoyed from female rappers, ive chosen to give female rap a chance, and ive noticed what i enjoy is when they have a bold personality, and dont really take themselves too seriously, and with that being said, i completely understand sexyy red and her appeal. She’s not a great technical rapper, hell shes barely a good rapper, but she has such a brash and fun personality and you can tell she doesn’t take herself too seriously as a rapper, not to mention very catchy hooks and funny quotable lines. also, another thing that i can get from her is the relatability to alot of people (not me personally lol) she makes music for the extremely ratchet girls that have a kid to a baby daddy they hate, drive an altima and smoke blacks. she is them personified, people that grew up in the hood know a girl exactly like her. I think she is here to stay, and i hope and pray to god that the industry doesn’t force her to do pop crossovers that strip her of her personality and charisma.<br><br>thats how i feel
I was initially  surprised  but now seeing  how mad some you guys are I 100% support it just like lil boat 2 when he gave it a 7
thought the beats were kind of dry at the beginning of the record, but ended up really liking it. She’s funny
is this his highest rated trap album? kinda crazy lol
Bro doing April Fools in December
As high as Melt My Eyez is wild
SHES NOT GON LET YOU HIT
I seriously hoped the yellow flannel was a joke. You lost all your credibility with this one.<br>And before y&#39;all call me misogynistic, so many other female rappers deserve higher praise.<br>Little Simz got a light 8 on a fucking album of the year, Megan is so much more talented, Cardi B has a nicer voice and her ghostwriters actually write good songs.
Wow there goes theneedledrop&#39;s cred. 8 for this crap? Seen what you give scores of 6s to in the past. unsubbing.
Bro is just simping at this point 💀
these comments fucking suck yes this is better than your stupid “untouchable” kanye album yeezus wishes it was aggressive as this lmao
Don’t even give Kid Laroi a real review and you give this an 8 gotta be kidding me higher than Drake, Post Malone or Travis Scotts album this year ?
Fantano I know you’re desperate after your divorce but sexy red ain’t gonna let you hit.
This new Young Thug album must be pretty good
i still find her name ironic considering she looks like a bloke
I love all of the angry men in the comments lol. Im sure there is a statistics term that I dont know that means that rating one album a 6 and another an 8, does not mean that the 8 is a better album than the one rated a 6. I wish I could explain it 😭😭😭
Keep it in your pants, Fantano
I love this
You get it ... Thank you someone does
If sufjan got the 9 this deserved it too ngl
The fact that this outdoes so many great albums that deserve a 8+
This is my new 9/11
Whadaya know. Fantano siding with Sexyy Red. You want to know what else is red? Communism.
You heard it here first. Sexyy Red has dropped an album better than DAMN
Yes definitely equal to sometimes I might be introvert<br><br>*sarcasm
what the fuck
One of the worst reviews on your channel
…
better than quaranta
Female Gucci mane does go hard ngl
Bro this is not as good as Melt My Eyez 💀
nah…..
Is this an 8 or is this just Anthony&#39;s jungle fever?
Thanks for the review mr bald glad to know this is almost three times as good as swimming
This is worse than Mbdtf or yeezus
And you gave aesop a 6
Completely agree that Sexyy Red has a classic of an album here, wayyy better than MBDTF, Yeezus, Currents, Astroworld, and Blonde. No way it’s better than Lil Pump by Lil Pump tho.
real music wins again
I literally can’t believe it this is my 9/11
Biggest miss of ur career so far melonman
No way he thinks this is better than Utopia
this over cupcakke is crazy
Glad to know that sexxy red has dropped and an album as good as blond, AND some rap songs, and BETTER than MBDTF
It’s incredible that melon hurt this many kanye fans without even mentioning him
You&#39;ve got to be kidding me
Way to honor Jay-Z on his birthday with this review !!
What the fuck is happening with your reviews this year
lost so much respect in your opinion man...very disappointing.
this is to pimp a butterfly if Kendrick was sexyy red
17 Favorite songs is ridiculous bro
LOL
If Fantano let that coochie breathe he would’ve scored it a 10
You have no shame
If his music creditability wasn&#39;t already gone, it is now
great to see sexxy red is already making albums better than mbdtf!!
Of course
Just like the good ol&#39; times (Lil Pump - Selftitle)
There is no way this is better than DAMN
Boy it&#39;s over black women left you go listen to Taylor Swift
Sexxy red gets an 8 but MBDTF gets a 7 even all these years later 😭
Think you would really fuck with TiaCorine melon you should give her a  go, especially I Can’t Wait there’s personality filled bangers all across that thing
Please Redux and give an 3/10
ahh yes cause sexy red is so different from all the other current female rappers
the way fantano lowers his standards for black female artists might be lowkey racist 💀
Bro it sounds like amateur local rap 😭
Her music is actually difficult to listen to. I find her talentless and annoying to listen to. Giving this album a score like that is some CRAZY shit.
Red Hood best Nikke ever don&#39;t @ me.
this is why people are not taking your opinions seriously anymore
He’s actually right, she’s got some hella gangsta boo vibes.
This album got an 8. Let that sink in…🗑️
He lost his mind guys... It&#39;s over.
Another great virtue signaling review 👍
If it was a dude that released this shit Fantano will call it narcissistic and misogynistic, smh. You only giving her this rating cause shes a woman
Trash
Embarrassing review
Melon it isn’t April yet
So this white boy gives this bullshit 8 😂😂. We gotta be careful who we let influence culture around this here parts
W
There is no way
yt comments outrageous🤦‍♂️ sexy red top 3 this year
Dawg no fucking way is this a 8 bro, wtf is going on I swear the world is turning upside down. Hip- Hop is fucking dead.
Ooooo boy an 8/10 this’ll be good
THIS IS INSANE LMFAOOOOO I LOVE IT
The fact that he likes TPAB over this classic is insane.
8/10 are you fr rn
8/10?????? Better than FATDs and LET’s START HERE BY YACHTY?? What
Yeah, nah…<br>You might wanna consider taking a break from reviewing hip hop my boy.. that or getting rid of scores entirely
Wow..... An 8.... Fantano has been bought! The fact that aexxy red is getting her ass kissed by so many people is quite disturbing to me.... I will forever second guess this dudes reviews now!
He gave this a higher score than Slauson Malone.<br><br>There’s no way that a beautiful and uniquely original record like EXCELSIOR is rated worse than something that sounds like every other generic trap female record that’s come out in the last decade.
theres atleast a 1% chance any of the people in these comments have actually listened to the album and are just hating because... yknow.
😐
WHATTTTTTT
Just give us the top 50 already
Better than Yeezus! so true
Bro being contrarian just to be contrarian
Oh lord 💀💀💀
what the fuck
This artist glamorizes every racist stereotype of black communities and Anthony loves it????
Ain’t no way
at this point i started to feel like melon just loves naughty black women
Has he ever broken down how he reviews albums? I don’t understand how this is rated higher than DAMN. I’m seriously losing interest in his “opinions” on music
Same rating as Rodeo is crazy
Is This video real ?!?
Guys this isnt April 1st
If it’s thot music fantano is gonna automatically love it
Ain’t no way booaa 💀
Who paid you 😂
You lost me with this one Melon. Feel like this is an attention grab review tbh
i swear to god if this trumpy gets a yellow flannel review and knower doesn’t even get a review i’m gonna be a little peeved melon boy
comments: people judging fantano&#39;s score without listening to a single track off the album vs ppl who heard it
HOW IS THIS THE SAME AS SWIMIMING
the dislikes being this high on a REALLY GOOD score makes me laugh so much. W sexyy red
According to fantano, Almost every denzel curry album is just as amazing a Sexy Redd DELUXE. Take a step back and really think about it
&quot;How is this better than MBDTF? How is this better than DAMN?&quot;<br><br>If I had to make a wild guess, I would say that maybe he likes this album more than those other ones? And like, that&#39;s it?
I know not
Bro outta touch 💔😔
She fr is saving hip hop🙏🏿
NAHHHHHH NAWWWW WAYYYYY BRAA, STRONG 8 IS OITRAGEOUS☠️☠️☠️
I bet Fantano knew exactly how controversial this review would be. So he decided to drop it on the same day as the GTA 6 trailer, to try to get some of the heat off him lol
This dudes a joke 😂
Ain&#39;t no way you gave this a higher score than Quaranta
All of the sudden Anthony wants to defend style over substance like he hasn&#39;t given shit to dozens of rappers for having shallow lyrics and focusing on sonics. Good one dude I totally believe this isn&#39;t virtue signaling
chat is this real
wtf is wrong with you
Sexy red thugga’s sister?
I literally can&#39;t take you seriously on your opinions on hiphop ... or music. Holy shit. This is embarrassing.
It&#39;s hard to tell if this thing with Ice Spice and Sexyy Red is a bit.
It&#39;s funny how we&#39;re essentially in the middle of a huge disco era, and not even tHe iNtErNeT&#39;s bUsIeSt mUsIc nErD can tell.  He&#39;s swept up in it.
Melantown melon melentown😂.
AINT NO WAY
Dude….an 8…..really?😮
fantano fans and music snobs are so fucking annoying bruh. just learn to have fun! the album is fun as fuck!
Hard to believe sexyy red dropped a better album than nas, andre 3k, drake and Westside gunn 🥵🥵🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
Almost as good as Good Kid Mad City<br>😮😮😮😮 ! <br><br>According to Melonboi
What the fuck
good for her
it’s 2017 all over again…
Honestly? Kinda love that he rated this higher than all the albums being mentioned. I rock with it
Nigga wtf is this 💀
Melon has to be her baby daddy in order to get an 8
melon down bad frfr
Poptism was a mistake
Fantano simping over her in a hour deluxe edition of that album😅😅😅. Now he likes it too. 4/10
Sexxy Red is fye cuz she sticks with what she knows and kills it. Knows how to write a hit too
what a fucking leftist.
Hood hottest princess is better than mdtf damn “All of drake albums” and DONDA 😂
Say sike rn 🫵
WHAT
Is he pranking us?
Giving it an 8/10 just for the bar about sucking off Joe Biden is wild
Nice to see Fantano hitting the mid life crisis and decided to start to smoke some crack, good for you melon!
Bro should not be allowed to review music
no fucking way this got a higher score than DAMN
You guys it’s all about context and expectations. Yeah MBDTF was a 7 cause Kanye could do better and had done better in the past…this album is great for what the expectations are and what the artist was trying to accomplish.
Quit reviewing music.
Anthony, get your testosterone levels checked
Sure, I haven&#39;t listened to the album, and sure, i havent even finished the review, but i have a preconceived view of this womans music and of your reviews, and thats enough for me. <br>You&#39;ve both left me very disappointed, melon.
I believe this man can write a review on a big fat piece of turd and convince me to be curious on how it may taste
anthony…no…please
what da fuk
I respect her real ness. Don’t understand why people hate on her. Yall same ones who hyped up cardi b
this album is the female equivalent to like an nle choppa album. i’m not sure if it’s pandering, stupidity, or whatever, but melon lost the plot
Anthony in his &quot;The hoes gon love this&quot; phase rn
New generational fantano review dropped
You’re joking…
Alright Kanye fans, the MBDTF review was 13 years ago, you have to let it go. There are new things to get mad at, like his review of Care For Me by Saba.
Lil pump logic
Sexxy Red, drop the album that&#39;s better than Dark fantasy and Kendrick Lamar&#39;s damn😂.
been a good 5 years or so since the last time like to dislike was 4:1 like this on a positive review
Wow this might be your worst review delete it ❤️❤️🥰
No way he actually gave it a better rating than DAMN.
Reinforcing the worst stereotypes of black culture has always been a thing for people like Anthony
Just unsubscribed
Ain’t no way 😂
you can&#39;t give the same number to Kristin Hayter and this. cmon.
Anthony you can’t be serious
The fact this is higher than MBDTF and DAMN 😂😂
?????
Oh this about to be more controversial than the Lil Pump review 😭
Stunned to see the yellow flannel.
Buncha white boys upset wit this album getting a 8😂😂. This album for the streets. Full of bangers. Y&#39;all wouldn&#39;t understand
8 foo???
This is why i cant take fantano seriously
This, I think, is the moment we stop (if indeed we ever started) taking Anthony Fantano seriously as a music critic.
I knew beforehand that the comments were gonna meme but I just wanna say; I actually really enjoyed this album too.<br><br>Sexyy Red W
This isn&#39;t Peter Gabriel - I/O?
Big sexyy is goated, well deserved<br>This review is about to set the internet on fire for a bit
according to Fantano, SexxyRed is closer in quality to To Pimp a Butterfly than to Yeezus.
giving this a higher rating than astroword is crazy
This day gonna go down in history😂
What
Remember when people thought he was trolling when he gave that Billie album a high score this is that on steroids.
I actually agree with melon here, I love how abrasively ignorant she is, it&#39;s like she&#39;s doing it to almost parody levels but it&#39;s actually catchy asf
She is not gonna let you hit dawg 😂
This album is just back-to-back-to-back bangers but holy shit people are going to be so mad at you
glad to know this was better than Melodrama, Channel Orange, MAGDALENE and DAMN
FANTANO I LOVE YOU BUT THIS IS THE ACTUAL WORST TAKE YOU’VE EVER HAD
Melon April fools is a long ways away lol .
Fantano waiting for the spotify wrapped ended so he could play the fck out sexyy red 24/7
No way you gave this full review and only gave THE GHOST~POP TAPE a short 😔
Keep in mind a strong 8 is the highest he has ever given a mainstream trap album to, on par with Rodeo…<br><br>This comment section lol😂
sexyy red better than every j cole album apparently 💀
I agree this is about as good as Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers
8/10 ☠️
🤦‍♂️cmon now
Why does this guy always review garbage pop music. Review good sh1t. Jazz, metal, underground music. Not this.
Her: Wyd?<br><br>Me: Listening to a melon intellectualize garbage female rap
I&#39;m too old for this shit man
This has to be a troll
This is Melon heads way of trying to smash Sexxyy redd
deadass sounded like he was boutta give this a ten
I am actually dumb founded that you said Kanye was a bitch in the middle of this video.
Hahaha fuck yeah melon, make the Kanye fans cry
Boy I hate to sound like a Twitter conspiracist accusing review sites and YouTubers of pandering to certain demographics but this is a bit much. I listen to street rap mostly, Est gee, Bagg, durk, YTB Fatt, 42 dug etc the category sexyyred is closely related to. And fantano’s listener base and fantano himself are some of the first people to constantly call out trap and drill for being boring or repetitive, and yet somehow this tape is an 8? Yeah idk about that one fam lol.
Worst all time take on this channel
This is the 2020s equivalent of the Lil Pump review.
I&#39;m sorry bro but I could not disagree more with this review. L take through and through
unsubscribe
But you heard swimming and thought that was a 3
you have to disclose paid sponsorships melon
I always knew you were an industry plant 😅
He just made her an 8/10!!!!!!!!!! That is absolutely insane!
Fantano seems to like rappers that are bold and funny so I’m not too shocked he likes Sexyy Red. But I definitely didn’t see him giving her an 8 lol
Fantano fans in the comments having the superpower to form an opinion on an album without listening to it is impressive
Not this Better rated than MMESYF
Our typical troll comments have come to a cease… HE ACTUALLY DID GIVE THIS ALBUM A GOOD SCORE 😂 I ain’t hating though… good for Sexyy!
I know famed music critic Robert Christgau once criticized you for a lack of female artists among your videos and I feel like you took it personally, Anthony. You always seem to rate female artists higher than what is truly warranted.
Psyop
bro gave NO THANK YOU a lower score than this 😂😂😂😂😂
Yeah, this is melons worst take by a long shot
No chance this is real
go back to thinking with your other head bro
Honestly a W.<br><br>She&#39;s got amazing chemistry with Sosa on Ghetto Princess
This got me questioning alot😅
Take it back
I never heard of her until a minute ago and after 9 seconds of listening and never listening again I give this the same classic status as As Nasty As They Wanna Be by 2 Live Crew now get that retarded brain out of my face unless u letting me eat out your fourth eye Ho
Sexy red nearly as good as Igor &amp; Atrocity Exhibition wth
Im glad you understand the artistic greatness of this masterpiece album
lmao
Sexyy Redd ain’t letting u hit bro 🤦‍♂️
This is one of his highest rated trap album of all time now. Same as Rodeo. Higher then any Future, Thugger, or Carti. What the fuck.<br><br>Edit: Also, the albums actually good. Misogynists mad.
Anthony if you have a crush on Sexxy Red you can just say so
is there some script we’re not following here like what the hell did I just watch?
this scored higher than the beggar btw. let that sink in
Anthony, I think it’s time we talk about your blatant female bias in regards to scores.
So this pile of dogshit is better than every trap artist careers?
Bro he gave this a better score than Andre 3000! Crazy Crazy
Aint no way bro gave this shit a better score than wayne and 2 chainz💀💀
Not April 1 fantano
So happy to see that Sexyy Red already has an album as good as Blonde!!!!
I&#39;ve truly seen it all.
Say sike right now
This why i love fantano. He could have easily given this a 3 and no one would have cared. But he gives credit wherever he thinks its due
this is honestly a W
anthony.. come on man…
This man said sexxyreds album is better than mbdtf . I may unsubscribe cause wtf
So this is the second highest score he gave a rap album this year huh…
Anthony just panders at this point lol
The lore of Sexyy Red’s album getting an 8 is soo good lol
yeah i can’t take him serious anymore.
STL represent
Anthony&#39;s midlife crisis has been interesting to witness.
We don’t value lyricists anymore in hip hop
No way
What in the Lil Pump Self Titled
this received an 8, sza ctrl got a 7, anthony on some drugs fr
this is a joke right
the turmoil this review will bring I’m ready 🍿
There’s a problem in hip hop. I’ve gotta say I’m disappointed in this review. You’ve taken the actual music aspect and thrown it in the garbage just to pat sexy redd on the back and get validation. Simplicity and Vulgar lyrics don’t make songs “fun or good”. You’re hypocritical in the one ngl.
Yes I truly believe this album is better than both DAMN and MBDTF, so influential melon boy!
Wow! This album has a better score than 808s and Heartbreak and MBDTF. This must be a very narrative, influential, heartbreaking, and compelling album that will leave me a changed man for life. I have to check this out.
Bro likes this album more than House of Balloons
Anthony you can&#39;t just give this an 8 because you love Trump too
Truly one of the artist we have
And in that very moment, Fantano became the Hood’s Hottest Prince
so you&#39;re telling me this is better than any travis album, and on par with Denzel Curry....
No freaking way this is a real review.
Boy aint no way boy…
You would&#39;ve given this a 10 if it was called Kids Skeeyee Ghosts
this is the breaking point where I and trillions of people stop taking you seriously
On your take that this would be an 10/10 album if Poundtown had the Ben Shapiro spoken word remix, I categorically cannot agree. Unscrubbed.
This is better than Utopia 💀💀💀
she aint letting you hit bro
This is the hill you want to die on?
Bro even put 36 chambers in the back to add insult to injury
sexy red wipes all of mac miller and jcoles discography’s??😭😭
Semi common melon L
No way he gave this a 8
Bro what
Ok Anthony
He almost gave this a 10!!! LMAO
You fell off with the reviews bro smh
I am completely speechless
better than mbdtf im crying
Naa melon is down BAD
Higher than MBDTF btw
I like it too tbh. Reminds me of old school lil pump, just that ignorant frenetic energy
you gotta be trolling
mf almost gave it a 9 💀
No fucking way 💀
oh my god????
ur not real
LMFAOOOOO
Finally you recognize real music
i refuse to believe you rated this higher than mbdtf
Aint no way
Boy what the hell
Oh but if her name was Sexxy Yellow you would have given her a 2 huh?
This is a joke
This just proves fantano glazes women. It doesn’t matter what you say.
This cannot be real...
for once people are outraged with a high score rather than a low one, very interesting<br><br>edit: he’s getting cooked right now hahaha
Melon rating sexxxy redd higher than MBDTF is a death sentence.
Good to know this album was better than utopia
I can&#39;t lie, I wrote off Sexyy Red when I learned about her. Even though her feature was the best part of For All the Dogs I just didn&#39;t expect her to offer the same quality on a track she commanded.
I get that you loved the album, but the that doesn’t mean you have to get a BBL
Huh???? is fantano spittin&#39;????
This that a yellow flannel I see
Come on melon
i’m ngl i actually just unsubscribed , this was the last straw ☠️
I thought the same lol
No fuckinb shot.
shit imma listen to it now
LMFAOOOOOOOO
L
i saw the yellow flannel and cried
GTA 6
Oh this is gonna be HATED
no, fantano, please.
Lets gooooo lmfao
BETTER SCORE THAN MBDTF HAHAHAHA
trap = crap
This would have gotten a 3 if it was a conservative man rapping 🦅
you put this above utopia
This the Lil Pump self titled review of 2023
My melon pink, his booty hole brown 🔥
When personal enjoyment signs a future of trashy garbage trap rap from talentless bimbos and makes it a reality.
Boy ain’t no way he gave this a higher score than DAMN. 😭
Love this ❤️
how r ppl shocked, he rated lil pump and yachty higher than mbdtf anything can happen
So inspiring that SexxyRed already dropped an album better than MBDTF.<br><br>Edit: Ain&#39;t no way 7k of yall liked this 😭sorry kanye u gotta quit now
Oh shit a very positive review for a sexxy red album thats not what I expected but it&#39;s quite nice to see. I know my sisters &amp; some of my friends love her music but i never cared to listen to her but I&#39;ll definitely check this one out now that I have some positive expectations.
Sexy red &gt;MBDTF smh Melon
8 is fucking insane
ah yes, hood hottest princess surpasses mbdtf i can’t take this psychological torture anymore anthony.
This got a higher rating than quaranta😵‍💫
the video we all needed
Great review Anthony, but I’ll admit that I wasn’t expecting you to start yelling “Shake that a** for Melon” in the middle of the review.
It&#39;s crazy how all this time, Women wanted to avoid being seen like this. Just a willingly, do it for a paycheck. It&#39;s very sad the way  society has come to.
She’s not gonna let you hit bro
no way you gave ts a higher score than mbdtf 💀💀💀
Melon I was gonna give it to you when you said the album was one of the best trap albums this year, unfortunately I have to tell you <br>“But I’m not going to give this album anything past a 5 because she is black and female” is not a correct or morally right opinion. <br>In my house we judge people on the content of their character and their music, not on the color of their skin or their gender you bigot
no way he’s wearing a yellow flannel for this
Not gonna lie melon, I’m disappointed. Sexy Redd ain’t worth an 8 neither are those projects, that score shoulda gone to all of Juice’s albums. Still fire tho keep grinding
nah fantano gotta get clowned on for giving sexxy red an 8. U ARE A FRAUD
It’s not April 1st melon
I saw the &quot;Sexxy Red&quot; typo Melon
if it was Sexxy Kendrick Red you would&#39;ve given it a 10
Better than Damn? MDBTF??
Hate to be that guy, but you give sexyy red a strong 8, but MBDTF a a light 6????
You can’t just say free your n word for 10 minutes and call that a review, Anthony
Are you kidding me.. he rated it higher then mbdtf
Troll review, i know damn well he didnt rate this better than MBDTF
No way this is more enjoyable than UTOPIA...
A strong 8 from Sexxy Red was not in my bingo cards for 2023
L&#39;RAIN ANTHONY
Anthony rating this album higher than mbdtf is truly mind-boggling and honestly worrying
W
You&#39;re brave. And correct.
Hoochthony Dadtano
Nah Fantano this is fucking crazy TAKE THAT SHIT OFFF!!! 😂😂😂
wow who knew sexy redd would come out with an album better than my beautiful dark twisted fantasy
Y-YELLOW FLANNEL‽
This has to be a joke. This had to be satire. There’s no way.
But its not April for another 5 months melon
wtf
solid review sexxany mantano
You have to be joking. MBDTF 6 BUT SEXYY MF RED IS AN 8 YOU ARE WASHED
Pinkthony Coochitano
I do not like you
You rated  t h i s  higher than the Lil Pump EP??????
Sexy Redd better than MDBTF???
A yellow flannel… 😔
huh
brain rot
LMFAOOOOOOOO
I always knew sexxy red would come out with a record better than DAMN.
fantano fs beat to this
this might be the most surprised i’ve ever been by a fantano review
it’s amazing to see how sexyy red as a debut artist has already dropped an album better than yeezus!
very happy with your score!!! i’m glad you’re able to appreciate the genius that is sexyy red
8/10??? NO WAY
Anthony Fantano, the internet hottest princess here
Fantano’s being all sexy unbuttoning his flannel a little this time to distract us from the cover
Melon you can’t just give Sexyy Red an 8 because you want to shake that ass for her
8/10??? FANTANO SEXYY RED ISNT GONNA LET U HIT
BABE WAKE UP MELON JUST SAID SEXXY RED IS BETTER THAN DAMN
Anthony we know that if the album was called “To pimp a Hood’s Hottest Princess” you would’ve given it a 10
This album is the modern day TPAB rap is saved
This review is gonna hit rap instagram pages harder than crack hit the black community
the secret to the yellow flannel is to be a trump supporter
Not the yellow 😭
Holy
Damn he rated this higher than Utopia💀
wait so this is better then utopia💀
AIN NO WAY
No way you gave this a higher score than Killer Mike’s newest album 💀💀💀
We, AJR, think Melon is the true Hood Hottest Princess!
NO WAY THIS GOT A 8/10 LMAOOO THIS IS A NOT GOOD AT MOST
You&#39;re so zesty drizzy
Fantano you don’t have to lie about this she won’t sleep with you
Aint no way sexyy red got the golden flannel
Ain’t no way…
Hell naww
8?!?!?!? Tf you on
Better than DAMN 😅
sexyy red getting a better review than bladee is insane
It wouldve been a 10/10 if it was called Hood Hottest Pimp a Butterfly
Fantano’s feeling Sexyy Yellow today 🤪
The hell is happening rn😂😂😂
If it was called To Hood a Princess it’d be a ten
This can’t be real
Ain&#39;t no way
Fantano there is now way you rated this higher than MBDTF and the new Danny Brown album. <br><br>I actually just processed how crazy this review is. This is one of the highest rated trap albums of all time and has a higher rating than any Arctic Monkeys, Thugger, most Kanye, and many many more. This album is a 2 at most. Fantano you’re CRAZY for this review. I honestly think that this is one of your worst ratings melon. Subscribed
Hood Hottest Melon
