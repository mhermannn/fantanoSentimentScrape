I was raised with a lot of hard rock and metal like: Mudvayne, Nine Inch Nails, Rush, etc. I also knew some rap: Nas, Immortal Technique, Atmosphere, etc. So when I heard Burial, it was familiar to me because it had raw emotion that I was used to. So much passion. But I also could here the modern electronic aspects of things. I brought up the dubstep scene because everything was so screechy and punchy and robotic. But this was smooth, deep, emotional, melancholy. Not sad, but touching. Yet, you could dance to it if you were awake at 4am and couldn&#39;t sleep. The best way I could describe burials sound: Music to listen coming back from work late at night. It&#39;s got that feeling of being exhausted both mentally and physically. It&#39;s like taking a sonic Jacuzzi.",
