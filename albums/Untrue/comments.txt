Classic Dubstep
Why does he have hair
Literally Untrue by Burial
my favorite album of all time, no other record will resonate with me as much as this
This review is missing a very important detail. Burial&#39;s masterpiece here uses all the attributes the reviewer discusses and creates emotional and humanistic stories. The crafted sounds and vocal samples take you on a visceral journey through the story he tells in most of these songs.
its a sin to not mention dubstep as much as you did. this is PURE dubstep.
this is my favourite album of all time, just a masterpiece
This is not music you review. This is a music that reviews you.
Burial is like that 30 min walk from the party to your place at 2am on a wednesday
To be honest it was really the first album/records that was the ‚Äòaha‚Äô moment but this one reached beyond bass listeners.
First time I heard that album I was learning about the dubstep scene in 2010. It was totally new to me. I had a friend of mine play me a couple of songs. I was raised with a lot of hard rock and metal like: Mudvayne, Nine Inch Nails, Rush, etc. I also knew some rap: Nas, Immortal Technique, Atmosphere, etc. So when I heard Burial, it was familiar to me because it had raw emotion that I was used to. So much passion. But I also could here the modern electronic aspects of things. I brought up the dubstep scene because everything was so screechy and punchy and robotic. But this was smooth, deep, emotional, melancholy. Not sad, but touching. Yet, you could dance to it if you were awake at 4am and couldn&#39;t sleep. The best way I could describe burials sound: Music to listen coming back from work late at night. It&#39;s got that feeling of being exhausted both mentally and physically. It&#39;s like taking a sonic Jacuzzi.
Ew shave your head melon
the constant rain is why british people produce the rhythms they so
Simon Reynolds wrote a piece for Pitchfork in 2017 titled &#39;Why Burial‚Äôs Untrue Is the Most Important Electronic Album of the Century So Far&#39;. It&#39;s out of this fucking world. If like me you love this album, read that article.
For those who haven&#39;t listened to Untrue on mushrooms, you are welcome.
everytime i listen to this album it feels like i‚Äôm on a nightbus
why does this nigga have hair
DUBSTEP NEVER DIES!
Omg he had hair
Im seriously impressed this guy made such amazing work under something like soundforge. I just cant imagine how long he spent  trying to perfect drums alone. Absolute legend.
The similarites of the soundspace of Burial - Untrue and the endless environments within Blame! are very parallel to each other. Sure it could sounds ethereal but I believe with the burialistic architecture and the vast distopia they both hold is something they both intertwine from one another
Dude gets it, but he <i>doesn&#39;t really</i> get it.
I&#39;ve been obsessed with this album for around a year now. I knew Archangel and untrue a long time ago years but I never really listened to the whole entire thing till around a year ago I&#39;m still listening to it now and that&#39;s why I looked at this video now. I guess you do know good music üòäüòâ
ITS UK *GARRIJ. Not garaaaaaash. Blasphemy.
Made on Soundforge ffs.<br><br>Its the best album of all time, unfortunately. Pack it up guys, we done completed the musics
thats a lot of hair
Just listened to this album in full and wow it is amazing can&#39;t even pinpoint the emotion this album gives its just amazing
this album gets me stoned
sometimes it‚Äôs ok just to say an album sounds cool
Really like his hair
Do Original Pirate Material!
I like to come back to this video once in a while just to read appreciative comments for this masterpiece
last time he had hair?
This album really is special. It&#39;s not often you hear any kind of music, never mind electronic music, sound so human.
Burial sucks, such as almost everything from underground electronic music. Too minimal, too boring, too repetitive, too ambient, too empty:  Trash music.<br>Only mainstream house, dance, and EDM music is great, OR oldskool rave early 90&#39;s, oldskool techno, 90&#39;s eurodance, and generally 90&#39;s commercial house/techno music which was great. Underground music always SUCKS&gt;
This album sums up a night out in the UK for sure.
If yall liked this record, I recommend having a look at Forss - Ecclesia
this man actually compared afx to burial üôÄüôÄüôÄ
This album is PERFECT for a cloudy or rainy day. Really encapsulates the atmosphere of that kind of weather
Are there any other albums he rates this highly? I‚Äôve become obsessed with this one
One of my favourite albums
The use of texture and space on this album will make your ears melt.
I like you better with hair<br>Great review
CLASSIC/10 is the only rating i expected, thanks melon - i still like you
Can someone please let me know who made this
I get why so many people love it, I just think it&#39;s kinda boring to listen to.<br>It&#39;s not bad but it&#39;s not rly good either for me
Can&#39;t wait for antidawn - burial r√©cord Review
found another album to disassociate to other than to be kind lol<br>my brother would like this too probably
What a stunningly descriptive review! As a music journalist myself, this explanation really does it justice
Actually burial was influenced from the source rave scene and drum and bass
And it&#39;s black and white..
&quot;What Richard D. James was doing back in the 90&#39;s&quot;???... there was no need for that, my man...<br><br>Jus&#39; call him by the gear he named himself after
While it is highly influenced by garage like you said, I think it was more a product of breakbeat, rave, jungle, grime and dub.
This album rocks
top 10 albums ever from UK/anywhere.
Raving into the night with tears in your eyes? I&#39;ve always thought Burial sounded pretty gloomy and depressing.
It‚Äôs crazy how he didn‚Äôt even make this on a daw
The album perfectly encapsulates loneliness in the modern world.
The only song I know by them is forgive
2021 and...yes I... still freaky lovin it. This record and all this guy&#39;s opera it&#39;s what bring me back to elettronica. Thank you Anthony for a super good review!
chicagoooooo
completely unnecessary history of house &amp; garage ahead of the review however
This album was among the drops at the time that influence my life and the healing that lifted me in difficult times.<br><br>Archangel, Etched Headplate, Ghost Hardware, Shell of Light, Homeless, UK were my most frequent repeats to this day.
Garage pronounced wrong, and its Buuuurial. Not Bearial. But the rest was spot on.
Woah, I haven&#39;t seen a Fantano video in years. He can grow hair?
Eternal grey skies. That&#39;s Britain. What you&#39;re describing is Britain.
This album is the predecessor to The Weeknd. Its extremely reminiscent of his first three records. There is no way his producer aren&#39;t heavily influenced by Burial.
Such an amazing album.  Still in my heavy rotation to this day.  Pretty much every song is a &quot;I remember exactly where I was when I first heard this&quot; tune IMO.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d1rxJTIJX8&amp;t=82">1:22</a> there you go. Ummm. Some elephants in the room, The KLF - Chill Out, Artful Dodger - It&#39;s All About the Stragglers. If we&#39;re into dropping names and showing our chops when it comes to cultural knowledge.
Peep the Kids See Ghosts record in the back  üòé
it&#39;s pronounced garridge, fantano. garridge
Untrue is the gauge of all electronic music, period
This album doesn&#39;t only depict the life of downtown/working-class London in the 2000s, but also the UK&#39;s tone in general of the mid-2000s era. Whether you are in London, Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham, Bristol, Truro, Edinburgh or heck even Cardiff, this album hits hard because it depicts that time of the UK&#39;s bleak, dark, grey and rainy era perfectly.
Bristol, UK.<br><br>It&#39;s a rainy day, cold, grey, bleak, dingey, like every day in the UK.<br><br>I&#39;m currently sood outside a McDonalds.<br><br>Alone.<br><br>I lost all my friends recently, we used to hang out here. <br><br>But now, I&#39;m here, all alone.<br><br>I quite like being alone, honestly. I must say, as an introvert, although I enjoy solitude, enjoy being by myself, enjoy doing my own thing without social responsibility, I do feel loneliness. I do miss the times I used to come to McDonalds with my friends, after a day out in the city, going to the cinema, shopping, just having a chat, having fun.<br><br>I guess, while I stand here, in Bristol, UK, outside a McDonalds, reminiscing on those times, I&#39;m a different person now, and I can&#39;t relive those friendships and those events of my past.<br><br>I would like some friends again, though, it would be rather nice. <br><br>Ultimately, I&#39;d like go out with them, where I no longer feel like I don&#39;t fit in, where social anxiety isn&#39;t a struggle, where I&#39;m no longer an introvert. Maybe, just maybe, one day I can rejoice with people in a McDonalds again.<br><br>It&#39;s only a simple request.<br><br>Only a simple one.
I also have two vinyls of Kids See Ghosts
hair
This album is what Blade Runner 2049 sounds like
I hear future garage all the time now but this was 2007. This album was ahead of its time a timeless classic
BURIAL
while admirable, an american trying to critique this album is missing the point. It&#39;s croydon wallpaper. It;s the sound of a nightbus from victoria to streatham. it&#39;s incredibly insular because it&#39;s about dark nights on the 133 passing by industrial estates with your hood up and your headphones in.<br><br>fishbone audacity
ur hair looks weird melon
I‚Äôm 33. I found this album in 2007 on /mu/. I knew I liked it. I had no idea that this album cover would immediately come to mind every time the word ‚Äúdubstep‚Äù is mentioned even 13 years later.
someone had his Francepill today it seems...garaaaageeee, how he says it its so funny, and fucx up my earnerves
Burial ia priceless!
This album is so fucking overrated.
Burial uses a lot of Metal Gear Solid samples, and later on uses samples from Zelda: Majora&#39;s Mask.  This makes me feel nostalgic and every time I listened to Burial it reminds me of my youth.
I love that his mum listen to his music and encouraged him even more when he was making his tunes ‚ò∫Ô∏è
shame how u focused on the sound over the meaning, and you didn‚Äôt even get it. the grime and dirtiness of london isn‚Äôt blissful it‚Äôs sad depressing and lonely. it‚Äôs not beautiful, it‚Äôs meaningful
This album did not age that well in my opinion
holy shit he has to bury the idea of ever having hair again
i love burial but mmm classic?  not sure about that.<br>his music is so repetitive and most of his tracks sound way too similar...
really, what is the use of this review? it is as late and superfluous as my comment.
Those bullet case sounds he mentions are actually a sample from bullet casings hitting the floor from Metal gear Solid fyi. Also look up where the vocal sample from etched head plate comes from XXX
There&#39;s a deep social and actually political backbone to this record - beyond the sound, the &quot;ah-ha&quot; moment - it&#39;s got teeth, and the deeper down you go the more it becomes a deeply spiritual path to empathy and self-discovery.<br>Great review, but you missed a few things.
It makes so much sense when you realize Burial initially starting making music based on tapes his older brother (I think) would bring back from garage, jungle, etc. shows (I think Burial was underage at the time). To me the album feels like it&#39;s on the outside looking in, it&#39;s like how he imagines what it&#39;s actually like combined with this isolation.
The best electronic album of all time, should be considered as one of the greatest album of all time
why does he have hair?
everything your saying is void until you learn how to pronounce garage fam.  Furthermore it‚Äôs a bit blasphemous to judge burial like this lol
Untrue is one of my fav albums. 10/10
I&#39;ve somehow over the year come by your channel for the reviews. And while you manage to gerically descirbe an album you never really say anything at all. Aside from the fact your researched what was sampled. Nothing about how the drum programming is about as Complex as it gets as is the large space created in the tracks.
&quot;If new wave music were somehow goth?&quot;<br>So you mean <b><i>darkwave</i></b>
I love this album... one of the south London classics!
Sooner or later you need to do a classic review on Massive Attack.
I&#39;ll show you light now. It burns forever
i‚Äôm still salty over the rival dealer ep review
Goth New Age? Would you call that No Age?
This is not the 2007 electronic dance album I wanted a classic review for, Melon.
10/10 bitches
So this is the album with the song that Elon and Grimes named the &#39;A&#39; in their child X √Ü A-12&#39;s name after, nice. A classic, good pick from Grimes.
The influence of US garage is overstated here and the influence of Jungle/Drum &amp; Bass on UK Garage isn‚Äôt touched upon. I‚Äôve never heard the description ‚Äòfuture garage‚Äô applied to this record (or indeed any other). Dependent on your viewpoint, it‚Äôs either the long form distillation of dubstep or the first post-dubstep record. Either way, it was mostly downhill for dubstep from here.
yes
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d1rxJTIJX8&amp;t=27">0:27</a> This doesn&#39;t sound right !?
Your upper lip looks like a woman who hasn&#39;t shaved her snatch in a few days.
So glad I bought all the early Burial releases on wax back in the day. I&#39;ve refused many lucrative offers from people wanting to buy them in the years since.
#3 Aphex Twin
This album is incredible. I don&#39;t know how I didn&#39;t discover it until just today.<br><br>Actually....I was watching a live stream chat with Grimes, and she said she loves this album.<br>So....I randomly checked it out, and was pleasantly surprised. Grimes never has steered me wrong before.
&quot;Shell nof light&quot; is a masterclass of mood

Wait.....why does he have hair? üòÇ
Imagine making a classic album in only two weeks. That fact always continues to blow my mind.
One of the most overrated album of all time. I‚Äôm more disappointed that the melon fell for the hype and fanbolisitic platitudes. This album is important mostly for showing us what a vacant and sad state our culture is in that it would ‚Äúcapture the imagination‚Äù of a generation.
This is one of the greatest albums I have ever listened to.
Gararrrrge
Total waffle.
its UK GARIDGE mate......garraaaaaaage
Why didn‚Äôt he mention skream
i finally figured who you remind me of its andy bernard from the office
This is so sad. That guy wasted so much time to come up with countless hollow phrases of worthless bullshit
I listened to this album for the first time in a hospital waiting room, and I think that&#39;s the perfect place for the experience that is Untrue. Blank, isolated, and quiet.
Can somebody explain how this album is the defining moment for electronic music? <br>I didnt find anything special in this album?
imagine beefing Anthony fantano on mandy in brixton mcdonalds after a rave
That sound was always in the UK we were pioneering that sound for a long time burial drew inspiration from everywhere, garage sounds with 2 step drums and deep house elements and some hip hop thrown in there
What on earth is Gararrrrrge house.
YES YES AND YES(alan partridge voice)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d1rxJTIJX8&amp;t=35">0:35</a> there is something absurdly hilarious about these next two seconds
You look different.
It&#39;s pronounced &quot;Garidge&quot;. Thank you
KISSIN YOOOOUU
The album is a perfect depiction of London in mid 2000‚Äôs, starting from a night out, popping a pill, gurning for 6 hours, having a comedown, going to a takeaway afterwards and then getting the last night bus home.
He literally created Future Garage
review music has the right to children pls
One of the best albums ever made
For me, the obscure distorted samples make this album.
UK Garage lool
One of the best albums ever imo‚úå
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d1rxJTIJX8&amp;t=417">6:57</a><br><br><br>Dog Shelter. The epitome of depression.
For those that don&#39;t know, Burial made this album in a software called SoundForge, a very archaic and outdated audio software even for its time. It didn&#39;t have a step sequencer or way of quantizing rhythms like you would find in modern DAWs, so he basically placed raw audio clips freehand until they &quot;sounded&quot; like 2-step beats, giving them the iconic Burial lurching and off-kilter drum feel. He mentions in an interview that he could tell when the drums were going to sound good if they looked &quot;skeletal as fuck, like a fishbone&quot;. He also mentions he gets the name &quot;Burial&quot; due to how he always felt his music wasn&#39;t as good as the music that he liked, so he had to cover and &quot;bury&quot; his music in static and ambience to hide it, making it sound like it was playing on pirate radio.
you really didn&#39;t talk about archangel on purpose
burial is the pioneer of a genre called &#39;nightbus&#39; because its the type of music u listen to when going home on the night bus in london :D
Four tet is burial
As a single person on YouTube all I can say is, you need to listen to untrue once before you die. It‚Äôs an experience unlike anything else. It‚Äôs not music for the sake of music. There‚Äôs a mood, a purpose to each song. It‚Äôs probably, the best electronic music album ive ever listened to, and I can guarantee I will be listening to it in 50 years time.
it&#39;s pronounced garage not garage, idiot.
No joke I was like ehh when I first heard it, now i can&#39;t stop fkin listening to it
<b>ZIPPO OPENING.</b>
Best album of history
10
I came back after not watching you for like two months and that hair is great you look like a drug addict
Its pronounced ‚Äúuk garidge‚Äù bro
You should do a review of Move by Tsuruda, it&#39;s some of the most creative and dynamically ominous bass heavy music around
oh...so you were bald by choice
The album definitely doesn‚Äôt sound like raving into the night with tears in your eyes. Sounds more like the soundtrack to a quiet, contemplative night bus home. For me anyway
Ahhh this album is so special to me
Little bit behind on this one
alright if you&#39;re getting on your UK dance music classics imma need a review of The Future Sound Of London - Accelerator
its gar-ij
Hairplugathony Fantano
Learned about Burial through Adam Curtis
it was only after 6 years of owning that record did i find out where the vocals came from...thats how dam good Burial is (imo)
why does he have two copies of kids see ghosts
Really good review
lmao not sure about your timeline, missed out dubstep, UK garage, DnB and Rave/Old skool these are the roots of Burial...the pre roots to those scenes have some connection to chicago, but DnB is very much its own thing and is dub step(not the global dubstep the original late 90&#39;s early 00&#39;s dubstep) If you have not mentions old skool and the rave scene you have missed out a HUGE part but good to see peeps listening to Burial
1 of my fave albums, I even have a Burial tattoo:-)
Bro what the fuck are you doing....
its &#39;garage&#39; not &#39;garaahhge&#39;
One of my favourite albums.
Really nice review, a timeless record indeed. I think the bullet shell sample was taken from Metal Gear Solid.
hey Antony, could you please review Mirrors of Mala?
This album really obsolesced a lot of things I used to listen to.
Paused the doyle
I wouldn&#39;t compare Burials routes to a US house sound, I&#39;d say they&#39;re so deeeply routed in other UK genres. Burial&#39;s pitch shifted vocals and synths were very inspired by UK Rave and Hardcore scene 1991-1995, the garage itself can&#39;t be compared to US garage house but more 2002 style dark garage, bigger emphasis on sub bass etc. As much as US house eventually inspired UK garage, there&#39;s such little influence here, this album is thoroughly a reflection of UK dance music of the 90s/noughties.<br><br>thats my 2 pence on the matter
Review &quot;Portrait with Firewood&quot; - Djrum, last years best electronic album by far
Burial is one of the most unique producers in the world. Hands down. Great review, words aren&#39;t enough to explain how good it is.
I remember when In Colour by Jamie XX came out and I rather enjoyed it because I thought the sounds on it were pretty unique and cool, and then a couple years later I came across this record and I was like &quot;...ah&quot;
THE REVIEW I&#39;VE BEEN WAITING FOR
I can&#39;t understand how people like burial, for me is just crap
WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU PRONOUNCING GARAGE LIKE THAT WHAT THE FUCK
&quot;wallpaper record&quot; now where have I heard that phrase before?  Also can you review Tricky&#39;s Maxinquaye?
Apenas pinche pel√≥n?
The quality of this album cannot be overstated. So good. I bought it when it came out in 2007 after hearing some of it on the radio and listened to it for years without realising how significant it was globally. That was back before the Internet ruled absolutely everything.
Berry-ill? Please stop pronouncing this.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d1rxJTIJX8&amp;t=194">3:14</a> Abstract implies what Burial did here is distant, or far removed from its influences. I think in reality he managed to crystalise the essence of rave, both in terms of the music and culture around it, and also somehow set it firmly against the grey, melancholic background of real life beyond those brief moments of ecstasy. <br><br>(Sorry to sound like an especially wanky boomkat blurb.)
Honestly would of just said fuck it and called it &#39;old school dubstep&#39; but I appreciate the effort üëç
fav album of all time imo longboarding through the streets of Oslo 2011. amazing shit! 11/10 would do again!
Future Garage.
My favorite moment is when in the middle of &#39;Homeless&#39; the darkest piece of the album appears. It always gives me goosebumps.
Old intro :&#39;3
melon go and review some techno
Some interesting facts about Burials Untrue album: <br><br>It was written and produced in two weeks, two weeks!<br><br>Burial has a fascination with gaming, particularly Metal Gear Solid and builds a lot of his percussion from in game samples, what you thought was a snare or a high-hat could well be a gun reloading or the character picking up extra health, most of these have been warped beyond recognition. The most obvious raw sound and also touched on in this review is the gun shells you hear hitting the floor in Near Dark. The track Archangel samples the music from the intro to Metal Gear Solid 2 also.<br><br>Burial used Sound Forge to create the entire album which is more of a audio editing program than a production tool like Albeton or Logic, it doesn&#39;t follow a simple grid system which is what gives him the distinct swing to his drums and percussion. <br> <br>The vocals whilst often taken from popular artists such as Beyonce and Christina Aguilera, he isn&#39;t afraid to use other sources to sample such as Youtube for example the vocals on Etched headplate are taken from Alicia Robinsons cover of Angel by Amanda Perez. You can find the cover here /watch?v=vdOcrHKH1mk
I&#39;m sorry, but if you start a review of a Burial album stating his whole real name, that just show how disrespectful and/or how unknown Burial it is for you.
Burial, Volor Flex, NOCOW, and other Future Garage artist with this style sounds to me like it was all made by someone in a dark dystopian future, who just woke up from a fever dream. I know that might sound pretentious, and dumb, but thats the best way I can describe it. Burials Untrue will always remain my number one favorite album of all time, and Future Garage will always have a special place in my heart.
Incredible texture
I love this kind of music: very moody, melancholic and hypnotic. A great listen for cloudy days.
This is my favorite classics week of yours, hands down. Maybe it&#39;s just that &#39;00s nostalgia. I don&#39;t watch a ton anymore, but these always reel me back in. Was just listening to this a couple weeks ago. Playing Toxicity constantly now too. Thanks for doing these.
Don&#39;t know how familiar you are with the rest of the UK electronic scene, but I&#39;d love to hear you explore UK dubstep some more
My best album of all time!
This is one of my favourite albums of all time, hopefully this gets anthony&#39;s fanbase to check it out
Still waiting for his third proper studio album.
Garaajjjjj. Garrraaaaaajjjjjjjj.<br><br>GA-RIDGE.
Melon discovers finasteride &amp; minoxidil in 2019
You forgot to mention how he used bare &#39;metal gear solid&#39; samples via the gun sounds you was talking about
&gt;electronic music<br>And there it is, before I even watched this video and without having to open his mouth, he demonstrates his incompetence when understanding music like this.
Fantano liked KSG so much he bought it twice
i disagree
Endorphin is possibly the most beautiful song I&#39;ve ever heard. Certainly in the top 5.
One of the few albums that had me in a trance/captivated from start to finish - beautiful, bleak, cathartic - deffo a classic
been obsessively listening to all of Burial&#39;s discography for some time now and I can say I&#39;m pleased for you to return on this and speak a little about it. In my opinion no artist has come close to being able to throw together ensembles as dark, smooth, or original nor have I been as able to resonate emotionally with any other artist. Nothing sounds cooler than a dark twisted trippy segment of a burial track as I&#39;m walking or taking the train home drunk at 5am with my headphones in. You wish it was playing from a shitty silver CD player almost. All I can say is I&#39;m eager for more. Thanks for also being a fan, Anthony big up
Album of the decade
DJ Krush &amp; Toshinori Kondo - Ki Oku
didn&#39;t know that future-garage was pioneered by Burial, very interesting !
Forgot the fact he didn&#39;t even use a DAW to create these masterpieces also?
Been listening to Homeless and Etched headplate atleast once a week for years. Cant get tired of this album
REVIEW A CLASSIC DJ MIX CALLED DIESELBOY - THE DUNGEONMASTER‚ÄôS GUIDE!!!
You should do TMG- Bangers And Ass, it&#39;s a short satirical album.
Fantano I love you but I cringed every single time you said &#39;garaaje&#39; when in the UK it&#39;s &#39;garij&#39; haha
I remember after this came out a few guys that I knew using Logic and Ableton dropped it for Soundforge.  Although one guy the first time I met him said &#39;Soundforge is amazing&#39; which led me to believe he didn&#39;t know anything and was just jumping on the copycat bandwagon.<br>That and the shell casing samples that became ubiquitous for the next 5 years.  The copycat game was strong with this one.  No one had shame and they didn&#39;t care.
They played some of this on Toonmai.
Wow, Burial is one of my favourite artists. Great analysis of the sound and movement. But Future Garage, never heard that term? This was moving Garage into early Dub Step / Dark step. Walking around London, late at night - this was the soundtrack.
How was this classic? Whole album sounds like it belongs on a lowfi Playlist
this is my #1 classic album i&#39;ve wanted to see you do<br>cool
daddy Burial finally got a review ‚ô•Ô∏è
Review blood cultures happy birthday plz
Deja vu! Love the song ArchAngel by Burial.
Undertow Classic review when ?
awesome clasic.
This album got me through my early twenties
hearing an American say UK Gahrage is blasphemy. You can say GAHRAGE in your day to day but when it is &quot;UK Garage&quot; it is &quot;UK GARage&quot;
listening to this album: ecstasy<br>listening to the review of this album: torture<br><br>i love you Anthony but this review just illuminates the vast distance that spans the spaces between art and criticism
An atmospheric masterpiece, 12 years on this album still sounds fresh
I love this album so much, and you for doing this
You look different...
Review memes
Used to listen to this on repeat in the fall and winter when I was around 14 - 15. Great times : )
ratatat - classics for classics week when?
Adore this album.
What!!!?? For some reason I thought u hated this?? Amazing thank u cutie<br>Edit: sorry that was rival dealer my bad

classic...
Will we get the black parade in a classics week?  ü§îü§î
Fun fact: Those sounds you mention of shell casings hitting the ground on Near Dark are actually sampled from the PlayStation game Metal Gear Solid.
Spot on review, I love this album. On top of that, I know of and love Arthur Russell&#39;s music now.
Do Coil next
PETITION FOR A REVIEW OF ARCHANGEL ALONE
I love hearing Anthony talk about dance music! Pls review more dance music in 2019 Anthony!
Why and how Anthony
bruv, shave your head. please
this album is a great vibe. very replay-able and psychedelic
yes yes untrue a fuckin classic
ga-ridge not guh-raaj!
Rival Dealer is better. üôåüëäü§ò
The album expresses the sombre mood of a poor council estate in London at night.<br>The dark underground feeling of the streets, with a vocal that calls out to you, asking you to feel what they are feeling.
Great album!
Wow i knew about this albums since i was a kid stop reviewing mainstream trash and focus on good music you didnt even review doseones new album like wtf
When are you doing 21 savage new album
PLEASE DO CALIFORNIA MR BUNGLE
Just listened to this album, why are the drums the same on every track?
YES BITCH WORK!!!
pls dont say garage like that
Review The Claypool Lennon Delirium. You dont have the balls its prob over your head anyway, if it wasn&#39;t you would of done it by now.
Great to see you reviewing Burial dude but your chronology of UK electronic music and it‚Äôs influences gets a light 4/10. Pretty sure Roy Davis Jr is American too, great fucking tune though
Could you please do the right thing Melon, and just review Kodak new album...
Bruh where tf is the I am &lt; I was review?
‚ÄúUK Gararrrrj‚Äù
Talk about vacants origins album
Why does this melon have so much hair on it? Is it even safe to eat?
U need to do more research on &quot;future garage&quot;, the idea was around long before burial.
guhraahj lool smh
It‚Äôs not garage and there is nothing called future garage. The genre was called dubstep, he he was pigeon holed as the poster boy of that genre. That genre then made it American and was butchered and trashed turned into Idm. Your wrong melon wronggggggggggggg üëéüèª
i bought the album randomly when it came out and loved it
Shave your head again ugly
decent classics week, just left wishing you finally got around to velocity:design:comfort. maybe next time, melonman.
Its pronounced garridge
Review ZAYN ICARUS FALLS PLEASE
I was just listening to this album again..... like three days ago... and you drop this. I‚Äôm shook.
In Rainbows, Mezzanine, The Downward Spiral. Blease
Great fecking album
fantone  slamtano mindless memorized he forgot to give it a rating. That&#39;s when you know you hit the goldmine of music. Thank you
what‚Äôs that thing growing on your head
please start pronouncing garage like garage and not garage, thanks.
Untrue is such a solitary record in many ways. Nothing sounds quite like it, and it feels so private, so personal that listening to it alone such a profoundly melancholic experience.<br><br>I first heard it in January when I was caught in a grip of post-season depression. Alone in my house with an average cup of coffee, feeling the cold and watching the rain outside. When you&#39;re in a state of mind that nothing will fix, this record sounds like its getting on a level with you, as if Burial is reaching out through the crumpled blanket of beats and samples to say &quot;Yeah man, it sucks and I get you&quot;.<br><br>Even if it didn&#39;t make me feel better, it was exactly what I needed to hear at the time. It&#39;s like electronic blues and I love it.
GARAGE<br>I DON&#39;T CARE ABOUT GARAGE<br>LISTEN TO THIS IT DON&#39;T SOUND LIKE GARAGE
two of my top 10 favorite albums OAT (this and toxicity) thank you melon
The only thing that pisses me off about this record is that the vinyl version is missing like 3 tracks. Why would they do that?!
Anyone who was listening to Burial when this came out will call it Dubstep and this was a defining moment for Dubstep as well, not just for electronic music. You can technically call it UK Garage yeah, but definitely not Garaj - as that&#39;s where you park your car
10/10 Burial is a Genius. One of the best albums of electronic music ever made.
One of the best albums ever
Someone replaced Anthony
Burial is a 10/10 or a 9/10.
This is such a London at 5AM album.
Did this album grow on you then? I remember from the blogtv days that you didn‚Äôt like the pitch shifted vocals.
Review icedancer
listening to this album on a rainy night bus through London is an emotional experience
Do the new robyn album omg
That has to be the ugliest cover art ever tho
I liked this album before Anthony told me to and I&#39;m happy he reviewed it
LOVING YOOUUUUU, COULDNT BE ALONE
&quot;Gah-raaage&quot; you mean garrige.
At the time this album was coming out we would listen to it everyday, it really was magical! Dubstep in general was soo brilliant back then and very subtle, more like oldskool Dub. Miss these times.
Please do Superunknown
RA Advisor did a decent in‚Äìdepth to this record if anyone is interested.
J Dilla cmon
Finally some recognition
you have the hair of a newborn
Are you going to review that new 21 Savage album
Take a shot every time melon says <b>gurrawzh</b>
The bullet shells hitting the floor are from Metal Gear Solid. (:
Surprised to see you done this now
Best listened to on good headphones while walking at night in an industrial district with light rain.
The vocals on Archangel are from a song by Ray J, the guy from the Kim Kardashian sex tape.
OH fuck
Can you review some japanese classic albums? The Blue Hearts, Thee Michelle Gun Elephant, Luna Sea, whatever,  c&#39;mon Melon!
Long Overdue!
kiwihead pls<br><br>(seriously though with that intro and your hair coming back you need to record your reviews in 480p)
Thank you melon
Please consider doing In Rainbows so I can stop my family from eating melons for dinner
classic. Say no more.
ayyye, the old intro and everything.  modern classic record too
YES MELON. Review more house!! love you
Is Fever Ray&#39;s self titled album a classic?
would love a Perfume Future Pop review &lt;3333
This album changed my life... i never clicked as fast on one of your reviews. It&#39;s shame that you&#39;re not talking of the tracks themselves ! But thank you to have promoted it for those who didnt know it !
Review 21 savage&#39;s new album  &quot;i am i was&quot;
the atmosphere on this album is just incredible, so emotional
Oracular Spectacular MGMT one day?
There‚Äôs no album that‚Äôs come out this century that‚Äôs imprinted onto my DNA the way that ‚ÄúUntrue‚Äù has. If I had the knowhow required to produce electronic music, I have no doubt I could recreate the entire thing from memory.
thats one fuzzy melon.
Are you ever gonna review Kodaks new album?
Only a melon would think Burial has elements of Dubstep. Just because I want to eat a slice of you beautiful suculent fruit boy doesnt mean I have to agree with your insights on Burial
Is Anthony Fantano fat?
God youre so fucking THICCCC
Melon has hair? This is like a blast from the past.
you look like the average dude that used to go to the gym, has a son of around 6 years old, loves football and baseball, you go to church every sunday but underneeth this boring exterior you are hiding a dark sexual secret
Did you hear MF DOOM x Cookin Soul DOOM XMAS
Why hasn&#39;t he reviewed I am&gt; I was?
Babythony Hairtano
I love this album
Hell yeah
THAT VINTAGE TND OPENING<br>I&#39;M GONNA FUCKING LOSE IT
Review the Puzzle‚Äôs new album
Can you please review the new Bladee album
Lol. &quot;Future Garage&quot; is just a name that people gave to dubstep that was at a slower bpm (like 126-130), as dubstep never actually had a set tempo at that point in time. The people that came up with that name are the people who think &quot;brostep&quot; is the default definition of dubstep, and &quot;dark garage&quot; definitely doesnt fit into that genre. Thank you for ruining things america
College Dropout classic review now
Omg you have fuzz on your melon
Kode9 referred to the sound as ‚Äòdownbeat euphoria‚Äô, which is really quite apposite
since its classic week can you review the new bladee mixtape
I haven&#39;t heard another album that taps into the human experience quite like this one.
look up Warpigjdb

Never thought I would see this man outside again.
i loved this album in high school and completely forgot it existed until now
Review X 100PRE
My only complaint of Classics Week is that we get but one a year.
PLEASE DO DEMON DAYS!
Took more than 1 year for this record to click with me but goddamn it was worth it.
The Downward Spiral cmon melon
Just keep delaying your review of food and liquor, keep going
God bless you.
TREEEEEE
I&#39;ll really appreciate you reviewing La Dispute&#39;s Somewhere At The Bottom Of The River Between Vega And Altair, since, at least for me, its a real classic from the genre. Love you melon, great reviews as always.
21 savage I am &gt; I was review?
why would one üçâ need so many copies of kids see ghosts on vinyl?
One of the best electronic music albums of all time
Could it be a gnome?

MUSIC HAS THE RIGHT TO CHILDREN CLASSIC REVIEW WHEN?
I remember first hearing this album on a rainy morning, sitting in the university cafe. Heard good reviews about it so I had to listen. I just stared into the void for a solid 45 minutes. Powerful album.
waited years for thi s
Where‚Äôs the Pink Floyd classic revieww????
Turn On The Bright Lights please thanks
review i am &gt; i was!!!
:h-<br>:WILLIAM
hi anthony ive been listening to an artist named yellow days, and i was wondering if youve listened to him your self and could even consider doing an album review his latest is about 18 months old but you know a man can beg
It&#39;s the 40th anniversary of Pink Floyd&#39;s The Wall please review it
Facing New York - Dogtown
Love to hear a Melon in the morning
There is a ‚Äúmaking of‚Äù video of this album that is a better synopsis of it. And I would not use ‚Äúfuture garage‚Äù to describe this at all.
And not a single review of the Blade Runner soundtrack by Vangelis
This album is a true relic of its time and nothing else will top it for me, many imitators have tried and failed, even Burial&#39;s post Untrue work, although still excellent, hasn&#39;t topped this. I still get goosebumps from listening to it even now.
Melon ima need you to review iam &gt; i was like right fuckin now
have a nice life - deathconsciousness CLASSIC/10
LISTEN TO ME.  That was, by far, the most incredible review I‚Äôve ever seen filmed
gaRAHHHG
I literally love this album more than my wife.
Bit of a crap classic week.
ICP WORST TO BEST BUTTSKUNK
still no kodak album review melon
Thanks for covering someone outside of poop, er, pop land.
Hell yeah
This is definitely one of my favorite records ever and a huge inspiration for me. Everytime I listen to it I feel like I&#39;m walking around a futuristic city at night lol
21 Savage
As a Brit the way to pronounce Garage is somewhat painful. I can cope when taking about the place park your car, but when talking about the music, it hurts.
Oh boy
i don&#39;t know any of these albums but i just click for the tree intro
WHERE IS REVIEW for BLADEE - ICEDANCER ????
I didn&#39;t know about any of the albums of this classics week i&#39;m def a pleb
All 4 of your recent classic albums have been less than 20 years old - plans to do any older ones?
IT&#39;S GARAGE NOT GARAGE M&#39;LORD
Reviews Burial - Untrue<br><br>Not even a single mention of Archangel.<br><br>Ok.
My album to go when travelling by train...
SBTRKT PLZ
I never ‚Äúgot‚Äù this album, dont get how it‚Äôs re-listenable
Hairthony fantano here
Also thanks for shitting up /mu/ with this review, they now hate it. God they are so pathetic
Burial lives around the corner from me, his music is so fucking accurate of our area/city its fucking insane. If you grew up in South London nothing comes close to capturing the feeling of it than Untrue
etched headplate is my fave
still waiting for Review of something by Starset
Get that shit off of your head
That ring tattoo is cringe
Do a Classic review of Flockaveli

Review 21‚Äôs new album
Love this album. It blew my mind when it came out.

It&#39;s GARRIDGE melon

Skream! next

ah yes, the in mcdonalds at 3 am album.
Ridiculously late to the party
Its about time
not hearing it pronounced &quot;Ga-ridge&quot; is making my brain feel weird
Never expected you to review this album. VERY NICE
So no head?
Life changing album
Kinda wish you mentioned something about In McDonalds.<br>Thanks for reviewing this anyway.
Still nothing on 21s album?
Man, Fantano is so much greater than he was. He‚Äôs gone from 1 to 21 so fast. It‚Äôs savage.<br><br><br>I guess we‚Äôll never get it...
THE STROKES - IS THIS IT
Yes! I love Burial.<br><br>Praying for Illinois tomorrow
What real dubstep is and not that garbage edm yall think is dubstep.
Review Oceansize - Effloresce
Are you gonna review 21 savage‚Äôs ‚ÄúI am &lt; I was‚Äù?
This album is a game changer but Fantano seems to ignore the influence that mid 90&#39;s DnB in particular Metalheadz and Reinforced records had on the sound. Whats crazy is that he produced this album almost entirely in Sound Forge, which to this day as someone who dabbles in production has me thinking &#39;how is that even possible&#39;?
React to 21 savage
Chicagooooooo
waiting for the third album
This record changed my life! :)
Literally the best album ever made
i am the 666th comment.
Poor melon has to go from reviewing these classics to i am&gt;i was. Pray for melon that he makes it through this difficult time.
k fine ill listen to it. jeeeez
Review that new 21 you fucking fruit
deathconsciousness CLASSIC REVIEW
Awwww yeah baby
The perfect album for night-time drives through the city.<br>Also Adam Curtis uses Burials stuff really well in his documentaries if anyone‚Äôs interested
Do Trentem√∏ller The Last Resort
Untrue is such a good piece listenend to it many many times
I was in junior high back then, i remember distictly when i got my brothers friend‚Äôs old mp3 and he had archangel on it. I was instantly MESMERIZED. I had never heard anything like it, it truly sparked my love for electronic music :)
this review is incomplete without any reference to Mark Fisher
wait, isn&#39;t this album like super old?
51
One of the greatest albums of all time, the UK&#39;s underground electronic scene is criminally underrated.
Favorite album
Death Consciousnesses by Have A Nice Life has to be mentioned as a classic album.
These past two choices have been GREAT!!!
Starting off 2019 fuckin STRONG
When you learn that he created the whole album on a non DAW piece of software called soundforge cos that‚Äôs all he knew how to use.<br>Limitations on technology can truely foster an amazing creative perspective and unique work that you would likely not have arrived at when equipped with the normal creative tools most producers have at their disposal.
Boymerang - balance of the force.
Really like this album.
review the new 21 savage album already
Please review another classic album: The Prodigy - Music For The Jilted Generation (1994)

I&#39;VE BEEN WAITING THIS FOR SO LONG.

NICK DRAKE<br>PINK MOON
Love how self aware this album was (in the context of electronic dance music culture), and that he sampled metal gear solid 2, possibly one of the most self aware games ever created.
Nice to see some UK underground music here, but you‚Äôd get stabbed for calling it UK gahraaahhhge..
love you/10
REVIEW CYHSY FOR CLASSICS
A lot of the samples comes from Metal Gear Solid game. For example those dropping bullet sounds.
FULL BODY CHILLS
you make me experience the numbness and bliss of afterlife but also kind of struck down by eternal grey skies
Yes. Yes. Yes. YES. YES. YES. YEAASSSS.
Was just thinking about Burial and then I see this... stop reading my mind
Deathconsciousness Classic review!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
near dark is so dark and so emotional i still listen to it once a week...as well as Homeless...those two tracks are just heaven to me :) x
I would love it if you‚Äôd review Crack the skye
Can&#39;t believe Fantano is reviewing my fav album, everyone should go watch the video By Resident Advisor narrated by Marian Hobbs!
Please review Tonedeff - Polymer since you never did =(
welp this was unexpected
Melon! Please review Jeff Buckley‚Äôs ‚ÄòGrace‚Äô.
Oh.. now i know why he keeps his hair short wtf
wasnt expecting fantano to review burial ever. Love it
üî•review
Jane Doe, The Downward Spiral or Deathconsciousness please

This is one of those albums i just dont get
Aaaaaaaaa I&#39;ve been waiting for this for ages
Best thing JK Rowling has ever created.

@theneedledrop I&#39;m lovin&#39; all your throwback intros lol
lamooo
woah sniper, i‚Äôm not gonna pull down my pants so you can take some photos
No way dude.
You should go back and do 21s new album
Untrue in my top 5 album for ever. Classic, cult.
Review Massive Attack - Mezzanine!!!!
How about deadmau5 ‚ÄúRandom Album Title‚Äù?
The first vinyl record I ever purchased. :)
um Anthony ur head looks weird
This is the perfect album to listen to travelling on a bus through a wet and dark urban England. Kind of like Mezzanine. It gives off a similar vibe.
Ew why do you have hair now melon üò≠
review the glow pt 2 again and give it the first 11/10
I&#39;d like to see him give them a real rating instead of just classic/10. Seems like a cop-out.
Awesome!!!!!
Would love to see a review of Ulver&#39;s Shadows of The Sun.<br><br>Always like your Classic reviews, you remain earnest throughout bringing up all the highs and lows whereas many reviewers of classics suck up.
I know you‚Äôve addressed why you don‚Äôt cover certain genres much before, but I constantly wonder what you would think of the crazy weird &amp; wonky ‚Äú‚ÄùEDM‚Äù‚Äù stuff that has come out in the last decade largely influenced by Burial &amp; similar styles &amp; artists... KOAN Sound, Culprate, Moody Good, even like Eprom and Ivy Lab and shit, all the Inspected label stuff... I think you‚Äôd dig so much of it. Always glad to see love for Burial though of course.
Stream producer Squishy Squishy
I was expecting scarse meme in the intro
I love classics week ‚úåüèº
You look different
This new episode of black mirror is intense
please make one on Fox Confessor

Thats one of my favorite albums of all time!

21 SAVAGE
Favorite album of all time!
This album still godly!
Freakin&#39;  love this album, can&#39;t tell ya how long I&#39;ve waited for a review from u on this one :)
My favorite album of all-time ‚ù§Ô∏è
YES YES YES YES FUCKING YES I&#39;VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS REVIEW FOR 6 YEARS
Garridge, Melon, I&#39;ve told you already!
Melon if you&#39;re going to talk about garage, please pronounce it the same way its pronounced by those who made the genre :^) (ga-ridge)
WOW! What are the chances! I literally just posted this album on my music instagram cdsandmp3s this afternoon! Great minds, Anthony. Great minds. lol
thanks for reviewing this album, big boy.
WHY DOES HE LOOKED LIKE HES BEING ELECTROCUTED!
As an English person the way you say ‚Äúgarage‚Äù makes me laugh
this record is a good example of a record you can use to determine your dating pool.
One of the best albums of all time
THE AVALANCHES - SINCE I LEFT YOU i really hope this happens
Thanks for reviewing this
&gt;doesn&#39;t mention archangel
WHERE YHE FUCK IS 21
Really love Burial&#39;s Where Is Home remix
Ayee yall i make dope ass sample based beats and songs. My style is uniqe and fresh, i dont make type beats. I also do dj mixes. songs from my beat tapes is out on my page now. Fuck with a young nigga!
Review All Hail West Texas puhlease Antny  !!<br>(Or The Sunset Tree if that&#39;s more &quot;classic&quot;)
hoping Deathconciousness is a review soon
In Rainbows please melon
Feel like you missed the mark on this review a bit - should have put a bit more effort into research on the UK garage scene and Burial&#39;s influences on this record - garage house is largely irrelevant in the actual inspiration of Untrue whereas Dubstep, UK Garage, plastic people, FWD, UK rave/warehouse music don&#39;t really get mentioned; yet you go into detail on the origins of the influences of Untrue&#39;s influences. Also you can&#39;t stop name dropping Burial as if to say hurr durr I&#39;m knowledgable I even know his bloody middle name, despite Burial obviously not wanting anyone to know his name and doing his best to keep it secret, seems insensitive and as if you don&#39;t really know the artist.
Favourite album of all time &lt;3
I know it&#39;s a classic but... I could never get into this album :( I do love his EP Kindred.
My favorite album of all times. Me and my friend&#39;ve had such amazing experience listening Burial in general, especially this album.<br><br>Seriously, even my stupid friends loved this mythical album. I introduced  them to Burial and we ended up introducing this album to around 60 people during our journey; we used to smoke weed inside my friend&#39;s car almost every weekend Sunday at dawn after getting out of the party, the music was just Burial, exclusively.<br><br>Damn this was so good that I&#39;ve even had random girls calling me the next day just to ask me what we were listening inside that car. We even named my best friends&#39;s car the &quot;Burial movil&quot;.
YESSS BEEN WAITING FOR THIS SHIT
damn fuckin str8
Shave your head adam22
Where the fuck is the new Burial shit. It‚Äôs depressing that his previous album is already a classic and he has only followed it up periodically with some great EPS and a few not so great ones
Never has an electronic album felt to human and had so much emotion packed into it
This album is a throwback, used to love it.
After checking this album out I&#39;m positive that Frank was listening to this while making Endless
rad, thanks for bringing this back to me<br>I remember checking it out once looking for recommendations similar to A New Place 2 Drown<br>which I know you didn&#39;t like my Fanta Fanta &lt;3
Just came here for the intro tbh
Thank you, Melon! Still praying for Deathconsciousness though
Day 3 of trying to get Anthony Fantano to review Sick, Nasty, Thug by B Dizzle.
its like watching history channel
you didn&#39;t talk about the most interesting part of his music: <br>he used soundfourge (not a daw; more something along the lines of audacity) and because there isn&#39;t a grid in this program, the end result was the extremely weird rythms
&lt;3
almost all of burials discography is stellar, my favourite being the EP Rival Dealer and then Untrue and his first album, if you havn&#39;t checked him out, nows the time!!! just put on some headphones and go for a walk on a rainy night and enjoy!!!!
‚ÄúHiders‚Äù was the best song
i found this album through GTA a year ago, thank you frank ocean.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>give me a break, i just turned 16
To say that I don&#39;t love this record would be untrue.
Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots pls
Kodak Black - Dying to Live when
FUCKING FINALLY
I love that album
I love those intros, glad they&#39;re back
Malibu Ken?
Shell of light a BANGER
HOLY SHIT THE INTRO AHA
@theneedledrop have you read Mark Fisher&#39;s writing on Burial? pretty great stuff. it&#39;s in his book &quot;Writings on Depression, Hauntology, and Lost Futures&quot;, or something like that.
Hello Melon üëãüèº u should review the Berserk manga lol
One of my favorite albums of all time it changed the game
Anthony, thank you for finally reviewing this album, I&#39;ve waited so long to see this review of what has to be my most favorite album of all time. You&#39;re the best.
Hot damn now this is a classic review I&#39;m interested in.
2 AM in mcdonalds

A favorite of mine! Thanks Melon!
I got erect when I saw the notification.
21 savage?
<b>C H I C A G O</b>
One of the best albums of all time. I&#39;m so happy to hear your review.
still listen to this record at least a few times a year. nice.
Do a Number Girl Album
Do Pink Floyd‚Äôs &quot;The Wall&quot; next.
Hey Anthony, I doubt you&#39;ll see this comment but I just want you to know you look great with the hair :)
headthony fullofhairtano here
Thank You for reviewing this Melon
This album did legit change my life.<br><br>It really is one of the most beautiful albums ever produced.
I LOVE THIS ALBUM
Wow 11.5 years and its a classic?!?!
So he ain&#39;t reviewing 21&#39;s album eh
Lil B white flame mixtape
Amazing album but I prefer his newer more prog releases. Much more his medium.
Definitely deserves a 10 as well as burials first album. Two of my all time favourites
GOAT electronic album
Wasn&#39;t a fan of Burial but I&#39;m a fan of yours.... What does that say about me?
TREE IS BACK
I‚Äôm waiting for the doppelg√§nger review
Wow I was reacting to your 2012 review burial-triant when you upload this video
One of my faves. Thanks for the review Tony Balony.
When is the classic review of DAMN?
MM lp review please!
cute fit antnee üòö stop frontin so hard üò´
Classic
The reason it sounds like bullet shell casings hitting the ground is because it&#39;s literally a sample of that sound from Metal Gear Solid.<br><br>It&#39;s also worth noting that most of the vocal samples are not the original tracks but from things like obscure covers uploaded to youtube from random people.
When Fantano gave a classic review for The Glow Part 2, he said it came out later than most albums he typically called &quot;classics&quot;<br>Now here he is, calling albums from 2007 &quot;classics&quot;
sadboi dubstep...
Review Big Chungus
Total classic, presently surprised to see it here!
You would review this album today. -Tonight. <br>üåöüñ§
Melon, don&#39;t take any of these mean comments seriously. Let your hair grow out a bit more and shorten it on the sides once its longer. Don&#39;t let the haters take your hair, you&#39;re better than them. Grow it out and be the beautiful kiwi you know you are
since 2007 isn‚Äôt too early for a classic, where‚Äôs person pitch or MPP??
I&#39;m amazed that it took you this long to get around to it. I actually thought you already reviewed this album years ago, but I guess not. Either way, glad you like it. I like it too. I think I might give it a relisten right now. Maybe you could review some aphex twin stuff if you haven&#39;t already.
The hair is real!!!!
When will you drop my opinion on the new 21 savage album
Fucking love this album
AMERIC ANFOOTBALL CLASSIC REVIEW MELON üçâ
Ain‚Äôt seen Fantano in so long this melon is growing fur.
Do a classic review for Black Parade. I really wanna know your thoughts in retrospect.
I love you so much. &lt;3
I really like how you break it down but you pronounced ciara&#39;s name wrong.
BANGLEDESH
I can‚Äôt believe you are reviewing untrue!! So pumped!!!
THE LEGENDARY BLACK FLANNEL
I&#39;ve been waiting for somebody to talk about this album in depth
but where is the i am &gt; i was review at
Depressed flannel. This is one of my all time favourite albums tho
Gosh I hope we get a Sunn O))) Black One classic review
pretty embarrassing for a dubstep album tbh, it doesn&#39;t even have any sick bass drops
There are very little albums that I‚Äôve listened to that has provided such an engaging atmosphere as Burial. The electronic, rave influenced ADI fusion music takes the trip hop of the 90‚Äôs and drowns it with today‚Äôs textures.<br><br>It GIVES OFF A V I B E MAN<br><br>The androgynous vocals over those LAYERED, CONGESTED BEATS. <br><br>There is no album more fitting for going to a McDonald‚Äôs at 2 in the morning coming down from molly after clubbing. Not that I know from experience...
fastest i&#39;ve ever clicked on a melon video
Omfg.....thank you
please please please do below the heavens my melon. i am dying.
Melon, maybe recreating the logan paul suicide forest video and mocking holocaust victims wasn&#39;t the greatest idea. Didn&#39;t affect my view of you as it was already extremely positive but i&#39;m sure the media will pick up on this
You could review The Orb&#39;s album Adventures Beyond The Ultraworld.
Yay, more house and techno reviews plz!!
Where the fuck is the I am &gt; I was review? How am I gonna sound smart about my opinion on it when I don‚Äôt know yours?
<b>When none of the comments have anything to do with the content and are just memeing</b>
never clicked on a review so quickly
This isn&#39;t Disintegration melon
Deathconsciousnes next Tony
Nine inch nails the downward spiral classic review when?
You forgot to mention the Metal Gear Solid 2 sample on the second track :)
funeral or is this it one day??? <br><br>jens lekman&#39;s night falls over kortedala?
I like Fantano&#39;s hair, it&#39;s like a mole brown/taupe color
Oh I miss the tree intros
Absolutely loving these classic reviews

Do &quot;A Night At The Opera&quot; shill classic review
Hey guys it&#39;s Scarcethany Fantano here
Surprised he knows his house
YES
I&#39;ve been waiting for demon days, for way too long.
So I guess this classic review week is just underground grunge and edm/dubstep
I wanted you to review a Brazilian album for once. If you don&#39;t know where to begin i can recomend you baco exu do blues&#39;s bluesman album. I can translate the lyrics if you want
um wow you just threw Burial&#39;s government name out there like it was nothing, cmon Anthony
Arcade Fire-Funeral
God this is a beautiful album
This is your chance to do songs for the deaf, just sayinggg
Where‚Äôs that 21 tho fantano
This album is my religion
I just wanna say thank you. Ps 2 step isn‚Äôt a genre it‚Äôs a beat ‚ù§Ô∏è
Doesn&#39;t this make the youngest album reviewed for classics week
Review the Kodak album. Its his first number 1 album
Might be as classic but still not as classic as the trees.
A classics week dedicated to the 2000s. I think it‚Äôs great that he‚Äôs doing this. Most of us don‚Äôt realize that we‚Äôre almost a whole decade away from the 2000s
√ÅG√ÜTIS BYRJUN YOU MELON FUCK
üåßÔ∏è‚òï
This is most definitely it
<b>Hairthony</b><br><b>Longtano</b>

CHICAGOOOOO
Yo either do a classics review of The Downward Spiral by Nine Inch Nails or a worst to best of Nine Inch Nails
üòéüòéüòé
fave album ever, honestly.
I hope he legit grows his hair out for all of 2019.
That&#39;s an odd way of spelling &quot;Strawberry Jam by Animal Collective&quot;
MCR Black Parade tomorrow or we riot
Melon‚Äôs hair is leveling up to lvl.99 boss
Brother, Sister and Paracletus puhleeeeeees
I pray to Goddddd. I pray to Jesussss that the intros are not just for classic week. &lt;3333
Garage has NOTHING to do with the US <br>It&#39;s an evolution of Jungle, another UK genre.<br>AND you didn&#39;t mention the MGS2 sample.<br>FFS it almost like you didn&#39;t even listen to it.
The madman did it. One of the best albums ever.
Yassssss!!!!!
tentee-wan sabage pls
Fantano, get rid of those sideburns.
Burial&#39;s Untrue? Anthony outside, with hair? is this 2013?
Where&#39;s oracular spectacular?
Hairy melon
Soundtracks for the Blind Classic review, please.
Best album of the 00‚Äôs hands down
YEEEES
Im here dammit
&gt;reviewing burial<br>you never been to englandhave you
This was one of the first records to emotionally impact me and open my eyes to one of many kinds of music that I would love. Glad to see you talk about it in classics week, great way to start the year. Hope your 2019 goes great Melon!
If you ever want a good cry. 1.5 grams of shrooms and burial
Classic review of Aphex Twin - Drukqs??
We need a House music starter kit
Fucking thank you! üëçüèΩüôåüèΩ really happy to see this one reviewed. Timeless album, grew up mentally to it.
Yee that was totally some other dude completely. I guess it&#39;s probably still important though. üòÖ
Please review Deathconciousness by Have A Nice Life for classics week
You need to do classics week atleast twice a year. It&#39;s not like you&#39;d run out of albums to review or oversaturate the appeal with giving me a little bit more to masturbate to though the year
classic right here.
Jesus i didnt realize this album was 12 years old
but no mention of el b though.....
This is something I should have expected but I didn&#39;t
i love how you are reviewing classic albums from the 2000¬¥s that i¬¥ve honestly never heard off, thanks for introducing me to all these great records
i wanted this album to make me cry<br><br>i didn&#39;t cry
üéµüé∂üéµ HOLDING YOU
Fun Fact Fantano - A lot of the samples which burial used for this record are from metal gear solid. So when you said you could hear gun-shells, that&#39;s actually true he sampled gun-shells dropping on the floor for hi-hats.
The college dropout: classic/10
JANE DOEEEEEE
I STANthony
James Blake wouldn&#39;t have existed without Bruial. And James&#39; sound would greatly influence the Alternative R&amp;B and Art Pop of the 10s.
we need a deathconciousness classic review anthony
To Pimp a Butterfly classic review when?
For classic week can you review Die lit?
What a Time to Be Alive! :)
Where the FUCK is the Cal&#39;s sextape review
My dad works at hyperdub. Be nice or he will hurt you
The bullet shell sounds you mentioned are actually just that. He sampled those from Metal Gear Solid
I think its haircut time melon
You spelt gray wrong you fucking knob
good classics week, I actually care about these ones
Dude this is my favorite  album ever!!!! thanks for the review of this gem &lt;3
Can you do an album people have heard of. These aren‚Äôt classics
YES ONE OF MY FAVORITES OF ALL TIME!!!!!!
Thank you for doing your thing man! You have created a unique little community of people who share your love of music. I enjoy watching your videos when I am taking a break at the end of my day and it&#39;s nice to have my hobby of digging through and analyzing music so validated. I appreciate your ability to articulate your opinions on music on the level you do, and it helps me to become more articulate myself. Much love man

Still my favorite electronic album ever.
This hairdo is untrue.

What will it take to get Fantano to take psychedelics and stream himself listening to Corey Feldman?
hmmm this isnt The Black Parade
Greatest music review channel of all time
I liked this album before Fantano told me to, beat that
Do homeless people like house music? ü§î
