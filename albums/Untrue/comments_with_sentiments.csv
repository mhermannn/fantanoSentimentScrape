@ricric9521,2024-04-28T05:06:00Z,2024-04-28T05:06:00Z,0,This review is missing a very important detail. Burial&#39;s masterpiece here uses all the attributes the reviewer discusses and creates emotional and humanistic stories. The crafted sounds and vocal samples take you on a visceral journey through the story he tells in most of these songs.,4
@vansdan.,2024-03-26T05:58:33Z,2024-03-26T05:58:33Z,1,its a sin to not mention dubstep as much as you did. this is PURE dubstep.,5

@nomad1517,2023-12-26T08:07:54Z,2023-12-26T08:07:54Z,0,"First time I heard that album I was learning about the dubstep scene in 2010. It was totally new to me. I had a friend of mine play me a couple of songs. I was raised with a lot of hard rock and metal like: Mudvayne, Nine Inch Nails, Rush, etc. I also knew some rap: Nas, Immortal Technique, Atmosphere, etc. So when I heard Burial, it was familiar to me because it had raw emotion that I was used to. So much passion. But I also could here the modern electronic aspects of things. I brought up the dubstep scene because everything was so screechy and punchy and robotic. But this was smooth, deep, emotional, melancholy. Not sad, but touching. Yet, you could dance to it if you were awake at 4am and couldn&#39;t sleep. The best way I could describe burials sound: Music to listen coming back from work late at night. It&#39;s got that feeling of being exhausted both mentally and physically. It&#39;s like taking a sonic Jacuzzi.",5

@solossoo,2023-06-06T03:32:09Z,2023-06-06T03:32:09Z,0,The similarites of the soundspace of Burial - Untrue and the endless environments within Blame! are very parallel to each other. Sure it could sounds ethereal but I believe with the burialistic architecture and the vast distopia they both hold is something they both intertwine from one another,4

@JL-oo7ll,2020-12-16T20:50:09Z,2020-12-16T20:51:37Z,3,"There&#39;s a deep social and actually political backbone to this record - beyond the sound, the &quot;ah-ha&quot; moment - it&#39;s got teeth, and the deeper down you go the more it becomes a deeply spiritual path to empathy and self-discovery.<br>Great review, but you missed a few things.",3
@hackatthekeyboard,2020-11-30T07:35:18Z,2020-11-30T07:35:18Z,3,"It makes so much sense when you realize Burial initially starting making music based on tapes his older brother (I think) would bring back from garage, jungle, etc. shows (I think Burial was underage at the time). To me the album feels like it&#39;s on the outside looking in, it&#39;s like how he imagines what it&#39;s actually like combined with this isolation.",4

@osirisofthesouth2853,2020-09-05T01:25:57Z,2020-09-05T01:25:57Z,0,everything your saying is void until you learn how to pronounce garage fam.  Furthermore it’s a bit blasphemous to judge burial like this lol,1
@MatichekYoutube,2020-08-04T18:07:29Z,2020-08-04T18:08:11Z,0,Untrue is one of my fav albums. 10/10,5
@bobbydeazy,2020-08-02T21:50:44Z,2020-08-02T21:50:44Z,0,I&#39;ve somehow over the year come by your channel for the reviews. And while you manage to gerically descirbe an album you never really say anything at all. Aside from the fact your researched what was sampled. Nothing about how the drum programming is about as Complex as it gets as is the large space created in the tracks.,2
