And you’ve jus never had real depression or pain in your life to understand how raw this album was . Cudi was almost gone but he made this album to be able to live . I get you wanna talk about guitar tones and etc but the songs aren’t that bad in the slightest . This feels like the mos real grunge sounding album since the 90s .

I would agree its boring AS FUCK if unrelatable. I would assume it&#39;s impossible to like/relate to EVERY song unless you have been in that same headspace &amp; I definitely have been &amp; can relate 100%. If you&#39;ve never been (((extremely))) suicidal for a (really) long time I could understand liking half the album or almost none of it. There&#39;s definitely people that 100% relate  but still hate it tho. At least a 3 if I hated it definitely not a 0. I couldn&#39;t believe anyone who likes this album has a horrible taste in music. Bad music tastes do exist but There&#39;s A LOT of horrendus albums that are beyond worse in comparison. SBTH has many haters, but also has a MASSIVE amount of fans. So if a MASSIVE fan base exists then cudis mission was acomplished very well. Im  not a cringy hate my life edge-lord fake depressed person, I can genuinely relate to SBTH as a 27 year old.",
