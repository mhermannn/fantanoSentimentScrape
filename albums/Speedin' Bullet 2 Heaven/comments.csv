I feel like it does come off the same way as captain beefheart lmao, like can we admit that blues in general is dissonant and fucking wacked out. Tom waits? Bob dylan?

You threw Miley Cyrus and Her Dead Petz a bone and gave that trash a 1.. that&#39;s WAY worse than this. This album at least has some genuine emotion poured into it. I dig a handful of tracks on it.

But it was wack as fuck of him to personally attack Kid Cudi for his state of mind and drug addiction. He even recognized that many of Cudi&#39;s lyrics were extremely depressed and suicidal. For Anthony to not infer that Cudi was really struggling at the very least is really irresponsible, and calling an artistic work of him putting his suicidal thoughts on his sleeve as boring pretentious garbage seems in poor taste"

@jacksonwatkins6431,2023-06-08T02:55:41Z,2023-06-08T02:55:41Z,7,"The album reminds me of how I once heard The Room described: A movie made by someone who has never seen a movie but had movies described to them. SB2H sounds like an album made by a person who has never heard a 90&#39;s alternative album but has had 90&#39;s alternative music explained to them. Also a person who doesn&#39;t have the chops to make this kind of music. Which is not to say that it takes virtuosic chops, and not to say that Scott isn&#39;t talented, he&#39;s just not a good singer or musician in the way that the music he was trying to make demands."

@Thdarkonex3,2023-03-18T19:39:20Z,2023-03-18T19:39:20Z,2,Jus relistened and yeah how can you like grunge and say that the lyrics in this album isn‚Äôt that great when Kurt cobain himself was saying Lyrics such as mosquito and etc . The problem is with critics is y‚Äôall contradict yourselfs a lot . Which is the issue in my personal opinion grunge music was always suppose to be abstract and a bit off putting but at the same time a vibe . It is the genre for chaos and emotions . Whether in anger or sadness . It jus seems to me fantano you don‚Äôt really know what you be talking about alot of times . And you‚Äôve jus never had real depression or pain in your life to understand how raw this album was . Cudi was almost gone but he made this album to be able to live . I get you wanna talk about guitar tones and etc but the songs aren‚Äôt that bad in the slightest . This feels like the mos real grunge sounding album since the 90s . Now adays hardly anyone plays instruments . And music isn‚Äôt always about a certain formula . It‚Äôs about feeling .

I dislike 1 song only which is the acoustic version of the album title song. I don&#39;t dislike the album length but a really long deluxe version should&#39;ve  happened. I love SBTH but  if I HATED it I would score it at least a 3.4 . 0 is a bit extreme. I would agree its boring AS FUCK if unrelatable. I would assume it&#39;s impossible to like/relate to EVERY song unless you have been in that same headspace &amp; I definitely have been &amp; can relate 100%. If you&#39;ve never been (((extremely))) suicidal for a (really) long time I could understand liking half the album or almost none of it. There&#39;s definitely people that 100% relate  but still hate it tho. At least a 3 if I hated it definitely not a 0. I couldn&#39;t believe anyone who likes this album has a horrible taste in music. Bad music tastes do exist but There&#39;s A LOT of horrendus albums that are beyond worse in comparison. SBTH has many haters, but also has a MASSIVE amount of fans. So if a MASSIVE fan base exists then cudis mission was acomplished very well. Im  not a cringy hate my life edge-lord fake depressed person, I can genuinely relate to SBTH as a 27 year old."

This is about when you&#39;re at absolute rock bottom, torn the fuck up, raw and rough af. Just coarse, black darkness. You will understand this album then. Life has to hit you first. I know this now."

@satfat1232,2022-06-17T16:14:38Z,2022-06-17T16:14:38Z,4,This album is horrible but I don‚Äôt think you should‚Äôve talked about his mental health in a negative sense. Especially when he was actually losing his mind during this album and it‚Äôs nothing to joke about.
