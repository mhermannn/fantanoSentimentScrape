But it was wack as fuck of him to personally attack Kid Cudi for his state of mind and drug addiction. He even recognized that many of Cudi&#39;s lyrics were extremely depressed and suicidal. For Anthony to not infer that Cudi was really struggling at the very least is really irresponsible, and calling an artistic work of him putting his suicidal thoughts on his sleeve as boring pretentious garbage seems in poor taste",1

SB2H sounds like an album made by a person who has never heard a 90&#39;s alternative album but has had 90&#39;s alternative music explained to them. Also a person who doesn&#39;t have the chops to make this kind of music.

@Thdarkonex3,2023-03-18T19:39:20Z,2023-03-18T19:39:20Z,2,Jus relistened and yeah how can you like grunge and say that the lyrics in this album isn‚Äôt that great when Kurt cobain himself was saying Lyrics such as mosquito and etc . The problem is with critics is y‚Äôall contradict yourselfs a lot . Which is the issue in my personal opinion grunge music was always suppose to be abstract and a bit off putting but at the same time a vibe . It is the genre for chaos and emotions . Whether in anger or sadness . It jus seems to me fantano you don‚Äôt really know what you be talking about alot of times . And you‚Äôve jus never had real depression or pain in your life to understand how raw this album was . Cudi was almost gone but he made this album to be able to live . I get you wanna talk about guitar tones and etc but the songs aren‚Äôt that bad in the slightest . This feels like the mos real grunge sounding album since the 90s . Now adays hardly anyone plays instruments . And music isn‚Äôt always about a certain formula . It‚Äôs about feeling .,2

I dislike 1 song only which is the acoustic version of the album title song. I don&#39;t dislike the album length but a really long deluxe version should&#39;ve  happened. I love SBTH but  if I HATED it I would score it at least a 3.4 . 0 is a bit extreme. I would agree its boring AS FUCK if unrelatable. I would assume it&#39;s impossible to like/relate to EVERY song unless you have been in that same headspace &amp; I definitely have been &amp; can relate 100%. If you&#39;ve never been (((extremely))) suicidal for a (really) long time I could understand liking half the album or almost none of it. There&#39;s definitely people that 100% relate  but still hate it tho. At least a 3 if I hated it definitely not a 0. I couldn&#39;t believe anyone who likes this album has a horrible taste in music. Bad music tastes do exist but There&#39;s A LOT of horrendus albums that are beyond worse in comparison. SBTH has many haters, but also has a MASSIVE amount of fans. So if a MASSIVE fan base exists then cudis mission was acomplished very well. Im  not a cringy hate my life edge-lord fake depressed person, I can genuinely relate to SBTH as a 27 year old.",3

Relatively balanced and fair in the beginning - looking for a saving grace and really ‚Äútrying‚Äù to give the record its due process. Some good Beavis and Butthead and Cudi impressions too. But then his tone changes and his contempt for the record comes out. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt say the singing is good. You cannot. YOU CAN‚ÄôT!‚Äù<br><br>It‚Äôs stuff like this where his performance convinces you that he has no choice but to give the album a zero, because otherwise he wouldn‚Äôt be doing his job. And he does it in a performative way that wouldn‚Äôt be nearly as effective if you were just reading the review on paper.",5

This is about when you&#39;re at absolute rock bottom, torn the fuck up, raw and rough af. Just coarse, black darkness. You will understand this album then. Life has to hit you first. I know this now.",5
