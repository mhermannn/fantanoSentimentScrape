hey everyone Anthony fantano here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new kid cuy album speeding bullet to Heaven kid cuy is a rapper singer composer multi-instrumentalist as well it seems who had a pretty promising start to his music career his professional commercial music career in the previous decade he was delivering some very moody introspective hip-hop that not a lot of other rappers were and while I didn't really go head over heels for his stuff I thought his follow-up to his debut was kind of mediocre I was pretty indifferent to it but at least he wasn't like a generic artist to me he had a sound he had a vibe that I could recognize but pretty immediately after his next album Mr Rager himself seemed to fall off and not just quality-wise like he fell off the edge of sanity and started to release some of the worst music of this decade the faux Rock album he did with that wizard collaborative side project also indicud which is a record that still haunts me to this day to the point where I completely skipped over Mr Scott Miss c's next record satellite flight however his new record over here my morbid curiosity got the best of me because I heard it was a rock record uh actually the lead singles that were teasing this album songs like confused as well as wedding tuck and also judgmental [ __ ] these songs were kind of intriguing to me I guess it was sort of interesting to see Scott going in another Direction what cudy lacks in musical chops a lot of the time he has an attitude and emotion and genres like grunge and alternative rock and punk music emotion and and attitude are the cornerstones of these styles of music so cudy might pull through on this one no nope no no this is easily the worst record I've had to review this year maybe not the worst album I've heard this year I mean there are certainly worse records but the Worst Album I've had to review and it it's it's very rare that I Define albums in those terms but there have been some very special albums this year that came out and I had a very strong distaste for but this one Takes the Cake The Hair cake this thing is almost completely unlistenable the core of the album is 18 tracks long and if that wasn't enough kid Cy saw fit to add eight more songs of demos and rehearsal demos which are even more of a wasteland than the core of the record on the last leg of this record kid Cy spends this album pretending he's like Kurt Cobain it's like the first part of the album is what he thought was his successful career and then he offs himself and then he spends the rest of the album convincing you that he was so great that you needed to hear these demos when in fact the demos are so awful they're so weak they're so badly performed they're even less listenable than all the songs that preceded them but for the first section of this album there are really two sides to it one side where kid Cy is boring you to tears and the other side where he's essentially just annoying you and getting on your nerves so on the boring side of these 18 tracks kid cuy essentially recycles and repeats the most rudimentary of guitar riffs in drum beats and vocal lines to the point where the tracks just get stale within the first 30 seconds kid cuy he might deliver some decent sounds in the production on this record overall I think is pretty cool that analog tape definitely brings a nice heaviness and Clarity and crispness and punchiness to these guitars and drums but kid Cy isn't writing songs so much as he's writing little Snippets and slivers of songs and then just stringing them out for 2 to 5 minutes like un confused or screwed or amen the song fairy tale remains as well honestly I don't even know why I'm listing tracks out that is basically the musical premise of almost every song here the difference with the tracks that are bearable though is that they are maybe a little more visceral a little more explosive so it kind of makes them uh just enjoyable in comparison with these incredibly stale annoying songs there are actually some decent riffs on the songs Fade to red or man in the night and still still even in the context of this God awful record I still enjoy judgmental [ __ ] it's probably the most diverse and wild track on the entire record and I actually wish cuy took as many risks on the other tracks here as he did on this song because the vocal performances are wild the guitars are heavy the drums are punk as hell but the thing is these halfway decent tracks are nowhere near as plentiful enough or quality enough to raise the standard of of this entire album NE L to say the slower songs the more subtle songs the ballads on here are even more painfully boring tracks like wedding tuck or the incredibly long song Adventures which is not only needlessly long in and of itself but it also features this asinine beas and Butthead skit at the end of it actually quite a few tracks actually end with a beas and Butthead skit and honest to God appearance from Mike Judge animator writer and voiceover artist pretending to be beas and Butthead and acting out these really awkward dialogues in relation to this terrible album even beas and Butthead themselves can't seem to get on board with some of these songs as beas kind of pops into to say I don't know Butthead and then the teacher Pops in to go oh well okay kid C's emotional and blah blah blah blah blah and I know you guys are on hallucinogenics where I don't know where that came from but if there is kind of a moral in that kids listen drugs do not make you make good music they really don't you need to have kind of a base level of talent or at least some kind of like sober great musical idea before you just take tons of drugs and then embark on some kind of musical recording Adventure because that this will happen he just seems to travel further and further down this Rabbit Hole of awfulness and I just kind of wonder how far it can go how many albums until even the most deluded of kid Cy fans are going to say wow he's he's really making bad music this time and there are other lyrical moments on this record that are just so hilariously bad to go back to this Adventures track like her vagina is and warm I'll keep you safe just hold my arm and also this one thing I loved no more chicken sandwiches yes I'll pay for the damages hell yes I will say though quite a few of the lyrics on this record are incredibly dark they're depressive they're suicidal they deal in drug addiction however a lot of the very repetitive and very plain language that kid Cy uses on a lot of these tracks I think fails to kind of translate the pain that he's experiencing also the fact that so many of the songs on this record are musically inept it sort of keeps his message from having any impact the music itself is so weak that cu's emotions and cu's messages on these tracks just aren't that well translated not going to get too deep into it but another thing that I have notoriously never enjoyed about kid cu's music once again it's terrible here the vocals the singing on this record is by no measure good singing you cannot argue that the singing on this record is good you cannot you can't who am I what you feel complete I'm going to make an album it's going to be a rock album you know the 18 tracks that cui delivers initially on this album are bad enough but then once we get into the demo section of this record it just turns soul sucking it's like once you've knocked the person out you're just jumping on top of them and holding their arms down and smashing their face in until they're just a bloody pulp of nothing this album is the musical equivalent to just a mile of hot coal walking it is sadistic really what kid cuy is doing to his listeners by no standard is this a good or even a punk rock album he's he's lost his mind he's just off the deep end and not even like a you know in a in a way where he's like doing this Captain beef heart kind of thing where his music is just so whacked out and just so strange nobody can get it it's not like that at all it's like he's at such a high level of delusion that this becomes what you want to release as your album 90 minutes of this if I talk about this thing anymore the migraine that this album the seed of a migraine that this album planted in my head is going to get worse so for my sake for your sake let's just call it here I'm feeling a zero on this record a big fat goose egg you know there are a few riffs here and there that are somewhat okay but then the ridiculous lyrics and the beus and bad sketches just pull away from anything that this album had in terms of a Saving Grace including the final moments of the record the whole demo section I'm going to just leave bye and he always hated on the kid cuddly you know you think you got to beat no there's there's no cow thing going on here okay there's no cow thing going on here this video is over there's no more jokes there's no it's done okay it's over so bye
