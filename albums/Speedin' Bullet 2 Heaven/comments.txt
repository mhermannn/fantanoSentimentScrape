Listenijg to this album... like, its not that bad lmao. I feel like it does come off the same way as captain beefheart lmao, like can we admit that blues in general is dissonant and fucking wacked out. Tom waits? Bob dylan? None of that shit is cohesive, but it sounds cool.
EAT WHATS ON YOUR PLATE <br>FILL YOURSELF WITH HATE
No way people are saying Fanta o is wrong on this one‚ò†Ô∏è kid cudi glazers can‚Äôt admit when an album is bad
This album is amazing you cuck
NO MORE CHICKEN SANDWICHES YES ILL PAY FOR THE DAMAGES
Whats that album behind him with the constellation
I love this album, ya&#39;ll can&#39;t change my mind
maybe if it was called to pimp a speeding bullet he wouldve given it a 10<br><br><br><br><br><br>as a side note i genuinely have never seen him this upset during a review he actually was being tortured by this album
If the name of the album was To Pimp A Speedin Bullet 2 Heaven he would have given it a 10
I liked it
Cudi fuckin rocks....this guy has never made anything but a reaction video
L
At least we know Anthony isnt depressed
Late to the party but... a zero? C&#39;mon now. This album destroys Angelic 2 the Core.. You threw Miley Cyrus and Her Dead Petz a bone and gave that trash a 1.. that&#39;s WAY worse than this. This album at least has some genuine emotion poured into it. I dig a handful of tracks on it.
I use to hate the album... But now I love it!!
maturing is realising Fantano was wrong.
This album is a classic
I like all Kid Cudi Albums they have this raw element of creative energy
I&#39;m not saying Fantano was wrong to see this as a bad album or criticise the music. I think it&#39;s bad. But it was wack as fuck of him to personally attack Kid Cudi for his state of mind and drug addiction. He even recognized that many of Cudi&#39;s lyrics were extremely depressed and suicidal. For Anthony to not infer that Cudi was really struggling at the very least is really irresponsible, and calling an artistic work of him putting his suicidal thoughts on his sleeve as boring pretentious garbage seems in poor taste
MELTING is a banger tho
I can kinda groove to the first minute of &quot;Confused&quot; if I don&#39;t pay attention to the lyrics. That&#39;s just about the nicest thing I can say about this album.
should I listen to this
This is fantanos biggest video lol KING üëë CUDI
CONFUSED! is ok though. honestly kinda good
I feel like this album just needs to be listened to in a certain mood. You need to relate to be a huge fan of Cudi
I predict Melon will retire from youtube 10 years from now
I thought the album was fine
You gave this album a 0 which is basically a Light 0 which is basically a Decent 0 which is basically a Strong 0 which is basically a Light 1 which is basically a Decent 1 which is basically a Strong 1 which is basically a Light 2 which is basically a Decent 2 which is basically a Strong 2 which is basically a Light 3 which is basically a Decent 3 which is basically a Strong 3 which is basically a Light 4 which is basically a Decent 4 which is basically a Strong 4 which is basically a Light 5 which is basically a Decent 5 which is basically a Strong 5 which is basically a Light 6 which is basically a Decent 6 which is basically a Strong 6 which is basically a Light 7 which is basically a Decent 7 which is basically a Strong 7 which is basically a Light 8 which is basically a Decent 8 which is basically a Strong 8 which is basically a Light 9 which is basically a Decent 9 which is basically a Strong 9 which is basically a 10.
You can literally see the chair in this one‚Ä¶ and no one noticed until he pointed out that he sits
I love this album
I hate this guy
You have to be in a certain space to discover this you can‚Äôt just listen and the demo tracks went over his head because he don‚Äôt make music. Music is for him not you
Speeding bullet to the trash can üòÖ
I hate how people like you can have a voice.
Today I had this thought &quot;oh yeah that thing, let me give it another listen,  maybe it wasn&#39;t as bad as I remember&quot;<br>Yeah,  I got 3 songs in and then checked the run time and saw 90 MINUTES and I backed the fuck down. <br>Unless you&#39;re an amazing songwriter,  punk rock and long run times don&#39;t go well together
Unless you experienced the &quot;Dark Night Soul&quot;(or the &quot;Kundalini Blues&quot; as I call it) on your Psychological/Spiritual/Artodyic journey to finding wholeness/enlightenment/individuation and also are honest enough with  oneself&#39;s to realize the piece of trash many of us also are too, deep down[and of course have a biase for grunge music, perhaps because of those reasons] then you probably should even listen or attempt to judge this music, its made for the few who&#39;ve been their and if you have you realize the rare masterpiece it was that most artist<br><b>(until the indie scene literally took this main stream n this album would probably top some charts if released today with all the indie, psychedic, music, festival, thats celebratory while still emo that erupted slowly through the years after its release..)</b><br>never take those chances and I&#39;m beyond grateful he did.
I really wish you would‚Äôve put a Beavis and Butthead skit at the end of this review. Missed opportunity
I watch this when I need cheering up
Bruh u wrong this album deserves at least like a solid 5 or sum not 0. You should give Lil Pump a zeroüíÄ
Melon should do a redux of this, i think SB2H is actually amazing
The album reminds me of how I once heard The Room described: A movie made by someone who has never seen a movie but had movies described to them. SB2H sounds like an album made by a person who has never heard a 90&#39;s alternative album but has had 90&#39;s alternative music explained to them. Also a person who doesn&#39;t have the chops to make this kind of music. Which is not to say that it takes virtuosic chops, and not to say that Scott isn&#39;t talented, he&#39;s just not a good singer or musician in the way that the music he was trying to make demands.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=460">7:40</a> I literally rewatch this video for this part
This is one of the only albums I can pick up when I feel like everything is falling apart around me. For anyone that‚Äôs ever been severely depressed and/or battling addiction this project hits in places other can‚Äôt.
This is def his funniest thumbnail ever
I can understand why people don‚Äôt like this album, but for me, it‚Äôs honesty and raw amount of ass really speaks to me.
fact is that this album IS cudi. this is the rawest emotion he&#39;s ever expressed. if you hate this album you&#39;ve never felt anything close to what cudi felt when making it
This album aged like milk
its kinda sad how blind this video is but its valid for the time it was released because people where shocked by change
Jus relistened and yeah how can you like grunge and say that the lyrics in this album isn‚Äôt that great when Kurt cobain himself was saying Lyrics such as mosquito and etc . The problem is with critics is y‚Äôall contradict yourselfs a lot . Which is the issue in my personal opinion grunge music was always suppose to be abstract and a bit off putting but at the same time a vibe . It is the genre for chaos and emotions . Whether in anger or sadness . It jus seems to me fantano you don‚Äôt really know what you be talking about alot of times . And you‚Äôve jus never had real depression or pain in your life to understand how raw this album was . Cudi was almost gone but he made this album to be able to live . I get you wanna talk about guitar tones and etc but the songs aren‚Äôt that bad in the slightest . This feels like the mos real grunge sounding album since the 90s . Now adays hardly anyone plays instruments . And music isn‚Äôt always about a certain formula . It‚Äôs about feeling .
cudis best album
Kid Cudi struggled with drugs and depression during the time the album came out which probably explains why this album was a monstrosity.
Speeding bullet 2 hell
Machine Gun Kelly got a higher score than thisüò≠üò≠üò≠
This review is still funny till this day, but the album has definetly grown on me alot ngl. And I&#39;m glad I ain&#39;t the only one from looking at some recent comments.
I guess you don&#39;t smoke dope like Kid Cudi
Am I the only one that oddly found a couple of the demo songs more enjoyable, than the actual main part of the album?
As badly put together as this album is, there are a few highlights for me, some of the tracks here really do capture the feeling of intense depression
i rate this album review video a 0/10
The Pete &amp; Pete vinyl is so cool
His &quot;0&quot; reviews are so funny because he sounds legitimately offended by the music
What‚Äôs wrong with hair-cake and cornerstones?
The teacher is you dude
This album is great. Fuck you fantano
I really love SBTH, THE WHOLE THING including the skits(i can understand the skit hate). I dislike 1 song only which is the acoustic version of the album title song. I don&#39;t dislike the album length but a really long deluxe version should&#39;ve  happened. I love SBTH but  if I HATED it I would score it at least a 3.4 . 0 is a bit extreme. I would agree its boring AS FUCK if unrelatable. I would assume it&#39;s impossible to like/relate to EVERY song unless you have been in that same headspace &amp; I definitely have been &amp; can relate 100%. If you&#39;ve never been (((extremely))) suicidal for a (really) long time I could understand liking half the album or almost none of it. There&#39;s definitely people that 100% relate  but still hate it tho. At least a 3 if I hated it definitely not a 0. I couldn&#39;t believe anyone who likes this album has a horrible taste in music. Bad music tastes do exist but There&#39;s A LOT of horrendus albums that are beyond worse in comparison. SBTH has many haters, but also has a MASSIVE amount of fans. So if a MASSIVE fan base exists then cudis mission was acomplished very well. Im  not a cringy hate my life edge-lord fake depressed person, I can genuinely relate to SBTH as a 27 year old.
Desperate need of a Redux
My favorite album of all time
I love this album.. it&#39;s so raw. It definitely becomes better when you&#39;re at your lowest.
It‚Äôs funny that Cudi did a full 180 from SB2H to PPDS then to KSG
This is one of those albums that you‚Äôll only like if you‚Äôre at ur lowest
I can understand why people don‚Äôt like this album, but personally, it has grown on me mainly bc u can feel the raw emotion that Cudi expresses
This review is the equivalent of a rage quit.
cal had a point honestly
I&#39;ve never listened to him before, but I found out about the album in the video &quot;its so bad, which so good&quot;. I love this album from start to finish. I even got myself a tattoo with the name of the song.
I love this album.
I love this album I wish he&#39;d make more music like this. If anyone knows something similar let me know
best album of all time! he did what kurt did but better..all the pain he endured was put into that album and absolu im not even going to finish ur all to close minded ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I can&#39;t explain it in words, but this is the best album of all time
I didn‚Äôt dig this album when I first heard it but recently giving it another was a pretty good idea cause I‚Äôve found something to really dig and appreciate it sometimes I just put on Confused or the titled song to push back and fight the darkness that hits me sometimes so now I pretty much adore to at least like every Cudi album
. lmao nod - 10.8. if didn‚Äôt skim thru album prob would‚Äôve blwn brains out tooüíÄ- it had interstng sects bt th beavisbthd was terribl^
Classic üòÇüòÇ
He didnt even get to talk about The Return of Chip Douglas...
When you Danny.
Kid Cudi aside, I feel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=591">9:51</a> on another level
cudi the only mf who can drop some of the best and worst music ever
Red Sabbath is the worst song. Uuuugh.
Judgemental cunt is the worst thing I&#39;ve ever heard
Aweeeeeeeeee the hair cake reference :,,,)
i think this is a solid 8 to a 9, i really enjoyed this album. i usually agree with anthony a lot but don‚Äôt agree with this
This is one of Fantano‚Äôs best reviews. Relatively balanced and fair in the beginning - looking for a saving grace and really ‚Äútrying‚Äù to give the record its due process. Some good Beavis and Butthead and Cudi impressions too. But then his tone changes and his contempt for the record comes out. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt say the singing is good. You cannot. YOU CAN‚ÄôT!‚Äù<br><br>It‚Äôs stuff like this where his performance convinces you that he has no choice but to give the album a zero, because otherwise he wouldn‚Äôt be doing his job. And he does it in a performative way that wouldn‚Äôt be nearly as effective if you were just reading the review on paper.
The album is a feeling. It&#39;s not about polished, well produced shit. That&#39;s some emo girl pop. This is about when you&#39;re at absolute rock bottom, torn the fuck up, raw and rough af. Just coarse, black darkness. You will understand this album then. Life has to hit you first. I know this now.
this is by no mean cudi&#39;s best but it&#39;s not the worst thing in the world either <br><br>there are some good songs it&#39;s at the very least a 5/10, it does get tiring specially at the demo tracks
i like this album -hamish
Speeding bullet to hell through his head,<br>Im a huge cudi fan btw
This album is horrible but I don‚Äôt think you should‚Äôve talked about his mental health in a negative sense. Especially when he was actually losing his mind during this album and it‚Äôs nothing to joke about.
Love that Polaris record back there! Pete and Pete!
you have no taste bro sorry TONY also ur bald
Hey Beavis, you remember that time we were on that shitty Kid Cudi album?
Hey pinot
Decent to strong 2, not a good album...
fantano&#39;s released so many negative reviews since this one but this still might be my favorite, so fucking funny
5 years later it‚Äôs now my favorite album next to bleach
GREATEST ALBUM OF ALL TIME
Fantano‚Äôs biggest L
This review is hilarious
This dude is all cap. This is cudi&#39;s version of Yeezus. Not meant for everyday listening, and takes a while to warm up to it esp when it first dropped, but it grew over time/life. <br><br>but definitely has a punk rock grunge vibe. Listen to it when you&#39;re angry, it sounds different üíØ
From a high Cudi getting a 0 to a sober Cudi getting a 10. This man really changed his attitude with this review. Thank you melon
Handle With Care is a nice track though.
Cudi has a 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 10 from fantano
this album is an embodiment of psychosis
i would&#39;ve not reviewed this, cudi was clearly in an extremely dark place
Anybody knos the album in tge background next to dummy? Thanks!
who even listens to him
This album clears death grips discography
This actually features on the Wikipedia timeline of grunge albums... I&#39;m 43,....Fuck me.
Idc what anyone says, edge of the earth is fire and a vibe
Beavis and Butthead said this was the coolest album that has ever been made so review is obsolete
I just listened to the album and I couldn‚Äôt even finish it. I thought I was just being too hard on the album but bro after seeing how many more songs I had left, I gave up. I was thinking about what you said about the album and you were fucking right.
worst albums of the decade ehh nah got to stop
speedin bullet 2 heaven is great
Listening in 2022. This was actually a decent album
This is my favorite kid cudi album
Oh yeah sure. This was SHIT. but black country new road.....that shit fire.
Cudi was in the worst state of his life mentally when he made this album. That‚Äôs really why this album flopped. He talks about it in his documentary.
Overrated artist
I never listened to it because of this review and I just did a sit down and listen through. This review was too goddamn harsh.
Come on man this is at least a 1
Kid Cuddly... sus
still better than the money store
Why did you skip satellite flight?
You should definitely Redux this
Beavis and Butthead skits gave me breaks so my brain wouldn‚Äôt melt to this god awful album
I actually liked Speedin&#39; Bullet 2 Heaven, my favorite track is Fuchsia Butterflies. The raw guitar and Cudi&#39;s vocals really made the track.
I understand the hate towards this album, but in my personal experience parts of this album are really emotionaly moving. This album helped me to go through the worst parts of my life by knowing someone as successful as Kid Cudi has the same rock bottoms as I do
I think this is the worst video Fantano has ever made
Man I like this album, still easily his worst release but not bad by any means imo.
lowkey it‚Äôs not bad
That‚Äôs right you are a fucking nerd. Listen to the message you punk. U fucking virgin.
your so clearly missing the entire point of the album. From where cudi was at the time of making it, to the message he was trying to convey... you missed it all. This was in no way just a &quot;sad attempt at copying cobain&quot;.
Don‚Äôt let this hating ass dude take away from cudi‚Äôs creativity and greatness. Every song is unique pieces of gold and diamonds. How you gonna just not listen to a whole album based off a previous song you didn‚Äôt like, enjoy the music for what it is not based on what u think it should sound like
Still one of my favorite albums
No
It&#39;s a solid punk album
your bald and probably racist, nobody cares abt what you think your litteraly bald
Kurt Cobain did not commit suicide‚Ä¶
Real MUSIC fans will love what Cudi did with SBTH this was marketed and label as a HIP HOP album when it should of been marketed as grunge and alternative ya are fake Cudi fans this album incredible
You can&#39;t deny this album is very entertaining
This album grew on me <br>- Man in the night <br>- screwed <br>- judgemental c**t<br>- wedding tux <br>- fuschia butterflies <br>- speedin bullet 2 heaven<br>&amp; my favorite song on the album <br>- melting <br>Are all good dare I say great tracks
it‚Äôs bad but not a 0,  it‚Äôs like a 3-4/10
i unapologetically love this album. so many great songs
I‚Äôm more opened minded with music now and when I revisited this album I realized I generally liked the songs and didn‚Äôt have to replay them to like them I liked them first listen. He has gore at songs on the album people just want the same rap trash
This Album is literally my fav it&#39;s soooo good I literally cannot understand why people hate it
this album is fire
You know, revisiting it&#39;s pretty fucking great!
Bruh
I enjoy this album a lot.
Sometimes when i&#39;m high af i comeback to watch this and laugh for 10 min straight
How I feel about the money store. Unlistenable
I&#39;m going through all your video to just dislike
one of my fav Albums atm
ive never seen melon man this angery and dissapointed guess kid cudi got revenge for him giving motm2 a 6 lol
Confused is the only track I enjoy from this album, The rest of it is painfully boring or Bad
big miss anthony
The audio has a fuck ton of white noise lol.
2015: OH IF I CRASH<br><br>2018: AND WHEN I LAND
Sry dad
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=598">9:58</a>
I don‚Äôt understand how u gave this such a low score
Kid Cudi is the only artist to get a 0 and also a 10 lmaoo
i didn&#39;t know this even existed until today.
Unironically my favorite Cudi album
this album is my guilty pleasure to be honest but I completey agree with these statements at the same time
I love this album I don&#39;t understand the hate on this one
kid cudi is the only artist that has a 0 and a 10 from fantano
Anthony: Complains about him crying becoming a meme<br><br>Also Anthony:
Cool cat says kid Cudi got a speeding bullet to 10
Nah after I‚Äôve listened to this album 20 times through it has become the most beautiful work of art that has ever entered my ears.
Wow this is terrible yeah I‚Äôm late asf
I like this album
Plot twist: he smoked so much weed, and got so high that he wanted to give the message to not do drugs and do music at the same time.
Don&#39;t understand a 0 I personally love the rock mix with his vocals
5/10 for me
I felt like he chocked this up to be so bad but I actually liked it. Some parts weren&#39;t great, but overall I liked it.
The return of Chip douglas is a genius song
Q
the album that squashed the melon
Jesus Christ man. Indicud is a fucking masterpiece
Best album of all time
AN-KNEE WHY U ALWAYS HATIN ON THA KID CUDDLY?!
U need to take a 10 strip and listen to this album
Kid Cudi makes the best 0/10 album. Just that flawed vocals and simply painful lyrics drowning in a lo-fi instruments.<br><br>Edit: This thing really grew on me a lot!!
Who&#39;s here after Tones and I got a 0 Lmao
Here after Tones and I took Cudi‚Äôs spot.
idk why I keep coming back to this lol
<b>Speedin&#39; Bullet 2 Eleven</b>
This was the only year where Fantano gave out both a 10/10 and a 0/10. I wonder if we will ever get that again.
So this was Fantano‚Äôs first unironic 0 then? He gave his first 10 in 2011 but his first 0 4 years after that. Twice as many 10/10s as 0/10s. Weird, but makes sense.
Even the thumbnail looks like he‚Äôs trying not to laugh at how awful this album is
This album is so underrated tho you blind bro smh ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I always come back to this review it&#39;s so hilarious üòÇüòÇüòÇ
I PRAY TO ALLAH
This album was raw I slept on it cuase of this video but went back to it and it was amazing
if anyones criticism on art is that its boring their opinion doesn&#39;t matter
I just bought this CD because I like it
can‚Äôt believe melon gave this album a 69
I love this album
First time listen thoughts:<br>Definitely, Definitely not a zero. Atleast 5 or 6.
Speedin&#39; bullet 0/ten
I‚Äôll do it then.<br><br>Tran- SITION!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=385">6:25</a> that laugh XD
Cute
‚ÄùDrugs dont make good music.‚Äù Facts!!
He said the word cunt so polite lol
has anyone ever looked at fantano‚Äôs lips
Love cudi but I‚Äôm glad someone pointed out how trash this is
What‚Äôs the name of the album in his vinyl behind him on the left of dummy?
I&#39;m only here for the dummy vinyl in the background
I am the only person on this earth who likes this album
Big fat goose egg lol!
Here in 2021 and if anyone sees this I want you to know this is one of my favorite cudi albums. I can take the heat...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=481">8:01</a>
this is the biggest L ive ever seen
Imagine if he was doing reaction videos back then of when he first heard this album
Has no-one really commented on the Polaris LP in the background??
it‚Äôs not that bad. strong 6 to a light 7
handle with care is a good track
hey it&#39;s not THAT bad. Probably a 4/10 imo
WHOOO AM I <br><br>WHOOO ARE WEEE?<br><br>All I want<br><br>IS TO FEEL COMPLETE<br><br><br><br>CONFUSED!
You know melon I like this record
I really hope he likes it!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>He didn&#39;t like it
I never knew this album exist until yesterday I listened to it and man its just awwwwwwwwwwwwwwful. Awful awful I then went and listened back to KSG and almost cried because  it meant so much more knowing that cudi went from being a complete mess of a person suicide depression that was expressed in the saddest and most upsetting disappointing way in SB2H to a masterpiece in KSG. Truly beautiful love cudi
Wow. A friend of mine just recommendet this peace of shit and I thought ok, I love KSG, let‚Äòs give it a try. I did. I shouldn‚Äòt have. Now I was wondering if it was just me but thank god it‚Äòs objectively trash.
now that i‚Äôm listening to it now it‚Äôs kind of good some of the songs
Needlecock sits in his room all day jackin it and thinks he‚Äôs in a position to determine whether or not a record is good
Nobody:<br><br>Anthony Fantano: Big fat GoOSeEgG
I am in shock that this album has a higher score than MOTM on pitchfork
how the fuck does kid cudi have one of the five 10&#39;s and one of the few 0&#39;s that anthony has given at the same time.
this is unironically one of my favorite albums ever, and insides out is my favorite song ever :)
wow anthony looks pretty happy on the thumbnail<br>hope he doesn&#39;t give this album a strong 0 out of ten
I actually like this album, but it would be a thousand times better if the Beavis and Butthead skits at the end of tracks were just scrapped
It‚Äôs not even bad Confused! Is his best song
Underrated rock album. Idc what anyone says.
I read that Erykah Badu and Andre 3000 loved this album<br><br>Just goes to show that music is at the end of the day, quite subjective
I love the trippy album cover tho
Fucking idiot terrible review
I wanna know what he was on while making these songs and writing the skits
Anthony you really didn‚Äôt have to obliterate him like this
This might be the only video where he doesn‚Äôt say ‚ÄúFOREVER‚Äù
I LOVE THIS ALBUM IT GETS BETTER EVERY YEAR
Melon you have to admit, Speedin‚Äô Bullet 2 Heaven is one of the albums of all time
He has aspergers probably that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs repetitive dudes different that‚Äôs what makes cudi different I mean yeh and yeh he was going through shit needed to go get checked into a hospital clearly was having a breakdown it‚Äôs sad but I‚Äôm thinking he‚Äôs getting a bit better but yeh not the best album but again he was going through shit
Cudi is the only musician to get a 0 and a 10 in 3 years
Going back to it now I can see why he&#39;s mad. When the album is good it&#39;s actually a banger but cudi clearly wasn&#39;t going for perfection. I still enjoyed it thoughaly and the skits make it way better lol
Madness into sadness
This video actually makes me seethe with anger at just about every moment
Fuck u man
OG fans knows that the original description was &quot;kid cudi loses his mind
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=387">6:27</a> thumbnail
I lived long enough to see a man get a 0 and his very next project gets a 10 i mean what a legend
I personally don&#39;t mind this album. Got some bangers on it. I just like hearing a man go insane over a thing he doesn&#39;t enjoy.<br><br>Gotta admit though, you didn&#39;t have to say that Kid Cudi should ride a speeding bullet train into a blazing fire. a biiiit too far there, melon.
I loved this album wdymüò≠
I just don‚Äôt think people understand this album. Yes it‚Äôs not the greatest to listen too, yes it has very annoying lines, but that wasn‚Äôt the point. This album was just a way for Cudi to scream his heart out. He‚Äôs been dealing with addiction and drug abuse during this album keep in mind and it was getting so bad  he just needed to sound what he was feeling rather than sing what he was feeling.
Speedin bullet 2 to light 3
I swear the description to this video used to be different and he says that ‚Äúkid Cudi losses his mind‚Äù
Do a redux review of this album.
Cudi&#39;s Montage saves this man&#39;s whole career. What a beautiful song man...
Confused is pretty good
This album is one fat oof
I definitely don&#39;t agree with you saying his first works were mediocre but everyone&#39;s entitled to an opinion
It&#39;s as bad as the album cover
Kid cudi put 2 instead of to because he knew a two was the max fantano would rate this album
Lmao motd to this then this to motm III üò≥ cudi career really model his sanity huh üòÇ
just listened to speedin bullet 2 heaven for the first time today and honestly i have no clue wtf fantano talking abt, easily one of my favorite cudi albums
Years later, I remember Melon‚Äôs fake Cudi song more than I remember anything on the actual album.
My little brother just looked over and asked me ‚Äúwhen did Logic make a YouTube channel‚Äù
I want someone to makea record called slowing grenade to hell and it be the best album ever
I got scared when he started screaming at the demo songs
i actually like this album,,,, idk I dont listen to rock or grunge so maybe that&#39;s why it sounds good to me, the skits are intolerable for sure
This is one of best kid cudis best albums. Please get someone that actually appreciates art for what it is.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=120">2:00</a>
capitain beefheart is just bad
Indicud is fucking awesome
this album is super underrated fr, the beavis and butthead stuff sucks but a lot of the songs are genuinely good
This is one of his best albums. WZRD is another amazing album
The return of chip douglas is the most unintentionally funny shit ever. It&#39;s so awful that I love it
The growth is out of this worldü§Ø
that little smudge in the middle of the 0 annoys me
in fantano&#39;s kid cudi - speedin bullet 2 heaven review, he makes a silly analogy and says that kid cudi is pretending he&#39;s kurt cobain, and puts up an image of kurt cobain - montage of heck. he gave this album a 0<br><br> and next time he reviewed a kid cudi project, it sampled kurt cobain on the song cudi montage, and fantano gave it a 10
No fucking way he thinks indicud is a 0
Look at the description he edited the scoreüòÇüòÇ
Oh how far he‚Äôs risen hearing MOTM3
Theres something about ‚ÄòCONFUSED!‚Äô thats somewhat cool so i wouldn‚Äôt say thats a bad track but its nothing good
Just listened to this for the first time after finally giving in to an avalanche of morbid curiosity. I cannot get through one whole song. I thought you were exaggerating but Christ... this is the most simultaniously horrible/boring thing I&#39;ve ever heard. I&#39;m dumbfounded you got all the way through this
I will never forgive Anthony for convincing everyone this is a terrible album
WHO&#39;S HERE FROM MOTM3 REVIEW?????
Worst thing he ever made but his new shit is fuego
A Tesla can go 0 to 100 in 4.2 seconds. Kid Cudi can go 0-10 in 3 years.
I liked ‚ÄúConfused‚Äù tho.
I thought it was questionable like everyone else when it came out; but over the years it really grew on me.<br>sometimes good art elicits strong emotion even if its a negative emotion.
Anthony fandango ‚Äúthere are absolutely some decent riffs‚Äù<br>Gives 0/10
He finna score MOTM III 10/10. Calling it here
Biiiiiiig comeback
I actually really liked the title track
Listen to Edge Of The Earth. Also the chicken sandwiches line is from his texts with his ex GF. The lack of research is disappointing regarding this goated album.
This guy&#39;s obviously never tried mushrooms
Man Cudi sucks, he will never get a 10
Am I weird for liking this album?
Took me 5 years to realize he gave this a .94/10 and not .94 as in 9.4/10... I&#39;ve been claiming to love an album that&#39;s this horrible for this long? Sweet dude fuck me
i think this album is near perfection
your harshest review. if it came out in 2020 it would‚Äôve gotten a 3.
If this album were good you would have given it a ten. Disappointed in your bias melon.
whatever people say bout this album, this my theraphy
You don‚Äôt get it because you can‚Äôt relate. Lmao
I don&#39;t understand why he is so angry about it, the album is bad, but you don&#39;t have to go off on him as hard as you did, also the description, ik what you&#39;ve done melon...
Yeah I listened to a little bit and I can see exactly what you mean because the first song I listened  to it actually genuinely hurt my ears this is really really bad.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=457">7:37</a> üîÅ
Whenever I ask my mother if I can have friends over: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=119">1:59</a>
Anybody else like this album
I have a lot of edgey friends who think this is cudis best album, it ‚Äúdescribes their pain better than any other song‚Äù
I remember when the description used to say &quot;Kid Cudi loses his mind&quot; ü§£ <br><br>Also that thumbnail is still gold ü§£
I agree with most of what he‚Äôs saying, but Indicud was and is a masterpiece imo
Then, Kid Cudi does an album with Kanye West and it goes really well.
yeah ur a asshole buddy. cudi is a better artist then you will ever be
this album legit gave me a headache. I only somewhat liked 3 songs. Pure pain.
The album would&#39;ve gotten a 1 if there weren&#39;t the beavis and butthead skits
Handle With Care is the only best song
I&#39;m calling your mom for saying the C Word.
I saw Polaris and clicked like my life depended on it
worst take on any album ever
2015: Speedin&#39; Bullet 2 Heaven: 0.94721/10<br>2018: Kids See Ghosts: 10/10<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>DAMN.
THE ANGELS HAVE NO WHISKEY MNAAMMAANAMAMAAAAAA
its like death grips but bad (or worse, depending on who you are)
This is like the lightest 0 to a light 1 ever
It‚Äôs mediocre, but it‚Äôs not actually that bad. It just sounds like demos
People its okay for other people to have opinions and you are entitled to have yours too. Stop being a little bitch because some disagrees with you üòÄ
this man kid cudi straight went from a 0 to a 10
&quot;Speedin&#39; Bullet To Hell&quot; as Meami Dev says
This was probably the most angry 0 Anthony Fantano has ever given
I never disliked a video so much. Don&#39;t listen with headphone his tortuous yelling will blow your ear drums out. plus Andre 3000 said he liked the album and has way more accolades than you gosh im blocking you if I knew how. They say your old work is the best just like how kid cud came out on man on the moon and hated his new stuff progressively I&#39;ve also seen your Detroit 2 review is garbage , wow Im flabbergasted you have the audacity to review anything geez.
bro we get it Death Grips=good...<br>Everything else=bad
This sounds like a 90‚Äôs nostalgia album gone wrong.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=588">9:48</a><br>I drew the Cal meme that&#39;s on the wall. It&#39;s only in the vid for a few seconds, but I&#39;m glad I left a mark on this monumental meme review.<br><br>Anthony posted on Facebook like a month before this video released asking for fan art of cal, there were like some legit nice looking submissions like drawings and paintings. I decided to whip up some spicy shit in Microsoft paint in about 5 minutes and commented it on the post and forgot about it lol, when I saw it on the wall my first time watching this this review I shit a brick<br><br>That is all I drew that horrible picture of cal lmao Anthony credit u me u scuMbAg
Honestly this guy just trashes good music üòÇ example A. This album is fantastic <br>Example B. MBDTF is phenomenal <br>Example C. Swimming and watching movies with the sound off are phenomenal.
The thumbnail is the exact opposite of the review
What&#39;s that record next to Dummy? I like the art lol
oof.
You don&#39;t understand it.
This review is so infamous that I forget Fantano says cunt
2nd album is the shit, is my fav album
I&#39;m gonna be honest, I don&#39;t think he liked the album.
all these rap rock flops make me wanna see some famous rapper and a famous rockstar form a supergroup to finally create a successful mix
Probably my favorite album of all time, don&#39;t care
4 years ago
Melon should listen to this album on acid and then re review it
Come on ‚Äú...‚Äù was my favorite song on the album
I watch this video at least once a month or in two months. If not even more regularly. It hands down helps me go through my day. This is why internet was made. If there was an internet hall of fame, this video will be there as a personal choice. Great stuff melon.
Anthony I‚Äôm sorry that I like Indicud, please let my family go
The albums been updated to 0.94721/10 ?!?
The score in the description is 0.94721 and if you round 7 up, you turn the 4 into a 5, and if you round that 5 up it turns the 0.9 into a 1.0, therefore, Kid Cudi - Speedin Bullet 2 Heaven got a 1, not a 0.
Kid Cudi. The only man on earth to score a 0 and a 10 from Anthony
I came here to hear him say cunt
I agree. Absolute dog shit
This is the type of album he would either give a 0 or a 9
MOTM changed my fucking life, Mr Raged was good, indicud was good, WZRD was trash, satellite flight was forgettable, SB2H was ABSOLUTE HOT TRASH SHIT
I dont know how this album avoided a NOT GOOD score lol
You can&#39;t say so many good things about the record and give it a 0. Thats a worthless review
Im a huge Cudi fan. It wasnt a bad album it was just too many songs and it was not presented correctly, I can find 12 really good songs and pick better singles for the album and the way we view this album would be totally different. Cudi&#39;s style has always been different but Speeding Bullet was all the way left. I feel like that is what singles are for, singles sort of prepare the audience for what the album is going to sound like a few months before it drops. The singles that were chosen were terrible. Confused was ok(acoustics version would have been a better choice), along with Judgmental Cunt and Wedding Tux 2 songs that would not be of the 12 songs I would have picked for the album. He had really good songs like Man in the Night and Handle With Care that would have been better as singles. But when I listen back on the album it is his best vocal performance to date.
This was no more than just a cash grab click bait than it was an album review. Man doesn‚Äôt know his taste for being the biggest ‚Äúinternet music nerd‚Äù
Ur a bitch
What the fuck I loved this album
0.9/10 so it really wasn&#39;t a 0/10 all along
sayin &quot;It&#39;s time for a review of the new kid - Cudi&quot; right from the start of the video is very unsettling melon
Just listened to the entire thing. Man, it was very hard to listen to. Some songs have a half way decent intro and they make you think &quot;alright maybe this will be at least somewhat listenable&quot; and then the vocals come on and the same riff just droans on for 3 minutes like Fantano said. <br><br>Wedding Tux, Confused. The only two songs I found worth anything on this entire 17 song album, and they are not nearly good enough to make up for the rest of the other 15 songs that drag them down like passengers on the titanic. <br><br>0/10.
I know all words of this review.
It&#39;s pretty bad yooo lol
cudi stan. love every album every song. this one hurts still 4 years later
What is this album with this cat in the background?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=119">1:59</a>
This will be the most influential generational album of the future. This is what music will sound like as sounds and cultures blend
From a 0 to a 10
you wrong for this melon<br>albums genuinely an 8/10 you just dont understand black art
I‚Äôm all smiles
He‚Äôs wearing the same shirt for Miley Cyrus‚Äôs dead petz review. The first red flannel <br><br>Pulling a sneaky one on us.
Name of the vinyl in the back?
anthony talks about how kid cudi is trying to write the montage of heck and gets a zero. two years later, he SAMPLES a song from that tape and gets a ten.
He didn&#39;t gave it a zero,he gave 0.94721
All things aside Anthony was really pissed for reviewing this album,he went insane
I‚Äôm feeling a light 0 to a strong 10 on this one
I disagree strongly
I agree Fantano ‚Äú...‚Äù was my least fav track too
Wow what a good 10/10 album according to fantano
it‚Äôs officially a 10
Issa 10
it‚Äôs a 10 for 24 hours everyone celebrate
I thought confused was pretty good
I genuinely like this album a lot not just cuz I like kid Cudi. You&#39;re a real asshole trying to make people that like this album feel bad about themselves for liking a album. U literally have 0 musical talent yet u think your opinion matters
Fuck u u literally gave a lil pump album a higher review than this kid Cudi album I scared of your taste in music. Personally I thought this album was great and creative asf, I&#39;d like to see your dumbass ever create something instead of judging it like you&#39;re God and getting these kids to agree with you
The big speeding bullet of all
Album of the decade
This album is a work of art. You never gave it a chance.
Indicud was a good album.<br>1. Man on the Moon 1 was like 8 or 9<br>2. Man on the Moon 2 was like 7<br>3. Indicud was like a 6 or a 7<br>4. Nobody listened to WZRD<br>5. Speeding Bullet was like a 5 or 6
would be a 10 if death grips made it
Today I literally just discovered melon puts his score in the description
Ye kid you need talent and then smoke weed to make good music!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=464">7:44</a><br><br><br>me when im gonna make a rock album
We got a 0 and a 10 for 2015 and Kid Cudi got a 0 and a 10
Cudi going from a 0 to a 10 is the biggest comeback story of all time
It‚Äôs not even the drugs you keep mentioning drugs. This album is about being defeated mentally it‚Äôs not about being brain dead on drugs if anything he‚Äôs using drugs to cope and mask his feelings. L for shitting on a album about mental illness I‚Äôm sure this will haunt you  in the future. Everyone has problems if you don‚Äôt relate that‚Äôs great but don‚Äôt shit on those who use music to express their pain. You shitting on this album is basically like you don‚Äôt give a fuck about anyone but yourself. Get over yourself and open your mind. Watch when you go through some real shit you‚Äôll go crawling back to this album
Funny that he said he fell off after MOTMii when he‚Äôs yet to drop a bad album
Bro... how the actual fuck is indicud a bad record?
best review eveR i COME BACK FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT
eh too much hate
I just recently started watching his stuff around December of 2019 and I don‚Äôt think I ever seen him get up off that chair lol
just watched a massacre
Not everyone can pull off grunge and Kid Cudi should leave this genre and just admire..Speedin Bullet was the best track for me.
Speedin&#39; bullet 2 hell
He&#39;s so he&#39;s so re-born. He&#39;s movin forward... he&#39;s movin forward... keep movin forward.
The Nothing literally starts with Cudi asking for candy
He doesn&#39;t have a least fav track but still gives this a 0
This album is now a cult classic, Melon ya ain&#39;t always right and you totally went into it with the wrong mindset. If you go through this album as if it dropped in the 90s, you&#39;ll then get it. This album has soooo many fuckin bangers. Also its quite funny seeing him eat his words as he reviews and raves over a Young Thug track, the king of repetition. Hold this L Melonü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòàü§òüèºüî• 90s aesthetics throughout this album are so beautiful
This is his best review.
My favorite review
I‚Äôm not gonna lie I like this album a lot and find myself relistening to most of the songs
Has the description always said 0.94721/10 instead of 0/10?
Its His best album
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs always hatin‚Äô on the Kid Cudders.‚Äù<br><br>-Cal
Also WZRD is really great
This album was good it didn&#39;t deserve a 0
In a couple years this album will have to get a classics review
You have to have been in a dark place to understand this album üíØ
Old description was way better
Anthony: Drugs do not make you make good music <br>Acidrap Era Chance : Am I a joke to you
I‚Äôm sure Anthony regrets this review.
I wonder if anyone here has actually listened to this album or are just riding the hate train. I&#39;m listening to it now, and it&#39;s definitely not his best work. It&#39;s pretty decent
i always watch these old reviews after he gave Lil Pump&#39;s album a 7
The Alpha and the Omega<br>Kid Cudi
wtf how is this one of the worst records of the century its one of the best
Who‚Äôs here after the Green Day review?
Who&#39;s here after Green Day just got a 0 lmfao
The only artist that got both a 0 and a 10
Wait, melon SITS DOWN IN HIS REVIEWS?!
Green day has joined the club
Who&#39;s here after Greenday got a 0 lmfao
Who‚Äôs here after Green Day got a fuckin 0
Has anyone noticed that the score in the description has changed to a 0.94721/10?
Green Day has joined the chat
0&gt;NOT GOOD <br>Right
Who‚Äôs here after  Green Day got 0
Who‚Äôs returning to this masterpiece of a review after Green Day got a zero
Just in case you can&#39;t speak melon, here&#39;s the translation: &quot;I want to have sex with this album, 10/10&quot; - Mr. Melon
Damn dude you really didnt understand this
Confused is an okay song tbh
Adventures is good
in another video, you mentioned how growing up you realize the music you listened to as a kid &quot;fucking sucks&quot;. i couldn&#39;t think of one but now i remember i listened to &quot;Unfuckwittable&quot; from indicud lmao. I feel like I deep down knew it was terrible but I didn&#39;t want to admit it consciously, as I did with a lot of things as a kid, especially sonic games.
Wow this is disgusting melon literally just came out as a racist he will not allow himself to enjoy rock music because it‚Äôs sung by a black man. Unsubscribed.
There are a few good songs on this. And trippy shit goin on....
This new Kid Cudi album, it&#39;s not goodüí£üí•
This album was amazing. True Cudi fans know this is his artistry pouring out of him. Cudi made this album for him not for shitty reviews of people who aren&#39;t into it.
WZRD, Indicud were both great albums
that beavis impression was on point lmao
You didn‚Äôt have to end the mans career let alone life daym son
Idk a lot of people hate this album but if you listen to the entire thing start to finish, it‚Äôs pretty good to me at least
C‚Äômon melon, round it to a .95
He had to give it album of the decade didn&#39;t he
there was a couple of good songs
No least favorite tracks, it&#39;s look you love this album...
&amp; this was the exact moment melon was broken
Ur a fukin geek bruh
You sir are an idiot
I feel like you have to be going through shit to connect with this album. But if you do you&#39;ll love it.
my favorite album.. here in 2019
Playing this album on guitar is pretty fun to me. 3-4 chords every song and as a beginner it was just something cool to show the homies.
Whitethony Noisetano
The smile in the thumbnail says it all
I walked in on my girlfriend listening to this album<br><br><br><br><br>Now im single
If you listen to grunge; consider checking my channel. I make original songs and would greatly appreciate your support.
I actually think that MOTM 2 is Cudi‚Äôs high-point.
Awwww you bitch you let cal speak! Lol
y&#39;all look it&#39;s not a zero anymore!!!! damn
I revisit this shit like twice a year just so I can laugh my ass offüòÖüòÖ. Funniest Melon video of all timeüòÇ
I fucking hate this album!
this album made him insane
Review Satellite Flight.
Just from watching your review and knowing Kid Cudi&#39;s other work, I can tell that this is like the 2015 pop rap version of John Frusciante&#39;s Niandra LaDes and Usually Just a T-Shirt but without the heroin.
Ok boomer
i just heard some of these songs... i don&#39;t think it merited a ZERO.
&quot;This album is the musical equivalent to a mile of hot coal walking, it is sadistic really what Kid Cudi is doing to his listeners&quot;<br>This review is fucking hilarious, the roasts get exponentially better hahahah
Well if you round up then technically Cudi got a 1.
I&#39;m glad Mr. Fantano came back in his review today and gave it the 9 it deserved, can&#39;t believe he would do a complete 180 like that though
About to go 2 million so soon Melon!
The album is not that bad coming from someone who listens to rock from all eras , dont let someones opinion sway your own judgement.
i really like CONFUSED! but i tried to listen to to the rest of the album and it was a fucking headache. just shitty guitars, awful vocals. holy fuck who green lighted this?
Legendary review lmfao
but you appreciated some pat of the album so logically it cant be 0 duuh. Your reviews are good but your rate seems to have no logic for me <br>for me : <br>1 awful (in all my life only 1 album i rated it like that cause he was awful all along hard to listend i wanted to bump my head off the wall<br>2 really bad<br>3 bad<br>4 boring<br>5 still boring but some good stuff<br>6 somewhat good<br>7 good<br>8 really good<br>9 excellent<br>10 masterpiece ( these albums are supposed to be really uncommon)
The beavis and butthead parts should just die, but that applies to the skit concept in general
Maybe it should have just been trimmed down a lot?, listening to only a few songs I really don&#39;t get how there could nothing of value in this, it seems at least to be a pretty natural blend of rock and hip-hop and made from someone who felt it rather than a team of writers trying to make a mindless club banger or something, Idk...
mary mary so contrary
I still hate this review
not gonna lie knowing some of the stuff he gives 10s i was expecting more
Funny how the next video after this for me is a 10
Lmao thas my favourite cal skit had me dying
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=119">1:59</a>
I loved it! I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt listen  to you before I streamed it üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Dammit! Grunge could&#39;ve come back, and it&#39;s a shame because some of the instrumentals aren&#39;t that bad...but Cudi.....OH GOOOOOOD.
Fuck y‚Äôall I luh this album.
who am i, who are we?
Anthony does not like it when your bad albums are very long, because he has to listen to the whole thing to do a review
I loved man on the moon 1 &amp; 2, but yeah, this ones awful
A lot of people get offended when a black man makes a rock album...
Yall THIS IS THE GREATEST ALBUM EVER! FANTANA DOES NOT KNOW PUNK ROCK, FANTANA IS POP IM SO CONFUSED AT HOW HE GOT EVERYONE TO DISLIKE THIS ALBUM YALL MISSING OUT DID YALL EVEN LISTEN OR OUR YOU JUST LISTENING TO THE MELON AND PITCHFORK<br>EDGE OF THE EARTH<br>CONFUSED<br>MAN IN THE NIGHT <br>FADE 2 RED <br>ADVENTURES <br>AMEN<br>JUDGEMENTAL CUNT<br>SEANCE CHAOS<br>WEDDING TUX <br>FAIRY TALE REMAINS <br>WAIT!<br>SPeedING BULLET 2 Heaven
Didn‚Äôt the description used to say ‚Äúkid cudi loses his mind?‚Äù
This guy talks like hes never felt depressed before. What a hater...
This was worthy of a Red Flannel if I&#39;ve ever seen one!
You do a damn good Beavis, Melon.
*Speedin&#39; Bullet 2 Heaven
&quot;drugs cant make you do good music.&quot;<br>chance the rapper: <b>stops doing acid</b>
Are you fucking kidding me Anthony?

Let me tell you something he didn‚Äôt listen to it on LSD
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=484">8:04</a> So what you&#39;re saying here is that Mario Yamasaki produced this record
—Ö–º–º.. –¥–∞ –≤—Ä–æ–¥–µ –Ω–æ—Ä–º –æ–Ω —Å–¥–µ–ª–∞–ª
Do I see Polaris - Music from the adventures of Pete and Pete behind you? You know your stuff man I love that album.
u a bitch
You realize you&#39;re a complete meme right? A complete joke? Your &quot; career &quot; is a sham
i could deal with the bad writing but the production was completely unforgivable. This dude had access to all of the best and then still put out garbage.
It has some okay songs on here anthony always trying to down play artist
I LIKE THIS ALBUM BRUH YOU&#39;RE JUST TOO OVERREACTING TO IT 10 OUT OF 10 CUDI!<br>I LIKE THIS ALBUM BRUH YOU&#39;RE JUST TOO OVERREACTING TO IT 10 OUT OF 10 CUDI!

&quot;no more chicken sandwiches yes i&#39;ll pay for the damages&quot;<br><br>it was there the whole time

I‚Äôm the only one who likes this record
Be my FREEEND
sometimes when im sad i comeback to this video
Kid Cudi going grunge is like Michael Jordan playing baseball. You just don&#39;t fucking play baseball, Cudi!
Its also very obvious that he did not listen to the full album... ‚ÄúWhere they are on hallucinogens, where did that come from‚Äù umm sir there is literally a skit where he says ‚Äútake some of these mushrooms that cudi gave us‚Äù how are you gonna review somethin u havent fully listened to... ur cancelled
‚ÄúWorst ive had to review‚Äù gtfo no one made you review it or listen to it... also this album paved the way for a lot of music nowadays it gets wayyy too much hate... look at the tracks x made same style from a rapper who was championed (btw i love both artists and hated SB2H at first listen but its actually really fucking good)
Handle with care is my jam to this day
Ayo Whenever I‚Äôm in a shitty day I always come back to this review to lighten my mood specially towards the end üòÇüòÇüòÇ. For the record thou, I still fucks with kid cudi‚Äôs music to this day! Also WZRD and Indicud  where both good interesting albums ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Wait, wait. Cudi? Ive been pronouncing it coodi fuuuuucccckkkk
Atleast supermarket from logic wasn&#39;t thissss bad lmao
On this day, an album was put to rest and an angel got its wings.
I remember someone calling it Speedin&#39; Bullet to a Trash Can
0.94721/10
MY WIFEEEEE
I liked the original summary more: &quot;Kid Cudi&#39;s lost his mind.&quot;<br>I do respect the change
Pffft. This is in his Rock Review playlist. Unbelievable.
Cudi did better than Chance The Rapper by <br>.94721
I LOVE MY WIIIIFE
I actually fucking loved this album, lol.
4 years and I&#39;m still watching this, I love this video lmao
Tyler childers
This album actually fire man. He put it out when people had different expectations. ‚ÄúI want man on the moon‚Äù and I was one of those people. These passed 2 years been crazy and this album really been helping me. Crazy how music can grow through each experience.
why he whistling after saying ‚Äúworst‚Äù at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=125">2:05</a>
Every single one of those albums have great songs on them like I‚Äôm starting to think that me and fantano lived very different life‚Äôs cause relating to an album makes it 10 times better and every single album I love doesn‚Äôt even get anything above a 3 with this guy
Personally loved this album ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
He never gave it a Chance
Anthony Fantano has no taste nor visions at all
lets see if chance can get his own kanye and make his kids see ghosts
Not my precious cudiüò≠
Who else is here after OMG LOL Dolls Surprise Glamper Car House unboxing?
Who else here after the chance review
When Cudi gets a 0 without even saying shit about his wife
Satellite flight was actually good
I love this album!! 10/10
Back after the Chance review
Got damn, this score is lower than my will to live
Here after Chance the Rapper became the 2nd artist to get a 0 from Melon
I hate that people hated it so much cause i wanted to hear more but i don‚Äôt think cudi will continue it due to the criticism
Good review but why are you heiling here? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=118">1:58</a>
We all know you here after watchin that Chance review üòÇ
I didn‚Äôt think we‚Äôd had one of these any day...
Still better than &quot;The Big Day&quot;
Who&#39;s here after watching TBD review‚ò†
came back here after chance
Who‚Äôs here after that chance review
This is better than chances new album according to melon
Cudi isn‚Äôt alone anymore.
who&#39;s back here after chano got the fantan0?
Chances album score is disrespectful to SB2H
Who&#39;s here after the Chance the Rapper review?
Not a strong 0 therefore no where near as good as the Greatest Album of All time, I‚Äôm talking of course about Chance the Rapper‚Äôs debut album ‚ÄúThe Big Day‚Äù which has inspired me to quit my job at Burger King and go work at the unemployment line!
Coming back after chance gets a zero
Damn Chance and Kid Cudi holding the biggest L&#39;s if this decade
who back after the Chance review?
balls.
who‚Äôs here after that chance the rapper review
Kid cudi has a lot of good songs and a lot of bad songs
Hey... at least it wasn&#39;t a NOT GOOD
Going to the comment section on his Indicud review and going to the comment section on this review is like going to a completely different dimension, it‚Äôs surreal.
The only man to ever get a 0 and a 10
Pursuit of happiness is still bomb tho
When he talks about how deluded his fans are and then I look at this, and it has almost 3k dislikes, he definitely is a true man
I think I‚Äôm the only one here who actually enjoyed this album.
Last best album, after to pimp a butterfly
fuck you i love kid cudi
Every now and then, I come back to see your beavis and butthead impression
the album was for those who needed it
Blandthany blandtano
Been said many times but from a 0 to a 4 to a 10. Talk about a glow up
remember when the description simply read: ‚ÄúKid Cudi loses his mind.‚Äù
the album cover never fails to crack me up lol
I bought this album...<br><br>...because of the dope album cover
so how does 0 and NOT GOOD differ I mean which is worse
Admit you were wrong
This is my favorite kid cudi album though. It was more than music.....<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>It&#39;s more than music.
Damn the new calassic scored higher
Its strong 6 to me, pretty good but a little too long and sometimes a bit unprofessional.<br><br>Still really nice experiment with many amazing songs
welp I listened to the album a second time, now it&#39;s one of my favorites
Angrythony Mantano
I fucking loved this album holy shit I went on a journey
Here for my weekly watch
Most low scores he gives he gets a lot of hate for. MOST low scores.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=356">5:56</a>
I bet YouTube told him to change the caption, used to be ‚Äúkid cudi loses his mind‚Äù
I don&#39;t get how this dude went from putting out a 0/10 for you to a 10/10<br>Literally what
I really have to disagree with you on this one  Fantano.  I found most of this album really engaging.. sure the Beavis and Butthead thing stank, but man oh man, I don&#39;t agree with this 0. I loved it.
I liked this album
Everything Cudi has done is great
I honestly think some of WZRD wasn‚Äôt that bad the beats were pretty flowy and nice but overall wasn‚Äôt his best
I remember when the original synopsis was ‚ÄòKid Cudi loses his mind.‚Äô
Kid Cudi: The only person to get a 0 and a 10 from Anthony Fantano.
This untalented fuck really gave this album a 0üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ not his best work but I can‚Äôt even take your reviews seriously after this bullshit
nah you a clown for this one, this album slaps
yall sleep on this album SB2H is good as fuck
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=343">5:43</a> fucking solid beavis impression no lie
Are you crazy?!
He doesn‚Äôt do drugs he did it because he was depressed
This album was üî• change my mind. Fuchsia butterflies was the best song on this album. you can‚Äôt listen to this album, you have to feel this album.
Kid Cudi trying to pretend to be God Speed You...? because the title album reminds me a lot to the Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Atennas to Heaven&#39;s album (IDK?)
The internet&#39;s busiest music bird
Anthony looked excited about it in the thumbnail.
Since no one is saying it, imma be the first one to admit that this album, although flawed, was really ahead of its time, especially after listening to KSG. I&#39;ve actually never listened to this album until recently and I have to say it&#39;s not that bad. Please don&#39;t @ me
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=449">7:29</a> YOU CANNOT! YOU CAN&#39;T!
I love this album, it&#39;s grungy, it&#39;s emo as fuck and scrappy. It&#39;s a great impersonation of toxic emotions. It&#39;s a cool concept
Seems like we all bit the bullet
Wow melon. Didn‚Äôt have to call him the n-word.
HEYYYYY YOU CHANGED THE DESCRIPTION IT ORIGINALLY SAID KID CUDI LOSES HIS MIND
The video description for this used to be &quot;kid cudi loses his mind&quot;
The hair cake
Holy shit
I don&#39;t care what he says for you to like this album you got to have empathy and once you have it the album is the best thing in the world.
Omg shut ya mouth melon I love you and your pac man but Indicud is a great album and man on the moon 2 is not mediocre
indicud is not that bad
-sition
Who came back to this after the Logic: Not Good
Kid cuddly
My favorite Cudi album, next to PP&amp;DS. Both works of art.
Well... at least it&#39;s not not bad.
Speeding bullet to 10/10
He went from 0 to 10 real quick
I actually think this album is a complete work of genius.
Who else is here after the Logic: Supermarket review?
Wow Cudi went from a 0/10 to a 10/10
I could&#39;ve sworn the description said &quot;Kid Cudi loses his fucking mind&quot;
Cudi makes music for his fans not for the masses
The first review where there isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúforever‚Äù at the end
this album is good
Sorry I like a lot of<br>Things song(‚Äò;
I actually quite enjoyed this album. Very deep and raw like punk is supposed to be
I dunno about this project. I heard this album and I was so confused (no pun intended) I stopped at CONFUSED! because I just wasn‚Äôt looking for that when I was tryna listen to rap fusion. Did he even rap once in the project? That‚Äôs not the problem tho. The problem is that even though I relate to the project, the project‚Äôs production is probably some of the worst stuff I‚Äôve ever heard. Some Rap Songs was amazing and maybe I need to listen to this album in its entirety. But honestly idk
When I watch this review, I like to imagine he&#39;s talking about &#39;The Downward Spiral.&#39;
This album is ahead of its time and is amazing
You know what, revisiting this I think Anthony is kinda unfair to rate this less than a 1 while giving 3&#39;s and 4&#39;s to albums that are objectively more shit than this album. Even Anthony admits he likes a song or two off this album, while there have been albums he hasn&#39;t but he&#39;s still scored them higher. And especially now looking back I feel like Cudi needed to make something like this before he could make something like Kids See Ghosts
this is the album of castration
Kids see ghosts got a 10. Biggest comeback of 2018 belongs to kid Cudi
i always find myself going back to this, what a classic
Fantano was really pissed on this review
Didn&#39;t the description used to say ‚ÄúKid Cudi loses his mind‚Äù
Jesus I never realized how many people hate cudis music, I must be tripping cause I love it
Anthony changed the description from &quot;Kid Cudi loses his mind&quot; for some reason lol
Crazy how this is the album that got me into Cudi and is still one of my fav albums of all time üòÇüòÇ
Can u re review this album?
his music isnt as weak as your reviews. TOOL.
&quot;STAY TUNE STAYYYYYYY TUNE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot; &quot;FUCKING ON THE FIRST DATE!!, SUCKING ON THE FIRST DATE &quot;  This album Jam
Remember when the description just said Kid Cudi loses his mind lmao
For the longest time I thought this album was called Speeding Bullet to Hell
Melon actually changed the description from &quot;Kid Cudi loses his mind&quot; to &quot;Kid Cudi goes grunge and it doesn&#39;t go well&quot;
Yeah I  used to be a huge kid cudi fan.... and I stopped listening around the time you did. If you listen to his earlier work, he sings about suicide a lot as well. It&#39;s clear the dude has dealt with serious depression. But yeah he just stopped making good music. Even with Kids See Ghosts, you can tell Kanye did most of the work.
such a dumb review
HAHAHA
Fantano changed the description, it used to be:<br><br>&quot;Kid Cudi loses his mind.&quot;<br><br>Anthony thinks he&#39;s Slicktano
the description changed
nice Polaris vinyl
I think a lot of this album is listened to with the wrong mindset. Cudi did this whole album constantly on mushrooms, which makes a pretty weird but huge difference
I guess I am the only person who is in love with this album...
I‚Äôve just realized that I‚Äôve been mentally conflating Kid Cudi and Kid Rock for years
What is the difference betwin a 0 and a NOT GOOD, exactly ?
I stopped listening to him after satellite flight journey to mother moon, I was a legit fan up until that point.
You are a dumbass
Kid Cudi loses his mind
Fuck you
Who remembers when the description said Kid Cudi loses his mind
oh shit he actually did change the description.
man put a decimal as a rating.
lol you know it&#39;s bad when he didnt even say &quot;kid cuddly....speedin&#39; bullet to heaven....forever&quot;
HEY SALLY STRANGE<br>YA LOOKIN HAPPILY DERANGED
Anyone notice that he changed the description
Bro...I just think you can‚Äôt relate. Have you taken a fuck load of psychedelics and had a mental break down and bring yourself back up ever in your life? Your judging out of a perspective that has expectation
speedin bullet t0 heaven
I love this album i give it a TEN
Melting is such a great song
i keep feeling physically attacked when he says No no NO <b>NO</b>
who knew what would come in 2018
Wow, he changed the description. Guess he didn&#39;t want to jokingly say Cudi lost his mind after tackling that kind of thing on Kids See Ghosts. Good change!
that portishead record in the background is the best thing in this video
Uhhhh, go look at the description. Did melon change his mind? It used to say 0/10, now it says 0.94721/10.
So I guess you could say it was pretty good, huh?
Indicud was great üò≠
A melon spirals into insanity for 10 minutes
Kid Cudi is so reborn now
You could say he went on a‚Ä¶ <b>downward spiral</b>
I feel like Cudi watched this and realized he needed to do better then kids see ghosts dropped, thank u melon for the masterpiece
LITERALLY FUCK YOU FOR THIS REVIEW
reminder that this isn‚Äôt even a red flannel.
Put a middle finger next to the 0, and it‚Äôs a 10.
Noisethany noisetano
Kid cudli is the best
Based on the first 2 songs, I think there&#39;s enough good in this album to get at least a 1
I friggin love this album. It‚Äôs the only rock album I listen to
This album is great. It shows a mans fall into insanity. Very raw. The emotion is very obvious and not in a bad way also.
You can&#39;t give his album indicud shit. It was great especially &quot;Just what I am&quot;. üíØ
I listened to this album last night. Gave it a 28/100 based on the songs themselves. Probably a 1/10 based on how many songs I liked.
I like this album a lot
&quot;Sometimes we must fall into darkness to discover the light.&quot; <br><br><b>Makes hell as an album before visiting Heaven with Kanye</b>
ive been saying this album is good
Why is Dummy in the background?
3 years ago, kid cudi got a 0 <br><br><br><br><br><br>Just a coincidence I watched this video on Dec 5th
3 YEARS OF SBTH.. A CLASSIC
I found the beavis and butthead skits hilarious and enjoyable how they incorporated it into his music
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=117">1:57</a>
Bit harsh to give an album 0/10 if you admit to liking at least one of the songs on it. That&#39;s surely enough to merit a 1.
(1)0
How is this not a &#39;NOT GOOD&#39;
Didn‚Äôt like it at first, but it grew on me after Kids See Ghosts.
THIS ALBUM WAS BETTER THAN MOTM2 FUCK Y‚ÄôALL FANTANO DICKRIDERS
I love this album
it‚Äôs a 1/10 bc i like CONFUSED!
This is my Fav Album... That&#39;s why it was in my suggestions ....You have to have to be delusional ,depressed, and angry just to get it.
Maybe I have a bias here being a huge Cudi fan but I think personally that this was just Cudi being a fan of early 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s  rock/metal conveying the rage and sad emotion that usually winds up on a rap/r&amp;b album into a rock album. This album certainly has a lot of flaws and I agree that the songs are stretched out and dragged out ideas but that doesn&#39;t change the fact that the ideas are good at least to me. For instance...fuchsia butterfly.. it has such a wild agression with this idea that Cudi is this drug addicted maniac who will mask his emotions and tell himself that he&#39;s happy while consuming these drugs and I just love the raw emotion. Sometimes personally I don&#39;t need flawless performances to be blown away by the emotion brought out on a track. It&#39;s definitely subjective whether these tracks sound good to someone but I do think that this album has SOME good tracks. Songs can  make more sense to people when you as the listener put together the reasoning behind each track. I think Speedin&#39; bullet to Heaven(the track) has this crazy snappy beat to it while all these winding reversed guitars floating around Cudi as he sings with this soft and  drowsy vocals that sound like someone convincing themself that theyre going to be okay. Call me crazy and tell me this album is trash but I can&#39;t tell my ears not to love the emotion on this album flaws and all. I think the cracks and setbacks in Cudi&#39;s career don&#39;t change the fact that he always has some great ideas and people can say he &quot;fell off&quot; but maybe he doesn&#39;t give a fuck about the spotlight? I mean yes he could have milked the man on the moon series and got a bunch of features and made millions but he decided to push creativity which sacrificed his popularity and Ill forever love him for that. This is how the most respected artists roll like Frank and Andre etc.
I probably watch this twice a week
I don&#39;t really care I like this shit
Funniest review from melon lmao
Missing out! Listen deep into satellite flight
I agree this is a horrible album, but I honestly can‚Äôt stop listening to it
So wait...is a 0 worse than a NOT GOOD?
Yall mfs aint got nooooooo taste. Albums fire. You don‚Äôt know shit lmao
The rating Kids See Ghosts should‚Äôve got but never did.
so uhhhh, you liked the album?
The fact that this dude helped form Kids See Ghosts blows my mind
I loooooved this album

This album was bad but I only liked the song &quot;confused &quot; But I disagree with Inidcud satellite flight.
Did you listen to the album though
There&#39;s no Cal Chuchesta thing there&#39;s no more jokes there&#39;s no <br><br>BLEHSNAKUWNSHSYWBSBXKXIJSBS
This album is the dopest dope you&#39;ll ever smoke when you&#39;re high, but absolute trash when you&#39;re sober, Cudi actually did his job consider he was literally fucking around basically. At least it&#39;s not Rebirth, because that was commercially produced rap rock garbage...with two good songs...ish.
If you like 2 songs why is this a zero?
Why is this not a red flannel?
I like confused
Going 0 to 10 real quick
From a 0 to a 10 with Kanye<br>I guess life is just a coin toss
Melon do you realise it wasn&#39;t Kurt Cobain&#39;s decision to release the montage of heck tapes on an album?
this is not a good review, you laugh at a man who struggled with drug use and mental illness. AND THE ALBUM WASNT EVEN BAD!
my favourite album of all time
please stop yelling at me anthony I didn&#39;t make this album ok
This album wasn&#39;t bad there&#39;s one song that scared the hell out of me which was &quot;the nothing&quot; it was scary but fuck it was nice and had a vibe to get high too and cry too
You gave this a 10 but ksg a 0?
Kid cuddly üòÇüòÇüòÇ
This album is a 10. Lyrics don&#39;t matter for making good music. Singing doesn&#39;t need to be on pitch it just needs to convey emotion. Every fucking song on this album   is coming from a man who is 100% bleeding his feelings out. Each song is packed with pain. Speeding Bullet 2 Heaven is an insane thing to combine with depression. The rawness is ugly from misery and beautifully human
Wow the amount of ignorant comments, complete close mindedness to what this album truly brings to the table. Everyone is focusing on him rapping when this has nothing to do with his rap flow, although he brought something completely otherworldly into his own style of rock just like how he did with rap, yet no one can appreciate this side? This reviewer doesn&#39;t like Kid Cudi to begin with and talking shit brings views so this isn&#39;t a valid music critic.
The black flannel
Them hating fucks sidelining and question what you do...<br><br>Critics are the people no one will ever remember ^_^ .
this guy is stupid.....speedin bullet to heaven GOES HARD
And now Kid Cudi has a 10
Hmm. I always thought it was pronounced Kid Cutie...
This guy saw the 0 and got depressed thnx melon
this album got me through some tough times. 9.9/10 from me.
Do psychedelics then listen to it
What‚Äôs funny he made so many references to old projects
if a album is completely silent and is only 1 second long, there is nothing to criticize and therefor be a ten, or would it be a 0 because there&#39;s nothing good to say about it?
Rehab does wonders
This record is for depressed people I liked it when it came out because that&#39;s how I felt &quot;cover your wounds don&#39;t show your scars smile for friends and carry on&quot; unless you&#39;ve been through that shit you&#39;re not going to understand it
Anyone else like Fuchsia Butterflies?
This review didn‚Äôt age well
This my favorite album fym
‚ÄúBuy this album if you dare‚Äù
Its really not that bad fantano trippin
CONDUSED! is good don&#39;t @ me
The only thing that gives me a migraine, Anthony Fantano, is hearing your opinion on anything.
speedin bullet to speedin bullet to heaven
u gotta be in a certain depression state to truly understand this record facts
Screwed. . .  my favorite song
Now I see why this album got a 0 he didn&#39;t really like his music to begin with
<b>This album was fucking great in my opinion sue me</b>
I actually like the album...fuck me
No least favorite tracks listed in description... It&#39;s a perfect 10!
This album broke bigquint as well üíÄ
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=558">9:18</a>
Youre garbadge .
Surprise you just didn&#39;t give him a not good review
BIG. FAT. GOOSE EGG.
Your best review ever
The likes are by people who like the review.<br><br>The dislikes are by people who want to eat the melon alive
I do really like that album art though
Anthony: drugs can‚Äôt make u do good music <br>Kid cudi gets a 0 when was doing drugs and now he gets a 10 when he is sober<br>Anthony is a man of his word
Album art is hilarious tho
It&#39;s not that bad
It‚Äôs a YouTube classic
speedin bullet to mah brain
I watch this once a month
Kid Cudi, the only man to get both a 10 and a 0.
I‚Äôd just like to say, fuck you
This album booty
My friend: Is SAO a good anime<br>Me: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=119">1:59</a>
This album is amazing
A proto not good video
Zero to hero
Eh, I like it.
I feel like I have to listen to this album now just to see it because its so bad, its like an ISIS beheading video
Damn
Bro i know this video is old but, i had this ex who loved cudi right? And she fell in love with this album! I mean I‚Äôm not one to judge but it wasn‚Äôt my cup of tea. So with that being said, tell me why when we got down and heavy she had this blasting üò≠ bruh try giving head to ‚Äúconfused!‚Äù. I will never forgot that day man smh. What‚Äôs fucked is you Know i still went at it even tho i was praying that it would end, smh i was way thirsty.
Ah yes, times before the corey feldman review
Ngl i like this album.
Is this album the only one that gets  a 0
Honestly find this album really good.
So wait.  You&#39;ve literally stated you&#39;ve reviewed worse albums an have heard worse albums(corey feldman anyone?) An they still managed to get above a 1...<br><br>An this was at least a light 4...<br><br>This might aswell have been a stink piece lol. ESPECIALLY since you give kids see ghosts a 10. A mdtf try hard(which you gave a 6)...with tge same bad crooning singing this has lol.<br><br>I don&#39;t understand your scoring at all. Like i feel like you just wanted to do a first of giving a 0 to someone.<br><br>You gave waaaay too many good points and you had favorite tracks...that isn&#39;t what a 0 album sounds like lol.
&quot;It&#39;s sadistic to his listeners;&quot; exactly. Man it kills me how horrible Cudi is now, considering how great Man on the Moon 1 &amp; 2 were.
I do like Confused. The melody of his singing is catchy, and closer to the way he used to sing. If the whole album had been more similar to this song, and hired an actual band to play these instrumental parts and just focused on singing, it could have been interesting. At least average, not horrible.
I watch this when i need a good laugh
this is my favorite review of all time
comeback king.
Most deserving high rating in the album reviews ever, you should&#39;ve made your entire loved list in 2015 this, such a legendary piece of work!
its crazy how so many people dont understand, just like wat beavis said to butthead. &quot;You just dont get it&quot;. if ya know ya know üòâ
Fuck being on that chill shit, we go 0-10 with ye real quick.- Kid West
You lost all credibility in my book when you rated the same guy a 0 and a 10 within a span of three short years. Check yourself, Antoine, before you rekThony yourself.
I came for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=400">6:40</a>.
a zero. i laughed!
Iconic
the album can be used as torture in guantanamo
Look how far he‚Äôs come now
I think it‚Äôs pretty ok, not the best one but listenable(indicudi is pretty good too) but hey this is coming from a depressed bag of shit
I kinda liked confused...
im from future: redux 10/10
Keep moving forward....
fuck u this album is dope lol
You should wear funeral attire for any video in which you give an album a 0
I never watched this video until today because I just didn‚Äôt want to ever listen to the album after listening to a couple of tracks when it first came out and the thought of even watching a review about it made me cringe. This is fucking hilarious.
nearly two years later and I must say that Speedin‚Äô Bullet 2 Heaven is a breath of fresh air!!<br><br>from the gnarly riffs to the vocal slurs, Cudi really gave us something amazing!!<br><br>I‚Äôve been jamming out to System Of A Down, Metallica and Lamb Of God a lot lately, and SB2H just meshes in so well with everything.<br><br>from his cadence and vibrato to the subject matter and execution are all so divine. this is an album of release, not critique.
From 0 to 10, wow
This album aged well.
damn he upped the score to a .94
TRASH review go take your goofy ass elsewhere or GET WITH IT
I put my hand on a stove
Judi got a 0 and a 10<br><br>Get you a man that can do both
.I&#39;m gonna make an album, it&#39;s gonna be a rock ALBUMMM
End of 2015: Cudi gets a 0.<br>Two and a half year later: Cudi (with Kanye) gets a 10.<br><br>IT CAN BE DONE.
You just don&#39;t get it.
Dreams do come true
I bet you listen to this now and love it.
0-10 dreams do come true.

So you never liked Cudi?  Why
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=119">1:59</a>
Lmao at the ending, classic review
I am a big kid cudi fan but this album I couldn&#39;t vibe to except two or three songs.
This album is a masterpiece @ me
I loved this album. The problem is that your looking at it like a rock album. Don‚Äôt get me wrong it‚Äôs not a quality album if you look at it like that, but it‚Äôs more then that. It was meant to understand him more as an artist and as a person (to leave it all on the table). It was also meant to give comfort to people that are going through the same things as him.

This is relevant again!
I like it
If it takes the hair cake you know it&#39;s bad
I actually loved the album
Can&#39;t get into this hipster music
Indicud is good
fuck you your reviews suck always
I kinda wanna see someone critique your reviews.
I get u think u something about music but kid Cudi is one of the Greatest artist of our time
Who would&#39;ve thought that the best album he&#39;s reviewed that year would also hold the worst album he&#39;s reviewed
Nigga was so close to sin90 üòî
a big fat goose egg
So is this worse then not good?
This dude wasn&#39;t even listening to the album clearly. The Beavis and butthead skits were funny and they were going on the journey with cudi and they talked about when they took shrooms and then the skit he&#39;s trying to talk about when butthead said &quot;idk about this&quot; he also said I started to feel funny. And then the professor explains that Cudis music and the shrooms are making then emotional. Music is subjective and don&#39;t let this guy deter you from a great album.
Cal Said &quot;You&#39;re Always Hating On The Kid Cuddly&quot; LMAFO
Just another unoriginal person who thinks they understand art is what this review comes down to.  <br>Because you can&#39;t argue this, I was not at all a rap fan before this album!  Love grunge rock and loved this album. Had my mind blown so hard when I discovered it was a kid cudi album that I tried other cudi.  By this point I probably listen to more rap than rock cause this ARTIST blew my mind wide open with a speedin bullet from heaven.  You just don&#39;t get it though!  What it comes down to is...YOU ARE A LAME.  Idc at all or have any investment if you like or respect this album or the genius that is Cudi either, keep on being a square that reports what others do for all I care.  My point is you are straight up wrong on this review.  If never had anyone bend my mind with such beauty in music before this album and now I hear and care to give effort to understand rap!  Thank God for that because I just didn&#39;t understand before and I was missing out on tons of great stuff.
SBTH WAS TRASH, THE OTHER ALBUM ‚ÄúSURFIN‚Äù ON IT WAS TRASH, EVERYTHING ELSE WAS DOPE.
Y‚Äôknow what. I think he likes it.
This new, Kid Cudi album....<br><br> <b>ITS NOT GOOD</b><br>   üí•üí•üí•üí•
I‚Äôm feeling a strong 6 to a light 7 on this album.
I watch this once a week
Its crazy because I love this album, in fact its what really put me on to Cudi
Here for my monthly watch of this video
your wrong
Who is this a not good review??
I don&#39;t think this was an album for the fans or musical genius&#39; I really think this album was a manifestation of a manic episode and the different stages of his depression/life. Really the only way I think you can listen to it is if you&#39;re having a manic episode yourself.
if alex depressedly or teen suicide put this out people would be like THIS IS SO GOOD
I liked the album. Just because he‚Äôs creative and changing his genre he‚Äôs getting shit.
This is so wierd. I completely disagree. Kid cudi music and vocals was amazing.
This album saved my life
This album is Weird Al spoofing himself
speeding bullet to the dick
&quot;the room&quot; of albums
Can we just take a minute to admire how corny the album art is?
Tried to listen to this album today at work... Agree with him 100%... This joint is hard as hell to listen to. From the start. Finally we FULLY agree on an album lol
I‚Äôve been pronouncing it coody this whole time
I&#39;m triggered
Angry-thony <br>Rant-tano
THE FACT THAT HE DIDNT LIKE CONFUSED MADE ME CHANGE THE VIDEO
i liked the album, most of the songs were at least decent, The Return of Chip Douglass was the only song that i hated, but that&#39;s just my opinion
Isn‚Äôt a zero a ‚ÄúNOT GOOD‚Äù?
This album is great if you can find the beauty in it. If not oh well. Its subjective
This album gives some deep feelings which is why most people don‚Äôt like this because they don‚Äôt pick up on those feels or like them.
nah bruh and you should wear a hat
This is what comes up when you search TheNeedleDrop Loses his Mind
It wasn&#39;t that bad,TOO me AnyWa√ø
You don‚Äôt gotta like the album but respect it for what it is. He poured out his demons and shared it with his friends. He makes music for those ones who get it.
You just don&#39;t get it. You&#39;re not on the frequency maan
I&#39;m gonna be in the minority saying that I liked this album....  Oh well I got my Kid Cudi rock album could give a fuck about anyone else
Andre 3000 thought this shit was amazing üôÑ
He judges music from an analytical, critical, logical mind. If he judged this album from more of a soul and artistic level he&#39;d understand that we really understand that, he doesnt understand.
THE ADVENTURES OF PETE AND PETE
Good point, drugs can make good artist&#39;s music better, but often doesn&#39;t make bad artists better at music. Crazy, this reminds me I found Fantano through his Beefheart Review. One of the better channels I have subscribed to in a long time.
i like the rock and roll vibe. long live rock
I always come back here for a good laugh aint gonna lie...
Drink everytime Cudi says he wants to kill himself in CONFUSED!
Why didn‚Äôt he give it a <b>NOT GOOD</b> review?
Just to make it clear kid cudi&#39;s music is to help people feel less alone and not commit suicide
I came here straight from Wikipedia.
This album was a total psychedelic album , just like in the 70s when lsd erupted and we had a lot of psycadelic rock music to listen too whilst tripping . This is album is one of those. Cudi went to rehab not long after his psychosis , unless you ; yourself have gone down that rabbit hole . it‚Äôs obvious you would not understand . You can bash artists but at the end art is art . Are all of your videos negative , I viewed two but I‚Äôm not sure lol , maybe that‚Äôs how you reel in your views. Music is great regardless it just depends on the vibes , it‚Äôs obviously music you wouldn‚Äôt play in a car lol.
Tbh it‚Äôs not that bad I like the album but everybody‚Äôs different
Every year or so I go back to this video and decide not to kill myself again
Man .. y&#39;all have no taste , that was the greatest album he created
But lil pump got a 7 righhtttt
Whenever I struggle at college, so basically when I&#39;m not sleeping, I listen to this interview to inspire me to not fall off and get my work done. <br>- Thanks Anthony!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=405">6:45</a> Anthony, don&#39;t think you can just slide past that horendous tye dye sweatshit you got on
you are just not in the same frequency...think inwards
steveantonhy -Ontano
I really don&#39;t get the hate... I think this album is minimalistic and emotional. its bad when your judge it with the idea that kid cud is just a rapper. Its a different genre and experimental. I think the album sounds like what depression feels like... if you just want to be entertained then its awful for that reason :D . but otherwise its more like  abstract art I think. <br>still love your channel. keep it up
Cudi doesn‚Äôt give a fuck what you say<br>Cudi‚Äôs all smiles
I like confused melting adventures <br><br>I think you just milking for views
Didn&#39;t know a 0/10 was possible
wzrd and satellite flight are great albums , this has to be one of my favorite albums from him its a different vibe . youre a clown dude
I actually really like the album
i like it.
I actually liked some stuff on indicud, red eye, beez, unfuckwittable, etc
Hey! Your hair line is speedin 2 heaven !
mellon daddy got triggrd
Bro this album was one of his best work to me, this was a dope album to me it was a personal album, I loved every....almost every song on this album
this was one of his best albums.
i watch this every few months bc its like getting a warm hug
Indicud was poes nice
I have not liked Kid Cudi much at all, but I actually enjoyed this album. Guess I‚Äôm the only one...
You trippin or smoking crack. This album is dope.
you&#39;re a fuckin idiot
review soap
Where is the red flannel
I see you Arcturus!
shoutout to Dummy in the background &lt;3
<b>BREATHES</b>
this album is so bad the writing for the name of the album at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=16">0:16</a> is literally scribbles
What about fuchsia butterflies? Thats the only song ive heard off the album before and its pretty trippy. I actually really enjoyed that song.
<b>SPEEDTHONY BULLETANO HERE</b>
2018 i&#39;m still watching this üòÇ
Is this better than 17 by XXXTentacion though?
but you gave indicud a 2? okay.
This album is fire
god, you really are the internets busiest music nerd...every artist I type into YouTube, you have a review of them... lol
Why is this album so hated?? Like I get if you don&#39;t like punk but how can you judge someone&#39;s inner pain and soul? Let the dude express himself however he wants
I didn&#39;t think it was THAT terrible.
I actually liked this album is was nice, could‚Äôve been better thou
Kid kudi is always been trash. <br>&quot;Day and night the lonely loner seems to free his mind tonight&quot;. Wow lyrical af. Lmao
Even the tracks you listed as favourites were awful
Why be review albums if you are the most Close minded person in the world
Fuck this dude indicud was a good album
Kid cudi‚Äôs speeding bullet to heaven backwards makes it a 10/0 which means it‚Äôs the best album ever recorded
I loved this album
a big fat goose egg
I on the other hand, loved this album
‚ÄúMAN YOU ALWAYS HATED ON THE KID CUDLY YOUD THINK YOU GOTTA BLABLABLA‚Äù üòÇ dead
Favorite kid cudi album of all time
The Beavis impression tho
Fantano stole your review and made it into a 40 second video
polaris on vinyl oh fuk
Still better than the new Eminem
idk boring and annoying is like my favorite genre of music
Album cover looks very inviting though.
Who is here from the one with no words
Is a 0 the lowest Fantano has ever gone?
you forgot to make this 11/10
Saw this then the silent version. Silent version was gold and makes so much sense
Jeez, Anthony, I know the album&#39;s bad but did you need to say that Kid should be &quot;hung from a tree like a Christmas ornament&quot;?
idk, I feel like this album is a little bit &#39;over-hated&#39;
Speedin‚Äô Bullet to Melon
Jaden smith&#39;s &quot;Syre&quot; vs this vs lil peep&#39;s &quot;come over when you&#39;re sober&quot; vs xxxtentacles &quot;17&quot;<br><b>I&#39;m waiting for a response Melon</b>
It&#39;s like an &quot;outsider&quot; album, basically, which is why I happen to find it oddly appealing. It&#39;s so weirdly undone and archaic, yet very blunt that I can&#39;t help but embrace its eccentric, poorly emulated pseudo-grunge sound. It&#39;s like an alien made it, and that makes it likable.
His first album is one of the most consistent and best albums of this century.
Did we stop doing Not Good reviews??
Anthony Fantano sent me here
<b>That&#39;s a Skrik not a Skrrt!</b>
I can never watch this the same way after watching this but without any words
You CANNNAAAAT! You CAN&#39;T!!!
No more damages, I&#39;ll pay for the chicken sandwiches
I thought it was a 10-point scale, now you might as well start handning out elevens. Thanks for nothing man.
Imagine if in some music discussion, somebody says that this is his favorite album
Melon really cant stand this album... Me neither.
Anybody here after the new fantano video?
Why does the album cover look like a Tumblr meme?
album was horrible but had at least 10 good songs
kid cudi is essentially just living the life dewey cox in walk hard lol
IMO THIS WAS HIS BEST ALBUM. ANDRE 3000 THOUGHT SO TOO. YOU GYPSIES HAVE A POOR TASTE IN MUSIC. THIS ALBUM IS DELIRIUM AND SELF PITYING DRUNKEN SORROW PUT INTO A KURT COBAIN STYLE ROCK. IT WAS INCREDIBLE MORE THAN IT WAS CRUD.
day n night is like one of my fav songs ever
2015 was not a great year for music.
I liked indicud
They should do this with one of the Albums Anthony likes to see how he reacts differently.
WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
What is the difference between a not good and a 0?
I really liked indicud...
I&#39;m not even caring about the Kid Cudi music......just mesmerized by that Polaris vinyl
He had some good tracks on here
before ‚ÄúNot Good‚Äù Anthony used to just shit on artists by giving them zero‚Äôsü§£ü§£
Wtf did I just listened to!?!
Yea I just found out about this album and I was wondering why the hell I hadnt known about it but now I know
10 seconds into the album i had to close it down it just hurted my ears
Im watching this review while taking a shit and its really runny
I don&#39;t mind if other people don&#39;t like the same music as me however indicud will forever be legendary status to me.
Anthony is pissed on this review
I watch this video every morning to give me strength throughout the day
I thought there was like 1 or 2 good songs on it
I honestly love it...
Though I respect Anthony&#39;s opinion, I found his harsh judgment of this album odd. It&#39;s nothing revolutionary, but I found it to be an interesting, idiosyncratic listen with quite a bit of character, even if the songs aren&#39;t fantastically written.
If Cudi offs himself, wouldn&#39;t that technically make Fantano a serial killer? He has already claimed 2 victims,  Lil Peep and Chester.
Here for my daily viewing
Speedin‚Äô Bullet To The Head
This is a great album lmao
I just noticed he has A Polaris Album in the back you know the band that plays the theme song to Pete and Pete I can&#39;t believe I never seen that.
the cover of the album is cudi after seeing this review
cudi&#39;s best album and imo a future classic example of outsiders music. i just think it needs some time. not calling you dumb for not liking it as much as you did. i just really found it relatable and good when i first heard it because of what i was going through. something about the minamilsm and loneliness of the album really draws me in when i&#39;m in a certain mood. it&#39;s honestly the album that made me drop my retarded fear that i was dumb for liking music considered bad by the masses and to just be myself and enjoy whatever, because i remember listening to this thing and having the worst case of that and my friends and everyone around me told me to &quot;enjoy what i like.&quot; sorry for the long comment i&#39;m just really passionate about my weird relationship with this album
i understand its just your opinion, anthony, but did you have to give this album a 9/10? seems a bit too low
Favorite review
I can&#39;t stop watching it, it is just too funny.
this upsets me because I actually liked it ):
so did fantano like it? oh wait who cares
sssoo am i the only one that likes this album¬ø??
I liked indicud but that‚Äôs literally it
big fat MELOn/10
Who said this album is meant to fill up your joy of favorable music, there‚Äôs a direct  reason to the sad and yet very violent need of validation of his past albums, their dark it‚Äôs fine they‚Äôre not meant be teddy pendergrass, believe me they‚Äôre comforting to those in relation to the message the records convey... I‚Äôm not a kid cudi troll, we love good music we all crave it, but is their honest expressions and substance to it does the music question your humanity ??? I was once depressed and kid cudi come through, so his been depressed who does he talk to ??   Jimi Hendrix ?  He‚Äôs gone , Kanye ? Their probably on same boat, he‚Äôs all evolving madly.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=342">5:42</a>
why did you betray me
i actually love this album
Cudi music ahead of its time
There are seriously people here arguing this album is just misunderstood?üòÇüòÇ
This is arguably the worst album of all time.
The fact that you even went off and said indicud was horrible hurts me deeply
Dude, can&#39;t believe you feel this way
This is my second favorite cudi album you have to listen to a album more then 1 time to apperciate the music very poor review sidenote if your not into dark emo music its not for you bro
you were wrong
This album is amazing. I honestly hate the fact people don&#39;t like this album at all. You people do not understand what he was going through if you were to be going through the same thing you would love this album as do I.
I actually hate Cudi&#39;s old work, but I like this album a lot.
i liked it.
This. Is. A. Good. Album.
This album is the perfect example of how just because you legitimately had some heavy personal issues doesn&#39;t automatically mean you can make a great album. Not every person with drug problems, anxiety, and clinical depression can be the next Kurt Cobain.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=119">1:59</a> my favorite part
I never listened to this album but now I will....I just did and I found out I could turn into a üóë
Pie/10
I wanna cry I loved cudi :(
Speedin Bullet to Chicken Sandwiches
Anthony Fantano is a Track #10
Maybe it&#39;s because I don&#39;t listen to hip hop and I don&#39;t know anything Kid Cudi did before, but I went to listen to this album expecting it to be laughably bad and I&#39;m into it.  Some cool minimalist riffs on some wacky cheap-sounding guitar and some interesting arrangements and drums and vocals.  Idk, seems sweet to me.  Could do without the Beavis and Butthead but still.
So if its not commercial its not good??? LMAO fuck outta here your wack AF. Who tf are you to say &quot;the worst music of the decade&quot;.... Say you dont like it but most of the Cudi fam vibes with these &quot;wack tracks&quot; to a deep level, i am for sure am one of them. I aint gonna let no dorky ass bitch tell me what music is good or not.... People fuck with what they like stop telling people what music is good or not. give your opinion on the song dont tell me IT IS BAd, because i vibe the fuck out with this shit even years later.
Hahahaha hold on
Am I the only person who kinda likes Indicud
He didnt even round that score smh
The description is fucking gold
still better than jeffery
its so crazy cuz i fucking loved that album.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=400">6:40</a> Kid Cudi couldn&#39;t have written that shit
Does nobody care about how Kid Cudi feels? Oh wait I forgot most of y&#39;all are trolls...
Every time a rapper tries to rock, they fall flat on their face. RATM are the exception, people. Not the rule. If you&#39;re a good rapper, rap. If you&#39;re good at rock, rock. Don&#39;t do things if you don&#39;t have the chops to back it up.<br><br>Edit: Just went and gave it a good try. Sounds exactly like a rapper trying to imitate rock music. The instrumentals are clearly written by hip hop producers. They&#39;re all rhythmic, repetitive hooks. They don&#39;t sound grungy at all, they sound like an attempt to make hip hop beats with guitars.
Thank you. I have to add this with Lou Reed&#39;s LULU, Meghan Trainor&#39;s Thank Me, David Bowie&#39;s Blackstar, and John Lennon&#39;s Unfinished Music Part 1 &amp;2. Who knows? Maybe this will be one of the best albums of all-time when he is dead.
I fucking love this needledrop yussss
The only enjoyable thing about this album is the title.
this isn&#39;t a very good album. But I really love a few songs on it. im depressed and I can understand and feel where he&#39;s coming from. And that to me is just super very fucking comforting. As far as emotion goes it feels good to me. I know emotion can&#39;t just make a good album because music is obviously about music. I don&#39;t like the majority of the songs on the album but there are some I really love, edge of the earth/ post mortem boredom, confused, man in the night, Handle with care, fairy tale remains, fuchsia butterflys and then my favorites, melting and embers. This album isn&#39;t for everybody obviously but there are some really great songs from it that I really love and I think some of your comments are funny lol but you should just try to understand maybe although it&#39;s hard
I don&#39;t think Judgmental C*nt is a good song, but it&#39;s at least entertaining. I was cracking up the whole time I was listening to it, and it at least had some personality, unlike the entire rest of the album.
Sattelite Flight was actually good maynnn, you shouldve checked it out. Is a lot like the first two albums
how was MOTM2 mediocre? That album literally saved me
This is honestly my favorite review, I watch it everyday.
The album&#39;s nice
I actually love the album, much like all of Cudi&#39;s music.
I love some songs on speedin bullet 2 heaven because I been depressed and it helps me with my depression but yea some song are terrible but the good songs I like I love them
Why do I like this album so much? It seems like everybody else hates it.
FUCK you, I am UNSUBSCRIBONG!11!!!!
I‚Äôve honestly enjoyed every Cudi project in different ways.
Speeding bullet to heaven is the best album from kid cudi , y‚Äôall just not on that level . You gotta understand kid cudi‚Äôs feelings and vibes it‚Äôs the best album
&quot;the hair cake&quot;
melonlossesmindovercudilossinghisabilitytoproducegoodmusic
Is this anyone else&#39;s favorite Fantano review? I just like watching him suffer
I can&#39;t remember if I left the comment ranting about how I don&#39;t understand how people hats this album in this comment section but here&#39;s formally stating that this indeed is a bad album lmao
happy milli
ANOTHER REVIEW GONE PLATINUM!
I actually like the album ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=461">7:41</a> BES SONG EVER
Waaaaattt, I can&#39;t believe you think indicud!
Album saved my life.
No more chicken sandwiches<br><br>Or crime allowances
I only know about Cudi from his stint on Comedy Bang Bang after Reggie Watts left. Now I know why he was replaced pretty much immediately by Weird Al.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=337">5:37</a> Pretty solid Beavis impression.
I honestly can&#39;t tell you why I still come back to this album, I know it is extremely unpopular and ridiculous to enjoy this album but I do. It&#39;s somber, it&#39;s dark, it&#39;s depressing, it&#39;s weird as fuck, but I like it. I obviously have some Cudi bias from being a fan from so long but to be honest I even prefer this album over PPDS (newest album). It just has this surreal and creepy vibe to it. To add to my contrasting opinion I actually PREFER the slower song than to the loud and fast ones. I think Cudi&#39;s voice does a lot better in mellow tracks than fast paced ones. Please don&#39;t crucify me for this, but is there anyone else who likes this thing.
2,000 likes and I&#39;ll buy the vinyl version of this album and listen to it all the way through full blast
Faster than the speed of love face ass lol Cudi I&#39;m disappointed in you
Where&#39;s your yella flannel Cuckthony Boitano
He doesn&#39;t know Kid Cudi story
Dude this album was good, but i understand why people couldnt like it.
You gave damn a 7 but this a 10
you seem to forget a kid named kudi, that mixtape was awesome. that, at least in my opinion was his debut just because of how solid it was. He kept that solid run going with Man on the moon 1 and 2, and indicud wasnt anything great but it had a few really good tracks. SBTH was awful, ear bleedingly bad, so hard to get through, but I&#39;m still jamming to Passion pain n demon slayin all the time.
Your finest review
Nah bro you just don&#39;t like Cudi. I&#39;ve seen you bash him on several occasions. Just don&#39;t review him if you don&#39;t understand it.
kid cuddly lol
I like Handle with Care. That is all. Thank you for your time.
Alright I&#39;m just gonna say it-This is a great album
Your review is halfway decent you 4eyed fuck
This album is my life on repeat
KId Cudi should collab with Brad Sucks imo<br>He could be the tuning fork to Cudi&#39;s madness
This album is just a result of Cudi doing too much LSD I mean just look at the cover
this album isnt that bad its just a underwritten and overlong grunge record, not very good but shit everyone is acting like its the worst album ever like goddamn
ASS
Trying to figure out how to give this a few million thumbs down, y&#39;all liked Cudi, don&#39;t know Scott.
isnt just me or does he look like a melon
Is that Polaris in the background?
I don&#39;t like death grips
Anthony&#39;s first zero lol
Here for my daily watch.
fuck you jelly melly, kid cubi is the ROCKIST!
dayn noit
Am I the only one that likes this project? Lol
I&#39;ve finally listened to the album. Now I understand why he&#39;s depressed and hates himself
i like this album
Most of you were and/or are too sane to listen to this album.
mmmmmmhhhmm merrm meeh/10
These are his best reviews. This was entertaining af. Cud needs to keep dropping albums.
Indicud is actually a pretty good album. Not his best nor worst but there are some great tracks to take away from it.
People calling his opinion trash are ignoring just how much music this guy listens to. <br><br>I haven&#39;t liked a Kid Cudi song since Day N&#39; Nite.
Dat portishead vinyl tho‚Ä¶
Anthony Fantano here the internet&#39;s busiest music.
I spy with my little eye...<br><br>...Dummy in the background.
classic/10
the point is that he was depressed and basically a mess and thats the theme of this album but no one gets it ig
kid Cudi is a great
you&#39;re opinion is garbage. this is one of the greatest albums ever. you just need to be on the same frequency as it
Splitting Migraine to Hell
This is kid cudis yeezus album and to be honest I like this album its not that bad if it&#39;s in the background
The Trout Mask Replica of our time
edge of the earth/postmortem boredom<br>confused<br>adventures<br>handle with care<br>angered kids<br>fuchsia butterflies<br>red Sabbath <br>speedin bullet to heaven <br>embers <br>WAIT!<br>inside&#39;s out<br><br>all these songs I mentioned are dank! I deleted the rest of the album because let&#39;s be honest they weren&#39;t that great. but when I listen to the album the way I edited it it&#39;s one of my favorite albums. really gives off some deep psychedelic like vibes. some lyrics are slept on too like &quot;I explore the galaxy nightly, I&#39;m out of my body&quot; he&#39;s talking about astral projection. so of course you won&#39;t like this album if you&#39;re not on the same frequency ‚úå
kid cudi is a hero. the ablum;s not a zer0
Melon
lmaoooooooooooo 0 ahahahahahahahaha
indicud was the biggest disappointment since McDonald&#39;s brought back the mcrib
Satellite Flight will sound like a classic after listening to SB2H
the melon gave this album a melon
I happen to actually think the album is good. I agree, it&#39;s not his best, but the album was made at a time when he was going through a lot of shit mentally with his depression. Kid cudi is my favorite artist of all time, and my personal belief is that Indicud was his best album. Just what I am is one of my favorite songs and will be till the day I die
this is one of my favorite album from kid cudi...
my mom changed the wifi password when she saw i tried to download this album
I never even knew this existed
Harsh, I agree about the demo CD but I actually really love the first disc.
funny video but that rainbow sweater........ dude your girlfriend need to step her game up by picking some clothes for you
speeding bullet straight thru my brain
Kid Cuddly! pahhh! üò≠ üòÇ
Bra ima punch you in the face on sight when i see you for the worst review of this creative work of art. You dont know shit about music.
This album is astoundingly terrible, it&#39;s f***ing beautifiul.
Satellite Flight was surprisingly okay. Wasn&#39;t terrible, wasn&#39;t super special.
YOU GAVE DAMN A 2.67 BUT SPEEDIN BULLET A STRONG 9??? FUCK OUTTA HERE
Watch Anthony&#39;s review of &quot;To Pimp a Butterfly&quot;, and watch this review immediately after.  Classic hilarity.
This is so weird to me. How could you judge music, there&#39;s no way you know how he was feeling or why he truly made that album. There&#39;s no right or wrong way to make music
I love this album it&#39;s truly before its time and it saved my life
Yo that Polaris album in the background though.<br>Great record and The Adventures of Pete and Pete was way ahead of it&#39;s time.
ü§£üòÇüòÇü§£
videos like these justify the &quot;nerd&quot; in internets busiest music nerd bc good lord does he sperg out on this one
&quot;Speeding Bullet to Heaven&quot; &gt; &quot;Sgt. Peppers&quot;
Don&#39;t lie, this is the best comedy album of the year. I rate it LOL/10
this was very satisfying
Damn, I really liked WZRD, I love the song &quot;High Off Life&quot;
Good album name tho...
&gt;man in the night<br><br>&gt;night man<br><br>&gt;the nightman cometh
I finally got around to trying to give this album a full listen and in all honesty, I couldn&#39;t make it past like track 10. It was so annoying
More like &#39;Belongs in the Trash&#39;.
Holy shit that&#39;s fuckin Polaris album lol wtf lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=561">9:21</a> <br>Oh my godü§£ I&#39;m done he gave this shit a zero
Kid Cuddly
I actually like the album
This album is a disgrace to rock music
I&#39;m not a huge fan of this album but I will say I do have a couple of songs I like. As emo as it comes off I love Handle With Care. I will admit I didn&#39;t like it too much at first but it kept coming up on my Spotify and grew to like it. The other one I like is Speedin&#39; Bullet to Heaven.. it can get annoying or sort of like he&#39;s droning on and on but I think that&#39;s the point. The rest of the album has... okay moments, to put it nicely, but otherwise I don&#39;t care for it.
I rather see 0s then 10s
Even Cudi looking to the sky like why did I create such a shitty album.
what&#39;s those two records in the back tho? 
&quot;A FEW RIFFS THAT ARE OKAY&quot;
&quot;90 MINUTES OF THIS&quot; LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
This is my favorite fucking review ever I&#39;m in literal fucking tears
I&#39;M IN FUCKING TEARS THIS ALBUM WAS FUCKING HORRENDOUS
came back for the meme
fuck all of you this is one of the best albums i know of
10 out of 10! Review it again!
good thing passion paon demon slayong was a good album  speeding bullet  through heaven was like he wasent evan trying!
The title track was nice, the rest was hard to enjoy
MFW I&#39;d rather listen to this than any Death Grips song.
I liked it and I still listen to it for comedy
on the bright side cudi&#39;s return to hip hop with demon slayin definitely had it&#39;s stand out moments and provided a very solid vibe
being a cudi fan this album will probably have me laughing, famous dex tapes never fail to make me laugh so this should bring a smile to my face
you are all stuck and asleep
I fucking love when he straight up ROASTS an album. Even if its one I like XD
Kid Mind loses his cudi.
if you forget that he is a rapper and take in consideration that cudi suffers from chronic depression. this was a good album. 
&quot;You&#39;re always hating on the kid cuddly!&quot;
review jimmy buffett pls
The WZRD was a great, Indicud is one of my favorite albums of all<br>time also? you need another listen man. Immortal, unfuckwittable, just what i am, Cold blooded. and it goes on. it really spoke to me and touched me.
Listen here theneedledick, I completely disagree
I didn&#39;t even know that Kid Cudi sang confused...<br>TBH I love the song confused
The first time I listened to this album 2 years ago I absolutely hated it because I thought it was supposed to be rap, and I had never heard of kid cudi. I really loved the beats though but I didn&#39;t come back to it til about a month ago, and now I LOVE THIS ALBUM. The beavis and butthead skits were over kill to me, but it&#39;s honestly one of my favorite albums now. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because the landscape of musics changed or my tastes are different, but that&#39;s honestly how I feel about this album. Not sure how I feel about demon slaying though.
Lol, out of his last 4 albums, you skipped the only good one, you idiot. This is why you can&#39;t skip any albums
We all know every day after his review Anthony caves in and blissfully listens to speedin&#39; bullet to heaven.
No mention of Seance Chaos? One of the best song titles in years for one of the worst songs in years.
am i the only fucking guy who loved this album
this album is actually pretty good if you really take the time to listen to what he&#39;s saying but I guess it&#39;s not for everyone there&#39;s no way that anyone will like it if they can&#39;t relate to what cudi is saying
Solid Beavis impersonation
I would have loved to watch him listen to this album
That beavis impression was soooo good lmfao
DecimalsüòÇ the album is in the decimals
I actually liked the album üôÑüòï
The album cover looks like the Mr. Krabs meme.
This is my favorite nirvana album
tbh I kind of like this album
Me gusta Speeding Bullet 2 Heaven
U right.
This shit is just unnecessarily rude. His rock collaborations and wild hip hop albums are amazing. You are very wrong sir, thank you for you explanation of discontent though. Boo to you
Kid Kudi - Speedin&#39; Bullet To Recycle Bin
I wish a speeding bullet would kill me.
God I love this video!
For some odd reason I watch this video once a month. I love how peach fuzz just shits on this man in particularly LUL.
Handle with care is the best song on this album in my opinion
Why didn&#39;t this get on the &quot;NOT GOOD&quot;
This album isn&#39;t as bad as people portray it. You guys all just watched the video and went into the album thinking &quot;it&#39;s gonna suck cause this bald guy said it was.&quot; It really isn&#39;t bad if you go into it not expecting anything. It&#39;s not for everyone, but you really have to respect what he tried to do. He made himself vulnerable by releasing this album, and honestly I respect it so much. If you actually listen to the lyrics this is one of the saddest albums I&#39;ve ever listened to. It really sounds like he&#39;s hit rock bottom with this one, and it&#39;s honestly depressing. Not depressing cause it&#39;s a horrible sounding album, it just has a really eerie vibe like he really wanted to just end his life for good. As you listen to it, it gives you this feeling of anxiety and peace at the same time and I can&#39;t really describe it. I hated this album when I listened to it at first too, but if you really give it an unbiased listen and really listen to some of the lyrics, it truthfully hits the heart. However his newest album is amazing and is honestly a masterpiece in my eyes.
i don&#39;t know why I clicked on this video. it just reminds me why I hate critics.
Once i seen the 0 i couldn&#39;t help but start laughing this review was so funny.
tbh there are some rlly chill songs to vibe for in speedin bullet 2 heaven. i feel for cudi. if you don&#39;t like it don&#39;t insult him so much
What&#39;s that album next to Dummy?
Now we can see that Cudi really lost his mind in 2015

&quot;No more chicken sandwiches, yes I&#39;ll pay for the damages&quot; is so ridiculous that it might be my favourite line in any medium of entertainment.
I still come back to this review based on it&#39;s impact on Fantano&#39;s career, and whatever new perspective he gained. The only other video that trumps this is that Corey Feldman record.
(stank)(tsb) chuckjoens11
Fuck you sir
Honestly someone should turn this into a ytp
I love you Kid Cudi
Lmfao. bet he avoidin&#39;  Cudi&#39;s new album.
I like this album way more since I know that every one hate it
Review his new shit
What&#39;s the left purple album on his shelf?
Do Passion Pain and Demon Slayin&#39;!
I liked this album... I really liked it... What is going on? It&#39;s about attitude, not instrumentation I guess... Adventures was my favourite... What the fuck?
You suck.
review the cudi&#39;s new album fantana
This must be the album that Shinji was always playing on Evangelion
Scott Mescudi gave a good reason for why this album sounded the way it did.  it&#39;s all the negativity, angry and depression locked in him, and to release it he had to make it into an album. I respect CuDi for doing what needed to be done. However his new album is great!! definitely Made a comeback.
@theneedledrop please rate Cudis new album PPD
please review his new album
Hyping myself up for the new review. Because it&#39;s dookie, aesthetically pleasing, but dookie.
Do Passion, Pain &amp; Demons slaying
Review Passion, Pain, and Demon Slayin&#39; please. I feel like it&#39;s better than his last three.
Lmao it&#39;s not even a 1
Review his new album
lol
Review his new album please!!!
MELTING in the demo section was definitely a highlight
I really didn&#39;t think the album was this bad, a couple tracks i skip over sure, but i really think there&quot;s a lot of decent ones too.
i liked this album...
to this day I&#39;ve still never listened to this album from start to finish lol its actually such a struggle. it physically and mentally pains me to listen to it.
As a Cudi fan,This album was truly Trash.
Kid Cudi dropped Passion Pain and Demon Slaying just for Anthony Fantano @theneedledrop give it a listen
Damn ZERO lol
Sometimes you need to make a big mess to in turn create a masterpiece.
Do his new album
shutup nerd
Review the new kid cudi
What about the new album?
I admire what Cudi is attempting, but he doesn&#39;t execute it very well. Every aspect - from lyrics to vocals to especially guitar - sounds lazy and amateurish in an unflattering way that is surprising for a music veteran in his 30s. The album just doesn&#39;t have the proper spark or energy to &quot;rock.&quot;
I think this album was him trying to show his depression, but as you say he can&#39;t even get that across which holds up to why he went to rehab. Confused! Is a great track I think &quot;I hate the drugs but I love the numb, I hate the gun but I want the sun&quot;.
His new albums not much better
No yellow flannel?
I know Anthony has now released a review of an album that&#39;s even worse than this one but I still enjoy this one more because this album being so bad is more unexpected I guess, since kudi used to make actually good music
Melon.
Have anyone noticed that the song &quot;fade 2 red&quot; (which Anthony mentions here <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=266">4:26</a>) it&#39;s a vile and blatant copy from the song &quot;Return of the rat&quot; by the Wipers? I&#39;m sure Cudi knows the song because Nirvana made a cover of it.
Open your minds people. This album was/is actually great. 8.5/10. Yeah..
love that dummy vinyl in the background
I liked confused a lot
Year ago today
1 year anniversary of the greatest video of all time
watching this video exactly a year after its out kill me.
indicud is cudis best work so far.
You are a pleb fat-tano, this shit is the Trout Mask Replica of our generation
a big fat goose egg
Whenever I feel like shit I come watch this and think &quot;well at least you&#39;re not as bad as this album.&quot;
Still don&#39;t think sbth was that bad
Since everyone is putting their personal opinion out there lol. I honestly think you just have to be able to relate to the songs, in order to like this album. I feel like if you have went through so pretty tough shit in your life this album isnt really that bad. I love this album! but its not for everyone.
brilliant
dont know if im the only one here, but i actually dont think it was that bad
am i the only one who really enjoyed this album wtf? seriously. and the lyrics. geez, Confused is one of my favorite songs in this album. all these hate comments, and mean comments wtf i&#39;m so upset
Speeding Bullet To Harambe
you are a goof
this review sucks ass <br>matter of opinion <br>Cudi is the Sun of hip hop
is he joking about the beavis and butthead or is cudi actually that idiotic?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=3">0:03</a> when speeding bullet to heaven dropped and was hoping you clicked the wrong vid
The dummy album looks ashamed to be in the shot with this album.
Lmao &quot;Kid Cudi has released some of the worst music of the past decade&quot; hahahahaha. Is that why the most visionary figures in music like Kanye, Asap Rocky, Travis Scott, and Andre 3000 all think he is one of the most influential and visionary artists alive? Say you don&#39;t like the music but don&#39;t try to tell anyone that Cudi has put out some of the worst music of the last 10 years. You&#39;re just wrong about that lol. Please respond to me as I would like to have a conversation with you.
Yo yo indicud was good, what about unfucwittable and immortal? Those were fucking great!
your review is too idealistic. <br><br>he released an unrefined music album. I enjoy the imperfections in each chord &amp; human voice. we&#39;ve seen &amp; heard perfectly mastered music before. <br><br>this is different, abstract ...imperfect
this album was so refreshing, I really like this, it&#39;s like a musician from the twenties time traveled into modern times but while time time traveling developed schizophrenia
When you&#39;re sad and depressed this album speaks levels. There are a lot of not great songs though.
I don&#39;t understand how you thought Indicud was so terrible. I thought it was one of his better albums.
Feel so bad that he&#39;s in rehab now (especially since he&#39;s one of my favorite artists) but Jesus, this review is so spot-on. One of the worst albums I&#39;ve ever had to sit through.
The description should say &quot;Anthony loses his mind&quot;
Kid cudi said fuck everything on this album basically
He doesn&#39;t say forever at the end of the video...
most of you just dont get it cudi did the repeating of easy guitar melodies sothat you would focus more on his voice +  the repeated melodies just seem like a hiphop beat that is on repeat like it usually is you have to kinda adjust to that type of output he captures mostly one feeling and keeps it on repeat track for track, the more ugly and annoying parts could be seen as the uglyness and annoyingness of the usuall stuff people have to go through with their emotions it could be seen as a metaphor. he did beautiful tracks like handle with care and also really disturbing shit like amen or seance chaos its just.. you have to get it.. he could do the usuall stuff that will propobly sound good for most peoples musical adjustment but he probly just choose not to and went into that corner of whatever he did, i didnt like the album right of the bat but it kinda grew on me over time and i like it alot now
Cudi is just telling the industry he doesnt give a fuck what people think, hes doing his own thing.
This project gave me aids
... I have to listen to this shit
This was my first ever kid cudi album and I had completely different expectations. I skipped through so many songs waiting thinking maybe I downloaded some messed up album
Damn that&#39;s the worst review I&#39;ve ever seen Anthony give üòÇüòÇüòÇ
You should release an Album!??
This Guy is a Critic? You have to remember that so Fuck him (:
kid cudi is the second best musician of all time.
gota remember that this album was better than others hes made tho
If i was into BDSM, this would be the soundtrack.
Something should be noted here. Most people heard the album and said Kid Cudi had lost his mind, in a mocking way. Thing is, he was actually losing his mind at the time and that was exactly his point making this album. He was actually going through mental illness, it&#39;s sad that he had to check into rehab for people to understand that. If you&#39;re not aware, lots of rock/hard rock/punk rock artists have a music thriving on conflict, chaos and depression. Cudi was just giving that a shot. Lots of rock artists make some of their best music while being in the darkest mental place. Sadly, Cudi is no rocker initially, so it was likely that he was going to fuck that up.<br><br>I think with a couple more people in the know and a better producer, this would have turned out well. Like it or not, but this record was an artist descending into hell who wanted to give a musical glimpse of what that is. In my opinion, while not disregarding the terrible output, he did that very well. He succeeded in doing what he wanted to do. For that alone, it deserves a bit of a kinder judgement than what it&#39;s got since it was released.<br><br>While I reject most of the album because it does suck, &quot;Fuchsia Butterflies&quot;, &quot;Edge of the Earth&quot;, &quot;Speedin&#39; Bullet 2 Heaven&quot; and (maybe) &quot;Wedding Tux&quot; aren&#39;t so bad and do make you travel to a very isolated, sad lonely place if you give them the time.
Corey Feldman or this? how do you want to die?
the album sucked. but i woundt give it a zero. so I say 2.5/10
This is what makes him Good cudi does what ever tf he wants. He didn&#39;t give a fuck
Kid Cudi has probably seen this, and that makes me happy.
i actually really enjoyed it it was a really raw depiction on his mindset whilst recording, and i think if you know anything about cudi&#39;s mental health right now might give you some hindsight. i immediately loved this album on the first listen and it only grew on me,it was a stream of consciousness through his drug addiction and depression and im so grateful to have an album to stand next to those emotions.
Super unpopular opinion: this album wasn&#39;t even bad. Some pretty good songs, and he had plenty of guts putting it out.
I get this album is a zero. but how can you laugh at this. it&#39;s obvious he is in a deep deep depression. he may actually kill him self man. he actually checked him self into a suicidal prevention center a few days ago. I hope he gets the help he needs.
Indicud was his best project imo
When Big Quint and Fantano agree on Cudi and his last 3 albums
This album wasn&#39;t good. The albums before that are amazing. If you truly listen to Indicud, it&#39;s amazing. Fantano&#39;s right about this but not the albums before
Well he actually admitted he was insane so..
Kid Cudi got depressed because of the backlash this album got the needle drop guy. Thanks for the 0 Anthony.
So big Sean DSP beats this album?
This album is better than TPAB
Totally agree. Motm 1 and 2 were perfect, some mixtapes from that era too, but Kid Cudi was releasing trash ever since. He really is is some kind of delusion and became irrelevant .
APOLOGIZE
rehabthony whaterevrthefucktano
HE&#39;S IN REHAB NOW HAHAHAHA NOW YOU GOTTA FEEL BAD BITCHBOI
is this review the reason kid cudi checked into rehab for depression
i knew he was out of his mind. like if you listen to SB2H, u just feel like hes not right in the head and the fact that everyone shit on his album and that he said and probably truly felt that his music would change the world. He just lost his desire to live probably. thank fuck he checked into rehab
Cudi wants to kill himself now and ITS YOUR FAULT ANTHONY
you weren&#39;t wrong, sadly he lost his mind.<br><br>glad he&#39;s getting help.
Anthony, he made another album, man. I can feel the tumors growing on my back because of this...
UHM PORTISHEAD &quot;DUMMY&quot; ALBUM YESSSSS
HYYMMMMYEAHHHHUHHHH
Hey, his new songs are really decent
You know it&#39;s a bad review when he his regular name at the beginning and didn&#39;t even say &quot;kid cudi... Forever&quot; at the end lol
Well, album was bad, but Embers is my shit
has anyone noticed that anthony might have a bad review shirt cause he wears the same one for his miley cyrus review
he gave miley cyrus and her dead petz a 1. let that sink in.
Speeding bullet to heaven is a speeding bullet to my brain
he made the cover a fucking meme
The first like 6 songs from indicud is my favorite work of kid cudi to date
Idk why Cal saying &quot;Kid Cuddly&quot; made me laugh chuckle so rapturously.
Stop complaining about the album and complain to your barber, jesus
Speedin bullet to the trash can
Satellite flight was pretty good
Polaris!
0.94721/10 üòÇ why he do kid like that
When I&#39;m on acid the cover looks so dope
I swear,I Just come back to this review for entertainment..Anthony facial expressions just kill me!!!!
This is music for the sad &amp; lonely. You closed minded fuvks wouldn&#39;t understand.
Most influential artist of the last ten years (according to Kanye)  ladies and gentlemen I introduce Kid Cudi. No wonder Kanye music has been such shit for the past ten years.
bitch he doesn&#39;t care about ur gay opinions he&#39;s all fucking smiles so suck on that idiot
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=372">6:12</a> &quot;THIS WILL HAPPEN&quot; IN DEAD AF
Your boring and annoying go fuck yourself <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23america">#America</a>
soon as he said the WZRD album was shit , which it isnt its frickin sperb , i said nahh given up on this guys reviews
I quite enjoyed the Acoustic Demo of Speedin&#39; Bullet 2 Heaven though
indicud was good come on
I couldn&#39;t even get through the album- it was that bad. I commend you for managing to get through it for the sake of the review.
Man on the Moon or Man on the Moon 2?
Are you mad and envious because you can&#39;t rap or sing or play music that people love?
Hater
This is straight up one of the worst records I have ever ever ever listened to.<br><br>The fact that Andre thought this was good is worrying............
I thought this album was like a 4 or 5 out of 10. Thought the rock stuff was interesting at least.
so who&#39;s watching this during this Kid Cudi and Kanye/Drake beef?
Indicud was amazing what talking about
Shit i like the album
Who else thinks this would be an awesome Stand name?
if you like this album even a little bit then your right to vote should be revoked immediately
he&#39;s lost his two moms
Speedin&#39; Bullet to Harambe
The thumbnail to this video had me crying bc I knew this album was garbage and his face said it all üòÇüíÄ
Wasnt it a 4/10 first?
it was good
Worse album of all time. üíØ
Still better than your shit meme review channel
Kid cuddly üòÇüòÇ
I want the old Kid cudi the 2010 kid cudi this sucks so badd
ok... I&#39;ve been a HUGE fan of KiD CuDi for years... motm 1 and 2 we&#39;re huge parts of my life in high school and really helped me through a lot and I always respected cudi for making music that is different and experimental... but that being said, this album if fucking TERRIBLE! saying it&#39;s &quot;experimental&quot; or &quot;Cudi&#39;s just trying something new&quot; does not somehow make it good! everything about this album is sloppy and amateur. I just wanna ask anyone who likes this album, if it wasn&#39;t cudi, would you still think it&#39;s good? I highly doubt it. listen to it again with that in mind and you&#39;ll probably realize that this is just objectively BAD MUSIC.

This album sucks
Take shrooms then listen to the whole album and do another review üòÇ I honestly think kid cudi knew this wasn&#39;t going to be an album a lot of people were going to be aboard with.
This guy is so shallow..
this is the score i gave your reviews. how ironic. no homo
I love how brutally honest you are.
Anyone know -- what is that album on the top left corner? I&#39;ve seen it on a few videos, the artwork looks interesting
i just lost my shit when he said &quot;SADISTIC&quot; lmfaoooo
It&#39;s a poor imitation of Bleach by Nirvana, but it&#39;s not as bad as people make it out to be.
the bullying in this review is incredible üòÇ
Am i the only one who enjoyed this album?This album took me on a journey through alot of different vibes it surely might not be suited for alot people but i respect Cudi for putting his personal album out for the world even though it didnt receive alot of good press
underrated aspect: that cover is absolutely terrible. it almost hurts to look at.
wow a 0.9
THIS REVIEW IS STILL HILARIOUS
This album was bad, but indicud was something that no one can recreate. The album was unique, risky, and had great song writing and production.
Every time I have a bad day I watch this video to remind myself my bad day wasn&#39;t as bad as this album
Speedin bullet to heaven is dope
cover looks like the Mr Krabs memes
Kid should have just stayed as the loner stoner rapper I understand artist what to branch out more but hell its like that old saying if it ain&#39;t broke don&#39;t fix it
This review is glorious. Please review more 0 albums.
I honestly don&#39;t think this is bad at all even tho the demos weren&#39;t really needed but sb2h reminds me of a worse nirvana lol put some respek on this mans name he&#39;s a top 10 living artist imo
What happened to the Wedding Tux and CONFUSED! reviews? I can&#39;t find them ANYWHERE!
Kid Cudi&#39;s Speedin&#39; Bullet to Heaven: NOT GOOD
i don&#39;t see how anyone can hate Indicud...
Do a classic review on Kid Cudi&#39;s first album. I&#39;m want to hear what it sounds like for you say something good about a Kid Cudi album for a change.
I clicked on this because of the polaris album
one thing i hate is that everyone saying this is trash only and has only ever listened to hip hop
Fav Track: Embers? Brilliant song. I get this record wasn&#39;t great at all but this guy had some extreme depression during this time period and Embers captures the depression and weariness of his life from 2013-now. I honestly don&#39;t hate this record. He didn&#39;t channel his emotion to the songs too clearly, but it&#39;s still a decent album. I&#39;m curious to see how his next record comes out
Some days I just put this album review on repeat.
An album that gets as much hate of infinite warfare
Hard drugs make this album the shit
666K
HAHAH THIS IS FKN HILARIOUS
666k views this album is satan incarnate confirmed
ITS TIME TO STOP
BEST ALBUM OF 2015 LOVED IT
The album artwork looks good, tbh smh familia.
dat cuddly album was at least a strang 9
kid cudi just fell off the earth with this one....his 1st album is dope, 2nd album...eh. but my god..... is he the definition of a one hit wonder? I mean he tried, right?
This album review was the most hilarious album review I&#39;ve ever watched. I don&#39;t even know if this review was good or bad for Cudi because people might say, this album apparently is so awful, I need to listen to this, or people are going to just stay away from it like the Black Plague.
Lil Boat gets a 7/10, but Speedin Bullet 2 Heaven gets a 0.94721/10? Seems Legit.
I&#39;m sure this was mentioned countless times before, but the cover looks like the Mr. Krabs meme.<br>Which actually makes sense once you listen to the album.
Damn Anthony, nice Polaris vinyl!
The Real Chip Douglas (Demo) is the best fuckin song I&#39;ve ever heard. I lose my shit at the end... every time.
Indicud is my 2nd fav. Cudder album...<br><br>)-:
Review this mixtape!<br><br><br><a href="https://soundcloud.com/mcgregordalton/sets/the-fourth-wall">https://soundcloud.com/mcgregordalton/sets/the-fourth-wall</a>
Speedin bullet to the head
Cudi lost his soul..first and second albums were dope then he started trying to do too much. nigga wanna be a punk rocker, rapper and fashion icon. plus i hate to say it, but he was better when he was coked out and depressed
his kid cudi impression is so on point.
Dummy by Portishead is in the background
Andre 3000 claimed this was one of the best albums to come out in years. No joke.
LMFAO ZERO
Cudi is one of my favorite artists so this album and review really make me upset
Album cover look like mr Krabs meme
Kid cudi will always have fans, just like nickelback will always have fans. No matter how shit the music is, someone will have been dropped on the head enough times to like crap music.
This album isn&#39;t that bad after a few months and I revisited it. I think it was just cool to shit on it. Not perfect but a few songs here and there are cool. I think he was just having fun and experimenting and I&#39;m pretty sure he has everyone&#39;s attention for his next album haha
man i thought i was sleeping on cudi but i come back to this mess LOL
say what you want about me and this album, but I personally paid $17.99 for it and have no regrets.
very fast kid cudi singing at incredible hihg speed
Then u should try to then lol
best review ever
he was expressing his feelings in music
This album was fuckin garbage
You are trash. Open your mind.
I actually love this album
You guys we are all being judgmental cunts.... Stop it. My rating 0-100 and idk who told him he could even be an artist. My only song I liked from him ever was day n night... After that... He is trash.
I liked half of it.
This album gave me morbid nightmares.
I&#39;ve seen this too many times... but it&#39;s so entertaining :)
Anyone else watches this daily? I don&#39;t know why I do this lmao
He said this was the worst album he REVIEWED this year, but maybe not the worst album he has listened to this year. What came out the same year as Speeding Bullet that&#39;s even worse than this? Did Buyer&#39;s Market II: The Return of the Sodomization drop in 2015 and I didn&#39;t hear about it? Damn, I&#39;m scared to even keep living with stuff like this dropping and if there&#39;s stuff even WORSE than this.
I love Kid Cudi and speeding bullet 2 heaven.
yeah I totally agree with Anthony there&#39;s a lot of personal messages that cudi just fails to express and execute right and the very long project has alotta instrumentals that consist of the same guitar rifts and he doesn&#39;t mix his lyrics well and with everything from the random unnecessary beavis and butthead skits to the bad vocals random noises and bad mixing which leads to songs that r boring and repetitive but r very weird and very unnecessarily strange just going into eachother it doesn&#39;t have much flow or connectivity and this same thing goes on for 18 tracks the demos r terrible this whole project has some good sounds but he doesn&#39;t fully execute he overcomplicates and half asses stuff at the same time gets a seemingly good idea and sound and then strings it out over and over again or throws in something random to make the song go from kinda good to bad in like a minute its different and its hard 2 understand but its still not that different then typical 90s punk rock and it&#39;s still not that good it really was about the execution
Speeding bullet to my head üò£üî´
Yo for all of you who live ironic bullshit Urban Outfitters is selling exclusive cassettes of speedin&#39; bullet at the major stores in like college towns. Hype AF
Worst album I have ever listened to, was very hard and cringing to finish
The Polaris album in the back...
do you think this downward spiral many see of CuDi should have been a situation where he should have released the last 3 albums as a different name/Brand? I love CuDi up until the INDICUD wave happened. I like that album a lot but now I feel like he&#39;s an indie artist trying his best to make decent quality sounding music with lackluster content. it saddens me because up until 2013/14 he was my fav.
This is too funny.  Sometimes, you need to take a break from useful album recommendations and just watch an angry rant.
NO. NOPE. NO.
Question: Which is worse: a strong 0 or a light 0?
This guy doesnt know what hes talking about
No one knows good , when cudi puts out something different you all hate it. <br>no one appreciates him
what is that album in thr background next to the portishead one?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=372">6:12</a>-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=379">6:19</a>
Okay. I&#39;m a sucker for grunge music and obviously felt there was just some biased but having finished listening to this whole album... Goddamn. <br><br>I feel bad Kid Cudi. Like... I get that he&#39;s experimenting and I do support him. In an age where everyone just tries to copy one another to be more standard and generic, he&#39;s trying to be original. This just didn&#39;t hit the mark for me.<br><br>I am in full support of him going any direction he wants, but I feel like his Punk-Rock if you call it this or &quot;Grunge&quot; needs a bit work.<br>I liked the actual song&quot;Speedin&#39; Bullet 2 Heaven&quot; cause as repetitive as it was, it was a song that was just bleak and bitter enough to make me think of my days in high school. Other then that, everything else kind of left me with a sore ear and depression.
stop making videos
your music taste is trash
You imbeciles just aren&#39;t woke enough to understand the true genius that is this album
I feel nothing but disgust when some dick rider says this Speedin&#39; Pile of Shit is experimental, and try to use it as an excuse. If you can&#39;t hear how awful Cudis voice is you are tone-deaf. Its like a teenager bought every Soundgarden and Nirvana album and tried to make an album based off of everything he heard.
I feel like Anthony is a few SBtHs away from losing his mind :)
CONFUSED! Is the only semi tolerable song on the whole album.
brh like why do you get so mad over music lmao
Confused! was the only tolerable song imho
got damn his Beavis impression is spot on
the beavis and butthead skits make me wanna kms. And I thought wedding tux was alright
I loved indicud
I really liked it and i think i am the only one. For me, it has some really intense feeling and personality. Maybe I like it because its different and isn&#39;t so easily consumed by todays listeners. Maybe in 20 years people will look back at it and think it was some kind of arty creative something. I don&#39;t know. I wasn&#39;t that into him when he was a rapper so I didn&#39;t listen to this expecting a certain sound like his fans most likely were. Also I dig sonic youth so maybe its just my preference hahah
SPB2H is beautiful
This album will be a classic in 20 years. Wait and you&#39;ll see.
Your review probably got this album way more listens/downloads than it would have had otherwise..
I liked it... I may be a huge cudi fan and I can see why someone wouldn&#39;t like parts of the album. I like the chill feel to some of the songs. I feel I can relate to parts of his lyrics and I can see what cudi was trying to do with this album. I sucks to see not many people think the same way but I can see where it comes from. its a very different type of music.
Lmao this review still funny
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=357">5:57</a> he made everyone throw away their mixtapes
oh and Chuck taylors.....wiz made Taylor gang in 2011 or 2012...cudi was chuck Taylor trench coats and skinny jeans before he was signed...thats y his fan base is soooo strong...we watch the whole world copy him...thank him for my beautiful dark twisted fantasy. . and probably being the only rapper without a ghost writer
if no one wants to hear Cudi...y does the whole world take his swag
Attention hip hop fans: Good Music record label is responsible for everything that you do......everything!!!! what you wear what you listen to what your standards are...most of it was created by a member of Good Music...those who just started rocking Jordans in 2011.. you can thank Kids Cudi...those who started wearing leather in 2010 ..you can thank kid cudi...those who just started wearing long trench coats and jackets you can thank kid cudi....those who wear fake balmain jeans....you can thank kid cudi...those who wear leather pants..yes you guessed it Cudi...Drake singing on albums ...you may not believe but you are a follower so you don&#39;t know that you should be  thanking Cudi....and also &quot;no more chicken sandwiches yes I&#39;ll pay for damages&quot; I think that means he wrecked a hotel room and he wants to go home...his singing sounds like that be cuz he rarely uses autotune...point being...if Cudi isn&#39;t &quot;the&quot; artist who the he&#39;ll is..I&#39;ve performed with famous people and been given my options of a path to being signed..so I&#39;m just saying most of you don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on.....Cudi is a God
I wanna know what record that is on his shelf, not Portishead but the other one. Anyone?
Black People should NEVER do Rock music. Stick to rap black people.
It is a really good album just take some time  to listen to it. The name says it all. It rakes you to another dimension.
cudi the goat
I loved the album because I&#39;m a devoted CuDi fan.  Clearly you don&#39;t understand art when you see it.
Only the singles were any good and you should definitely go back and listen to satellite flight
Cudi needs to take a few pages out of P.O.S&#39;s book if he wants to make rock/punk inspired hip hop.
I wanted that Polaris LP for RSD so bad
the funniest fucking review EVER!
he hit him with a .947
ANTHONY PLEASE HELP ME I LISTENED TO ALBUMS YOU LIKE AND MY FRIENDS HATE ME NOW AND JUST DON&#39;T WANT TO BE AROUND ME! HOW DO I STOP BEING LIKE YOU???<br><br>wetrippymane
Laughed the entire time. &quot;Always hating on the Kid Cuddly&quot; üòÉ
Jesus Christ wtf is that album cover lol
This album doesn&#39;t suck, it&#39;s just really different.
Put some RESPECK on his name.
holy shit üò≤ I think this is my first time ever seeing you give a zero
I like this record
God...This is a masterpiece of badness. Like a first practice session of a high school band.<br><br>I like angered kids though and some of the songs are so repetetive that they can put you into trance. But I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s good.
Shit was pure garbage... Exactly why I don&#39;t fuck with cudi, honestly think he&#39;s one of the most overrated artist of the decade
Edge of the earth is fucking beautiful
Question: what is it that makes the abstract and kind of experimental form of this so different to Captain Beefheart?
Anthony never did the end bit. So I guess this review goes on...<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>forever...
The album cover is like a Mr. Krabs meme
turn that 0.94721 upside down thats a 12L46.0 now
the only good song from the album, which actually wasn&#39;t even on the album, was the acoustic version of Confused. You really felt the classic Kid Cudi emotion on it.
I was going to comment this when you released the video but I just now getting to it. I feel as if it was very insolent and immature that you said what you had to say about this album. It was not necessary for you to berate him. I know that this wasn&#39;t his best album (believe me,  I know how shitty this was) but it wasn&#39;t made to impress or ante-up his past albums. Scott was going through dark times in life and the only way he could get relieved from his pain was through rock music. So this was more of a therapeutic album. But shit did you have to be such a dickhead?? If you don&#39;t enjoy Kid Cudi, why even bother listening or going as far as reviewing it, even though it was obviously not a pleasant album for you to hear. You could have just not said anything and left it alone. But instead you have to dissect each of its flaws one by one. Fuck, have you ever felt suicidal?? I could relate to certain things in this album and hearing you berate a person like Scott, who I&#39;ve looked up to for years, not only hurts him but me and many other listeners who are going through the same things. It&#39;s unappreciated.
Yup, I have to agree with this review. I couldn&#39;t even finish the album it was so terrible.
Kid Cudi needs to start doing drugs again. I love kid cudi, one of my favorite artist, but cmon man! Stop pushing out shit!
Maybe this album was a satire of Kid Cudi himself
I think... that you are inclined to rap music... all your ratings point towards that... so just review rap music, don&#39;t review other genres
you clearly dont know wtf your talking about, you critique music with your preconceptions
Me farting on a microphone might be as good as this album if it&#39;s a long fart probably better
absolutely savage
turn the 0.94721 upside down, it&#39;s a 0.6hLsomething1 now
hahahaHAHAHAHHAHA
Kid cudi got me through high school
what are the albums in the background
You bash it now, but hundreds of bands  in the future will form a tight-knit scene around an all new genre inspired by the music of Kid Cudi. After their inevitable rise to fame, all the future kids will be driving around annoying us old people with cudicore.
I enjoyed the album, but for a much different reason. The incredibly simplistic and droning song structure reminds me of early attempts at &quot;songwriting&quot; by and with friends in our parents&#39; basement years ago. It reminds me of a simpler time when we recorded music for our own entertainment, and it was cool to hear (for a few songs) what it sounded like when Kid Cudi did the same.<br><br>That being said, it isn&#39;t an appropriate 5th studio album that they expect us to pay for. Maybe as a mixtape release, or as a free download for fans....

cut the beavis &amp; butthead skits and a handful of tracks from this album and it&#39;s like a 6/10 lmao
It made me want to listen to the music cuz it just can&#39;t be so bad...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=105">1:45</a> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=127">2:07</a> the buildup he gave üòÇüòÇ
This was the worst studio album i&#39;ve ever heard in my life. <br><br>And to say i used to be a fan of the artist who made the worst album i&#39;ve ever heard in my life is a tragedy.
I spy a Portishead vinyl
No more chicken sandwiches<br>Yes I&#39;ll pay for the damages
Wow all those projects are great i like some less than others but they all had good songs like <br>WZRD: teleport 2 me, jamie/upper room/efflictim <br>Indicud: unfuckwittable/just what I am/young lady<br>Satellite Flight:Going to the ceremony/ balmain jeans/internal bleeding<br>Speedin&#39; Bullet 2 heaven: Confused/edge of the earth - post mortem boredom/speedin&#39; Bullet to heaven...<br>Adventures and wedding tux are good songs too...
Lmao this was more like a bashing rant
tbh to the kid cudi fans this album had some really bad songs and those demos were ass,but not all songs were horriable.my favorite songs from this able is edge of the earth,adventures,wedding tux,speeding bullet to heaven,melting,red sabbath,and embers.i didnt like a single song when i first heard this but i kept listening and it just grew on me.you just gotta listen to album a couple more times and you&#39;ll find songs that you like.this is not my favorite ablums from him but its interesting and different.
Just listened to the whole album and I feel there are two possible long term outcomes of it:.I feel the reason this album fell short is because the confusing, and arguably dysfunctional, combination of psychedelic and grunge music. It&#39;s possible that someone, or a group of people, may hear this album now or in the future and work towards refining the style that&#39;s attempted in this album. In other words, there&#39;s a possibility that this album may have laid down the framework of a new genre..However, even in the case this never becomes a genre, this will become a cult classic like Sharknado and be brought up in pop culture every now and then for at least the next century.
YOU look stale anthony
its hard to hear this guy talk about someone who got people through the worse times of their lives
your an idiot why not try to listen to what hes sayingüòà
This is easily my favorite album he&#39;s released. I guess it&#39;s perspective.
You should review Aesop Rock&#39;s new album Impossible Kid
0.94721/10 ayy lmao
Satellite flight wasn&#39;t bad at all way better than this
lmfaaaaaaaaaaoooooooooo
I keep going back to this...
i really didnt like it at first when it came out. i saw your vid and agreed. Now i feel like this album grew on me and now i like it way more than when it first came out. give it more time if you care for it c:
Put some respeck on his name
Listen to it again... That&#39;s all I&#39;m saying
I died laughing when he started talking about how cudi fans are on hallucinogens so true
this album fucking blows
Hahaha, this has got to be the funniest review so far
SB2H &gt; TPAB
I watch this weekly.
Smh idiot fantano this album is too good/ smart for an idiot like u to enjoy
HE&#39;S RIGHT THIS ALBUM SUCKS ASS AND KID CUDI IS DELUDED AF
its almost magical
not stale, i think yt mekes me feel feelings
i like the album alot
This review gave me cancer
do 1000 people like this bullshit? this is the worst rock album I&#39;ve ever heard. it makes St. anger look like Sgt. pepper&#39;s lonely hearts club band.
@theneedledrop, an old review and all, i have to comment. i listen to alot of your vlogs and respect your opinions even if i disagree with them, this i think is a completely one sided diatribe, an empty handed foray at the musician akin to a troll comment on a BBS. I think alot of intention went into this record that you&#39;re completely glossing over. While I agree its a BAD record with few saving graces sonically, theres alot of this record that feels intented, as if he&#39;s trying to capture the zeitgeist of hipster culture by utilizing revisionist/throwback sonics and iconography. injecting himself into the grunge aesthetic with vocal nods to Vedder, songwriting homage to the style of and personality of Cobain, obvious sendup with the B&amp;B clips, etc. <br><br>Theres alot of modern youth culture that throws back to the 80s sound, an 80s nostalgia. I think Cudi thought to look beyond that, see the interest in grunge nostalgia (there&#39;s a resurgence in goth as well) and pay homage, likely looking to get some explorative cred along the way. I think that this will be seen as a trail blazing record for other artist, albeit a misstepped one.
id rather listen to Cals CALassic
where u get that tie dyed hoodie?
i love this album, i honestly feel like it is an expression of his emotion, not music, but literally the sounds of his emotion. Idk, i liked it.
I feel really bad now for liking it because everyone seems to hate it but I don&#39;t really understand why. :D
I love that album, one of the best in 2015
Hey needledrop, this what i think of Kid cudis new album <br>Cudi promised brand new sound that he never have done before and all the songs will be only written and produced by Kid Cudi himself. Cudi was always known for having dark depressed hip-hop albums but this time he said the album will have punk-rock in it most of the time. In early July 2015, Cudi stated: &quot;This album is 100% the purest form of my artistic self&quot;.He also added: &quot;I&#39;ve ripped my heart out and carved it into tiny pieces of musical madness‚Äù. Another thing he mentioned that album will be double disced so fans could expect around 20+ songs on the album. Finally on december 4th 2015 Kid Cudi released his album, before the release of the album he have dropped couple singles that belong to the album and they were okay 7/10 enjoyable to listen. After listening first couple songs of the album, I released kid cudi lost his mind and didn&#39;t care about his music as much as he used to. He tried to recreate dark old Nirvana sounds and dark lyrics about suicide. The sound he created wasn&#39;t enjoyable to listen whatsoever it was very messy, challenging and rough. I could only be able to somehow enjoy and listen 4/20+ songs that were on the album. Many musical critics hated this album and i agree with them 100%, some critics said this album is the worst album of 2015. I personally think that drugs destroyed kid cudi as an musician he used to be a cocaine addict, now if you listen to his album he mentions having shrooms and LSD trips during the making of this album and no wonder it sounded so bad. Maybe if he stopped doing drugs and started focusing on music like he did in 2009-2010 during his prime times when his albums and singles were leading musical charts then he could have some chances of creating high quality music. two of his the best albums were called Man on the Moon: The End of Day and Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager. Cudi mentioned that his last album will be called Man On the Moon 3 and that&#39;s my last hope for return of good kid cudi‚Äôs music, he always used to be one of my favorite rappers of all the time. I really want to hear how that upcoming album will sound like.
this new album from kid cudi is pure beauty <br>you just have to undestand it
&quot;Multi instrumentalist as well... It seems&quot; done
this guys fuckin nuts. this album was amazing.
whytf did this garbage get .97421 higher score than Im Gay Im Happy????
whats with the .94721???
i see that portishead record in the back bless
I wonder if this was a troll album
oh no he used real instruments, grab the pitchforks. srsly wtf
You always hatin&#39; on the Kid Cuddly.
Y&#39;all either haven&#39;t listened to cudi stoned or while tripping off a few tabs of lsd because that shit is great. Cud makes his music while high/tripping so it&#39;s meant to be listened that way
This album is an AIDS-infected dumpster fire and his ravenous fans eat it up
0.9721 rounds up to 1. You gave this album 1/10
This guy really thinks anyone cares about what he says because he took the time to do his homework on things. He thinks his opinion is valuable. This guy is trash, whoever even watched this whole video should probably do their own reviews and get this guy off YouTube
I know this is four months late, but hahahaha! please make a loop of the singing impression. it made my day........oh my. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=468">7:48</a>
I think he hit egotistical death
this album does suck bad
I dont see whats so bad about indicud lol
Franku
a bunch of people getting salty cuz we are listeners of rap who are judging a &quot;grunge&quot; rock album. Yes I listen to a lot of rap but Kid Cudi USED TO RAP. So no shit there are gonna be rap heads like me that are disappointed in this album. But I don&#39;t just listen to rap, I also listened to a TON of rock when I was younger. And by no standards is this shit good. I bunch of people are relating this to Nirvana when the only thing Cudi and Nirvana have in common are the messages they send in their music. Yeah not everything is perfect in grunge but that is the same for a multitude of other genres. Plus the execution on this album is piss ass poor. You can&#39;t really understand this album if you can barely understand what the fuck Cudi is saying cuz the mixing is god awful. The lyrics are half-assed and Cudi should have taken more time to learn guitar so he didn&#39;t just loop the same basic fuckin guitar riffs. I&#39;ve got nothing against anybody who likes this album but I&#39;m tired of the people who have shit against the people who don&#39;t enjoy this album.
nigga got a decimal üòÇüòÇ
&quot;The Nothing&quot; is the only listenable track on the whole album for me. That song is at least quiet, atmospheric and creepy and the echo/reverb on his vocals help mask his bad singing.
I finished listening and I feel emotionally drained. More like a speedin bullet 2 my head.
i just hit a stain fantano
Idk if you&#39;re into this but get high when you listen to this album Anthony. Makes it 100 times better...other than that it&#39;s trash.
You...he didn&#39;t even transition lol
0
Real Cudi fans hate they have to agree with this review, only the real ones tho lol
this album was better than mileys. it doesn&#39;t deserve a 0. a zero is a spit in the face to fans. this was close to that but it wasn&#39;t intentional. id give it a strong 3. yu just don&#39;t like kid cudi. for some odd reason because he&#39;s great. indicud deserves a solid 7. cmon now
Its so hard to see what happened to cudi and kanye
I just had a thought.<br>Coming from a rap fan, this review doesn&#39;t even summarise this album as much for me as it does for almost everything of the same/similar genre.
whoa, is this the first time he didn&#39;t say forever?
This review was so funny .
The way he was talking, he made it seem like he was finna give it a 2 or something lol
I disagree with this review completely I really liked this album and I would like to see another experimental style album by kid cudi
LOLOL ur title card and description just doesn&#39;t even try to hide how little of a shit you give about this album
I love how he talks like everyone who liked the old Cudi. He seems like he was a fan, but after all of the shit Cudi has come out with he realized... it&#39;s over. I miss the hip hop Cudi
got muself a neeew frien
&quot;Kid Cudi loses his mind.&quot; Best. Description. EVER.
&quot;can&#39;t wait for his next album&quot;
I personally love this album. You either love it or you don&#39;t. Simple as
Hopefully  Cudi grasps all the experimental stuff and  the new skills he is trying to learn and molds them into something Dope again.
bruh review wiz khalifa mac and devin go to high school  album<br> please
The album was less than a 0
is it wrong that I liked the first song? lol
I much as I love kid cudis music I really have to agree speeding bullet to heaven was pretty bad I think cudi could have done better than this
Cudi&#39;s next album is going to be a masterpiece.
&quot;Love&quot; was pretty damn amazing tho.
i actually fuck with the album heavy, some songs are ass but definitely some great songs on there
damn, had to break out the decimal system for this one
This album saved my life
he shoulda stayed on comedy bang bang
Hold up! The WZRD album is lit. I just got through listening to it in the past few months, and I like it. I definitely give it a B- because I do agree that his vocals aren&#39;t the most catching and the record can easily sound very monotonous which is why I didn&#39;t like Indicud. That&#39;s kind of his problem. He seems very monotonous musically.
INDICUD was gold...this dude&#39;s gay
THIS IS THE GREATEST ALBUM EVER. I HOPE YOU GO BALD
Indicud is actually okay, or some songs at least
I actually like this album, this review is quite inaccurate.
I love the album now it took me the second to really get into it
the hair cake. lmaoo
at this point I will always love kid cudi for what he did for me back in the days of &quot;man on the moon&quot; &amp; &quot;mr. rager&quot;, but yea this album is hard to listen to. its a bummer but hes gonna do whatever he wants at this point lol.
this guy knows nothing about Music then... Mr Rager was a Classic &amp; Speeding bullet was a masterpiece

Fuck you, WZRD, Indicud, and Sattelite Flight were fuckin dope
If Kanye made this everyone would be giving it a 10
Please live more life then you&#39;ll get it.... a compressor will stop you peaking the meter !!!!
If only all you knew hes going to fuck up the world with MOTM 3 this year. This album isnt even bad at all. Just because you think its trash it does not make it a trash album. Its just not for you. This album, as he has hinted many times on twitter, is very pyschedelic and should honestly be treated as such. The first time i heard it was sober and i still enjoyed it but on acid or shrooms, which scott even has a reference through beavis and butthead, is the true way to fully appreciate this album in its entirety. Like many of you im sure scott has had a major influence in daily life as he has mine. Just because this album isnt to your likings doesnt mean you shouldnt be expecting better music. Im also pretty sure he has said he wants motm 3 to be his last album and that he wont put it out until he has everyone he wants to work on it together. Imagine how hard hes going to fuck all of your minds when he drops that shit
I see Polaris in the background!!  PETE &amp; PETE SHAWTY!!!!
Run the runtano here
What indicud was by far his best album wtf are you talking about?
LOL this album was awesome.
I can agree that I&#39;m not a fan of this album. Confused is a decent song, but try as I might, I can&#39;t find any more that I like.<br><br>I did love Indicud though, so I can&#39;t agree with you there.
i love this album, and i can honestly say it didn&#39;t feel awkward and boring i liked how chill it sounds
Semen stains the mountain tops.
when the review gets more views than the actual album
I can&#39;t believe UMG actually released that garbage album.
I feel like you don&#39;t have what it takes to get the point of the album.
&quot;HANDLE WITH CARE&quot; the only track that&#39;s actually good on this album.
you&#39;re dumb
don&#39;t always agree with him but this was worse then a hot glass of ass
Indicud was a great album, Satellite Flight was alright, and then Speeding Bullet 2 Heaven was just... yeah. I know he wants to experiment, but he&#39;s been doing that for years now, so I feel like he should go back to what he was good at for Man on the Moon 3
No no nope no!
Huge Kid CuDi fan, but Indicud was super fire man fr.. I can&#39;t believe you skipped over it!! But I fucking hate this album. Worse album I&#39;ve heard fr...
what a DUCK!!!!!
Can someone explain to me why Kid Cudi is soo hyped up? I mean I was there when he dropped Man On the Moon and it was a decent album, but why is he considered like this amazing artist?
RIP Kid Cudi
Andre 3000 sent me here
You&#39;re absolutely foolish. Kid cudi is one of the new great faces of the psychedelic rock culture. Many  abstemious persons would feel the way you do.
I agree
I don;t mind most of the songs in there
I couldn&#39;t get through this video cause you&#39;re so fucking hard to look at. Consider releasing these reviews as audio only. Thanks.
This guy probably gets hard from the thought of Kanye&#39;s booty
Thats so awesome you have the Polaris album behind you!! Yeah I wasnt feeling the speedin bullet to heaven album much either. Great review though!! I know somewhere Cudi will pick it back up.
i listened to like 3 songs and quit. im sorry cudi i only have so much patience lol
I think this album is pretty cool this is how kid cudi always wanted to sound
I liked the singing, all the humming. I love how I can get into it
&quot;No more chicken sandwiches!&quot; I love it
It was the sheer and raw emotion that resonated with me. Any one Kid Cudi fan would agree this album has been one of the most open of all in terms of authentic feelings. Most tracks were good. I&#39;m just a fan,who can appreciate his music for what it&#39;s worth.
...forever?
Andre 3000 said in an interview with la Reid that speedin bullet to heaven was the beat album hes heard in a long time, you have to get it, Anthony you dint get it.
Wzrd and indicud were fucking amazing, that you got to experience something new that you don&#39;t really see a rapper go into, I admit his shit got weird but those two were nice.
you skipped satellite flight tho...?
i took very long to even finish listening to this Album there&#39;s a (few songs) i like on here but i just rather not bother to finish listening to this album he needs a hug or something. idk Cudi
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=117">1:57</a> damn lmao
just checked it out on Amazon and hadn&#39;t laughed so much since I first heard the Shaggs i,e on Nothing: eerie errie darkenss neary.
why should you &#39;have to&#39; review this cd if you could use this space for shedding light on something/ anything better?
Indicud was a jewel though.....
Lmao
He already went platinum in the rap game he&#39;s going for rock now
This video should of ended at 30 seconds
Drugs don&#39;t help you make good music? Have heard of the 60s??
If you don&#39;t feel something while listening to Wedding Tux, you are the Cigarette Smoking Man
Wish cudi would&#39;ve stayed off the drugs
Cudi needs to go back to G.O.O.D because I didn&#39;t even know he released an album...Cudi is a genius but in G.O.O.D Travis &amp; Vic Mensa are their new Cudi(neither has Cudi&#39;s talent but ya get my point). I still listen to Cudi but he needs to get back to working with Kanye because idk what&#39;s wrong with him, he seems to be on a dark path.
MOTM 2 mediocre? Now you&#39;re just being ignorant
why are ya always hatin&#39; on kid cuddly?
he is going to get over his shit like he did his hole life and come back.
&quot;no more chicken sandwiches, yes ill pay for the damages&quot; is supposedly him no longer having to live off  of that from mcdonalds and i guess he can pay for whatever she wants... I just thought i should throw that in there. Not really trying to defend or anything
I sort of liked the idea of this album and some songs are  not too bad. What I did find that in the lyrics he says some random Lil Wayne type shit and I think to myself &quot;Did he really say that&quot;. <br><br>Also the Album is way too repetitive, almost like a listening to 2 songs on loop 9 times. And whenever I sort of get into the mood and feeling he&#39;s trying to relay a stupid sketch pops up and completely fucks it all up. <br><br>I wonder if he did that on purpose to maybe convay his life in a weird metaphor kinda way?<br><br>Who knows, maybe in 20 years time we&#39;ll look back at this album and think it&#39;s one of the best albums ever created.... But I doubt it.
I want to listen to him sing and hear some decnt lyrics, but the instruments are unlistenable..
I had the misfortune of listening to this album out of curiosity from watching this video and I agree wholeheartedly with his review. Possibly the worst thing I have ever listened to in my life. If he thinks he can pass as an actual guitarist, he needs to go to a mental hospital, because this is a testament to why some people should never ever pick up a guitar. I hadn&#39;t listened to his stuff before, but if he was a rapper, I feel like he should be doing that instead of being a false rock artist. Someone revoke his record contract. He is quite simply the worst musician I have heard in years.
The album cover never ceases to make me die of laughter every time I see it. What is he even doing!!! He&#39;s just like &quot;aaaaaahhhhh succ&quot;
it doesnt matter what you say, the fact that you skipoed over indicud it &quot;mediocre&quot; and the fact is it takes a few listens of one song to really appreciate its beuty, song like you lack in the listening department. im glad you havent reached a million on this video because if i were kid cudi, the hard work, blood, sweat and tears in my music would be disgraced by you, im not even a die hard cudi fan, and i guess i shouldn&#39;t bash on you for your review, but godamn, is it even a review when you havent listened to the music itself
friend:is this album good? <br>me:<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=119">1:59</a>
hes right this was complete garbage. this coming from a cudi fan im scared for motm 3
The funny thing is that Satelite Flight is actually a pretty solid project
Listen to Indicud again that album front to back was dope as hell and I&#39;d say his best work seriously as far as this album goes it&#39;s terrible front to back terrible and it hurts because I love the dude and support him but it&#39;s a bad album that being said Embers was alright
Subscribing to theneedledrop honestly just makes me realize how big humans opinions differ. I like this album, some tracks are so real its insane. Speedin&#39; Bullet 2 Heaven hits me hard. I&#39;m down with this bald guy. The fact that he gives an artist&#39;s album a 0 just makes me wonder.
I like the album its just i feel like he rushed it a bit and it could&#39;ve been more organized and songs flow into each other but it was like slow then rock or whatever i mean its good but he should have made the beavis and butthead parts shorter and only be in like 2 songs but like they were too long and messed up if he took a little bit more time to have the songs fow into each other and cut the skits really short then it would have made the album 75% better i give it a 7
Am I literally the only one who likes it? At first I didn&#39;t like it and yeah it repeats a lot but I think it&#39;s ok. Not the best, but I somewhat enjoy it, I hated the bevis and butt head things but besides that
Punk rock I will call it. <br>A cult classic......
wtf did i just listen to...
This was by far the worst album i&#39;ve ever heard in my life. I&#39;d rather listen to EVOL by Future than this garbage. (Both are garbage.)
Wow you&#39;re a herb
Huh? I&#39;m so confused as to what he&#39;s trying to say about the album. This album saved me. This album is very deep. Don&#39;t come to YouTube for other people&#39;s opinions. Just listen to the album and add your input. Hey, everyone is entitled to their own opinion.
This fool has me crying! I used to like Cudi but after WZRD I just cant...
What is wrong with u Man U just don&#39;t know dude
I actually found the album to be hillariously bad. I say I&#39;d give it both a 10/10 and 0/10 therefore.
It&#39;s okay if this is isn&#39;t considered hip hop. But not even rock will accept this fucking garbage
I used to be a HUGE cudi fan but HOLY FUCK! this is complete fucking trash. Long live &quot;A kid named Cudi.&quot;
i kinda like the album but i love his opinion
best reviewer of all time.
Who the fuck doesnt like Indicud?
I loved Satellite Flight. Indicud &amp; WZRD were trash
This was hilarious. I&#39;m not supposed to laugh this hard with bronchitis
atleast 2/10
also I prob won&#39;t be looking forward to a relisten
the album was ok, coming from not a big cudi fan but the lyrics were dark but the voice was horrid
Enough of the real cudi fan bs..I&#39;ve rolled with cudi since the mix tapes. Speeding bullet to heaven just wasn&#39;t good, and I liked wzrd. Out of 18 tracks I liked only 1... Just because the fans don&#39;t like something doesn&#39;t mean they aren&#39;t fans...Hell real fans would tell you when your music isn&#39;t good.
People thought his ex, Amanda Bynes was crazy, she got her shit together and it&#39;s back on track; on the other hand, Cudi is trying too hard to be avant garde it broke his inner universe and tries stupidly to cashcow it. Get out of your delusions and be a legit artist Cudi!
This kind of made me cry
I agree that Speeding bullet to heaven isn&#39;t good at all, but Indicud was fucking awesome. WZRD had it&#39;s moments too. Nothing will ever top MOTM 1 &amp; 2 though, hoping he goes back to that feel.
10 thousand plus people agree with you and I am one of them. Surprised people are saying they like this album
his music logic is trash other than that this is his only true video
I assumed this review was being a little too harsh until I tried to listen to the album. I just turned it off. I enjoyed Kid Cudi&#39;s older stuff and hope he returns to that style.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=148">2:28</a> boss pls
Lol
Are u stephan bodzin?
I actually liked it, now I feel like I have a terrible taste lol
Speedin&#39; Bullet¬†2 Dodge
hahaha this guy is judging cudi? he needs to look in the mirror a little more often.
omg it&#39;s even worse than he says
Dude doesn&#39;t know what he is talking about. A guy that works on YouTube has no life
Shut the fuck up dude!!
He still a legend after that garbage album.
I&#39;m only gonna listen to this album just for amusement.
i love this album. it brightens my day every time I listen to it because it is so hilarious to hear him attempt the 90&#39;s grunge scene.
birth of the big fat goose egg
This is a cry for help
SMFH young thug&#39;s, justin bierber&#39;s and Travis scott&#39;s albumsgot higher rating but that&#39;s none of my business. I&#39;m pretty sure the reason anthony hates it it&#39;s because cudi tries to much to be &quot;punk&quot; and in some parts of the record is kind of annoying and poser-ish but cmon is not that bad imo. I think a few tracks like Handle with care, Trauma, Embers and insides out make up for the rest of the bad tracks... and if not then I guess artists gotta have some crazy production with pharrell or kanye to give a descent rating
I guess I&#39;m the only one who actually likes this album..
I dont think its that bad. id give it  2.5 stars out of 5
Do some shrooms and you will understand this album
Indicud had some good tracks and unique sounds.....bit of a shit generalization and bas review, just because you dont like it needle doent mean its bullshit. However the collab with WZRD was utter garbage.
Music is definitely subjective and I get that  but I think this one&#39;s a creeper. I&#39;ve given it a few listens now (commuting to and from work on my pushbike)  and it&#39;s pretty great imo. The first intro is way deep and, when stoned, makes me contemplate. &quot;Confused&quot; is awesome. That &quot;Teacher&quot; you were refering to is Mr Garrison......you&#39;d probably know that  if you followed pop culture more closely. Bevis and Buthead dropped magic mushies and Mr Garrison popped in for a cameo........MMMMK.........and it was awesome!  You also believe that drugs play no part in making great music? That&#39;s crazy talk.......where do I begin!...........Have you ever smoked a joint? I&#39;d argue that you might not be able to review music unless you were high on weed....you&#39;re being to clinical.
this album was dope to me
I think Satellite Flight is good as fuck
At least the album art is sick. Reminds me of shrooms and LSD
Speedin&#39; Bullet To My Head
worst album of 2015
I knew I would like the album because you hated it, the fact that you didn&#39;t like wzrd damages your credibility to me.
Lolllllll
Why am I the only one that thinks this album is fucking amazing? I guess I&#39;m crazy.
I cant really take this guy serious after he said &quot;the golden age&quot; by dizzy wright was average.
I dont know what is more funny here. your reaction to this album or the album itself. I honestly laugh many times when i played this album but i have a pretty sick mind. I guess i was more expected for Cudi to sound weird and whacked out after watching him on comedy bang bang for that season and this album felt like a IFC skit of an album form that went on too long. I give him props for going out and trying this but he over did it and should not go back to punk rock. he not good at it. honestly the skits to me are the best part and i think were the only thing that made last though this album. Much like Miley i think this is just more music from people who came in with a F it lets make some music high/rolling as hell and not care what comes out. that being said there were a song or two worth repeating (the intro track is a fun trippy mess but could have been cut in half) but no one should play the whole album unless its speaking to you in a way few will ever understand, god help those few people.
Kid cudi fans are like meek mills fans
He&#39;s completely right and it makes me mad
I&#39;ve heard a few Kid Cudi songs and I&#39;ve liked them. I listen to mainly instrumental hip hop and some rock music I usually have no real expectations. first time hearing it there were some songs I liked but I thought the album was overall a bad rick album. listening to it again I really like it a lot more than before but there are still some bad songs. I can see why people hate it; you like rap then this turns on, not everyone is a rock fan. In my case he should&#39;ve at least used a different name for this album. I recommend playing it on shuffle you&#39;ll enjoy it more
FUck u dude
Satellite flight is actually good. Indicud would be good if not for the beats. wzrd was meh. AKNC MOTM1 and MOTM2 are classics. This was DOG SHIT.
So..... You didn&#39;t like it?
The album is interesting, lifelong cudi fan, initially i was disappointed, confused +handle with care and the track speedin bullet 2 heaven are alright. Just go with it, he&#39;s experimenting, it&#39;s better than him popping xanax and rapping about how may bitches he fucked. Guy is a legend and always will be
I really liked indicud
There&#39;s like 6 tracks on this album that I find pretty good but fuck, I cant even think about hearing the other 20 songs on there without giving myself a headache. Bald glasses man is 100% right about kid cudi at the moment and I find it sad. But I think The man on the moon will be back soon.... I hope
MOTM 2 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; any album released in 2015
The entire album reminds me of a Salvia trip
ARE YOU DUMB INDICUD SOLD NEARLY 200,000 UNITS ITS FIRST WEEK
Old kid cudi needs to be back
Old kid cudi needs to be back
The only Review I Agree With You Needle Dropüëéüëé
Kurt Cobain would love this album. because he love weird shit.
most be fun laughing at people with mentality illnesses.
The Beatles made most there music on LSD. so yea drugs dont make good music.
You have to be high to listen to Kid Cudi. Trust me. Then, it&#39;s great. Not the new album so much or WZRD, but the rest, oh yes.
music critics have no talent of there own so they jugde others check out this fucken guy
I played this at 2x at it was still a little bit slow...
I really liked it
Am I the only one who thinks this album is Gold??????
take shrooms than listen to the new cudi album guarenteed better
i somewhat agree/disagreewith you being a cudder <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23fan">#Fan</a> i think everything was great he did and exceptional leading to sb2h which in my opinion was his worst the balance is this cudi loved it i did not the album is his to be a fan of i personally dont like it wzrd was good or at least better than lil waynes shallow rebirth but i still fucks with cudi my only exception in spb2h was embers and the single sb2h.
Wow iv&#39;e never seen him give someone a 0
In my opinion, this is one of the best albums of the year
you realise you called him scott at some point
Anthony&#39;s face in the thumbnail tells the entire story üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Props for having the Portishead Dummy album in the background. A true work of art.
If he looks happy in the thumbnail, the album is shit. If he looks angry, the album is good.
I wonder where Speedin&#39; Bullet to Heaven ranks on Fantano&#39;s worst records of all time. I&#39;m feeling a strong 9 on this being in Fantano&#39;s top five worst records of all time.
I thought the song confused was decent.  I fell like if this instrumentals of this album were given to someone with better song writing and vocals it would be amazing.
If this guy would it love it , all you fuckers would it love it :-)
Man, and a majority of you guys just say this stuff just because you choose to not see deeper meanings behind lyrics. Everything is just face value to you all. Just generic bigots.
I&#39;m not even sure if this guy has even created music or even produced. So what the point of listening to a NERD talk about music. Music meant to be felt, not analyzed. Seems like you people forgot how to listen to music in general, this doesn&#39;t just involve Kid Cudi. It&#39;s just sick to see people with so much passion to destroy other passion. This is just one reason why we have a fucked up society.
Can you PLEASE make a list of indie pop blogs cause I dont know of any and I really want to, this would be a huge help thanks a lot hope this finds you ... or if anyone in the comments know of a list help me out thanks PEACE.
Accept The Cudi into your heart.... He will show you the way!!!!!!!! <br>Surrender your false artists and wack rappers..BLESS YOURSELVES <br>ALL HAIL CUDDER
Ok I respect your opinion,( because thats all it is and so is mine) but I like the album but from a production level it just goes to show that music in general still has artist that can achieve success in the industry and plus if wasn&#39;t for a lot of Cudi&#39;s earlier work we wouldn&#39;t have some of the popular artist we have today. When you look at how Cudi is using the opportunity worked hard for to use everything he has learned in the game from start to now and do something artistic and confident. Im sure you can agree that a lot of today&#39;s popular artist couldn&#39;t do what Cudi is doing how he does it so effortlessly and fearlessly. I salute him for simply stepping far out there and music is art and art is to be perceived of one perception but thats just how I listen to music so it is what it is
Kid Cudi is exposing his range as an artist while everybody are waiting for MOTM3. I understand that and i understand Cudi. Overall his albums since MOTM2 have not been as good as his first two. Indicud and Satellite Flight are also good in overall sound and message for a cudi fan. For me that WZRD project  and Speedin bullet are too rock influenced and hard to listen. But both of these albums have two-three-four tracks i still can vibe to. I&#39;m just worried that once MOTM3 comes it isn&#39;t what a sad and lonely kid like me needs. Peace out
kid cudi at his worst. time to go back to basics.
Sick and TIRED of people hating on cud I this shit is not even bad
indicud was amazing dude wtf
I hated it too tbh
My nigga kid cudi gon damn lost his mind
My nigga kid cudi gon damn lost his mind
JC Fantano JC...lmao
Did he say &#39;Clunge music&#39;?
he lost me at the &quot;skipped over satellite flight&quot; part considering that album was extremely unique, original and just downright awesome
If you gave this a zero, why on earth did you give LULU A FUCKING 6?! THESE ALBUMS COULD BOTH GO HEAD TO HEAD AND LAST TIL ROUND TWELVE IN A COMPETITION FOR THE SHITTIEST ALBUM EVER MADE. But lulu had something artsy or whatever, right? If you can recognize the shit that is Speeding Bullet, you should be able to recognize the shit that is a Metallica/Lou Reed collab. Okay I&#39;m done
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23freeihe">#FREEIHE</a>
kid cudi was my coming to age artist back in freshmen year throughout hes my favorite artist and i appreciate the music many people shyed away from. but this album and the last album just werent good they didnt have that feeling of intrigue and adventure as his earlier work. and for the record i am not a cudi hater back when all there was was mixtapes and day n nite i burned dozens of kid named cudi cds to pass out cause i was that much into it i just hope Man on the moon 3 can be a return to form for cudder.
An album that drives grown men to tears... for all the wrong reasons.
What was the purpose of the Beavis and Butthead skits? Of all the terrible components on this album, the skits confuse me the most.
I usually agree with most of the stuff you say, however I have to say, this album is a masterpiece.
u obviously don&#39;t understand Cudi
this is my all time favorite album...
this review sucks dick
Guess I&#39;ll wait for man on the moon 3
I can see the portishead record right behind you, please review them! :DDD
After listening to a few songs first, then later a couple of full album listens on headphones this grew on me. If you only like hip hop you won&#39;t like it. But if you like rock and are a fan of Cudi it ends up being really cool. Some of the lyrics are very profound and the whole thing is pure honesty. Art isn&#39;t always to entertain, sometimes it just has to simply be expressive and reflect the artists emotion. As consumers we forget this, understandably. The mould of this album is just different in many respects. I give a strong 5 to a 7 for the album, and a 10 to Cudi for originality, being himself, and not wearing a mask and lying to the public to get air play and approval!
This album is shit i agree. But slating indicud and motm2? They&#39;re both so good
Music critics, what an ancient outdated idea. Its your single opinion, art is subjective
Listen man I love Cudi. I really do. But I couldn&#39;t listen to this album more than once. I couldn&#39;t take it. It gave me a migraine. I still blast albums like Man on the Moon 1 &amp; 2 and even Indicud. But I just can&#39;t get with it.
I really wish I could listen to, not just the entire album, but ANY one song all the way through. I can&#39;t. I rage quit. RAGE QUIT.
Smh I can&#39;t believe you make money from this shit lol
You need to be on a psychedelic to enjoy this album. Exit yourself, access yourself.
confused wasnt that bad that single itself would of made the album at least a 1 or 2 i think miley cyrus album put him over the edge
The album is best on shrooms
This album is awesome, Andre 3000 and Mike Shinoda from Linkin Park agree
Not gonna lie. I was a skeptic. It took me a while to realize this is by far the best album I&#39;ve ever heard. Now I just listen to the entire album, every song is masterful.
I cannot be mad at this review because he didn&#39;t shit on my favorite songs but still original punk rockers didn&#39;t know anything put three cords to use and suck at performing so this is a damn good attempt at rapper punk rock lil wayne rock albums were decent attempts it&#39;s just not for everyone
yo you are a hater. grow some hair. hairless bitch
I totally got what you were saying about the tracks being snippets of songs.I disagree with your opinions of his old music though. I really enjoyed MOTM2 and indicud. indicud had vibe and cool bars, I liked some of the features too.
How the fuck can you dislike this video? He&#39;s spot on! The record is truck juice
Ok, I&#39;m not big on YouTube but y&#39;all going to make me do a review on cudi&#39;s album bc this is ridiculous! And also, you don&#39;t have to be a die hard cudi fan to like the album. I hate it when I read, &quot; oh, you just like it bc you&#39;re his fan&quot; whatever! No, people have different taste in music, don&#39;t judge them for thier opinion about it. I mean, to be honest the only album I bought other than this album was motm. I only bought the new album bc I stopped listening to him for awhile, so I&#39;m not a &quot; die hard fan&quot; and also I didn&#39;t watch the reviews about it bc people have different taste and not everyone is going the like it the same. When I first listened to it, I was like uh, ok? Keep listening. So everyday I had at least 2 fav songs per day. I love this album so much and it&#39;s coming from &quot; a not die hard fan&quot;. Come on, edge of the earth, confused, man in the night, screwed, fade 2 red, adventures, the nothing, amen, handle with care, fairy tale remains, wedding tux, red sabbath, fuck I could go on and on of my fav songs. It&#39;s really good! Like, I swear I don&#39;t get it? Now, Miley&#39;s album SUCKS! Yes! That&#39;s a fact! I couldn&#39;t even give that album a second chance. I&#39;m a film maker so I only like songs if I could vision myself making the videos and throughout this whole album, I could make bad ass videos! But really, adventures.... Best song ever! The beat, just everything! Like, I can&#39;t believe all of these bad reviews. Smh....now I can say, I&#39;m a die hard fan! The album is awesome! My opinion! Sorry! :)
it was not that bad actually...
Speedin&#39; Bullet to My Head
Can somebody give me candy
I tried listening to the very first song on this album, &#39;Handle With Care...&quot; I got halfway through, laughed my ass off and just went back to this to comment on how TERRIBLE it is. Fuck, even Fetty Wap is better than him, and I&#39;m not even a fan of Fetty Wap!
I disagree, It&#39;s awesome
douchebag. what qualifications do you have?? none. this is your OPINION. you are just fishing for attention. and TALK ABOUT ANNOYING.... I cant even finish this video your voice is like nails on a chalkboard. Cudi is my hero he saved my life I have been listening to him since he came out and he is my all time¬†favorite¬†so yes I may be a bit biased but I am a true fan and I can accept the fact that he is changing and growing as an artist. His own problems with drug addiction have empowered me with my own recovery. He doesn&#39;t talk about bitches and money like every other¬†entertainer out there. He actually relates to his¬†fans. If you didn&#39;t like him since he came out with¬†Indicud then why did you even bother with the following¬†two albums????? Get a life.
Almost seemed like he&#39;s losing his hair talking about this album
Arguably the worst album dropped so far this decade. Man, what happened to Cudi? Never been a huge fan, but Man on the Moon and The Legend of Mr. Rager were both pretty good. He thinks he&#39;s being artistic, but he&#39;s just making terrible music.
A GOOSE EGGOIJSDFOIOF
Have some of these kid cudi fanboys actually know what alt rock sounds like? 
The only reason people had hope for the album (<a href="http://hnhh.co/sehsiu">http://hnhh.co/sehsiu</a>). Why hasn&#39;t Anthony reviewed Love by Kid Cudi? Even though the track was recorded while he was &quot;Sane&quot;, it gave people hope that maybe he hadn&#39;t gone completely insane.
Now i really dislike this guy and all professional critics in general. Horrible industry with a horrible mindset. However this album was just........ a unpleasant  surprise.
Like Cudi said flex on them haters, HARD
PortisHead
I fucking love kid cudi, new shit and old shit, watching this kinda annoyed me but it&#39;s what I expected cuz this album definitely was probably his worst one but TO ME and maybe a few others, it was still good. Some songs were good some were bad. There&#39;s no denying that this album is extremely fucking different than his other stuff but people don&#39;t give him enough fucking credit because most of these trash artist on the radio don&#39;t have an abstract mindset to dive into and experiment with new genres of music and new styles. Even he &quot;doesn&#39;t make good music anymore&quot; because he stopped fucking with hip hop doesn&#39;t mean you should call his new shit trash. Too me Man on the Moon 2 is the greatest album ever it&#39;s fucking great no doubt about it. He&#39;s an artist with a purpose with meaning. He tries to guide the young listeners of the world to not make the same mistakes he did and prevents them from dealing with suicide. Dont like him? Cool doesn&#39;t matter but he deserves some fucking respect.
Yep.  Yep.   ... Yep.
damnnnn
Been a die hard Cudi fan from day one, but man this album hurt. Indicud didn&#39;t quite seal the deal, but SBTH solidified the breakup. Unless he comes back with something great, I won&#39;t be coming back to him anytime soon.
All the people hating are hip hop fans. This album is ALTERNATIVE. A different genre for you hip hop suckers. If you don&#39;t like it then just leave it alone like damn.
u r a idiot
All you people defending this trash ass album should hop in my trash bin along with it lol talking about way ahead of its time. It&#39;s trash that&#39;s what it is, trash, ass, doodoo, shit, dog shit, horse shit, dirty diaper, land fill, Meg Griffin, ect.........
You remind me of someone I don&#39;t like.
Actually didn&#39;t like kid cudi till this album, huh
I like this album not going to lie. I love all his music
This album is basically a cave and you have to shift through all the rock and shit in order to find some gems. There are a few if you really listen and have an open mind going into this.
I can genuinely say that The New CALassic was better than this. Like as a serious album. It was better. In every way.
Best review yet
i really liked adventures, embers, wait, fairy tale remains and melting
this reminded me of gonjasufi I like it when I&#39;m not paying attention to it like a background noise for when I&#39;m playing games or reading or some shit. it sounds stupid but I like this noisey crap
I actually liked this album a lot...
Normally I would want to drag Anthony, but in this case, I have to agree.
I have a feeling he just doesn&#39;t give a shit and he has a really fucked up record deal on universal and he gets paid around the same regardless. I hope one day he gets a decent deal on fools gold or something and puts out some actual hip hop. Pretty sure he just did drugs with Cage and they are both on this weird punk rock drug shit.
A simple &quot;I didn&#39;t like it I don&#39;t think you will either&quot; would have sufficed lol
i just wana say that u are fuckin wildin saying indicud was horrible. that is all.
Please Kid Cudi, come back to hip-hop. we miss you.
This album sounds like the album cover.
kid cudi has completely fallen off tbh
Worst cd ever of his.
This dude obviously just listens to albums once and gives a review you need to let the record grow on you theres no kid cud album i dislike and this album since it started gave me a positive reaction to it and made me continue to listen theres more than just his vocals and instruments its his lyrics and style and if you don&#39;t like it fine whatever doesn&#39;t mean its the worst album giving it a zero isn&#39;t fare not everyone is going to like everything this world has to offer people are allergic to things other don&#39;t like things and theres people that due this dude is allergic to kid cud plain and simple and others who agrees with him is also i thought Indicud was a strong album i actually listened to it in my car over and over and over again so please do your self a favor and just don&#39;t listen to kid cudi ever he&#39;s albums don&#39;t deserve your negativity thank you
Aren&#39;t demos supposed to be for the special edition?
I&#39;ve accepted that Cudi (who I really like tbh) is hit or miss a long while ago. He likes experimenting, and that&#39;s awesome. If I don&#39;t like an album it&#39;s a safe bet he&#39;ll release a new one within a year that will go back to his original style.
Your reviews are friggin&#39; hilarious when you hate the album. I hope we get a couple more 1s next year.
I vibed with one track, but hey everything is relative. Someone prolly likes the whole thing who knows, If they do then hey they&#39;re on a different freq than me
I actually feel bad for people who bought this album.
HERE&#39;S AN ACTUAL REVIEW <a href="http://www.billboard.com/articles/review/6792578/kid-cudi-speedin-bullet-2-heaven-album-review">http://www.billboard.com/articles/review/6792578/kid-cudi-speedin-bullet-2-heaven-album-review</a> FROM A CREDIBLE SOURCE NOT SOME  RANDOM ASS GUY OFF OF YOUTUBE.
Keep in mind this is just MY opinion. To me this was a pretty decent album to me. It wasn&#39;t as bad as everyone else is saying to my ears. But everyone is different ya know. Soooo yea ^.^
I always come to this video for a good laugh üòÇüòÇüòÇ
My curiosity has gotten the best me...I&#39;m going over the top...cover me!
This album made me want to put a Speeding Bullet into my head and send me to Heaven
I&#39;ve never seen a naked mole-rat talk until this kid opened its mouth.
Jeez. Reading the comments, I think some people look at Cudi like their boyfriend and they have to support him no matter what he does. It&#39;s okay for people to have opinions that don&#39;t match your own and just because someone hates the album doesn&#39;t mean you have to.
Holy shit,..I haven&#39;t heard anything here yet, but it sounds like i need to go give it a shot...wish me luck people.
man, this shit was hilarious.
Haha, that was a good Beavis impression
he deadass said Indicud was trash so I already knew this review was gonna be shit
I&#39;ve never really listened o kid cudi, my mate told me he made a grunge album, told me to give it a listen. I thought, why not. It was sort of interesting, but like the three songs I&#39;ve heard weren&#39;t bad, they had a lot of potential but they always just felt slightly pretentious and like theres something missing or something there that shouldn&#39;t be. 6/10
i fw cudi heavy but I didn&#39;t like the album but music isn&#39;t something you can really judge it&#39;s probably a nigga out there that thinks this is the best album ever lmao
To anyone who finds this album to be disappointing, disturbing, lacking, garbage, etc. You are entitled to your own opinions, as I too had a hard time digesting it.... at first. But I listened to it a couple more times and I was really starting to actually enjoy it. It&#39;s gritty and edgy, yet touches on a darker maniacal  side that Cudi sort of hid up till this point. I&#39;m mean we all know Cudi still faces major issues about facing his fathers death, struggling with addiction, and depression. But this album really is eye-opening!  <br><br>See, this album wasn&#39;t created to please the masses. It wasn&#39;t created to please anyone. It&#39;s a form of expression. All you simple humans, who love mainstream bullshit are not going to understand it or like it. And what is the first thing people do when they don&#39;t understand something? They talk shit. Now don&#39;t get me wrong, I am not a fan of about half these songs which sound like incoherent noises. But that doesn&#39;t mean this album is bad.<br><br> The more you listen to it with an open mind, the more you see than what is just at the surface. Have any of you actually read over the lyrics to these new songs? They are actually very interesting and haunting! This album is a piece of art, and a piece of what is going on in his mind and heart. None of us were expecting something like this from him, and I&#39;m actually glad he released this. It&#39;s different and I commend Cudi for his honesty to himself.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=459">7:39</a> R.I.P headphone users
Yeah, after I first tried bout a song into the album since I haven&#39;t really listened to a Kid Cudi song ever and it is so awful that I laugh so hard to this. Thanks for making me laugh, Anthony.
Why are people so defensive over Kid Cudi? You like him? Good. Now go find someone giving the album a positive review. Calm down. -_-
I hate the fact that people are saying this is a good project, like how? this is the type of shit that makes hipsters lose their minds and prove to the world that we are wrong and that these types of projects are mater pieces whereas in actual fact it is simply proving that artists are losing there shit adn pull a stunt like this to bring the attention of larges groups of people and begining to discuss how  you can make this shit
Yea this album is pure trash. The return of Chip Douglas, that demo alone ruined any chance of me buying this album.
MY MOM PUNISHED ME SHE LOCKED ME IN MY ROOM AND PLAYED 3 TIMES THAT ALBUM :&#39;(
You&#39;re hilarious in this video, I love you xD
Ik look every here that hates the album, but look if youre a real kid cudi fan you have to respect that he tried to somthing new and people cant respect that. this album Wasnt probably the album we were expecting and meant for people who love punk rock and some aucoustic genre but people cant respect or support him that he wanted to do something a lil different. He was probably tired of doing the same shit and switch to a new genre. But we will wait and see its only one project that he fucked up on. Im pretty sure he will come back..
The New Calassic 3/10 &gt; SBTH 0/10
Kid Cudi still makes music?
HEY you gonna review that Portishead album back there? Do a classic on it.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=460">7:40</a> &quot;im gonna make an album, its gonna be a...ROCK ALBUM! im go neberebe
I thought Kid Cudi was a one hit wonder the first day I heard &quot;Day N Night&quot;.....Ever since then the only time I ever hear of him is because some garbage he released.
I like the polaris vinyl back there! :)
What&#39;s the hissing noise in your videos? I don&#39;t think it&#39;s my headphones (I have the same headphones as you lol). Oh well
That was really funny. I wish James Rolfe AKA Angry Video Music Nerd was doing music reviews too. What would he say about this album? Dear Lord!
I thought this album was creative and artistic excellence, you musically illiterate folks can&#39;t hear shit like we artist can so I understand where yall come from when calling it trash haha!
I love the shit out of a few sonngs on this album and it can get really deep. I also enjoy his erratic, disconnected nonsensical lyrics. im not even a cudi fan. Good shit imo 7-8/10. have any of you ever listened to the Butthole Surfers? syd Barret? Both brilliant misunderstood artists. If the two collabed (BHS and SB), this would be their album.
The only decent tracks to me were the title track and Wedding Tux.
Way better than to pomp a blutterhigh
opinions are opinions. anthony is one of the most honest and thorough critics I have ever seen. if you don&#39;t agree, that&#39;s fine, just remember that just because you don&#39;t like somthing an artist has done, doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re not a &quot;real fan.&quot; just be honest with yourself and what you listen too.
The return of Chip Douglas demo is seriously laughable, it&#39;s just that bad
YOU WORE THIS SHIRT IN YOUR MILEY REVIEW. THIS IS YOUR &#39;IM ABOUT TO ETHER THIS ALBUM&#39; SHIRT
I thought the album was decent.
What a fall from grace for one Kid Cudi
I loved cudi&#39;s first album and his mixtapes before it. everything he has released after is just trash lol
It only sold 15k...Let me sip this tea real quick
indicud album is agreat album tf u talken about
nope...your sooo wrong
album reviews never make sense to me. ok, this guy didn&#39;t like the album why do we have to hear about it? the worst part is when people listen to reviews like this before listening to the music. they go into the record expecting to hate it, that&#39;s what these videos do, they promo hate. the fact that you said motm2 was bad just shows you&#39;re not a fan of the guys music. so why review an album you know you aren&#39;t going to like? just seems like a publicity stunt to get views and use your awful jokes. you&#39;re shitting on the artist who you&#39;re using to get a rep for yourself. pathetic.
By far the best Fantano review ever. This review is fantastic.
Lol its ok Anthony ik your pain
how the fuk did he not like WZRD album or Satellite Flight, if you never got into The WZRD Album your are Definitely not gonna like this album.
yeah this was pretty awful
I don&#39;t know what&#39;s worse, this or K-Pop
damn so many people out here just trash talking like just chill , if you got nothing good to say dont say anything
you probably listen to taylor swift you fucking ignorant piece of shit.
This album is great.
Who else started dying at Anthony&#39;s cudI impression ?! üòÇ
Kid Cudi is like Shia Labeouf except 4000x more worse
If this doesnt get at least a 8/10 im killing you man
Im crying XD
i loved cudi&#39;s music so much bit this √°lbum is absolute trash!
Unlistenable ??
This review is shit in a can
Kanye...get ya mans. He&#39;s bugging...the songs go nowhere.
I thought this video would make me heated, but it left me laughing. I actually respect this review. <br>Sorry, Scott. Take your biggest L yet.
does anyone else think that the project really just sounds like 90&#39;s rock except with kudi as the lead vocals...maybe Im just not well versed in the best 90&#39;s rock ... but form what Ive heard thats with this is an homage too
I&#39;ve disliked Cudi since the Nardwuar interview
so I did some research...people think this album is punk, what the fuck???
Cudi fans being SHUT DOWN in the comment section
just listened to the full album........ holy shit, this is straight up garbage
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=457">7:37</a> Don&#39;t scream like that again...almost fucked my speakers up.
This review is shit in a can.
This shit is just bad. His ego is so big for some goddamn reason he wont change either. He fucking sucks ass now
i listened to it and it IS BAD but a 0? wow. ha
DAYUM. How do you really feel about it though
i actually liked adventures... bcuz it was the only song that felt even a little hip hoppy
Speedin Bullet To Stage 4
POLARIS RECORD HEY SANDY  FTW
this album is the Manos: The Hands of Fate of music.
I was thinking why kid cudi what are you doing but the I realized he made a bad record on purpose to show everyone he is going to make the music he wants to and no one can stop him kinda clever if you ask me but that&#39;s my theory
I bet 1,000 bucks that MOTM3 will be trash
You as a person should review the way you say things. no human being should have to listen to this, as a person he can express himself the way he likes and wants. you need to find respect within yourself
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=460">7:40</a>-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=471">7:51</a> = solid gold.
Dam he made cudi seem like straight trash
Thanks for being one of the majority who hate the album, but one of the SELDOM who had at least a few positive things to say about the album. As someone who doesn&#39;t agree with the B&amp;B skits and only a couple of the songs but loves a lot of it, I appreciate you being professional enough to give this project some props. Haven&#39;t found another person who likes this album as much as I do yet, prob never will.
Why do I get the feeling that Kid Cudi is trolling hard with this album!? I mean it is badly mixed, poorly written lyrics, unbearable vocals and no structure or meaning whatsoever. If he was intentionally trying come out of his comfort zone and do something completely new that musically puts him in a different direction, he needs to learn how to compromise. Don&#39;t forget why your fans enjoyed your music in the first place.
When I first listened to this album, my first, immediate thought was that it seemed like something people would listen to if they were legitimately considering killing themselves.
... At least he&#39;s better than B.o.B
I like cudi. but this album was the worst album I&#39;ve ever heard! for the love of god cudi! RAPPPPPPP!
I like cudi. but this album was the worst album I&#39;ve ever heard! for the love of god cudi! RAPPPPPPP!
but indicud is actually good?

I HAD to come here after I saw Big Quint‚Ä¶.
you shouldve just stared right into the camera and said for five minutes
Day N Nite.....wha wha.....
Nice Polaris album on the shelf
&quot;Oh you have to have an acquired taste, an open mind, and you need to be on the same level as Cu...&quot; No shut the fuck up. This shit garbage juice and you need to stop lying to yourself.
I honestly liked the first half of the album, demo tracks were a little wack though..
You know the review is right, if all the angry comments read like &quot;wtf is tHe best Album ever yall just no understand&quot;.
obviously this guy doesnt understand music
Haha takes the hair cake ! i c what you did there
&quot;Only when ur on drugs will u like this album. DO NOT listen to this sober or u will have ur guts out of ur ears&quot;- kiD cUdi
This album is horrible! That&#39;s a Snapple fact. But in all seriousness someone should check up on my man cudi. He seems like he&#39;s going on a downward spiral
I threw up laughing while watching this after hearing a snippet of confused. I literally threw up on my new carpet!
This is the first review you do that i 100% agree with
I do agree with Fantano that as a whole the album is terrible, but as a kid Cudi fan I find myself enjoying some songs on it and rocking out when I&#39;m in the mood... For example &quot;Adventures&quot; makes me feel like I&#39;m in a badass spy movie or some shit
Fantano seems genuinely angry at Cudi for making him listen to his album...
harsh.
&quot;No more chicken sandwiches, I&#39;ll play for the damages&quot; ... My next Instagram caption
blame it on the drugs..
i rate this album a strong no more chicken sandwiches/10
My favorite part is when he says HMMMM or AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW.
This album is the kind of shit they play at Hot Topic
lmao his bevis impersonation was on point
Now I KNOW this is gonna be good
i find the review funny but he isnt giving a few of the tracks enough credit like: Embers, Speedin Bullet 2 Heaven and especially Trauma
The Beavis and Butthead laugh KILLED ME
This album is good. Fuck is this guy talkin about
to me, this album seemed like an ironic take on rock stuff he likes (which is probably somewhere in between entry to mid level, but he probably recognises this) especially with the beavis and butthead &quot;critique&quot;. and to be honest, he probably just smoked too much pot and though this is going to be edgy. hey mayn, fuck it, i&#39;m doing a rock album, then he cracked himself up with the awkwardness of it and went along the ride. theres a lot of bedroom fuck you snot-punk that resembles to this, but cudi has the possibility to just go to a good studio. i&#39;d say 10/6.5 trolling, it&#39;s totally garbage, pointless, but i think i get it and it&#39;s funny. ALSO LOOK AT THE COVER its a fucking meme boys :&#39;)<br><br>edit‚Ä∫<br>oh, and this comes from a guy who heard like 4 songs from cudi before + i loooove really bad music.
To all these dudes on here giving cudi album. It&#39;s creative. Do some drugs and you will understand this
Damn, guess Cudi is just a Speedin&#39; Bullet to Heaven at this point
&quot;Moooahmuuooh.&quot;<br><br>                   -Kid Cudi
KiD CuDi is definitely a terrible artist. I like a lot of his stuff. But he&#39;s bad.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=405">6:45</a> i disagree with, i think that the low quality of the music emphasises cudi&#39;s messages that he&#39;s trying to communicate. musically, i hate the album i cannot listen to it and enjoy it but i understand it, and him, and i respect it fully
I actually  have to agree with you on this album. it was...... no bueno
THAT FUCKING RATING IM DYINNNNN
I hate u
This album is terrible.
half the songs sound like it was made in the bathroom and the mic is in another room. Holy shit edge of the earth was a mess the album is trash
That album cover though.
LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! a 0! LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Speedin&#39; Bullet to the Clearance Section
indicud was dope
kid kudi new album fucking sucks now, nothing but shit, sounds like a drunk dude moaning over a microphone, nobody wants to hear him moan all day like he got poked in his ass, used to be one of my favorite artist, fell off harder then vanilla ice, u ain&#39;t a rocker u sound stupid as fuck on this album. I agree with this dude, don&#39;t waist your money, your gonna pay to hear a guy fuck around in a studio
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=457">7:37</a> yuKON NAAAAHT
Geez, Indicud was my favorite album of all time
This album wanted me to put a speeding bullet to my head
possibly the worse album of 3546
hey Anthony, you should review Andy Mineo&#39;s &quot;Uncomfortable&quot; next.
inb4 cult classic
guys its pretty bad, even bigquint couldnt sit through it
the beginning of his vids are so funny.
Kid Cudi is boring, can&#39;t sing and should stay in his lane and for him to experiment with other genres makes me want to kill myself.
it&#39;d be cool if you touched on the album covers in some of your reviews
lol omg this is so funny
I feel like for this album 1st u have to be a fan 2nd u have to be the type of fan his music speaks  to and 3rdly you have to at least listen to the lyrics because there&#39;s alot of gems in this album I actually really enjoy it
where id you get that rainbow sweater? i want it!
Attempt to listen to this album.....commence...
No nope no no -Anthony Fantano
Kid Dudi
i don&#39;t doubt the record sucks but......i love that artwork
I have officially found a person on YouTube who picks music apart like I do. I don&#39;t know where you have been all my life, but you&#39;re my new favorite.
This is the funniest thing in the internet
i am a die hard kudi fan, but this is shit, this album is absolute garbage and I am happy that I did not pay for it. The FBI could use this album for interrogation purposes
Kinda annoyed everyone&#39;s bashing it if you are a true fan u will stand by whatever an artist puts out if u believe in the artist that&#39;s where the problem is you&#39;re all saying aww he&#39;s gone grunge he isn&#39;t a rapper which he&#39;s said from the jump if u listen to his music instead of just skimming through it as Jay z would say lol. But that&#39;s the problem he&#39;s an artist and if u truly love music you&#39;ll feel his music but that&#39;s just my opinion and I feel as if this is something Kanye dipped his toes into with 808s but everyone bashes that too which is also a beautiful album ppl are just kinda closed minded and won&#39;t listen if it ain&#39;t catchy...
stop lying to yourselves. I listen through even the most terrible albums. This...I cut off half way through disk 1. Bevis and Butthead wad the album&#39;s highlight
U ALWAYZ HATIN ON DA KID CUDDLY
Okay, I haven&#39;t read any of the comments, I only watched the review a few weeks ago.<br>I just tried listening to this album cus I didn&#39;t really believe the negative HYPE from this video. <br><br>Conclusion: Kid Cudi put this out as a complete joke and is trolling the world.<br>Either that or he really did lose his mind and is in some sort of psychotic state.
If you put on a Future album and intend to hear lyrical hip hop, you&#39;ll come away thinking it was shit. This isn&#39;t a hip hop album. It&#39;s really not that bad of an alternative rock album.
MY RECYCLE BIN IS RUBBIN ITS HANDS TOGETHER LIKE BIRD MAN WHEN I DOWNLOAD THIS KID CUDI ALBUM
His music is good stop hating
I&#39;ll listen to it b/c why not. I usually get a good laugh out of bad records.
First zero ever?
I love you anthony, this review was hilarious.
i wouldn&#39;t blame drugs for the outcome of this album
interesting to finally see what the polar opposite of a perfect 10 album is
im about to listen to this album im scared.....but fuck it im going in
Kid Cudis new¬¥s album is not for personality like you. Thats all about youre mindset and experience. Ok, tracks are¬¥nt musically perfect but like a complex sounds dope.
It has it&#39;s wack songs and it sounds like he was just trying something new without having a complete background of the genre but a lot of the songs are really well written for him being a rap artist. Cudi always wants to experiment with things no one else is doing as rappers, and I think that&#39;s exactly what this album was.
This album sounded like it was written by an angsty 12 year old who is 2 deep 5 u
cudi should put more effort into quality instead of shitting out content,the problem is he doesn&#39;t have as strict producers to give constructive criticism.
Worse than Miley Cyrus?
marijuana is the best song
im feeling a -2 to a light -1 on this thing
I don&#39;t listen to Cudi but it sounds like he fucked up lol
Indicud is awesome!
To be honest though this is an incredibly bias review because you admit you never was into cudi&#39;s music. If you didn&#39;t like man of the moon 1 or 2 you definitely not going to like his more alternative music imo. <br><br>The album was alright. I like a few songs off their. I know Man On The Moon 3 will be what everybody is wanting. <br><br>Confused, Angered Kids, Worth, Fairy Tale Remains are the best songs on Speeding Bullet 2 Heaven.
I was looking forward to this album from songs like Confused, Wedding Tux and I was disappointed that Love wasn&#39;t on the album. The album is too long for only five songs to be listenable. Cudi has a problem with releasing these long project for full price and he knows that dick-riding fans will buy it. I bought it; I regret it. A huge portion of Indicud and the entirety of Speedin Bullet should have been free. Satellite Flight was actually enjoyable.
is this his first &quot;0?&quot;
thats a pretty good beavis impression anthony, maybe it&#39;s time to consider a career change.
Loving your Music From The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete vinyl in the background.
I kekked so hard when he started singing like CuDi
I&#39;m really want to like Cudi.. But he&#39;s making it very hard for me...
this album is killing me
Cudi fans be chugging the Koolaid..
IM SO WEAK...HE SAID A ZERO
the polaris album in the background &lt;3
Big fan of Cudi... I heard it... got high... heard it again and I don&#39;t wanna get high anymore. I&#39;ll just chill on the MOON.
Damn, I&#39;ve never seen Anthony say a album is straight up trash.
Why even review it? We know you don&#39;t like kid cudi already üòÇ
In my opinion Indicud was his best album.
Crying at the rating üòÇ
You lost all credibility when you said MOTM 2 was mediocre. WZRD and Indicud both were good albums yo. SBTH and Satellite Flight were trash but that&#39;s it.
I can&#39;t even call you a hater bro..you sounded genuinely hurt too. lol
Indicud is one of his best album
Kid Cudi is original, u just have different taste.
I understand that some one doesn&#39;t like this album it&#39;s personally my least favorite but it&#39;s not as bad as you say I feel like your overreacting and you saying MOTM2 is how could you say that !!
yeah most cudi fans are potheads that just goes along with whatever cudi says.
surprised he gave a review for this considering what he did for &quot;indicud&quot;.
I&#39;m from Cleveland and¬†i¬†listened to Kid Cudi since he made that first mixtape. I loved his first album and I was so happy that me made a man on the moon 2. after listening to motm2 I legit haven&#39;t even tried to listen to his other music. he fell off too bad and now after this review I will not listen to anything besides the old cudi I did like
I give this guy a Zer0 out of 10 in album reviewing skills
Has this little bitch ever gave good review about any album?
aaaaand irrelevant :)
Kid Cudi&gt;Justin Bieber
Can you review Stream of Nonesenseness by Average Rap Band please!!
wild guy! indicud was &amp; still is amazing
They&#39;re really are some solid tracks on the album honestly. Still a lot of it was just awful. He just tried to hard pretty much and his demo&#39;s suck. But given that this guy just didn&#39;t really care anymore then yeah it was great
Well since the guy literally went off his rocker when he made the album. It&#39;s phenomenal
This review matched with that fucking goofy album cover in the back make it so much better.....
lmao this is one of the most entertaining review youve done
he cleary isnt a cudi fan bro even said hes doesnt like his music lol
i like about 11 of the tracks not bad if u ask me if your a cudi fan this album shouldnt seem like a new thing hes doing if u can recall the wzrd album i myself enjoyed wzrd
A head full of dreams 11/10
I laughed watching this review, sorry cudder :(
He is not a rapper anymore, he said it himself he&#39;s alternative, btw i&#39;m not defending him because i didnt like it myself.
I don&#39;t understand LOL? I enjoyed the album
Indicud was his best
He did a good Bevis lol not bad at all
hes been horrible since leaving kanye.
I like kid cudi, but even I can&#39;t deny that this isn&#39;t his best work. I do see the change he&#39;s trying to make, and I know he&#39;s been going through a lot. But I can&#39;t really enjoy this album fully. Confused and Wedding Tux seem to be the only few good ones for me at least
Lol now i Just have to listen to this album!
I&#39;ve been a big fan of Cudi since Day and Night. Actually really enjoyed all of his tracks he&#39;s put out there. Satellite Flight is my most listened to album according to my iTunes. <br>SB2H is alright, I like around 5 tracks in total. But his music is almost like his journey or his story rather than just putting out hit tracks for the charts. I do agree though its rather a depressing album and i cut out the Beavis and Butt-Head parts out lol, don&#39;t really get that bit.<br><br>Favourite track maybe... Handle With Care
most is true i feel theres a method to CuDis madness AKNM MOTM MOTMII INDICUD seem related SF is a segway to new worlds like WZRD and now SB2H only to come full circle for MOTMIII<br><br>at least <br><br>i hope
He talks about really technical things when he reviews music i find. I never hear him talking about the lyrics or the perspectives and stuff when I feel that rap touches me on a deep level. Maybe because he can&#39;t relate to them idk.
I like how your ratings don&#39;t deal in absolutes. If they did, a 0 would be a completely blank record and a 10 would be music that makes the entire world cum and burn all other artist&#39;s records every second of listening and nobody cares about those two options in reality so yeah, good job on the reviews!
can&#39;t agree, I think Cudi put out a pretty honest record. maybe not for everyone, maybe not the most intricate of albums. But it&#39;s all him
Just an upcoming musician I can&#39;t give up <a href="https://soundcloud.com/martinmatterz/improv">https://soundcloud.com/martinmatterz/improv</a>
&quot;YOU ALWAYS HATING IN THE KID CUDLY!&quot;
but does it sound better if your high?
i came here to find new music and what i got was a great video... smh fantano unsubbed forever
Damn! Never seen Fantano so pissed lol.
biblical fail
I really got into Cudi&#39;s music a few months ago, and when I noticed his new album on Spotify I was excited, after giving most of the songs a quick listen, I didn&#39;t really like any of it ( Except the song Speedin&#39; Bullet To Heaven itself which i thought was pretty good). I suppose the album just wasn&#39;t what I was looking for, maybe it&#39;ll grow on me.
Stop laughing at someone whose obviously fucked themselves up you sad and sadistic potato of a man
y&#39;all really don&#39;t get the album at all!
I&#39;ve always liked Kid Cudi and every time he shits on him, I feel a slight pain in my body
Never thought I&#39;d see this coming. Miley Cyrus review was more savage, but I guess this record was so bad that it actually broke Fantano.
New low is set. Gonna have to start dipping into negative numbers for some of these whack artists
This album was fucking terrible idk why ppl can&#39;t deal with other ppls opinion
Erykah Badu loved this album. Erykah Badu CANCELLED
this was a shitty album, face it. all you cudi stans saying &quot;you won&#39;t understand this album because it&#39;s cudi doing what he wants and it&#39;s his music&quot; well if he wanted to make music for himself then he should have never released this album. cudi can make whatever music he wants but he really didn&#39;t think of his fans AT ALL with this album. he should&#39;ve kept this to himself
REVIEWS THE CHRIS BROWN ALBUM LOL!!!!
At the end of the day cudi makes music for people with a mental illness. He is cable of calming down anxiety and depression and even suicial thoughts. Although his songs may not sound pleasant in sb2h it really does have a lot of meaning
FUCK YOU UGLY MIND CLOSER, CUDI ROCKS.
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
This dude never likes any album
wow wtf terrible review
I miss the old cudi
I&#39;ve always been a fan of kid cudi. and no matter how many times he changed his style I actually liked it right up to satellite flight. but damn this album was so fucked I was disappointed af. He went rock I was like ok koo I&#39;m a fan of rock too see what he does but it was just disgusting I waited for this bs all year -_-
I don&#39;t know why he&#39;s bashing the album so bad, this album is made for people who have done psychedelics and can relate to the feeling you get when you&#39;re on them. I kind of look at this album like I would look at mac millers Run On Sentences Volume 1, its not bad its just different from the norm.
I want to defend Cudi... But the album is pretty bad
review floating points&#39; new album plzzzz
FUCK YOU BITCH
you should review The &quot;Preacher&#39;s Son&quot; album by TUT
I&#39;ve never seen fantano hate an album do much lol
I just listened to a few tracks and it&#39;s not great by any means but not THAT bad. It seems there are just a lot of hip hop kids freaking out because one of their heroes has made a weird, noisy rock album.
Literally one of the lamest albums ever made...
If you aren&#39;t the same age, or around the same age as Cudi, you probably didn&#39;t grow up listening to the same sht we did. We had Korn Nirvana Bush Pumpkins Green Day. This album is all that. It&#39;s punk it&#39;s grunge it&#39;s personal it&#39;s all that I grew up on and miss and love.<br><br>This album isnt for you, its for us.
NO MORE CHICKEN SANDWICHES, YES I&#39;LL PAY FOR THE DAMAGES .... if you really knew Cudi&#39;s content then you would recall that he states in &quot;Is There Any Love?&quot;  (the song he did with Wale a while back) a lyric that, I Believe, related to the chicken sandwich reference... &quot;You get McDonalds, forget the sirloin. hatin&#39; my mackin, they askin&quot;
Stfu you don&#39;t know anything about music. Cudi is great you just don&#39;t know you
Holy shit, been jammin to the man on the moon since my middle school days. And I must admit... Wtf is this abulm.. Like I thought Nothing or Bullet to Heaven were okay. But wtf.. I really enjoyed Satellite Flight. So I guess I was just expecting something different. Cause this wasn&#39;t..... Good.
Ok people don&#39;t understand. Cudi purposely made his album sound like his shit. This sound represents his sanity at this point in his life. He can&#39;t even go on tour cause of how mentally unstable he is.
I listened to a few songs...<br><br>Holy shit. I don&#39;t know what that was, I don&#39;t even know how to classify it.
WZRD IS THE BOMB...
30 seconds? Took me less than 10 to hear this was some WZRDesque rock guitar bullshit.
Hey Anthony, you should give the sunny album by hippie sabotage a listen.
I hate when people say &quot; I miss the old cudi&quot; sorry but this is him. he is evolving as a artist. I personally love this album. this is like my 3rd favorite album.  even that is good. I love every song he has made. I&#39;ve never heard a song of his didn&#39;t like. realize that the &quot;old&quot; cudi is still the Same person.
The  song adventures was really fucking good!
This album&#39;s helping me get through life just as much as A Kid Named Cudi and MOTM: II did. I actually can feel Cudi&#39;s pain Anthony, you have to have actually cared for and related to his art throughout his whole career to understand why he even made this album. This album actually makes me happy knowing that he&#39;s steering away from what everyone&#39;s so used to hearing in today&#39;s society.
I don&#39;t understand how people can&#39;t enjoy this or at least respect/ appreciate what it is. This is CuDi in his rawest form, letting out these deep, inner emotions and it&#39;s an honour that he wants to share that with his fans. It&#39;s sad to see that he has received so much hate for deviating into a place where not many other artists would dare. All of his albums have had an effect on me but this album makes me, as a fan, feel closer to CuDi than any of his previous work.
got the Polaris album in the back awesome..
Seems like you might hate this worse than Instant gratification. that kinda makes me happy
its not there to listen to as music, its there as an adventure, a trip. Its more than just music and that&#39;s all anyone is viewing it as
This is the funniest thing to watch in a very masochistic way.. sorry to be laughing at your pain Anthony lol
Just listened to this piece of shit this morning.<br>It didn&#39;t feel as long as <i>Miley Cyrus and Her Dead Petz</i>, but Jesus. I think this heap of refuse is <i>even worse</i>.<br>Without question one of the worst experiences I&#39;ve ever had.
Whats with terrible album covers this year?
lames love you fantano. this review was perfect.
some people bore me so fucking boring
This vid was classic! Now that&#39;s how you keep it real about some bullshit toilet worthy music!
SBTH&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;TPAB
This was a terrible album, but I don&#39;t understand why he&#39;s so mad lol
You guys need to do more drugs
fu*k you!!!
Yes!!!!! FUCKING YES!!! Thank you! This was complete garbage. Thank you.
On behalf of Lupe the GOAT, <br><br>Fuck Kid Cudi.
Kid Kudi is a hero! The Album&#39;s not a zero!
i feel like mike judge is just trolling us. Like for real, just REALLY listen to these sketches.
i was never the biggest cudi fan but this album only appeals to me because it reminds me of tony hawk and just brings me back a little, its a weak attempt of a rock album but i wouldn&#39;t say its the worst album ive heard but ehh
it was garbage loooool
Cudi said it himself, if you&#39;re a fan of his old music. That you shouldn&#39;t listen to this. I&#39;m pretty open minded about my music. And I&#39;m in the middle with this. It isn&#39;t his best. But it&#39;s not trash in my opinion at least. He warned his fans. I think you&#39;d have to give him some credit for that.
I LOVE YOU NEEDLE DROP SHOUT OUT HAIR CAKES
this is not as bad as miley&#39;s.....
i think its not for everybody&#39;s ears i think its a great album i listen to it everyday.
what an amazing album
this exactly
Takes about three listens to feel the vibe that cud is putting across. Maybe I&#39;m too much of a fan but I dig it
this guy doesn&#39;t like Beavis and Butthead!? lol now i know his opinion is invalid
ROAST
When I hear this guy lambasting interesting and difficult but ultimately great albums like this and (Miley&#39;s latest) I am deeply puzzled and a bit disturbed. To make sense of this I remember what almost all Macklemore songs sound like to me and imagine that this is how these albums sound to him. I predict he will retract these type of opinions within 6 years.
kid cudi loves hair cake
Fuck you needledrop
i liked indicud :x
I felt the same for Cal&#39;s mixtape.
Give me a week and a professional studio and I am absolutely positive I could make an album better than this. It&#39;s that bad.
This is one of those rare times TND goes all<br><br>Nintendony Nerdtano
you just don&#39;t get it Butthead, you just don&#39;t get it
I actually liked &quot;Adventures&quot; i just hated the beeves and butthead skit
This boy cooked
Bruh im in tears this is so funny üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ, i think we were all fans of Kid Cudi in 07-08 good times...
its a reflection of himself tbh.
I feel like Fantano just gave the people what they wanted to hear with this review. Im pretty sure this nigga been listening to this album on repeat cause it really wasnt all that bad, it takes a few listens to sink in and appreciate, and this nigga smarter than that
opp I lost interested in this video with in 5 second
And this is the same guy that talked so much shit about What a Time to Be Alive, and then makes the worst album of the year...
i cant believe he actually gave him a zero. i am ROFL&#39;ing
lol indicud was good
been a huge Cudi fan since &quot;A Kid Named Cudi&quot; i have favorite tracks from MOTM 1 and 2, WZRD, Indicud, and Satellite Flight. Yet i couldn&#39;t manage to find one single re-playable track on it i am not sure if he is running out of ideas but this seems lazy,self indulgent and moreover a waste of fans money IMO!
cudi doesn&#39;t do drugs anymore that&#39;s why his last few projects are lack luster
I miss MOTM Cudi so fucking much. This album is pure torture to try and listen to. He&#39;s gone forever.
speeding bullet to the trash can
i listened and loved cudi  through all of it day n night, king wizard, the prayer &quot;which spoke to me&quot; and many other of the great songs that speak to all of us and we can vibe to.. even satellite flight was okay but i was soo excited to hear his new album and one i heard it i almost cried .. i want my &quot;big brother&quot; back
Kid Cudi and Kurt Cobain are the same person now, they merged in a 50c shop on 7th, all the best bits fell into a red holdall that nobody bought.
damn this is why i love theneedldrop he&#39;s soo passionate about music like wow he was soo mad at cudi like if he betrayed knew him, ur the best dude
Now i really want to listen this record
He&#39;s got some great tracks on this &quot;wedding tux&quot; and &quot;fuchsia butterflies&quot;<br>&quot;Embers&quot; and a couple others,I believe this just isn&#39;t the type of music Anthony enjoys.<br>For example He rates  Speedin&#39; Bullet To Heaven a Zero while giving that Sophie compilation an 8 which to me just sounded like noise.
+theneedledrop I rarely laugh at these reviews but my god, this dude Cudi is finished.
Thank you! I hadn&#39;t laugh that hard in a while. Was not expecting a zero. Thank you.
August Alsina This Thing called life please!!
are u and papa franku friends irl?  if so pls hang out and film that shit, b0ss.  pls.  it is my one last wish before dis cancur kills me.  pls.  HA!  it&#39;s a prank, bro!  I dont hab cancur.  btw, hab u seen chef?
Cudi gets a 0 but you&#39;re in love with drake??
I don¬¥t really understand what¬¥s the idea behind this album yet but i think he should do another album. An album like MOTM and A Kid Named Cudi, another masterpiece, a last one. Please don¬¥t leave us with this, Cudi, please!
Please review intervals new release please!!!!
Indicud? Unfuckwittable, Immortal, King Wizard and Just What I Am are all great songs imo.
Speedin&#39; Bullet to Heaven 2: The Bargain Bin
i rather listen to cal
HAHAHAH W..OW
Vintage Cudi got me through some of the hardest times of my life. I need that cudi back.
I cried when I first heard Indicud because I knew it was the beginning of the end
Not the worst album this year? What is it then Anthony?
Just let Cudi be Cudi. There will never be a MOTM3 because that is not Cudi anymore. If you don&#39;t enjoy his music, then don&#39;t listen to it.

WHERE IS DEADEND HIPHOPS REVIEW!!!
This honestly has some of the most embarrassing lyrics I have ever heard.  By any standard.
I don&#39;t believe any of these reviewers understand what he was going for. Yes, the guitar riffs and chords are repetitive. Yes, The quality of the recording is sometimes muddled and very grungy. Thats exactly what he was going for. Simplicity. Raw, grungy, not at all autotuned and fixed up like all the new, shiny, hectic music were so accustomed to today. The words he is saying, the melodys he sings, are extremely raw and emotional, and beautiful on a level most people like to ignore. Most people in this society are shallow and don&#39;t listen to their emotions. Cudi is staying true to himself by producing a completely honest and open album that is different than what he has done in the past, is out of his comfort zone, and he fucking played the guitar and bass by himself, sticking true to his former statement to &quot;DO IT ALONE.&quot; You all want to judge him for making something different than what you wanted to hear, but has anyone really sat down and appreciated all the sounds he created and the emotional words he wrote? That depressing side he sings about is a side that exists in all people, and if you can&#39;t vibe with it, it shows you aren&#39;t ready to ask yourself questions and admit to your own emotions and flaws. I&#39;ll be one to say that I&#39;ve felt emotions he described in this album and it came out at the exact time I needed to hear it...I think he made this album to weed out the fans of music, art and authenticity, and the fans who just want some cool hip hop beats. Let him do what he wants. Kid Cudi didn&#39;t fall off, you all complaining did.
Fuschia Butterflies is my song tho
Wow, i feel bad for all the people who hate this album. This is probably one of Cudi&#39;s deepest records. Crazy how much heart that went into this project yet it still goes over all of your heads. Smfh
I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen a more brutal review from theneedledrop. If there are more so, direct me.
huge kid cudi fan, but this album hurt my ears
Ugh I couldn&#39;t have said it better myself. Solid review! I&#39;ll sub to that
This review is the polar opposite of the To Pimp A Butterfly Review hahaha
After this video I would never subscribe to your channel.
After this video I would never subscribe to your channel.
you should make a playlist of albums you hate pls
drugs do make good music
WHAT!!!!!!!!  indi cudi is an awesome album..... this fuckin guy
worst album than Miley&#39;s Dead Petz? whaaa
&quot;I&#39;m feelin a.........ZERO!!!&quot; Lmao I laughed through this entire review but that killed me for some reason.
Polaris&#39; Pete &amp; Pete soundtrack in the background.  Dope.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=457">7:37</a> RIP Headphone users
Cudi be doing to many weird movies that shit changing him!
This album sucks
Change the speed on all the songs to 1.25 and it&#39;s actually not bad.
( Õ°¬∞‚ï≠Õú ñ‚ïÆÕ°¬∞ ) DAT strong zero...
Easily the worst record ive ever listened too, the vocals are barley audible flat and boring
Do you actually have an educational background in music at all? Or are you just a genius in something that you don&#39;t even study or make?
Ayyyye, that Dummy vinyl cover tho&#39;. Portishead, son!
Here&#39;s why you are wrong, I feel this album is a perfect reflection of how Kid Cudi feels and his emotions. To call him crazy is disrespectful, even if Cudi is mentally ill, it&#39;s art, a way of expressing yourself and who are you? The judge of what art is good or not? If you can&#39;t emotionally relate to his album than obviously you&#39;re gonna call it trash. But for the people who feel as if Cudi is speaking for them and can relate it&#39;s different. You call it trash but that&#39;s your opinion, and that doesn&#39;t make it trash. So I hope all your viewers don&#39;t dick ride and actually give it a chance instead of going off what your no talent ass has to say. If you have the blueprint to a perfect album/sound lets see you do it yourself or sonically put together something. Don&#39;t be so close minded Anthony, you&#39;ve lost my respect for this fuckery, fuck you :)
This album was garbage, idc. I&#39;ve been a fan of Cudi since 09 and this is just garbage. Don&#39;t tell me I&#39;m not a real fan and pretend like this album was good because it wasn&#39;t. I&#39;d be OK with cudi&#39;s transition to a different type of music if the music was ACTUALLY good. but this wasn&#39;t. Indicud had some good songs, MOTM 2 was my fav, and MOTM 1 and A Kid Named Cudi were awesome. But this is...just....bad.
Can you review the Heaven&#39;s Basement album &quot;Filthy Empire&quot;? It came out in 2013, but I thin it&#39;s absolutely fantastic, and really worth a listen.
The album kind of had this abusive husband wanting his spouse to take him back feel to it. I feel like handle with care was an I&#39;m sorry for the preceding mass of bs, and Seance Chaos was spitting and stepping all over that, then wedding tux was a half assed attempt at reconciliation and the rest of the album just followed that outline with each I&#39;m sorry getting more and more......bad.......just.....bad
There&#39;s one song that&#39;s basically creep from radiohead.
That was kind of hard to hear, much like the album. üò¢
you have no taste in music at all if you think man on the moon, pursuit of happiness, and soundtrack to my life are bad.
this album makes riff raff and slim jesus look like gods
I&#39;m a massive kid cudi fan, and this album sucks ass....that is all
as much as I like cudi, I did not care for the album
i liked it
yall so mad that a reviewer reviewed an album lmao
Cudi has been my favorite artist since MotM 2, i vibed to every song on MotM 1&amp;2, it felt like his music was for me. I liked indicud personally, I thought it was a good mix of new and classic Cudi. Satellite flight was where he lost me. Half the songs didnt have words, the other half excluding &quot;Satellite Flight and Coming to the Ceremony&quot; were garbage. I was really worried about this new piece, especially when he started releasing rock singles. I gave it a shot but my god. This albums trash, and the dick riders on twitter dont help. I am still a fan of who Scott Mescudi used to be musically. But do not bash me because I can be a fan of someone and not like what they drop. This album was a letdown. He hasn&#39;t released a good album in my opinion in 3 years. I remain optimistic that MotM 3 will be good but, who knows.
wzrd and indicud  are dope as hell
The album sounds like something I&#39;d hear off some shitty Bandcamp page
Cudi, if you&#39;re watching this...don&#39;t listen to him lol. The album is great.
I liked this album...You gotta VIBE with Cudi...his singing was never the best but he always delivers
I&#39;m a huge cudi fan but i cant front and say that this album was even close to being listenable. cudi is annoying his fans and expects us to be cool when he drops some shit like this. When am i gonna get that travis scott kid cudi collab....NEVER!!
817 Kid Cudi dick riders disliking the video. This album is bad in my opinion man. ._.
Cudi one of my favorite musicians. Being from Ohio hes A icon here but. I heard A couple songs and im just not feeling it. I guest he tried to do like what lil Wayne did. Not copying but trying at Another complete Genere of music. Sorry Cudi we are still waiting on Man On the moon 3.Some fans like it but not really my cup of tea.
It would be interesting if Anthony was actually a huge fan of KiD CuDi, but he is just giving him constructive criticism so his music only gets better.
lmfao <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=510">8:30</a>
BROOOOOOOO hahahahahah
I personally like this album, it was like listening to a documentary.
I didn&#39;t love it... but M.O.T.M. 3 is on the horizon,  and I KNOW that will be hot.
This is one the albums of the year of Gerard Way
I love Kid Cudi, but I can&#39;t back this album. I just can&#39;t, it&#39;s gone too far. I hope he can redeem himself on Man On The Moon 3.
Kid Cudi fans be like &quot;YOU JUST GOT TO UNDERSTAND WHERE HE&#39;S COMING FROM!&quot; <br>Yeah from the fucking garbage can.
Indicud is good wtf you talking about ?
As a cudi fan i sat down and tried to listen to this album. I got to &quot;Judgemental C*nt*&quot; and had to stop. I agree, he has lost his mind.
cool, portishead is in the background. Pedestal is probably one of my favorite tracks
Fuck this nigga review. Fuck them granny panty horned rim glasses. Fuck that faded hairline. Kids, Listen to the album. Decide yourselves. There are people who like it and there are people who dont. Just like fucking ice cream.

A zero tho!!!! Lolol
fake and gay
is it ironic that youre wearing the same shirt as the Miley Cyrus review?
Cudi must of been on 20 mollys throughout the making of his album
idk, I&#39;m cool with Kudi&#39;s odd vocal style. it&#39;s weird AF, but I&#39;m cool with it.
Forever
i like WZRD , Indicud + Journey 2 th Money ..was funny to hear u str8 shit on th disc ..but i stopped watching these reviews bcuz we hear shit diff ..lik when pitchfork tries to cover rap .. but whatev ..disc was cool to me ..hella emo tho .. cudi rules !!.
Kid Cudi is just a garbage artist. Like he&#39;s not good ever since Day n Nite dropped and Pursuit of Happiness I just thought he was a boring Artist his voice is dull and he sings with it more than he raps (which he can&#39;t even do). There&#39;s nothing remarkable about him other than being signed to G.O.O.D Music and contributing to one of Kanyes greatest albums. He doesn&#39;t stand out he&#39;s just a boring dude
I was dead at about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=513">8:33</a> lmao
And you are?
I actually love this album. I reckon kids in the future will appreciate it more than right now, when things get weirder
Do a few track reviews. &quot;Solace&quot; and &quot;45&quot; by Earl Sweatshirt
Yeah this album full on trash
we need the diversity
im glad people  make bad songs because  i like the ones people  think are horrible
It&#39;s weird I love all of his albums just because I love all different sounds and I don&#39;t expect anything or put anything in a box I jus love abstract sounds. Only some people will understand I guess
I feel like Cudi knew critics would bombard his work with negative review... but something tells me he just won&#39;t care
Speedin Bullet 2 Heaven &gt; good kid maad city
WZRD wasnt even bad at all. but im scared to get this new one
Eyyyyyy Dummy by Portishead<br>I C U
Man in the night might be one of the worst songs I&#39;ve heard this year.
this entire video makes me cringe.
thank you for recognizing Scott&#39;s discography.
you think man on the moon 2 is mediocre, you&#39;re a fucking idiot.
Anthony Fantano. Speedin&#39; Bullet To Heaven...forever.
why do so many people watch this guys videos bout music, get your own opinion...<b>I&#39;m watching only some of this to see what other people think if this album because I didn&#39;t like it</b>
It is his opinion guys. Sometimes you gotta just say fuck it.
I loved the album.
Rough review but necessary.
a big fat goose egg
its like cudi recorded this in his tent @ bonnaroo or cochella on acid
Adventure &amp; Melting are good
Man, December&#39;s been a pretty rough month for you already.
Im a huge cudi fan but this your best review
yes, b0ss. weeeeeeell doooooone
God damn I cant believe the review was this bad lol I gave the album maybe 10 listens and it&#39;s pretty bad as much as I like cudi. It has a few good songs but I feel you just gotta be in the mood or relate to the lyrics to like the record. I used to think wzrd and indicud were bad but theres a few gems in there you just gotta relate to it honestly... idgaf i&#39;d much rather listen to this than any drake,young thug, mgk album any day
Kinda&#39; sounds like V Sauce at the beginning lol.
Very unfortunately, I had to give you the like on this review.
lol U LOST YO MIND IF ANYTHING   u must not label him as a rapper if he is transitioning to more guitar melodic styles     i used to this this anthony dude was chill cus of what he said of mf doom and the killa bees but shit,,,  unfollowing.... fuck death grips ahaaaa
he says hallucinogens help you vibe to his music not the reason he&#39;s a good artist
hey his new album is not bad its just good creativity and effort he put into this album its good.
I disagree completely with his assessment on MOTM1 and MOTM2. I also slightly disagree with Indicud which I thought had a lot of great songs on it (also some bad ones as well). However I can&#39;t defend the other albums... it&#39;s so disappointing because I feel he had so much potential after his mixtape and MOTM1.
So to keep it short, the album is trash and so is cudi. RIP old cudi
Alright I agree with you about this album but his other albums like indicud, and satellite flight those albums where amazing
Yo, this album made me question whether I ever liked cudi or was dick ridin&#39; the whole time. Damn, shit was trash.
you&#39;re the worst music reviewer of all time
Indicud wasn&#39;t bad at all, don&#39;t know why ppl hate it.
One of the worst albums ever made.
Speeding Bullet to Heaven is a great album, you have to have  a certain type vibe to respect it
listen people, don&#39;t judge music off of someone else&#39;s opinion. Take the time out to see how it relates and vibes with you. it&#39;s all just a opinion from someone&#39;s mind so there is no wrong or right of good &amp; bad music because everyone likes different things. Go with your mind and your own vibes.
Speedin&#39; Bullet To Hopsin
how much u wanna bet kanye west can write a better punk rock album
Best part is we all know for a fact that Cudi watched this video
dat Polaris record doeee... I see you bruh!
Call the album what it is : an experiment in alternative rock by a hip hop artist. Influenced primarily by grunge music, it seems. However, Cudi failed to include any real tension and build up, with no breakdowns, solos, or climaxes in any of the songs. This is probably because he makes rap, not rock. Overall, I&#39;d give it a 3.5
Indicud was üî•üî•üî• tho
First I lost B.o.B and now Cudi.
What i&#39;ve heard so far of this album i really like, but then again Anthony and I barely ever seem to share the same taste in music
I&#39;m feeling a light to strong Zero on this one hahaha
It&#39;s a shame because I enjoyed his man of the moon albums. At this point it&#39;s better for him not to even make it because it&#39;s going to be such a disappointment.
Agreed this album is terrible and don&#39;t come at me with this &quot;he is an artist he can make what ever he wants&quot; that is bullshit. I can spray shit on a wall and call it art but at the end of the day it ain&#39;t art. And yes I understand he&#39;s trying to &quot;find a new sound&quot; but I see no new sound in this album its generic and when I heard cudi was doing a rock album I thought it&#39;d be better...
Garbaash
Lebronthany Hairlinetano
and i thought his last piece bad man i miss old cudi
When he put Beavis and buttheads voices in the songs: those voices were referring to people like you Andy....
You wore the same shirt when you roasted Miley... coincidence orrrrr?
see this album just reinforces the importance of good song mixing and production...the whole freaking album sounded like a rushed demo but mehn am in pains cause if they were mixed, produced and sung and arranged properly no one would be saying this cause those songs are dope as fuck!!!...its just painful to listen to something with so much potential just be wasted wtf cudi!!
I just want everyone to keep listening to this album. I&#39;d admit I was like ehh another WZRD...but this is waaaaay better!! With so many tracks it&#39;s hard to grab on especially jumping genres ‚úåüèæÔ∏è
This made me crack up so bad. This is sadistic really what Kid Cudi is doing to his listeners.
Polaris in the background?
This album made me wanna slap Cudi&#39;s mom
what the fuck just listened to some of it and I kinda want to go kill myself
Cudi, I don&#39;t think Anthony &quot;fucks with you musically&quot;
MADNESS KILLING SADNESS
Captain Beefheart is the SHIT.
MOTM and MOTM 2 were great to me, incicud had like two tracks I liked. Satellite flight was like just confusing. But this...what.
The similarities of Cobain and Kudi is that their demos BOTH SUCK.
&#39;ANYHONY YOURE ALWAYS HATIN ON THE KID CUDLY, YKNOW YOU THINK YOU GOTTA BE THE BA BA BA!&#39; -cal
Worst album in years. Fetty is better than Cudi...
Yeah this album was pretty bad. So concurred.
Best review ever..
i seriously hope cudi aint listening cus this is Ruuuuuuuuuuuufff lmao
This was mean
Kid Cudi stans are literally insane for defending this.
Fuck this review...On the real the most honest, experimental, artistic album ever. Cudi is a true Artistry at his finest. And he proves it on this album. 10/10
You always shit on everything fuck you
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23bananthony">#bananthony</a>.
Viper&gt;Kid Cudi
dat Polaris album doe.
Was my favorite musician but if this the direction he&#39;s going I gotta drop it üò¢
yo there are like 20 tracks on this??!?!??!!??!wow
man on the moon 1 and 2 are classics. and indicud had some hits. dude is just trying hard to be different. he needs to get back to rappin and singing on trippy hip hop beats
Indicud is an amazing album
Kid cudi is honestly a God. He can do no wrong, anything he puts out is amazing
WTF !! I loved this album , the first time I heard it .. I knew he was gonna Let Shit Loose &amp; he did .. I Love this Shit !
You are too cerebral for your channels good.<br>I watched you and everyone be fooled by his album. The premise of which is supposed to convey just how miserable he is. Maybe its time you consider that he purposefully gave you what he is experiencing on the daily. &quot;This rabbit hole of awfulness&quot; as you so put it.  Everything you said to his discredit credits him all the more. Ill tell you why. That confusion and disgust you feel is what he literally translated from his point of view. I feel bad that you haven&#39;t grasped this concept. Does Kanye ring a bell? Or do you think the hitmaker known as Kid Cudi lost some of his 10 000 hours of creativity potential?
indicud and wzrd are very good albums
YESS MILEY WASNT HIS WORST RATED ALBUM SLAYY QUEEN WE LOVE YOU QUEEN MILEY ICONIC QUEEN
SOBER KID CUDI ! I COULD NOT MAKE IT THROUGH THE ENTIRE ALBUM . SB2H AND SATILITE FLIGHT ARE NOT GOOD ALBUMS ! SOBER KID CUDI
Y&#39;all tripping it was a dope album in its own way
I could record myself farting into a mic for 40 minutes and say &quot;who are you to criticize what I&#39;m doing? It&#39;s music man! It&#39;s up to the listener to decide!&quot; And that is true but COME ON. There is a certain point were it just becomes garbage... This guy isn&#39;t some snobby hipster who doesn&#39;t understand what art is, he&#39;s just a man stating the facts... This whole album was garbage, so boring, and as a hardcore Cudi fan it pains me to say it. Yes he is an artist, he can do whatever the fuck he wants, but to release this as a whole album to his fans and still expect a following is just ridiculous. I mean its like he wasn&#39;t even trying. And the part about the singing hit the nail on the head! All that endless moaning and wailing by Cudi is just annoying. I miss the lonely stoner.
damn... someone got burned bad lol
No seriously though this shit&#39;s fugin cancer
this would be a -1 except, songs like  adventures, the nothing, and the title track actually have some kind of interesting textures going on, also personally i liked the demo tracks better than any thing else on the album, to me they just sound like hevyer /better super generic punk songs, and don&#39;t have that god awful fucking production on them. The last track though, is the only track i actually like, it&#39;s pretty groovey, so like yeah same score as fandles
Drugs don&#39;t make you make good music? MGMT case and point.
Am I the only one who liked the album?
This album is SUPER BAD worst album of the year <br>I rather listen to troy ave album<br>Than this trash
woooo...He gave it a point! &quot;.9&quot; out of 10 lol a littlw harsh, but honestly this will make me want to watch your critiquing skills more now becuase for the last couple of albums i seen you review have been truthful to the tasteful ears.
&quot;It takes the cake... the hair cake&quot; THANKS FOR THE MEMORIES OF FUCKING FRANK EATING HAIR CAKE
I can&#39;t take your opinion seriously when you genuinely thought Hotline Bling was good :P
yall hate yeezus but like this? GTFOH
What is the point of this channel? I think I&#39;m gonna make an YouTube channel that gives one perspective on the highest forms of abstract art and just call them dumb and say I can do the same thing because I lack any form of higher thinking. Seems to work pretty well
screw this bald piece of shit, cudi is the greatest! you don&#39;t know shit
YOU<br>CAN<br>NAHT.<br>YOU CANT.
This bald, insane man clearly has never agreed with the way cudi creates his music, JFKPSA listen to it pls and remind yourself that a artist creates and experiments like no other, you&#39;re clearly insane and I feel bad for your no brain ass, I do admit I miss Hip hop head cudi but his music will keep flowing through the positive vibes.
&quot;There will be no haters and if there are haters we shall flex on them flex&quot;
The &quot;Hair-cake&quot; FithyFrank reference got me pretty good.
I love this album
Yeah I couldn&#39;t make it all the way through.
review smyle
Review Trademarc - Black Ash Days!
AS A KID CUDI FAN I&#39;M indifferent to your opinion. Meh, I like Kid Cudi and I have my reasons for liking him but eh, having not listened to this record maybe my tune will change. Idk.
don&#39;t hate cudi hate yourself
Eyyyyyyy Filthy Frank reference
Gave asap ferg &quot;trap lord&quot; a 7 but cudi&#39;s &quot;sbth&quot; gets a 0?.....its clear the basic, average (and i do mean basic) human mind cant comprehend a cudi album so i must only understand.
Review Montage Of Heck please
I believe Cudi became too obsessed with Kurt Cobain and birthed SBTH
I honestly enjoyed listening to it, I don&#39;t know how you say it&#39;s &quot;unlistenable &quot; .
Your Beavis impression is pretty good
Fuck you haters
hmmm...yeah, maybe it&#39;s in code. what kind of drugs is he on?
cudi said he was mad his genre was &#39;hip hop&#39; lol shoulda be categorized as &#39;trash&#39;
You like slim Jesus so stfuüíÄüòÇ
POLARIS VINYL IN THE BACK!!! One of my favorite albums!!
This album wasn&#39;t bad. To say it was trash is an overstatement, the switch from a hip hop to a rock influenced albums was warned by cudi and fans should have known before listening. This album was dope in its aesthetic and is exceptional in it difference between modern day hip hop artists. This album was heat and people need to expand the type of music they  listen to in order to understand this album
this review will get more views that the album will sell records
i liked indicud lol but this was str8 up dog shit
I used to like theneedledrop. Fuckit now!
+theneedledrop you should do a review on lil waynes no cielings 2. i wanna hear ur reactions to how bad it was lol
dude music is meant for the people who like it.
this guy does not know what he is talking about
speedin bullet to heaven was the best song
The first 0 you&#39;ve ever given.
Even as a fan of Kid Cudi I&#39;ll admit the album was just really bad... I understand that he&#39;s changed as a person but I was expecting him to drop some mind blowing jams in this album with a new style but to say the least, I&#39;m very disappointed with Kid Cudi. He had and probably still has a lot of potential considering he still has a lot of loyal fans. Maybe his next album will be something worth purchasing..
I literally disagree with most of what this guy is saying. MOTM2 Bad! Are you insane?!!!
YESS THE HAIR CAKE. LOL
Is this supposed to be a album for depressed people? I know fully well what deep depression feels like and this aint it. This is more like an promotion for suicide. This album is something you would commit suicide to and then be forced to listen to for all eternity in hell. FFS Cudi
By far, BEST REVIEW OF THIS YEAR!!! LOL XDXDXD
this do sound very acid-ish, but must&#39;ve been bad acid. enjoyed man in the night to some certain extent though
+theneedledrop idk why you don&#39;t review Alex Wiley&#39;s village party 2 it&#39;s such a good album with great instrumentals, lyrics and even a skit with ghandi.
Anthony, I don&#39;t appreciate you having Portishead-Dummy on display in a review of this shit album.
This was the greatest review of 2015. Hands down.
Indicud was a dope album...i didnt like 2-3 songs
I&#39;ve rematched this review so many times. Hurts to see kid cudi put out something this bad being that I was really amped about him back in high school since a kid named cudi. I just hope this is something he won&#39;t put out again. I saw he was upset at the response people gave on Twitter so let&#39;s just hope MoM3 is not going to be like this. Or he could potentially put out MoM3 to sound worse than SB2H to give us a big f*ck you for not liking it.
Oh so you&#39;re not going to review Curren$y? Canal Street Confidential
&gt;0.94721<br><br>Fucking savage
I actually really like this album compared to Indicud and WZRD. Idk, I thought it was different, in a good way.
kid cudi..... sooooo sad....... man on the moon was soo fucking dope,, WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED
:( sorry cudi, it is okay.
put A KID NAMED CUDI on and it will make everything better. if you know you know
Can&#39;t believe he skipped SatelliteFlight
cudi was the reason I got into producing. I thought Satellite Flight was okay with Internal Bleeding and Too Bad I Have To Destroy You, but now I can&#39;t help but to assume MOTM 3 will flop if he doesn&#39;t bring back his original sound. SMFH.... üò¢
Kids, drugs do not make you make great music üëèüèæüëèüèæüò©üò©
This album is my least favorite of his albums. But it&#39;s starting to grow on me tbh. Cudi is still legendary though!!!
Stop Stop he&#39;s already dead
As a huge Cudi fan, I can truly say this album was horrible. It&#39;s nothing original; he&#39;s just trying to revamp an old style and he did a terrible job of that. It was a try hard attempt, nothing more. No matter how much you love Cudi, this album is trash. <br>I&#39;ve always called a spade a spade. If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, then it&#39;s a fucking duck. And this album sounds like garbage, so it&#39;s fucking garbage.
Never liked Cudi, never listened to anything he put out, then he released this, so I listened to Man on the Moon to prepare. As someone who isn&#39;t a genuine fan of Cudi, I actually liked SBTH.. Like, really liked it..
I fuck with this album heavy. But seeing as though I never really got into rock music, I don&#39;t have anything to compare it to to say its as bad as dude was tryna say. I feel like you can enjoy music better when you try to take it from the artists perspective. But dawg y&#39;all gotta quit acting like this nigga owes you shit, let that man grown and make what he feels. We all miss MOTM but expecting that shit every time is gonna keep you from enjoying the new shit.

I was laughing before I clicked on this video lol.
Lmao a 0 xD
Come back to hip hop Cudi!
fuck, i really want that polaris vinyl
I cringe every time I see someone in the comments say &quot;fake fans.&quot;
aayyy Polaris. Reminds me of Pete &amp; Pete. &quot;Hey Sandy!&quot;
I actually like this album, better than any trap shit
If this sock boy ever comes out of his cardboard closet and crosses one of these artists that he hatefully bashes, they&#39;re going to hit a man with glasses.
Cudi aint making music for people anymore, its all for him. SO if you connect to the new vibes you connect more than just being a fan. If you dont vibe on this album then move on Cudi aint for you anymore. I&#39;m sick of all these people hating on cudi because they don&#39;t have taste in music outside of hip/hop.
Ayyy ease the fuck up, Indicud and Satellite flight are fire.
I&#39;m a huuuuuge kid cudi fan ever since i heard his first mixtape i was hooked on his shit. And as he went on making music I stayed like that until wzrd came along. I was thrown off but respected him for trying something different even though it wasn&#39;t my type of music. Then after indicud came out and I was like ok some kid cudi I actually know. I enjoyed the majority of the album and pretty regularly listened to it. Speedin bullet to heaven is something that I couldn&#39;t really listen to and feel the same way as i did with his prior projects and I was just going to throw it away like wzrd. Until my friend who also messes with cudi told me what he thought about the album. He&#39;s going through a rough time with school ex-girlfriend money and family issues which all hit him in about a span of a week right before this came out. He said he really liked the album which caught me by surprise because he and I have similar taste in music. But he told me the reason he liked it so much was because he could relate to it and he felt that he could find comfort in his songs. Which made me think back to when I started to listen to cudi which started in middle school on to high school. As many people know middle school can kinda be hard on some kids and I was no exception. I had a pretty bad case of depression and was very anti social. But I found comfort in cudi&#39;s songs from a kid named cudi motm 1&amp;2 dat kid from cleveland and indicud. So even though i think this album isnt really good it just might not be meant for me. I think that this is aimed for people with a certain mindset or people that are facing issues in their life and even though sonically it isnt a very good album i think people like this album because it helps them through their day of struggle.
Cal Cudi ftw hahaha gold
His album is incredible
This albums wavy as fuck actually. songs like man in the night, fairy tale remains etc remind me of some 90s grunge shit. But fuck y&#39;all opinions tho, Free Gucci mane
its not rap its not rock its cudi music. Enjoy or not.  bump his oldie then. this guy lol
I don&#39;t know, make a decent album, or song, or melody, or sing a note and I&#39;ll take you seriously.
HE IS TRYING TO BE SOMEONE DIFFERENT THAN ALL THESE ARTISTS
Is this album so bad its funny (like riff raff or lil b) or so bad it shouldn&#39;t of even been made
What&#39;s with the hate on Indicid? That was a dope album
he hated this more then dark sky Paradise. lol.
This is so fucking stupid! First off you call Man on the moon II a &quot;mediocre&quot; album when in reality it is a revolutionary album and has changed some aspects of the hip-hop game and Kid Cudi was the first of his kind. This new album may not be his greatest, but he just has a different style. There are good songs on this album you just have to understand the background and be in the mood to listen to it. It will take more than one day.
Fuck u all of cudis songs are good u piece of shit
WHAT HAPPENED TO CUDI!?!?
WHY YOU SO SALTY SADTANO!!!!!!! completely unlistenable???? cmon!!!!!
I feel like this album is the epitomization  of exactly why we all find artists so fascinating as human beings. They commit themselves to a brand, turn that brand into a successful business and the. Immediately release something the message of which is all my fans can go fuck themselves because exactly what think I am, that&#39;s what I&#39;m not. Give the man props for recognizing that he doesn&#39;t need any more money fame or respect to continue to find satisfaction in his art. Also this may be blasphemous but I felt the same way listening to this as I did the most recent Roots album, and then you shoot your cousin, which is to say very confused, and deeply sorry for any of her respective pr representatives and labels, but loving the attitude of: I&#39;m fucking rich enough for like a 1000 people, so fuck all y&#39;all for expecting me to do any of this for you. Having said that, this album is not enjoyable to listen to more than once.
uhh motm1 and 2 was great and so was Indicud, Satellite flight was good to and psychedelic. Ill admit though this album isnt his greatest but this was only an experimentation with rock. There are like 3 gems on this abum i do enjoy, not saying the whole album was great but motm3 is coming soon cant wait. This guy is not a professional critic so i could careless what he says everyone has their own taste in music and thats that.
Nah for real tho this album was just nasty bro any cudi fans please respectfully tell me why this is good to you I&#39;m very open minded and won&#39;t be an ass
The savagery in this interview is so entertaining.
I am a huge huge huge kid cudi fan and I did not like this album at all. I&#39;m so sad
I liked indicud and Satellite flight. MOTM is a killer series of albums too. But This...What the fuck Cudi
Oooooo that&#39;s so edgy to give it a zero WOW you really shocked the world with that...you&#39;re hunting for views and I don&#39;t even think the album is good
I liked the single &quot;speeding bullet to heaven&quot; prod by ratatat and him.
Scott better come up with this Man on the Moon 3... I was excited for this album, but damn fam.
this guy is a dicksplash. this album is getting so much hate by people that didn&#39;t even listen to it.
Kurt Cobain,Kid Cudi......both start with KC!!!!!!
I think u got a bit emotional  dude... Its really not that bad.... Cudi&#39;s an acquired taste, and I refuse you to judge his fans as delusional. Thats disrespectful. He speaks to a part of our mind that clearly doesnt exist in you, its quite pitiful actually. Respect to your other reviews, but u kinda showed your ignorance on this one. Peace!
i just wasted 4 mins of my life watching this review I&#39;m out
So right after this album dropped, and I realised how shit it was, I went back and listened to MOTM 1&amp;2... Damn I miss that Cudi. Every single song was dope. Then he released WZRD, and fucked himself.
I really enjoy A Kid Named Cudi, MOTM, MOTM2, and even a few tracks off indicud. However, this abomination is unlistenable. It sucks because I have always enjoyed his hip hop tracks. This makes me not want him to make MOTM3 ever because I&#39;m afraid he will just ruin everything.
This is probably one of my favorite albums of 2015. You just destroyed my feelings.
This album was trash. Bruh if you gonna switch genres at least make it good, like he didn&#39;t even leave rap off on a good note.
I never fucked with kid cudi, but I&#39;m gonna pretend like this was his only good album for fun
&quot;He just seems to travel further &amp; further down this rabbit hole of awfulness, and I just wonder how far it can go.. ü§î&quot; lmao you sir are hilarious
Satelite Flight was dope your loss
This guy is an idiot.
Definitely going to check out some Captain Beefheart now haha.
I agree with everything but your opinion on Indicud. That album is art so alot of opinions will be formed around it though.
Miley Cyrus and Her Dead Petz has been redeemed! I FORGIVE YIEW ANTHONY!
Had to stop watching the review because you got way to bias.
wtf?
LOL FUCK OFF THIS ALBUM IS LEGENDARY
The Edge of Earth part of Edge of Earth/Post Mortem Boredom was good. Confused was good. Adventures was good. Fairy Tales Remain was good. Fuchsia Butterflies was good. Otherwise, there were too many mediocre songs in my opinion kinda drowning out the good. None of the songs were painful in my opinion; a lot were just mediocre. And man I wish Edge of Earth and Post Mortem Boredom were separated. I could have had Edge of Earth on repeat-1 for a long ass time.
I&#39;m a big fan of his previous work but something tells me these weak projects are a result of having to many &quot;yes men&quot; in his team. If he gave this to Kanye in the early Good music days, he&#39;d rip the CD in half right in front of him. <br><br>At this point I hope his acting career continues to grow and I hope to support him that way. He means well as an artist but this is just complete trash. smh
Damn ant... This album doesn&#39;t even get a transition
I think your being generous giving him your first decimal number rating this should of been a flat 0
&quot;the hair cake&quot; lol shoutout to Filthy Frank
When Fantano throws the paper, the roast is real.
I had high hopes for this album I listened to Adventures first on youtube. I was like &quot;Okay its not that great lemme listen to the other songs.&quot; (listens to the whole album) &quot;Wtf is this, he lost his goddamn mind on this drug shit&quot; I would listen to the start of the song, then when I started getting bored skip to the middle of the song and then ending the song all together. I like rock but this is straight up garbage. I love kid cudi but I just don&#39;t love his new music
I think Cudder did this album to dispoint ppl on purpuse to ge back on havy lit comeback album !! it may would be &quot;The man on the moon 3&quot;
Completely agree. He could&#39;ve very well changed his sound to rock, and made this album fantastic. I really thought he would be more than capable of doing so. But he fucked it up.
&quot;The worst album I had to review&quot;, wait... you don&#39;t choose the albums you review?
i got a question. im not trying to be disrespectful because i love your videos and your point of view but what do you look for in a album to consider it a good album?
If you still think that &#39;being yourself&#39; is reason enough to buy or listen to this garbage, then we ain&#39;t friends.<br>For everyone commenting, saying that &quot;he&#39;s made this for himself, its raw and emotional, and honest&quot;... if the music you make when you&#39;re being &quot;honest&quot; is trash like this, then you don&#39;t deserve the platform to release music.<br><br>Cudi stans form an orderly line.
Maybe the album was a joke?
anthony theres times where i really wanna smack the fuck out of you
this album is fuckin awesome!!!!!! does anyone here even kno any other rock band other then nirvana, a guy can&#39;t like some one without saying he&#39;s trying to be like Kurt cobain. this album is dope, insides out, embers, fuschia butterflies, handle with care, edge of the earth/post mortem boredom!  those tracks are solid and adventures is cool
@theneedledrop curious to why don&#39;t you give more time to listen to an¬†album?
I&#39;m not at all sure how I feel about it... I want to like it. it has the recipe for something I&#39;d like. But I don&#39;t. I like his other releases and I really loved Satellite Flight. I think it&#39;s great he&#39;s being experimental... but this was not a mind blowing experience. maybe I expected too much.
do ilovemakonnens 2 album
Christ, if you say this album sucks, (which it does) Cudi fans act as if you&#39;re not &quot;intelligent&quot; enough to understand. We&#39;re not on the same &quot;frequency&quot; to understand this album. Shut the fuck up. Stop with your Pseudo-intellectual bullshit. This album is a total failed attempt to make a alternative grunge, guitar rock record. This man is not Hendrix. Do I respect some of his other work? Do I respect what he&#39;s done as far as producing, making music in the past? Yes. But this man is not God. Get over it.
i loved the speedin bullet to heaven,confused,loved , and handle with care but its not what i was expecting but he is an artist he can go where ever he pleases with his music. His true fans will always be there for him cause he helped them with their darkest times. if u think abt it kid cudi is the reason why rap has changed so much he is the pioneer of all the change in rap where u cant really put him in the rap genre we keep seeing more of those ppl become famous.
<b>gives Anthony a hug</b> There, there. It&#39;s gonna be okay. At least Kid Cudi didn&#39;t make Billboard&#39;s of G.O.A.T. rappers list... :D
We should just be thankful for the music that Cudi has given us in the past and respect that he has the balls to put an album like this out, not caring how it sells, how much money he makes, etc. Just toss this album aside if you don&#39;t like it, and throw on the old Cudi you know and love. End of story.
the worst part is that fantano rated MBDTF only 6 points higher than this monstrosity
Motm 1 is the best album ever
Is this album actually a bit for Comedy Bang Bang?
i love kid cudi hes a goat but i really dont think im gonna listen to him again
GODDAMN. Nasirthony Jonestano just dropped Ether. lmao
I agree 100% with this review which I don&#39;t often do. I got about halfway through it and couldn&#39;t take another second. The singing is just so flat and bland, you could put anyone in front of that mic, put on the same affects, and it would sound the same. Both Cudi and his fan-base are the most delusional pompous people on this planet right now. They just kid themselves into thinking he&#39;s some kind of God among mere mortals and his music is so good. It&#39;s actually just terrible schlock and I have no idea how it got put on wax. I can&#39;t say enough bad things about this album. THE ONE SONG I LIKED was Man In The Night and then he had to go and ruin that with the insultingly bad Beevis and Butthead sketch? at the end. Fuck this album.
nice polaris vinyl
This one was hard to get into. Big fan of his older stuff. He&#39;s just been trending downwards for years. It&#39;s a shame really, he seems like a great person who can go to certain emotional places creatively. In my opinion he just lost his way with conveying his messages.
God and I was going to go to his concert.....
I used to get so mad how you would hate on Kid Cudi but I just want to say thank you. As a person who grew up with his music and loving everything he put out no matter what, you got this one 100% correct. He needs to realize what he has done to his loyal fans.
as much as i like his reviews i hate it when he attacks an artist
sigh, I want to defend Cudi but in terms of music...I haven&#39;t LIKED an album since Man on the Moon II. I just feel like he got to full of himself after his tenure with GOOD Music, and its good to be confident but he just... he made enjoyable albums not necessarily the best but still enjoyable. I think he got too experimental with music and lost what it was that he was doing because this shit...just unacceptable Indicud was meh, few tracks maybe 5 or 6 that I could still listen to and on of them was purely the RZA. But WZRD? That last heap he had come out last year Satellite Bullshit? I can&#39;t even say I&#39;m a fan anymore
didnt like man on the moon or motm2, didnt like the start of this albgum, didnt listen past 4th track but it was so bad i couldnt go on... but pleasetony couldyoutano reviewtany brand-newtano?

All I gotta say is That Cudi definitely took some ayahuasca
Satellite Flight was a solid album. It defiantly has that MOTM vibe and I love it.
uh. oh. I liked it, kinda.
0.94721/10 Hahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahaha<br><br>I agree
i feel the same way...smh this album was a disappointment
you know the nigga mike judge was in the credits, i guess he was really bevis and butt head voices
Cudi lost it man, I regret buying it without streaming first...<br><br><br>So disappointed
Do Gunz n roses by Montana of 300
Critics are just envious people who lack talent. If you don&#39;t like it that&#39;s fine but to disrespect someone&#39;s art I feel is just sad. He&#39;s happy, he&#39;s made something that he wanted to and I love it. It&#39;s brave to put yourself out there and make art and you do it for yourself. Critics like you are just a disgrace to creativity. Art isn&#39;t meant to be critiqued it&#39;s meant to be appreciated
Funny how Anthony is wearing the same shirt he reviewed the Miley Album in. I hope he makes this a pattern. You see that navy blue dotted shirt, you know this album is trash.
He fell off so bad that I&#39;m sad
Not gonna lie, I loved MOTM 1&amp;2 and stopped listening after. But after this album dropped I listened to Satellite flight and thought it was dope tbh. On this album I liked &#39;Confused&#39; &amp; 1 or 2 others but the rest was trash
I am a huge CuDi fan and this album is shit, I won&#39;t stand for it! I regret buying it, I was 20 seconds into listening to it for the first time and knew I wouldn&#39;t like it. The sound is too harsh for anyone to like. Scott should return to his roots because that was where his emotions were portrayed properly.
I really liked it...
Now i understand why he felt out of place at &quot;GOOD&quot; music.. üòÇ
I feel like he&#39;s attacking my hero but I cant defend him..
you just gave me a bad vibe  dude...kid cudi isnt relatable to hip hop anymore. he isnt a rapper..he is an artist... you shoulda just not done a review on this
Honestly, even though this album isn&#39;t my personal cup of tea, and I&#39;m not a Cudi fan at all, it wasn&#39;t so bad. Certainly it wasn&#39;t great, and even at a lot of parts annoying, but all in all it was alright. It was like a legit street taco, odd taste, shitty meat, not bad but nothing to get you to come back next time for more.
WORST ALBUM OF 2015
Never thought i would live to see the day of the zerothony zerotanzo
He made the album for suicidal people. Review better before saying stupid shit. Btw indicud was dope Af and I liked satellite flight fuck off
I think its a test to see how strong his fanboys are. and apparently they&#39;re real strong. no one in their right mind can like it. its fucking noise. just noise. and those moans sound ridiculous and somehow different than those iconic moan things he did in his early stuff. it has to be a joke. he can&#39;t feel good about this shit. no way. its garbage and everyone knows it
your a awful critic
Nice hair cake ref Filthony Franktano
kid cudi is a god fuk out of here u bald headed fuk <br>lol
how in the hell can you say indicud or satellite flight aren&#39;t dope. totally disagree.
cudi should call kanye
So what&#39;s worse , Miley Cyrus and her dead petz or SBTH?
definitely not for me
‚ÄúPunk is musical freedom. It‚Äôs saying, doing and playing what you want. In Webster‚Äôs terms, ‚Äònirvana‚Äô means freedom from pain, suffering and the external world, and that‚Äôs pretty close to my definition of Punk Rock.‚Äù - Kurt Cobain
‚ÄúPunk rock should mean freedom, liking and excepting anything that you like. Playing whatever you want. As sloppy as you want. As long as it&#39;s good and it has passion.‚Äù - Kurt Cobain
‚ÄúArt is sacred. Punk rock is freedom. Expression and right to express is vital. Anyone can be artistic.‚Äù - Kurt Cobain, Journals
‚ÄúThe whole punk ethic was do-it-yourself, and I‚Äôve always been very literal, especially as a kid. When they said that anybody can do this, I was like, ‚ÄòOK, that‚Äôs me.‚Äô‚Äù - Michael Stipe
Honestly Fantano I want some of the albums you&#39;ve heard this year that are worse than this. Genuinely curious.
‚ÄúPunk rock is just another word for freedom.‚Äù - Patti Smith
‚ÄúUndermine their pompous authority, reject their moral standards, make anarchy and disorder your trademarks. Cause as much chaos and disruption as possible but don‚Äôt let them take you alive.&quot; - Sid Vicious
‚ÄúI come from the home-grown punk ethic, where it doesn‚Äôt matter if you can‚Äôt play a note, it‚Äôs how you communicate.‚Äù - Siobhan Fahey, Bananarama
&quot;I think punk rock, especially for me, was a big middle finger to this whole talent thing.&quot; - Mike Watt, Minutemen
I enjoyed it
This is gonna be your biggest video.
comments/current generation = every form of rock is dead
am I the only one who liked it
This dude is the biggest nerd I&#39;ve seen all year
Hair cake mah shit tho
I&#39;ll agree this isn&#39;t all great music on this album, but listen...music is more than what it sounds(though that sounds ironic). AND from an artistic standpoint this is actually very interesting stuff. It may not be attractive to the ear but it&#39;s still interesting and has its good parts. Songs like Confused, Speeding Bullet 2 Heaven and my personal favorite, Adventures, could be considered highlights. I personally love these few songs. But I will say, as I said before, this isn&#39;t ALL so great to the ear. I will admit this and I&#39;m a huge Cudi fan. With that being said, I believe he is simply trying to find himself and test his boundaries, and Man On The Moon 3 will be an amazing album. Don&#39;t kill each other in the comments, everyone have a good day or night:)
miley cyrus got a better review lmao
this guy never has given cudi a good review. fuck his opinion
HEY SANDY!!!! Cool Polaris record
i honestly enjoyed this album.
This dude is hilarious. Best album dude ever
cudi gives me hope As guitarist
lmfao.. this was rated worse than miley&#39;s last album .. hilarious
i gotta disagree with him on indicud and satellite flight but this album was pretty weak, and ive been a fan since Man on the moon.
I love the album like no bullshit I found it relatable and I like how Cudi put it together and how he was able to open with his anger, sadness, but ultimately accepting it and perserving and this is coming from somebody who barely listened to his first 2 albums and his singles I just honest to god enjoyed but it seems like trashing the album is the thing to do so fuck it its just different strokes for different folks
How many bad projects does he have to drop before Man on the Moon 3?
Just by the look of the thumbnail I knew Anthony took this album as a joke lol
The album cover is pretty dope tho
havent heard it. is it really that bad?
ETHER G-EAZY NEXT PLZ
Its sad because Man On The Moon: End Of Day is in my top ten records. Go ahead roast me internet.
What is the album facing toward us? The closest one.
My coworker had me listen to it because he said it&#39;s one of his favorite albums. I couldn&#39;t even get past the first four tracks and I turned it off. Couldn&#39;t take it.
if u aint on the same frequency as cudi u wont understand this album, its pretty dope fuck the haters n fake fans
You can NOT. YOU CEEAAN&#39;T lmaooooooo
Made it to track 3
To truly understand this album, you need to be going through some shit or just sad. But regardless, I wish Cudi stayed in the &#39;Satellite Flight&#39; vibe instead of this punk rock stuff. I enjoyed WZRD though.
Antwon Fantwon&#39;s Masterpiece...like if you get it
LMAO, a zero!! My god
he just need to do a rap album!!!! forget about rock cudi!
Indicud was a good album, same with Satellite flight. Satellite&#39;s only issue with me was that it was too short.
Kid Cudi the GOAT and he doesn&#39;t care about the haters. He has poured in all his heart and soul and enjoyed making this album. I give this album an easy 8/10. The lyrics are so intellectual and speak to my heart.
Dead end hip hop needs to review this...
Dont give up on cudi though.
this got so many views quick
wait is this your first 0/10? I didn;t even know you went this low

I just want Man on The Moon Kid Cudi, is that too much to ask?
I thought Satellite Flight was dope. . . <b>shrugs</b>
this is the best review you have ever done... i laughed my nuts off at the end for some reason
The Original MOTM was a Classic. Everything else.....Uh.....yea<br><br><br>MOTM 2 was too electic and IndiCud has some bangers but is mostly forgettable. Dont even pay attention to his Rock Stuff<br><br><br>He needs to stick to his strengths as an Artist and Stop trying to experiment.   A lot of the Artists can pull off the eclectic stuff, he ain&#39;t one of them. Also lay off the Coke Cudi<br><br><br>He should hook back up with Kayne again as well. But just my opinion
ummm... everybody makes mistakes, its okay to be wrong sir!!, you maybe should listen to the album a couple more times... also you said MOTM2 is mediocre? umm... just listen to SB2H again man... but its okay, WATCH HOW MANY PEOPLE HE INFLUENCES WITH THIS ALBUM... youll see.. = )
I&#39;m happy for him, he&#39;s creating the music he wants to create. Wether it&#39;s good or bad... At least it&#39;s coming from an honest place.
I heard this was bad, but shit a 0? That&#39;s a first for sure lol
This review was worse than the album. Personally I liked the album, it reminds me of the 80&#39;s rock sound, but then again I seen the album as dark colors and it pushed me through my workouts, maybe you should workout and listen to it to get a better understanding of it. I&#39;m probably the only person who is going to disagree with this review, but we all have different opinions and I cant be reliant on another persons over mine.
this album is horrible
LMAOOOO This was the best review ever hahaha too funny
I don&#39;t know this artist guys, can you give me your favorite album of him so i can listen to it ?
that portishead vinyl
this album made me realize how to NOT make music.....Thanks kid cudi
I checked this Album out after watching this, he&#39;s right it&#39;s mainly garbage but I actually liked Wedding Tux and Judgemental C they are a bit cheap but I could get into it but the majority of the album is just absolute shit. I then looked at Cudi&#39;s old stuff and found some amazing tracks which I had never heard like Enter Glactic, Mr. Rager and Sky Might Fall and I thought WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED TO THIS GUY, but anyway good review
The only song to that I liked was Love which reminded me of the the old Cudi a little.
This is the most accurate review you&#39;ve put out this year.
completely disagree this album is a piece of art
Some of the worst music of the decade? This guy is fucked.

I can&#39;t believe people are really bashing this album. I understand the emotion of this album and I believe most of you who don&#39;t have been through these emotions. I&#39;m not even a fan of of alternative music but when I heard it I really enjoy it. Y&#39;all need to relax.
I liked  this album, and I liked WZRD &amp; Indicud too. This album really isn&#39;t for those who just want another MOTM and people need to get over that. Secondly, I don&#39;t understand why people say he has a huge ego?? Making music that you like and not being influenced by others is to be applauded, if you don&#39;t like it then fine, but stop whining. Everyone&#39;s sounding so entitled, if you like the MOTM albums then go listen to them. Artists don&#39;t owe you shit. That being said I like it, it&#39;s not great but it&#39;s not as bad as people are making out. I&#39;d give it a 5/10.
I&#39;d rather listen to a chopped and screwed hopsin than this garbage
Ain&#39;t it sad when the only semi-redeeming thing about an album is the cover art?
It kills me to say this, but I hate this album, I want the old cudi back. And I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only one.
haha youtube recommended this video to me. Glad I watched, this is fun content! Keep it up dude!
Some people bore me, so fucking boring. but im all smiles, im all smile&#39;8
His 12 second impression of Cudi was better than the entire album
Yo fuck this guy he probably listens to tyga
LMAOOOO This is the review I imagined you giving this album when I was listening to it. So good.
Canal Street Confidential
this album was a 10
Wait didn&#39;t Kid Cudi say in an interview that he writes music for people who feel lonely? This album makes me want to commit suicide.
this album is for True CuDi Fans, IDGAF what y&#39;all think about it, I love this Album
&quot;Kid Cudree.&quot; - Cal
Do g eazy&#39;s album
WHY SAY U &quot;HAD TO REVIEW&quot; THIS ALBUM WHEN YOU CLEARLY CHOOSE WTF U REVIEW...CUT THE BULLSHIT!
Do SMYLE by Kyle
He&#39;s being generous by giving it a 0, that&#39;s how bad this album is. I couldn&#39;t listen to a full song without changing it, I feel like he put no effort into this album and just put it out knowing his fans were going to buy it so he can feed his cocaine addiction. I used to like his music, what a shame what he turned out to be.
jeremihs new album
i respect and understand your prespective but if u listen to it high. its very cool
I loved this album.
3 words needle, YOU... ARE... GARBAGE! guy always talks shit about Cudi with every Album but doesnt understand Cudi&#39;s lyrics and obviously can not connect to them, hes sucking Kendrick off alot, do me a favor and dont review Cudi anymore if you got nothin good to say anymore especially when you only like 2 songs, do your work somewhere else
You should do a video on Lil Uzi&#39;s -Luv Is Rage (Mixtape)
It sucks, because Kid Cudi was the man who initially got me into rap and just seeing his progressive decline since his debut is tough to see. What pisses me off is not that the music itself is bad, but he puts less and less effort with each LP he puts out and has that stubborn Gambino attitude &quot;if it sounds clever in my head it&#39;ll definitely sound good on this  track.&quot; I remember him saying Satellite Flight was a prelude to MOM3 but I&#39;m glad he realized naming this pile of horseshit MOM3 isn&#39;t the brightest idea.<br><br>Get well soon Scotty.
This album&#39;s a 10/10 start to finish. The satirical undertone&#39;s gone over absolutely everyone&#39;s heads. Sonically, the music might not be that great but the production is quality. Hasthony Nofuntano got trolled by Cudi
I was a huge fan of Kid Cudi&#39;s first two albums and I have to agree, Speeding Bullet 2 Heaven is trash...
hit the nail on the head on the interview hahaha
THE HAIRCAKE
I guess I&#39;ll remove it from my Google play library without even listening to it :(
lol the only song I liked was &quot;Inside Out&quot;, it kinda reminded me of Coldplay, the guitar riffs
I wonder what Ye thinks?
To me Indicud was great, satellite flight was good not amazing but it had some good tracks. WZRD and SBTH are steaming pile of shit though.
Dude 0 at least 2 or 1 jeez wtf
I left the Cudi train once he dropped satellite flight. Sorry.
i wanna make love to u ant
Such a fucking hater
I am feeling a 0 my heart died
Turn on the Portishead record behind you to get rid of that migraine.
I think all kid cudi needs is a girlfriend.<br>idk maybe.<br>I mean he is pretty good looking so it wouldn&#39;t be hard to get one.<br>idk maybe.
I think all kid cudi needs is a girlfriend.<br>idk maybe.<br>I mean he is pretty good looking so it wouldn&#39;t be hard.<br>idk maybe.
Where is the best place to recommend albums for Anthony to review?
Could you review an album called &quot;Stretch Music&quot;, by Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah? It&#39;s a great jazz album.
real Cudi fans wouldnt bitch about the direction Cudi is going in, they&#39;d support it #100
i loved the skits doe
Ethered Kid Cudi&#39;s album
Please review the movie &quot;Elf.&quot; Thanks.
always hatin on the Kid Cuddly
You should review Kyle
Your critique of this album is influenced by your prejudice of cudi as an artist. The music itself is enjoyable at most times. Skits are inexcusably bad but the core emotion of this album makes up for it. The lyrics are are self indulgent as any record. Cudis singing coveys emotion. If this music was released anonymously, people would respect it more. Your &#39;score&#39; reflects your inability to accept original ideas
HAHAHHAHHA
Stumbled on to video, nice review. I have been a long time Kid Cudi fan and I have stomached a lot of his garbage tracks in past, but some of the crap up here was insufferable. This was definitely his worst album, and I couldn&#39;t think it could get any worst than Indicud. There were only like 4 or 5 decent tracks and he found ways to mess them up like you mentioned. I think after this he needs to stop making music for a while.
Shoutout to the people who liked this album. Me included.
This album is just trash.... It&#39;s sad I was looking forward to it :(
Ever since Cudi left &quot;Good Music&quot; things went downhill hard!!
Oh, man!
I love kid cudis music....but don&#39;t like the new album....I waited years and years for a new album by him....dissapointed
That Beavis impression was pretty damn good!
Kid cudi <br>2008-2011 ( great)<br>2011-2013 ( O.K)<br>2013 - now ( wack )
Review When&#39;s It Dark Out! I&#39;ve been wanting to see your take on G-Eazy&#39;s new album!
Hilarious review by the way Anthony ;)
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23kidcudi">#KidCudi</a> drops a No Wave Post Punk Sludge-folk album that might be this generation&#39;s &#39;808s n Heartbreak&#39; in terms of 180&#39;n the culture on its head like The Love Below, or RAM. In this era of polarisation, the artist must hyper-polarise them-self to be heard. I think this review is hilarious and fair, but I like this album because I&#39;m excited for the education of Punk to these cyber-trap kids, and for what exciting things lay ahead from that. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23diy">#DIY</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23postpunk">#PostPunk</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23bevisandbutthead">#BevisandButthead</a>
Look I&#39;m not asking anyone to like this album. Personally I love it, but I know that a lot of his rap fan base will not like it. You have to respect it though. No one has ever done what he is doing and he is still gonna sell 21k+ so people like it. No one has ever made a #1 rap song and then followed with an alternative album. Respect the art and Cudi has more musical sense than any of you all.
Schoolthany Shootano
anthony fantano seems different.. he must really hate this
Fantano really does go harsher on meme artists. I hated this album, but he really was harsh just because people trying to seem cool like it pretentiously. How is he better by hating it extra?
I loved the album idk why so much negativity from it. We all have different taste in music lets be real here we&#39;re all different and we&#39;re not all going to like the same sounds which I think is great. Thanks for sharing though but we don&#39;t all agree as we all have our own thoughts on it and music in general. Rock on dude!
review g eazys When It&#39;s Dark Out album

omg...
Indicud was amazing you idiot
I strangely enjoyed this album
PORTISHEAD IN THE BACKGROUND!!!!
kid cudi was good 5 years ago but 2015 rip
Fuck you I love this album
Ah, Polaris...makes me wanna watch The Adventures of Pete and Pete.
Wow people who are hating on Kid Cudi really don&#39;t know what the fuck they are taking about. So because he has a different style in music you automatically say its garbage while this man gave young thug and future&#39;s album a higher rating, and people didn&#39;t say shit. Damn I&#39;m starting to believe the criticisms are from a bunch of elementary kids that was obviously brain damaged by future&#39;s and young thugs lyrics.
Papa franku... I&#39;ll leave now
do &quot;When It&#39;s Dark Out&quot; G Eazy
So I was like, it can&#39;t be that bad. I just listened to he single &quot;Confused!&quot;. Wow, just wow. I mean apart from the boring music that never changes and the crooning singing at the worst I&#39;ve ever heard it.... the lyrics.... OMG. IT&#39;S FUCKING NONSENSE! &quot;Who am I? Who are we? All I want is to feel complete.&quot; Really. Really. REALLY! Jesus man, and that isn&#39;t even one of the worst songs? I&#39;m way too afraid to hear the rest of it.
Its not that bad
the fact he can even talk about the album for ten minutes is impressive

WOOOOWWW NO REVIEW ON JADAKISS TOP5DOA...JESUS CHRIST....... IM APPULED
I am a big Kid Cudi fan, but I&#39;m sad to say, this album was really not my taste at all, I was expecting an album to help me through my struggled life, so now I have to continue with this struggle with no help.
I miss the old Kid Cudi and he slowly get out of my top artist.
ill destroy it and then rebuild just 4 thrills...
do chris stapleton-traveler
This album cover is cool that&#39;s about it
Calm the fuck down
I completely understand why a lot of people dont like his shit, it&#39;s simple, they cant relate to his life struggles and the pain behind the music. No need to be so harsh about it man.
HAIR CAKE
I legitimately laughed my ass off when he said &quot;because THIS will happen&quot;
&quot;The Kid Cuddly&quot; LMFAO.
I liked satellite flight
Only good songs... Confused, judgemental, agreed kids, melting.. Everything else was complete shit, probably worst album he&#39;s ever made
Ive been a big Cudi fan and defender, but when i heard the album was going to be like WZRD i was pretty disappointed because i knew what that meant. WZRD was pretty bad, except for a few catchy songs.  I would disagree about Indicud though i enjoyed that album thoroughly. Satellite Flight was pretty meh. Cudi is just making music for himself at this point, which is alright, gotta be a little selfish but its just getting bad, and it hurts me as a long time fan
I loved Man In The Night &amp; Judgmental Cunt... I&#39;m happy this album exists just so I can get those two songs out of it... But yeah the rest is just impossible to enjoy.. The speeding bullet song sounded great to me at first, almost a little Trent Reznor-ish with the vocals, but then it just followed the same damn pattern over and over and over again &amp; bored me to shit in the end. Meh.. I&#39;m no fan of Cudi but i can&#39;t deny my obsession with a few of his songs
The Nothing was the musical equivalent of being molested in the ears, made me so uncomfortable
lmao üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ üíÄ üíÄ  OMG I couldn&#39;t stop laughing
idk i thought melting was pretty great
Ur literally stupid ...
Do Jadakiss
This was hilariousXD
Horrendous album. It reminded me of some Frusciante stuff.
Woah!! Never thought I&#39;d see Ant Dog like this. He was visibly frustrated. A 0?!! ... Wow!
&quot;Buy this album. If you dare&quot;
-_- eh..
The fact that you said that he &quot;fell off the edge of sanity&quot; is sadly accurate. Think about the whole album, its about him being taken by the devil. He talks about getting wasted by himself, and about how he saw his father hang himself. I personally think after Man on the Moon 3 he&#39;s gonna kill himself which really worries me. He&#39;s a great artist no matter what you say, and we don&#39;t want to lose someone like him. think about it, he even canceled his tour, that is weird in itself.
Thank you. I was trying to give Cudder another chance, but you saved my time. I hate these annoying rock songs...
Can you review G-Eazy&#39;s new album?
this album makes me want to delete all the Kid Cudi songs out of my itunes..
I totally agree this album is awful compared with the old music he used to make I got bored listening about 20 seconds into all of the music maybe Kid Cudi has seen better seen days
I actually like it. I think you are way to harsh. It seems like you are just reading pitchfork reviews and basing this on them.
the album may be bad but don&#39;t badmouth cudi
Seems like the Cudi fans have found this review...
G-Eazy new album released same day When Its Dark Out. Review?
I love this album, its such a wonderful break from everything that sounds the same these days. Its a unique take on punk and just makes you want to thrash around and throw shit at windows. Great album
the worst thing is that motm 3 won&#39;t be like the rest of the series.Why cudi why?Motm 1 and 2 were amazing and made him standout from the rest and for some reason he wants to leave that.
This album not even that bad.. I agree the bevis &amp; butthead bs coulda stayed out but Foh man lol....  Everybody not got like dope shit. People hated on TPAB. (TPAB is waaaay better than sb2h). But just an example..
&quot;Whooo am iiiiiii<br>Won&#39;t u bieeeel come bleeuub<br>I&#39;m gonna make an album<br>It&#39;s gonna be a rock album<br>Emma doooma bema dooobla biiim&quot;<br><br>Fantano impersonates CuDi&#39;s singing
&quot;This album is the musical equivalent to a mile of hot coal walking.&quot; So you didn&#39;t like it then?
0/10!! lmao straight up savagery
FILTHY FRANK REFERENCE HAHA
I dunno about y&#39;all but I enjoyed Satellite Flight
G easy when it&#39;s dark out
ok i usually dont agree with your opinions. but i havent even listened to the album and im laughing my ass off lol. i still gotta check it out because i love cudi, but u gave me a good laugh i salute u sir
I actually  like the album, but oddly I find  this review  to be true. Cudi should get back to  making &quot;G.o.o.d Music&quot;...
Only disappointment I had was that there was absolutely no rapping. I wanted to hear a MOTM2 2015 psychedelic style that wasn&#39;t delivered. Be that as it may , I understand progression. Speeding bullet to heaven is a big leap past the WZRD/INDICUD sound that cudder has been giving us . I enjoyed a good number of songs , I didn&#39;t enjoy the repetitive guitar and simple lyrics. In a way I understand the album, the addiction, distortion and lost feeling the album sends is interesting... In any case you can&#39;t call art garbage, a person may not feel the artist&#39;s expression but that largely reflects on the individual. Shit maybe it&#39;s better to be using a substance while listening to this album, I am and it&#39;s cool.
hooot damn that made me piss on myself! lol
I felt the singing brought forth a melancholic vibe. And at first listen, I was kinda nice. But as it droned on and on without any interesting or meaningful developments though out the album, and at some parts the singing just didn&#39;t work either musically or texturally or was just plain out of key, it left a lot to be desired after a while. A whole lot.
Raise Your Speedin&#39; Hands Like Bullets to Heaven
no... tran...sition? it is that bad?
Yeah ur fucked man lol i lost a lot of respect for you after watching this. Do you even try to enjoy music when you listen to it? Because it sure dosn&#39;t seem like it. Unsubbed.
Kid Cudi may not fit the corporate, mainstream mold of &quot;good&quot; but his music is extremely artful and meaningful to many.
Damn he shit on kid cudi
Indicud came out my senior year of highschool, bumped that shit in the whip everyday until graduation
I actually really enjoyed the album knowing that its trash lol
When it&#39;s dark out
A ZERO OMG HAHAH LOL
you guys really hate all the songs on this album?? maybe I&#39;m just different than yall but I liked a couple of the slow ballads..songs that you instantly feel a connection with for example handle with care wasn&#39;t bad at all.
SB2H is amazing
Fuck all of you
do nothin,nowhere - bummer
Mr. Fantano! Excellent Review. I am new to your channel but from what I have seen so far, its nice to see there are reviewers that do not shy away from being painfully honest about the content artists put out. I was also unimpressed with this project. I have also been able to observe that you typically like to drop your reviews promptly after the albums are dropped but, I was curious if you would consider reviewing TRAPSOUL by Bryson Tiller even though, it was dropped a few months ago. I am interested in your opinion of this new Trap RnB type sound that has been buzzing lately (Bryson Tiller, Post Malone, Tory Lanez). Anyways, if not, thanks for your views regardless. <br><br><br>Cheers, <br><br>New TND Fan
fucking hilarious lmao idk tf happened to cudi man..
Calassic &gt; speeding bullet 2 heaven
aLbum with a captial L
Do a review of The Suffering Spirit by Old Wounds. Probably my favorite album of the year. Brutal Jersey Metalcore!
thats one shit album cover
I liked it fuck the rest
u make it so hard not to get butt hurt goddamn
dat papa franku reference tho.  Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞
this is so sad! his first album was a classic
&quot;If I cared about the blogs, then I&#39;d probably be a jackass&quot; - Scott Mescudi
+theneedledrop I STILL DOUBT THAT YOU ACTUALLY LISTENED TO LORE. The fact that you only talked about it for 30 seconds and all you could say was that it sounds like sabbath and that the band has yet to carve a niche for itself is evidence of that. While generally every stoner metal band gives a nod to Black Sabbath, Elder, especially in this particular album, does not do so as much as nearly any other group in the genre, hell, less so than Goatsnake in &quot;Black Age Blues&quot;. Lore is far more psychedelic, progressive, almost post-rock-esque, than Black Sabbath and their many contemporary clones, and sonically does not draw a heavy comparison to the fathers of metal. For me Lore will go down as the greatest album of 2015 BY FAR, not only have I not heard a better album this year, but I CAN&#39;T SAY THAT I HAVE EVER HEARD A BETTER ALBUM (I can&#39;t name one and I&#39;ve heard the entire Beatles and Led Zeppelin discography), and I&#39;m not sure that I ever will. You say the band has not carved a niche for themselves but if you had actually listened to the band you would know that they already had even before producing this masterpiece, and now they definitely have found their niche as an ambitious band whose goal is clear: to write masterpieces. The fact that you shrugged it off as a black sabbath sound a like is heavily irksome to me because it is so so so so much more than that. I don&#39;t expect you to ever go back and talk about it again but please give it another listen (if you ever actually gave a first listen) because your review here does not come close to giving it justice and IF YOU REALLY DID LISTEN TO THE ALBUM AND THAT IS ALL THAT YOU GOT FROM IT THEN YOU ARE MISSING OUT and I can no longer see any validity in your opinions.
I love all CuDi shit I don&#39;t know about you guys
I ain&#39;t get tired seen this! It&#39;s too funny all the shit that antoine fantoine throws hahahaha
Ever since &quot;Day N Nite&quot;, &quot;Prayer&quot;, and &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;,   I&#39;ve been trying to make myself like Cudi cause I was such a big fan of his moody hip-hop that other hip-hop artists never did. Cudi was special, but starting from Mr.Rager, Cudi is making it very hard for me to like his music. Been trying to be a loyal fan of him but his new interests in this indie rock music is just bad. Cudi is just not a good vocalist, period. WZRD was painful, and now this is worst. I have mad respect for Cudi for doing what he loves and walking his own path, but for me, I&#39;m out.
i actually laughed in this video
savage lol
Kid Cudi is the living embodiment of every black person&#39;s bad taste in rock music.
LMAO!!! Holy shit!!!
Holy shit, dude is definitely not a fan of Cudi.
Maybe a good dose  of some psychedelics would further your understanding,  although your critiquing of clearly more talented and fascinating individuals would probably lose some of its appeal.
this guy can have his opinion but if your a fain of cudi music then you&#39;ll like anything he puts out.
Haha seriously? i&#39;ve only heard the first elven minutes, but i&#39;m down with it, the dude clearly feels more then the average individual and is always pushing the envelope of expression, go listen to generic beats with catchy hooks, instead of being self-righteous hater.
Looool you said a migraine hahaha its that deep? Lol this album was that bad? Haha, i deff gotta check this out now
I don&#39;t fvck w/ this dude at alllll. Anyone who listens to this guy doesn&#39;t know good music. He called MOTM 2 mediocre even though that&#39;s like peak Cudi. Cud Cobain is playing on a frequency only few can hear
review: G-Eazy &quot;When It&#39;s Dark Out&quot;
Indicud and like 2 songs on Satellite Flight were decent, but this album was shit. Cudi needs to get his life together.
Fuck this, he&#39;s just tryna make music that he wants to make.. He never said it was rap or hip/hop, fuck y&#39;all
review was fire
Pause-upnause, then hit 2, 4 and 8. Or 2, 8 and 4 but slightly faster.
If you just vibe with it. its not bad at all
Obviously he isnt going to give a good review if he didnt even like cudis old stuff
ty fantano for this 10/10 review, review my Christmas Gas: A Telling of Classic Christmas Folk Tales through the Art of Farts
he could of made a much better album everyone that says the like really mean they like hes old album
After listening to the first half or so - I liked Embers. That&#39;s about it though.
Well Fantano, I give you props, I couldn&#39;t get through 6 songs.
His Big Sean review was worse all he said was NO the whole video lol
I listened to 3 songs and then had to throw in the towel. Utterly disappointed I was.
please review &quot;When it&#39;s dark out&quot; by g-eazy and &quot;Rays of Resistance&quot; by Na√¢man
how can i get you to review a mixtape of mine?
this album grew in me.<br>much like a tumor
NeedleDrop you need to hold this L for this review. Dead Wrong on this.
All his albums had great songs on them, motm 1&amp;2 were great, indicudi is pretty good, satellite flight was pretty good... But this is just not good at alll
Hey Anthony, could you please do a review of &quot;Living Room Songs&quot; by √ìlafur Arnalds? It&#39;s an amazing album, and a wonderful exhibit of neo-classical music. It is also available on vinyl.
This review!!! TAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
holy shit you just said that Cudi has no talent? this man inspired all your favourite rappers and you said that he doesn&#39;t have talent? fuck outta here
Weird enough I think he is doing a great job reflecting our world. He is doing the job of an artist. I enjoy this thought. Go CuDi...I think
he&#39;s great on Comedy Bang Bang tho , even his music there is better than reggie watts
Polaris LP in the Background.
I was hoping he would say &quot;I&#39;m feeling a <b>light</b> zero on this one&quot;. lmao.
Are you planning to do a review on the new Coldplay album?
A Head Full of Dreams - Coldplay

Review G-Eazy&#39;s new Album When It&#39;s Dark Out
first time i saw him being so mad over an album lmao
Literally as bad as papa franks cooking
Anthony&#39;s not reviewing that new Jadakiss album .. Reasons?
indicud was not bad take that back punk
He have him a 0 üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüíØ
Confused was not bad actually, on the first listen.... then it got boring.
Do the new Mutemath album!
Kid Cuddly kek
To the Kurt cobain comments . Sure you can see a lot of inspiration from Kurt but Kurt had a similar mindset as cudi obviously. Cudi still is wildly original with his melodies like always. To the he&#39;s crazy comments NOSHIT this album is what it&#39;s like for people with mental problems who can grasp what life is supposed to be .
Don&#39;t listen to this man! The album is great and truly represents Cudi has a person. The simplicity is not a bad thing. It&#39;s his melodies that have always been his signature. The melodies he creates over his simple guitar which he plays himself are crazy beautiful. Also the lyrics accurately represent not only depression but the depth of our minds. It&#39;s the same Cudi just an evolved sound of him.
Cudi used to help his fans with depression, now he&#39;s making them depressed. I am a HUGE fan of the guy but this is some bullshit. He should be paying people to listen to this, not the other way around. Scott...come back...pls.
Project underwhelming as hell
I can&#39;t seem to find any of the depressing/suicidal/drug addiction lines from kid cudi&#39;s songs that anthony was referring to? Someone point me to them please?
Shoutout to the filthy frank hair cake shoutout. 1 like = 1 prayer for those who know what im talking about
That song Seance chaos reminds me that song Institutionalized by Suicidal tendencies, anyway its pretty terrible even by punk standards.
I cant wait for the DeadendHipHop review of this !!!
review my homework
Rodeo is MOTM3. <br><br>T H A T &#39; S    I T.
Honest review
Thought project was meh
Cal is right bro. Yea he dont sing so well and music is simple but still its solid and its like he is seeing the light at the end of the tunnel wzrd was trippy and satelite was wtf but atleast we are on solid land now and its pretty good. Although if could id put Kurt cobains voice over his
A 0....mother of God. I really hope kid cudi is just fucking with all of us, and MOTM 3 is like some ridiculously dope album. Shout out to the dumbasses who bought the album.
review  MMM-PUFF daddy
damn 0!!? wonder what travis scott thinks of the album?
When I first heard this album I thought Cudi was straight brain dead off acid. I wish his &quot;fans&quot; would stop pretending this trash is good. Super disappointed, RIP MOTM 1
this album was ACTUALLY painful to listen to
g eazy next?
Has he reviewed The Good Fight album by Oddisee yet?
Terrible album. I think the vocals on this and the new grimes album are some of the most annoying I&#39;ve heard all year.
HA this dude said &quot; kids drugs won&#39;t help you make good music,&quot; then went on to say &quot; or this will happen&quot;, funny
People are mad cause Cudi decided to not spit/rap anymore<br>But production of the more punk/rock tracks are not uo to the quality of legendary punk rock groups such motorhead, green day, system of a down, sum 41 etc<br>He should have collaborated with those i think to improve the quality production wise for the rock songs cause the guitat is like a kid on fruity loops who just found the electronic guitar<br>Overall ill give it a 6/10 6.5/10 <br>But everything up to Indicud was Dope
Man im a huge kid cudi fan and have defended some of his awful songs but godamn i cannot listen to this.
That was funny<br>Thats all i can say
I love Indicud and both Man on the Moon&#39;s. WZRD and Satellite Flight: The Journey to Mother Moon are pretty good as well. This though is just.. NAH.
Fuck all you, kid Cudi is the best.
So, Anthony really enjoyed this album, eh?...
Cal chuchesta&#39;s mixtape is better than this
I respect it. I respecit man, but I do enjoy his musics. It just raw oddness. I don&#39;t think that he&#39;s the greatest, but he&#39;s pretty chill. Like the most basic depressed person, who you can&#39;t understand, because they fail to explain themselves well or even in a very coherent way.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=588">9:48</a> &quot;Kid Cuddly&quot;
lol what a funny boy. I&#39;m enjoying it, art be like that sometimes.
Review &quot;When It&#39;s Dark Out&quot; By G-Eazy!
Hold up, he gave Fetty Wap&#39;s shit a 5? And this a 0?
I kinda liked it.
Speedin&#39; Bullet to the trash can.
Nah this shit is good bruh, just way ahead of its time.
I was so frustrated and disappointed with this record! I miss the old KidCudi
Cudi: <b>releases a track of fart noises</b> <br><br><br>Stans: &quot;Kid Cudi is an artist you wouldn&#39;t understand&quot;
He ruined his career. even if Cudi releases another Rap album that&#39;s better than Illmatic, nobody will listen
Bigthony Dicktano
Chasing the devil by Krayzie bone!!!!!
I didn&#39;t even pay for this album and I want my money back üòÇ
Anthony went full nostalgia critic  haha
g eazy album pls
And what WAS the actual worst album you&#39;ve heard this year?
Coldplay   ----   Head Full of Dreams
your dumb for saying indicud was trash...that shit was gold. but yeah this project was <br>wack, totally agree
More like Speedin Bullet To My Brain
Comparing this album to his others bro this is trash im so disappointed üòë
Satellite Flight is a worthwhile album if you&#39;re down for some chill tunes.
his album is trash...
Lol when he said about taking drugs and making an album will end up being like Speedin&#39; Bullet. Only Chance can pull that shit off with Acid Rap
I like Edge of the Earth in a &quot;random dude with 100 followers I found on Soundcloud&quot; kinda way
I will forever stand by cudi
you might be the most annoying youtuber i&#39;ve come across :/ you just bash on shit it&#39;s pathetic. All music is good to the person who made it, your just 1 irrelevant opinion
Sums it up. I liked the cunt song though.
I like how Anthony goes all the way in every now and then to remind us hes not fucking around
Color Money?
This doesn&#39;t suck it&#39;s just not the cudi you all want him to be, going for a different thing now man
God I just wasted 8 minutes of life listening to you critique an artist who was willing to do something different. If this was such an &quot;awful record&quot; please do me favor and try to make some better music yourself!
Review G Eazy
The album art is sick though.
HAIR CAKE!!!
Worse than Miley??? Damn.
god damn. this is hilarious
This album is meant for you to listen to when your on lSD. Trust me its awesome when you trip.
Review g eazy when it&#39;s dark out
anyone else think Cudi is gonna off himself after motm3 ?
Stitches-For Drug Dealers Only review
After the song love, I though kid cudi was coming back in the best way. RIP
This album was awesome, Anthony fantano is blind . Love adventures, wedding tux , confused, speeding bullet to heaven.
Tbh im not the biggest kid cudi fan but i listened to this album cause i liked all of his other albums (except for indicud) and cause i listen to every new rap album (although this isn&#39;t a rap album) to get a feel for it and im not the biggest rock/grunge/punk fan but i will say that i actually enjoyed this album and of course just like every album there are some flaws. Cudi was just experimenting and figuring out what works and what doesn&#39;t. Also,i loved the beavis and butthead skits,i think it sorta fit the whole punk rock sound this album tried to give. All and all this isn&#39;t cudis best piece of art but its definitely not his worst. On a scale of 1-10,i&#39;d give it a 6.5. Im really hoping cudi will come back strong and blow us out of the water with MOTM 3 whenever its coming out or if it even ever will come out
Worse than Dark Sky Paradise?
Yeah this &quot;Album&quot; was kinda unnecessary. I hope Cudi enjoyed making it for himself at least...but even if so its not exactly like hes coming from a good place.<br>The only tracks worth keeping and hearing again I feel are Screwed, Man In The Night, Adventures, Handle With Care, Speedin Bullet 2 Heaven &amp; Melting.. for their creative process and melodic appeals.. I am still patient for Man on The Moon 3 but its like Damn wheres that fuck up the rap game and flex mojo so dope Mr cudi at?..Wasnt that the image for him now in this time &amp; space?
I agree with everything you are saying
Judgemanthony Cuntano ripping cudi to shreds hahahaha
Review &quot;When it&#39;s Dark Out&quot;
This was one of the best albums I ever heard and if you only love hip hop as much as this guy does you won&#39;t like the album , this album was great for what it was meant to be , you all are the worst ppl to say some shit is trash cuz you don&#39;t like it just say u don&#39;t like it in your opinion , yall hate cuz it&#39;s not for you lol
&quot;No more chicken sandwiches,Yes,i&#39;ll pay for the damages&quot;OH MY GOD KILL ME RIGHT NOW.
i needed this review  to make sure you were a good critic
I hope he adds this album as one of the great albums of December
NEEDLEDROP i would love to see a review of fightin words by diabolic
Anthony yet again spewing off about nothing. Cudi has always been heavily influenced by both Kurt Cobain and Pink Floyd. Always. If you knew his music, or anything about him personally...you kind of knew that. He&#39;s always thrown us small hints at thus specific vibe or sound through songs with Ratatat, Knux and other songs with heavy drums, or catchy guitar riffs. Different tones but same idea. He&#39;s doing him and I loved the album. Cudi has battled depression for the longest but he is also funny which is why he has Beavis and Butthead. He&#39;s just like us; fucked up but great beings. I think some people are just too shallow to appreciate it. Or maybe you have personally never had to battle depression before. His song called &quot;Love&quot; if you haven&#39;t heard it..please go to search it on here now.
TRAVIS SCOTT HAS STOLEN HIS SOUL. SERIOUSLY
Damn Kid Cudi. What the hell.
Man On The Moon 2 &gt;  Man On The Moon 1
Cudi is now the 37 year old Kobe of Hip-Hop
Antoine, I think I&#39;m not alone when I say I&#39;m curious about your thoughts on that new G-Eazy Album, When It&#39;s Dark Out. idek bruh bruh
He changed his music i dont like it
God damn I love when he rages lmaooo
This is soooo disappointing man! Big cudi fan but this last album just made me cringe! I honest to god skipped over every song a minute in. I hope, I PRAY my nigga that MOTM 3 will be nothing like this :/ <br><br><br>I had to resort to G-Eazy because it was so bad.
i&#39;m not gonna lie... i think half the album is trash and half of it is mind blowing good. im a die hard Scott mescudi fan... so whatever makes him happy makes me 20x happier
I really don&#39;t give a shit what you say I still love this album and its really entertaining
lol I never really liked Kid Cudi myself.
Kid Cudo album more disappointing than family guy since season 10
Judgemental Cunts
Wow, a ZERO!!! LMAOOOOO!!!
That album cover is distracting
aww dayum why you gotta do em like that anthony why
i would probably listen to cudi&#39;s music if i could tolerate him but i can&#39;t.. i just think he is an undercover homosexual and i think that is the source of all his depression and pseudo weirdness.. everytime i look him up he&#39;s saying something about playing a gay role or sticking up for gays.. he kissed a male fan once also.. i think he is bi
Cudi my nigga, and I guess I actually like it that all these people wanna stop listening to Cud, that means no more fake fans that just want hip hop albums, Cudi stays true to himself and his creative craft, sounding the same is boring, if you had a skill wouldn&#39;t you challenge yourself to do something awesome with it?
Review Jeremih&#39;s Late Nights album please! Would love to hear your thoughts on its place in the current wall of sound/volume wars climate of radio r&amp;b
Our dear man on the moon is trying to transcend hip-hop, but it appears his lift-off occurred too soon, and much like the challenger, came down in flames, but I still don&#39;t think it deserves a zero, some songs may lead to a better attempt next time, like adventures, edge of the earth, insides out, and I actually like handle with care, it&#39;s punk rock it&#39;s not like his voice has to sound as smooth as Michael jacksons.... But damn Anthony you murked cudi in this review.
Damn none of y&#39;all have nothing good to say about cudi, cudi is the originator this album was sick all the songs were good to me, y&#39;all are just some basic asses, for those who say they don&#39;t like t just don&#39;t get it or can&#39;t relate or are just close minded. Just because cudi started off as a &quot;rapper&quot; you guys want to automatically start comparing it to man on the moon. You guys remind me of those niggas that say they love the old Kanye there is no old Kanye there is only Kanye. And there is only cudi and he continues to put out new dope shit everytime. I challenge everyone to to put aside the past and look at this for what it is without comparing, if not, we just aren&#39;t on the same frequency. And as for you Anthony if anyone has a big ego it&#39;s you, your opinions on music is shit, it&#39;s stupid to review an album when you first hear it, every music listener knows you feel differently after understanding and listening to it more, but I&#39;m sure you review right away for views for your chann
boy hell Na all y&#39;all niggas trippin, kid kudi shit go hard af, you dont understand kudi that&#39;s why you hatin
do  g eazy&#39;s new album
Review Erykah Badu&#39;s new mixtape please!!!!
The sad part is that Cudi isn&#39;t a bad artist. Not-so-good rapper, a fair singer, amazing instrumentalist, and a wonderful ear for music. I&#39;m a die hard Cudi fan. I enjoyed EVERY project of his especially End of the Day. However, I listen to this and it makes me sad. If Man on the Moon 3 sounds anything like this, I think I will give up on Cudi all together. Dude seriously needs to go back to the drawing board, think through, then piece together his next project carefully because this album just pulled Cudi deep down a rabbit that he&#39;s gonna have to work hard to get out of. Once again, I&#39;m a die hard Kid Cudi fan but this album was just horrible.
THAT FILTHY REFERENCE THO
I disagree when he says his singing is bad. Cudi has unique singing and it sounds satisfying. Not everyone needs a Justin bieber voice to sing
yeah, was let down by this big time, massive cudi fan, and if he released this as a mixtape, fine, but this shit will put people off buying motm3 cause it is so stale as you said, same riffs over and over too much distortion, the only song i did like was adventure,  cause of the drum loop, then was like wtf at the moist vagina line ha
please review Erykah Badu&#39;s new mixtape &quot;But U Caint Use My Phone&quot;
Miley Cyrus had a higher rating than Kid Cudi. Think about that for a sec.
also trip to this album before you judge
i remember listening to a kid named cudi and i thought he was gonna become one of the most unique and biggest rappers out. man it sucks that he fell off i hope he rediscovers what made his music great in the past
unless your one of the troubled folk that this music is made for, you won&#39;t understand or like his music. I admit he isn&#39;t a great singer or guitarist but damn at least he&#39;s bold enough to literally make every sound on the album, idk man his notes strike nerves for me. it&#39;s intended for people who know pain, yall don&#39;t have to like it but to ALOT of people this guy is a prophet, regardless he&#39;s an artist being true to himself going his own path, you at least got to give respect
pretty awful
fantano a chump but i agree with this review... this album buns. Nobody trying to hear no grunge rock album.
I liked it for the most part
I like this album.........Sorry üò¨
couldnt of been worse then dark sky paradise, cause you acually said words other then &quot;no&quot;
2015 YOUTUBE VIDEO AWARDS : BEST REVIEW VIDEO
I stopped listening after a kid named cudi, everything after this sucks.
LOL I love this
Indicud wasn&#39;t awful
10/10....I loved it :)
ok it can&#39;t be this bad he has to be over reacting. <b>listens to it</b> ......oh god it&#39;s so bad
How can you have a review when the album JUST came out ????
I wish he would just realize this shit is trash and go back to his sound on MOTM but instead he&#39;s too busy trying to be like Kurt cobain smh.
well I know what to expect for classics week 2030. you&#39;ll come around.
interesting year... first a perfect 10, now a perfect 0
shoutout to Needledrop, he is needed in the game !!! dope video, really didn&#39;t see that 0 coming, I thought the intro was decent, and the &quot;Mary Quite Contrary&quot; song was decent, that might of been good enough for a 1, but the album was definitely terrible, even for Kid Cudi standards !!!
THIS MAN REALLY GAVE HIM A ZERO LMAOOüòÇ
BrandUn DeShay - &#39;goldUn Child&#39; or Kevin Gates &#39;Islah.&#39; Maybe Curren$y&#39;s &quot;Canal Street Confidential.&#39;
You know what? I liked his debut his second and wizard.<br><br>This is shit
Anthony Fantoin, you are cancer :(
THAT FILTHY FRANK REFERENCE THOOOO.
Soooo yall didn&#39;t enjoy The Nothing????
i love this album yo idc
its a good album. i like it
I am so disappointed with this ablum :,(
Man on the moon is one of my favorite albums of all time, I also really man on the moon 2, indicud was fine there was some really songs on there some not so much, satellite flight i enjoyed somewhat most of it was trash but again there was some songs on there that i liked and still listened too. This album is fucking garbage. every single song on this album was just horrible i cant support kid cudi anymore he has progressively gotten worse over his carrer but has continued to somewhat entertain me so i stuck with him but speedin&#39; bullet to heaven is just awful and it makes me really sad
first time i agree with your fatass
Can you review No Cielings 2? I know you&#39;re probably tired of Wayne reviews so could you review it in relation to No Cielings?
I SAW THAT FILTHY FRANK REFERENCE
Still better than Hopsins album lol
Erykah Badu?
LMFAO!! This review is satire at its best. Good review
ZERO!? HAHAHAHAHAHAHA YES ANTHONY!
new erykah badu mixtape review pls
THIS ALBUM WAS TERRIBLE
No one should base what they listen to on what a reviewer says music is completely based on your own perspective. You should definitely listen to an album before listening to a review
I don&#39;t agree with you on a lot of things, Anthony. But for the first time in a long time, I do. This album is shit. I respect Cudi for staying true to himself though. Too bad it&#39;s full of shit.
I really respect your opinion.  .  . and I agree with this video but I do feel you should check out Satellite Flight its a really good album
this is the most accurate review anthony has ever done my lord
I still like this album better than to pimp a butterfly<br>That shit was awful lol
still no review of But You Caint Use My Phone by Erykah Badu?
Hahahahaahaha this is the most hilarious review I&#39;ve seen by far
Bunch of haters, and this nigga got nothing better to do than criticize someone else shit. I&#39;d like to see this nigga try and make an album so people can rip this douche a new one
How can you say Indicud was bad? Wtf sometimes Anthony is a total madman.
Review EARTHGANGS new album Strays With Rabies
Allahuak bar I&#39;m throwin some hot bars
Are you going to go over the new AnCo single?
I liked the cover for the album more than the music.
review the new Erykah Badu album?
This is NOT rock. Good lord this was a pretty bad record, in my opinion of course. Do you plan on reviewing the new Coldplay record? Love or hate, I like them and wanna see your thoughts...
Embers is great.
Tyga&#39;s album is better than this shit wtf Cudi....
Lol best video you&#39;ve put out in a while. It really is a bafflingly bad album.
Not really his best compared to his other albums,but still has a couple songs I fuck wit.
Cudi was my favorite years ago. MOTM was a hit to me. MOTMII had me question a bit, but I stayed faithful cuz the concert tour for that album was sick. Didn&#39;t feel WZRD cuz I figured he wanted to try something different, he&#39;s allowed to do that. He&#39;s an artist. Indicud had me scratching my head but I liked a couple songs. But I&#39;m done after that. Rap Cudi is dead. Alt Rock Cudi lives and is here to stay. Bring back Emile and Plain Pat!!!!!
Not gonna review when it&#39;s dark out? I ain&#39;t biggest G-eazy fan but that album straight fire üî•
one of the best albums  this year along with TPAB (in my opinion)<br>beautiful i love when artist willing to take risks this what music needs mfs that dont&#39;t fucking care.
What a reminder that tastes in music are completely subjective. This guy gave Waka&#39;s &quot;Flockaveli 1.5&quot; mixtape a &quot;strong 7 to a light 8&quot;, but gave this album a zero/10 simply because he thinks everything sucks about it. It&#39;s quite hilarious. I enjoyed Cudi&#39;s album, &amp; Flockaveli 1.5 bored me. But do I think F1.5 deserves a zero/10? Nope, because there was some things I liked about it. If you hated the project enough to give it a zero/10 that means you liked nothing about it. It is hypocritical to yap about what you liked about it if you hated it completely. Gosh, I wonder if he bodied the new Coldplay album this hard.
do its dark out
lmfao this nigga really¬†gave¬†it a zero bahahahahahah
Anthony have you heard anything from Suicide Boys? If not, look em up
portishead record that&#39;s cool
Traaaasshhhhhh
this is unlistenable trash from top to bottom, how and why does this exist
Fuck this guy !
ah I love this album so much hah
Anthony Fantano, the internet  busiest music narcissist.
cudi has too many yes mans around
I agree with u on this one Fabiano
I had to put this album on just to hear how terrible it is. It&#39;s pretty terrifying tbh fam.
kid Cudi&#39;s album is Certified Platinum L.
i actually like this album :(
I actually liked Indicud though. It was different cool. This..... This is straight ass. There is no way Scott Mesecudi could release anything worse than this. Lord help my damage ears.
i actually liked the album
I agree with you 100000% I tried by best to respect Kid Cudi for bearing through a territory he is not familiar but it&#39;s like he didn&#39;t even try. He also tried to make the production like in the Montage of Heck soundtrack. He is playing like Kurt Cobain. Like a costume. It&#39;s shitty because he is battling through depression with this album but it&#39;s just not good. Not even in experimental terms.
This album was no good, but I kinda think this guy hates Kudi.
The fact that I have always thought that Kid Cudi was a horrible artist makes me feel really good about myself.
Why haven&#39;t you done G Eazy album yet
Your not joking about the headache. Damn Kudi, come back.. or take a break.
Lupe dying right about now.
This album ahead of its time fam. Y&#39;all just wasn&#39;t ready for it.
Do Mos Def - Black on Both Sides!
Do Mos Def - Black on Both Sides!
when lil dicky gets a better score than cudi
Review the new prog rock album from famous cat lil bub.¬† I&#39;m not kidding.
◊ó◊ó◊ó◊ó◊ó ◊§◊†◊ò◊†◊ï ◊ô◊ê ◊ê◊ó
Wait, is &quot;Love&quot; on MOTM 3 cuz thats the best recent shit he&#39;s put out.
drake took all the power from cudi
There are a lot of record reviews where I disagree with Anthony. I accept that our tastes are just different in that way. But this was one review that is absolutely on point. This record is so bad it&#39;s nearly drags down the quality of Cudi&#39;s past work. Burn it, Scott. Never speak of it again.
&quot;Started releasing some of the worst music of this decade&quot; oh my damn!!
I&#39;ve never seen Anthony so pissed off before lol
Cudi&#39;s fans need to stop feeding him positivity on Twitter and shit. This is the result; a shitty ass album. I miss old cudi
do you think cudi knew it was shit and said fuck everyone and released it anyway?
he turns into angry music nerd :3
Rick Ross, currency
Erykah Badu&#39;s latest mixtape. Something to cure the migraine bruh
NO! NO! LMFAO
to say there are no good songs on the album is just ignorant
This album is that bad?
It&#39;s a couple songs I like...
cudi needs to go back to spitting like he did on the mixtapes
He said this was the worst of the year and he just said no the whole Big Sean review this must be pretty fuckin terrible
Cudi impression is spot on.<br><br>This album is worse than Lulu.
lmaoooo i was waiting for this review, album is straight trash
As a die hard Cudi fan, I can honestly say this album was definitely a bad. But he remains my favorite artist because despite this nosedive of an album, he still managed to make a song that literally made me cry and I love it!! &quot;Fairy Tale Remains&quot; I mean.
His mix-tape and Man on the Moon 1&amp;2 where amazing to me but after that he kind of fell off for me. Indicud was alright kind of lack luster and Satellite flight was was also underwhelming as well.
I know I&#39;m not the only one waiting for Biq Quint to review this shit lmfao!<br>Kid Cudi should have stayed with G.O.O.D. Music, and maybe he would have been releasing dope projects. This album is honestly the last straw for me. Cudi is just making straight garbage music. On this album, he is just trying way too hard to be Kurt Cobain.
There is something incredibly cathartic about watching Anthony just tear into an album.
Could u review some russian pop music like Kirkorov? please
i just started listening to man on the moon and have been bumping day n night and pursuit of happiness. Fuck I thought he was good
wassupp, based on your taste in hip-hop I think you&#39;d really enjoy this new track by up and coming NYC conscious hip-hop aritst Zev Prince.........if you enjoy the vibes check out some of his other tracks too <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23necessarydistortion">#NecessaryDistortion</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23distort">#DISTORT</a> <a href="https://soundcloud.com/zev-prince/psa-prod-by-mf-doom">https://soundcloud.com/zev-prince/psa-prod-by-mf-doom</a>
Repeat after me my subjective judgmental internetlings:<br>I am entitled to the music that I want and expect from whatever musician I listen to!<br>Music is not art, I expect a musicians progress to be linear and uniform!<br>If I dont like the music, that means the music is bad! <br>If I dont like the music, that means the musician is bad!<br>Music belongs in a box, dont let it out!
review g-eazy&#39;s album
I can&#39;t even believe this album happened. I made it to AMEN and just couldn&#39;t do it anymore. I honestly wondered how I made it that far until I realized I wasn&#39;t taking a single thing seriously. It almost sounds like Kid Cudi knows it&#39;s bad and is fucking with me. And even still I just stopped. <br><br>Best part about this album was the Beavis and Butthead skits. I&#39;m amazed I actually wrote that sincerely.
Kudi knows exactly what hes doing
It&#39;s definitely different to his other stuff, but I wouldn&#39;t say its that bad, i&#39;d give it like a 6/10
Someone he hates more than Hopsin? huh...
What an accurate score.
<b>listens to Nirvana once</b>

REVIEW SADISTIK AND KNO - PHANTOM LIMBS!!!!!
me listening to this album <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=119">1:59</a>
crushing ym dreams man lmfao thankyou for saving my ears
indicudi is my fav cudi project but this was not good
It takes a special taste in music to like SBTH..but I understand the less fortunate people who just can&#39;t vibe to it. You just don&#39;t have the mindset me and some others have
KID CUDI LET ME THE FUCK DOWN MAN! FUCK. THIS IS THE WORST ALBUM I&#39;VE HEARD EVER. CUDI&#39;S EGO IS FUCKING HIM UP
This is fucking history in the making. Glad I was here on yt to witness the first ever big fat goose egg.
my nigga fantano went harder in this video than meek mills whole career
fuckin hilarious! #0
Kid Cudi fans that defend this album because &quot;he&#39;s going a different direction&quot; probably would never even think about listening to bands that possibly inspired this album
Review In Absentia - porcupine tree!
You should do G-eazys new album
when it&#39;s dark out. when it&#39;s dark out. when it&#39;s dark out. when it&#39;s dark out.
I can say that I loved WZRD and enjoyed it way more than SB2H, there was a couple of songs that still have that old Cudi vibe for ex: Edge of the earth. But like every other OG Cudi fan, I wish he went back to rapping. It&#39;s cool that he&#39;s experimenting with rock and shit, but it&#39;s just not that enjoyable no more. Satellite Flight EP is probably the last thing closest to old Cudi we will get. R.I.P. MOTM 3
i normally don&#39;t like just all out rage, but when it&#39;s coming from someone who&#39;s opinion i trust (and at least presents himself as fairly positive most of the time) it&#39;s popcorn-eating, stupid grin inducing kind of good. album is 0, this review is a 10<br><br>god bless you fantano
can someone make a playlist of reviews where anthony totally trashes albums?
Your a big fat goose egg
Been looking forward to MOTM 3 for years and each new album he&#39;s released that hasn&#39;t been it I&#39;ve just gotten more impatient and disillusioned. Now I don&#39;t even look forward to it anymore because of his track record
&quot;more rock reviews&quot;<br>absolute haram
&quot;The Return of Chip Douglas&quot; was fire bro...
man, even BIEBER got a better review...cudi what were you thinking... :&#39;(
cleanse your pallet and listen/ review Tall Can - Fungi.Psych(E).Boots
i feel like he should have rap more on the album
The filthy frank reference
Even though I love cudi,  this album makes me want to die
Cudi got fuckin ethered by Fantwon! Crossed that nigga into the shadow realm holy shit!
RIP KID CUDI.
Remember when Cudi tweeted about how everyone is so &quot;easily amused and impressed with mediocity&quot;? ....then he puts out this garbage. Wtf m8
I really only liked the song confused
+theneedledrop mannn can you make a top ten songs list for fugaziiii they&#39;re my favourite and I see you&#39;re quite interested in their discog as well.  Also maybe you could make a vid talking about innerband and innergroup feuds/beefs after what&#39;s happening in OF with Hodgy.  Oh and for Classics week for sure do moon and antac or lonesome crowed westtttt, or pavement or daydreamm nation, that&#39;s it Anthony,<br><br>Cheers
&quot;Kid cudi fell off sanity&quot; sadly true
i love the kid cudi vibe
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=559">9:19</a><br>NEVER FORGET <br>Finally, Anthony gave all possible scores to at least one of the projects he reviews. <br>üëè
There&#39;s nowt like a bad review to cheer ya up - had me in tears of laughter.
review the new nxworries ep!!
He straight up just killed Cudi
His first legitimate 0.
wow
He needs Kanye!!!! Lmao
The amount of disappointment I felt listening to this album and that&#39;s coming from a cudi fan
LMAO IF U DONT DO DRUGS THEN WHY U JUDGING THIS ALBUM. GO DO SOME DMT AND MUSHROOMS AND LSD AND SEE IF UR OKAY WITH THIS WORLD. F*CK U ND AND EVERYONE ELSE WHO THINKS THEY KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT KID CUDI :)
Wheres your album at ND????
This album was straight balls...just straight balls
no erykah badu?
You should review the new Tennyson EP &quot;Like What&quot; :) Keep up the awesome work.
Fuck you. Wrong about all of it.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=395">6:35</a> MOIST VAGINA BY NIRVANA HOW FUCKING TRY HARD KURT COBAIN CAN YOU BE CUDI?????
Does this guy have any music credentials to be making any music opinions?
wheres erykah badu review?
I am a huge Cudi fan. I thought Satellite Flight was decent and I thought Indicud was a little underrated. But this is just trash.  His ego on twitter is just ridiculous. He can only really make good music when he is miserable. Which is sad.
Kid Cudi always been mediocre, so stop over rating his ass. this album is alright imo, it had A LOT of really unenjoyable songs but it actually had some really good fuckin songs. Like I was amazed, but yeah I really hope Cudi makes his next album directly for the fans. Yeah, yeah, yeah... he has to &quot;keep on doing him&quot; right? nigga he&#39;s been &quot;doing him&quot; for the past 5 fuckin years. Kid Cudi needs to stop being a dam selfish dick and put out MOTM 3 next year. For the fans Cudi, strictly for the fans
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=541">9:01</a> LMAOOOO honestly I am close to tears at how much Anthony is stressing at this point üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
apex kek, even though i dunoo how in the fuk you gave dance gavin dance and lil dicky a 1 lmao
PORTISHEAD DUMMY
can you review rolo tomassi - grievances ? :))
Cudi needs to get on that coke and start rapping again.
I honestly think it takes more than 2 days to fully dig this album..but whatever
I agree completely, I used to be one of the biggest Cudi fans back in the day, and even could find a few songs on WZRD, Indicud, and Satellite Flight that were decent, but this monstrosity has officially killed the love for Kid Cudi inside of me. He once had so much going for him, and then he just died. Cudi I hate you now, and you ruined all of your music for me, I might delete every song I have. fuck you
Anthony, this is your Magnum Opus...
review g-eazy so you can shit on him because he is trash!
im personally offended you have dummy in the background.  it&#39;s just sitting there watching.... mocking....
There is no way in hell that the same man made Day n Nite
review when its dark out
Does this guy even have any music credentials to be making any opinions on any music?
All these Cudi Stans defending this shit. Comparing this shit to Jimi Hendrix. I bet if Cudi posted a picture of his shit on his instagram these stans would compare that shit to Picasso.
You&#39;re always bashing cudi, if you don&#39;t like him why listen to his stuff and review it?
You really need to review the following bands:<br><br>RDGLDGRN <br>Duckwrth and the Kickdrums<br>GARY CLARK JR!!!!!<br>Vacationer<br>RDGLDGRN<br>FIDLAR<br>Benjamin Booker<br>RDGLDGRN <br>Leon Bridges<br>GARY CLARK JR!!!!<br>RDGLDGRN <br>GARY CLARK JR!!!!!!!!!
This was a pretty funny review üòÇ
you saying how bad it is makes me interested, it might transcend into so bad it funny good territory.
all of you are stupid judging cudi. he&#39;s doing what he wants because he doesn&#39;t need your approval. all you guys are wasting your life judging material instead of making it. BTW Anthony Fantano talking about bevis and butt head in the album reveals he didn&#39;t listen to all of it because they are on shrooms that cudi gave them hahahha. I love cudi for doing what he wants. fuck impressing your sorry asses that are not open minded enough to appreciate it. Cudi said it himself he&#39;s done with man on the moon so stop comparing him to his old self. people change and so does their music.
you just had to throw that hair cake home in there, didn&#39;t you?
Thumbs up for the anti drug statements.
Well at least MBDTF got a higher review
I like how the nicest thing he said about it was &quot;it was almost okay&quot;. Goosethony Eggtano.
you should do a no cellings 2 review
pentagram- curious volume review <br>p en ta gram<br>pentagrammmmm
i see u filthy frank
aw fuck
y&#39;all got to realize that cudi is probably going through some serious shit. I can understand criticizing his music, but don&#39;t take shots at cudi himself...most of us (not even you fantano) can&#39;t relate to where he is right now. it&#39;s not something to laugh or talk shit about. just think. grow up
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE review the Connan Mockasin album &#39;Forever Dolphin Love&#39;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
first time ever for a zero album????? now i need to go hear it to see if its as bad as you say it is man...
Honestly. this is the first kudi  album I have listened to and I thought it was pretty alright
I would like to hear your review for A Head Full of Dreams by Coldplay. I think it&#39;s great but I like to hear your take
Im not gonna lie i actually loved this album but i love guitar rifts sounds also. This is not the worst album ive heard this year i will say this its better than Yeezus IMO!
So how about reviewing the new Sam Gellaitry EP?
I think the only reason I loved this album is because I can relate to the lyrics all too well,
Please review Leikeli47-part III(mixtape). It&#39;s already on my &#39;best of&#39;. Whatcha know &#39;bout dat nigga? Give &#39;em holy feel, HALLELUJAH!! She deserves serious props.
Review &quot;When It&#39;s Dark Out&quot; G-Easy&#39;s new album!
I fuck with the album and almost all his others. (Except MOTM2) Thank god music is subjective tho
HEB DEB DEB DEB DEB
lmao
Are you going to make a G-Eazy&#39;s new album review? If so when are you going to upload it
I don&#39;t know why you waste time in this type of reviews. There was a time on this channel that you could find new music really cool.
Damn fantano you could&#39;ve at least round off to a .95 haha
ARE U CRAZY? ARE YOU OUTTA YOUR MIND!
Hey, Anthony... Review Low&#39;s new album &#39;&#39;Ones And Sixes&#39;&#39;
Anthony I¬†know this is random but¬†if you ever decide to do a classic album review¬†again sometime could you review The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway? Just a request :)
I get the hate for this album but I&#39;ve actually had it on repeat!<br>Fav songs: Confused, Adventures, Man In The Night, Speeding Bullet and Fairytale Remains<br>It&#39;s different and a lot of the vocals aren&#39;t great, but I like Cudis voice and he still conveys his emotion well. Punk Rock Isn&#39;t the genre for him but he didn&#39;t do it terribly. <br>I think 0.94721/10 is a little harsh.
Would you be interested in reviewing The Plot In Me&#39;s &quot;Happiness in Self-Destruction&quot;?<br><br>Keep up the good work man. :)
Man on the moon 1 and 2 after that I say he&#39;s complete shit...
could you talk about Solid Gold Cowboys, by unlikely friends?
You&#39;re a fraud Fantano A FRAUD!
man i was actually a fan of cudis.. now hes meh
Not even joking, Cal&#39;s album was better than this...
Beavis and Butthead impression was spot on lmao
I don&#39;t agree.  And i&#39;m really no trying to be different, but its music unlike anything out.
This is definitely in Antony&#39;s top 10 review videos, fucking hilarious
I sounds like he really wanted to like it

FUck I love when anthony gets mad, this is the funniest review ever. &quot;cudi might pull through on this one? - NO, NOPE. NOOOO, NO&quot;.
Kek Review / 10
So its not fire?
Young Thugs verse on &quot;Maria I&#39;m Drunk&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This whole album.
The only album I haven&#39;t bought of Cudi&#39;s. Not based on any review but some songs I checked out on youtube prior to release. Just ain&#39;t my cup of tea. Still Cudi is my favorite artist and gonna support him when Man on the moon 3 pops.
Wow Anfernee. . .Why did u have to do Cuddly like that. . .? Confused isnt bad.
The single love was good from kidcudi
Young Thug&#39;s(young thug is complete trash to me)¬†album is BETTER than Kid Cudi&#39;s speedin&#39; bullet bullshit!I&#39;m a Cudi fan and I&#39;ve been listening and buying Kids Cudi&#39;s albums since his mixtape &quot;A Kid Named Cudi&quot;....However,I&#39;m NOT buying this album.I can&#39;t even listen to it.If it was a free mixtape I wouldn&#39;t even download this trash to listen too!I&#39;m a Cudi fan and I¬†have brought all ¬†his previous ¬†albums so for those who was going to call me a &quot;hater&quot;....save it.This is my opinion and I write this alone in Vegas.
Review the new G-Eazy! I know Anthony will just rip it to shreds but it&#39;s not that bad! It&#39;s a good listen!
I Actually enjoyed the Beavis and Butt Head skits, I haven&#39;t heard any new material from them in years. Am I the only one ?
brilliant review!!
Review Black Friday by Kendrick Lamar and J Cole üôèüôè
Seriously, should we be worried about dude?  This shit was psycho terrible..can you imagine touring this record? I would lose my mind

Beavis and Butthead impersonation on point!
Nxworries review??
I LOVE it when Antoine Fantoine goes in!
I really liked this album ..
Lil Dicky, Miley Cyrus and Hopsin all got better scores than this piece of shit LMAO! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
fantano loves talking shit about Cudi. truth is the dude really doesn&#39;t know music
It&#39;s an insane release. Like, it&#39;s a trainwreck, but it&#39;s the biggest, fiery trainwreck, and you can&#39;t stop looking at it (or in this case, hearing it). This is by no means a good album by any standards, BUT, I&#39;ll at least give it to Cud for making a fucked up, off the wall &quot;rock&quot; record and basically saying &quot;fuck you&quot; to his fans and not giving them what they want at all. Some of the album&#39;s backstory is interesting. It&#39;s just completely wild in every sense.
Do a classic review of Portishead&#39;s Dummy!
Can you review A Head Full of Dreams?
I have been a long time cudi fan. Motm and Motm2 will always be two of my favorite albums of all time, in my opinion. This album is here was shit. It seems that Cudi fans are forcing themselves to like this. Most say they they like the new sound, but really it wasn&#39;t good at all. I&#39;m really just waiting for Motm3.
HANDLE WITH CARE // FUCHSIA BUTTERFLIES r great. This album was creative no doubt, but i think cudi&#39;s attitude has always been about his shit sounding on a whole &#39;nother colossus so I don&#39;t know why it came as a suprise when this album dropped. theneedledrop talkin so much trash, but then give a 5/10 on Yeezus &amp; light 6 on MBDTF, pretty disrespectful. <br>0/10 shit review  :)
AOTY
cudi used to be my favorite rapper, but for the last 2-3 years his music has been trash
Forever gonna be a Scott fan but man does he not understand how many kids he&#39;s guided with MOTM?
Hahahahahahaha
Classic review of Portishead would be amazing!
Damn
thank you ralphthony cracktano for helping me realise this wasn&#39;t just extremely weird for me to understand, but the trash i thought it was
Well I got a 10/10!
i&#39;m a huge i fan i didn&#39;t like his last album that much but some songs grew on my later on. THIS album tho i haven&#39;t listened to it all the way but still as a fan i know what i want out of cudi and this wasn&#39;t it. I&#39;m glad he changed the name from man on the moon 3 because if this was that i&#39;m sure everyone would be pissed. Speeding bullet to heaven probably should have been released as a mixtape or something because i don&#39;t see anyone not even me paying for it. It&#39;s not the cudi we want
0\10 LMAO KID CUDI SHOULD JUST STOP
I&#39;m with Anthony on this one. Album sucked azzzzzzzzzzz
He has completely fucking lost it. His fan base is delusional if they eat this shit up. God awful. Fuck.
You didn&#39;t say forever Anthony :&#39; (
not even the cudi fanboys can come out to defend this
Damn not even a 0 to a light 0 lol and no transition... Kid video is terrible... Haven&#39;t liked an album of his since man on the moon 3
I like artists having the freedom to try anything they want, but Kid Cudi is one of the biggest fall offs ever to make music
REVIEW G EAZYS ALBUM HAHAHA
Really good Beavis impression hahahaha
This album was the ending of Scott&#39;s story, however, indicud was great as well as MOTM 2.
Damn gave that bitch a goose egg.
lol
omg, this album is so bad its awesome.  its like St. Anger but FUCKING HILARIOUS, I love it and the Beavis &amp; Butt-Head skits are worth the 15 bucks. lol this is the Trollest most Craziest thing I&#39;ve come acrossed in a long time wait wait; its like St. Anger Meets Black Metal by Dean Blunt. i have a sense of humor so this just feeds that side of me.. haaaa
Papa franku appreciate ls you
im pretty sure this album was meant for people who are like kid cudi. people who enjoy all types of music and can appreciate the effort to push away from normality. i like all of his fuckin music cuz tbh Scotts a legend
satellite flight was great last great cudi album there was
Filthy Frank tho
Alright Fantano stop fuckin around and review a real underground legend. Curren$y just dropped Canal Street Confidential and that shit is fire
adventures is a dope track, don&#39;t hate
I feel sad for Kid Cudi... Probably he has lots of yes men near him... I don&#39;t think he&#39;s mentally healthy hope he&#39;ll be alright
You reviewed this garbage but forgot Janet Jackson&#39;s new album...
incredibly terrible, biased opinion
Give me a reason to love you, Cudi.
Kid cudi fell off when he left good music
fuchsia butterflies is like the only unheard song  i play on this album.
Worse then dark sky paradise which is actually a good album
Fuckthony Boytano really wants cudi to watch this interview
You are 110% correct on virtually everything you state and comment on regarding cudi&#39;s career as an artist... I think I only continue to give his new albums/Mixtapes a listen is because somethin in my head hopes that maybe just ONE fuckin song MIGHT be HALF as good as one of his earlier tracks like &quot;Soundtrack 2 my life&quot; just for example but every album he&#39;s put out SINCE &quot;Man on the Moon&quot; has just been shittier and shittier and this one just takes the trophy for the shittiest... And there&#39;s SO MANY tracks on the album I kept playing the nxt and the nxt thinking goddamm there has to be one good one outta all these songs ... boy was my way of thinking completely wrong... <br>KID CUDI went to Cochella for a show....<br>N&#39; Honestly I think he took a tab or 2 of acid and he never left... <br><br>SORRY for spoutin off in a comment, <br>and i NEVER comment on YouTube ..Period... but felt so strongly about this terrible ass album, and i was way too excited to see someone else out there feels the EXACT same way... <br>Keep up the good reviews brotha...<br>Def, gunna follow from now on 
Carry the ghost - Noah Gunderson
THE RATING OMFG
I made the mistake of buying the album before listening it&#39;s not even hot garbage it&#39;s straight garbage.  Won&#39;t buy another cudi album again !
it took y&#39;all a while to figure out Kid Cudi is, and always was, straight garbage

Totally agree with this review. If I had to pick one word to describe this album it would be &quot;Boring.&quot;
Tenouttaten!  Review it again!  Tenouttaten!  Review it again!
Ive been to two kid cudi concerts at festivals. They were both awful, the music was great and i like him because he looks like a nice guy (ive seen different) but he ended his set early twice by at least 20 minutes. First time he passed out, i felt bad and was hoping the next time he wouldve talked about it. when i saw him the second time he didnt mention it and still without passing out managed to close his set 20 minutes early. Its just disappointing when i&#39;m trying to like the guy.
HOLY FUCK I MADE THAT SHITTY MS PAINT CAL DRAWING AT <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=588">9:48</a> IN LIKE TWO MINUTES AND POSTED IT IN THE COMMENTS OF YOUR FB POST WHERE YOU ASKED PEOPLE TO MAKE CAL ART<br><br>THATS FUCKING AWESOME
Lmao! I died when he sang this shit <br>&quot;I&#39;m gonna make an album, it&#39;s gonna be a rock album&quot;
lol..holy shit, I need to hear this
Tbh, Cal&#39;s part in this video was the best part of this album...
Anthony you&#39;re crazy lmao!
cal chuchesta i went to high school with him. we went to high school in arozona connecticut we used to hang at the lunch tables after school (we were part of the same after school day care program) he used to tell me about his passion for music especially bands such as Smashmouth and taking back sunday.<br>he told me he was fed up of prententious music tasters who would shit all over him for his music taste and not appreciate the true feelings behind his favorite sounds. he always dreamed of starting a satirical music review personality much in the same vein as stephen colbert, but with a melon who pretended to have a real good taste in music. long story short 10 years later i had not seen him until today i viewed a disturbing video featuring my high school friend wearing a disguise of a glasses and no mustache<br>his &quot;personality&quot; has gotten out of control i urge him to get therapy now his satire personality has overtaken his real one, and the audience believes cal is the character. but no, he is inserting pieces of his true self into these videos as a cry for help. he won&#39;t answer my calls won;t return my messages and disconnected his landline from his parents&#39; home in massachusets. additionally he has relapsed on his peppermint schnapps addiction. please cal i care for you and i cry for your safety. we want the old you back, the fun loving boy you used to be. you don&#39;t have to pretend any more my sweet baby. come on back into papas arms. come on back my darling it&#39;s okay to cry
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=479">7:59</a> <br>Savage af
This album is the movie 43 of music
I&#39;M SORRY BUT KID CUDI IS AN ALTERNATIVE HIP-HOP GOD AND IS LOOKED UP TOO BY A LOT OF ARTIST.... EVERY ONE WITH A NEGATIVE COMMENT CAN EAT OUR ALIEN DICKSSS!!!
Anthony, I have no idea about your religious convictions, but I&#39;m hella in the mood for a Top 20 Christmas Albums of All Time video, SPECIFICALLY FROM YOU. Please.
Its just not for everyone, simple as that. For us Solo Dolo&#39;s its awesome. Not saying I love every song, but there are some gems here, mostly the slow, mellow songs.
I friggin died when cal said &#39;kid cuddly&#39; hahahah. Oh man. cudi what happened?
Needledrop, you really need to review Divine Styler&#39;s &quot;Spiral Walls&quot; album because this is essentially a failed version of that.
Antwony Fanderas review the new Jeremih album
MOTM1 was a great album, MOTM2 was good, WZRD had its moments (decent), Indicud to me was a good solid project, Satellite Flight had like two or three songs i digged. I&#39;ve always liked Cudi and his unique sound but this new album has me just turned the fuck off. You can tell he&#39;s desperately attempting to mimic Nirvana&#39;s Bleach and IN Utero sound but failing badly. I couldn&#39;t even listen to it, had to stop halfway. I like one song though, but the Beavis n Butthead parts just came off corny af man. I know Cudi fans will claim others won&#39;t understand his &quot;new direction&quot; or &quot;evolving sound&quot; which will just pump Cudi;s head up more. I mean i dig the fact he wants to create a grunge album and all , but this shit was just so trash to me man, not even a good grunge attempt
Lmfao! As a former Kid Cudi fan, this review was awesome
I&#39;m glad to see Anthony giving this album a light 8. I mean he made a lot of good points that, although I didn&#39;t like the album the first run through, really made me think the second time I listened to it. Also the Beacis and Butthead skits and interludes really help make the work a cohesive piece of art that will definitely continue to be listened to decades in the future.
LEAST FAV TRACK: <br>&quot;KID CUDI - SPEEDIN&#39; BULLET TO HEAVEN&quot;<br>He put the entire album as his least favorite track so savage Anthony
What happened between Man on The Moon II(2010) and WZRD(2012)? Seems like thats when everything started falling apart
S/O PORTISHEAD
There used to be a time when Cudi was my favorite rapper. A Kid Named Cudi &amp; MOTM1 plus his features on song, I used to tell everyone to listen. MOTM2 had some good songs &amp; bad songs. WZRD &amp; Indicud were &quot;ehh&quot;. Satellite Flight was garbage &amp; I wasn&#39;t even looking forward to this, but man has Cudi fallen off. Idk what it is, is he cocky to the point of that he can put anything out &amp; think people will eat it up bc it&#39;s different or does he not realize he is making bad music. I hate when people say this about artist but I will be a fan of the old Kid Cudi, &amp; want nothing to do with this new stuff
wow i use to love THE Kid but now he is just not the same <br>its like he is the miley cyrus of hit hop <br>he has change that much  <br>for now i say RIP to THE Cudi
From someone who&#39;s life was changed by MOTM1, this is by far the most awful album I&#39;ve listened to this year.
i dont mind this album
Wait is this album really worse than Miley Cyrus&#39;s album?
If Thom Yorke made this album it would get a 6 or 7. But it&#39;s Cudi so people gonna hate. There&#39;s nothing wrong with this album I&#39;d rather listen to this than any Foo Fighters record. I was never big on Cudi as an MC so I embrace this album.
Never seen him give an angry review lol
A zero?? lmao
i was wondering if people actually liked this album...then i went on his twitter page.......don&#39;t.
ANTHONY DESTROYED CUDI. THIS IS THE BIGGEST ROAST OF 2015.
HE DID IT
I think kid cudi is doing something nobody(?) has ever done before! He&#39;s gone from making amazing music to making shitty music, doing the backwards development skit with his career! So his goal might just be to make people angry now? Or maybe he&#39;s being mind controlled to make this stuff now, he has come across some being in his hallucinogenic adventures and that being has manifested himself into Scott to make terrible music! It&#39;s a curse I tell you, a curse!!!
+theneedledrop Then YOU GO FUCKING MAKE YOUR OWN MUSIC THEN NIGGA, AND GO LISTEN TO ONLY YOUR OWN SHIT, YOU FUCKING ASS WIPE. WHERE THE FUCK IS YOURE DEMO TAPE? HUH!? FUCK YOU NIGGA
Anthony got to snappin on this one
g eazy when it&#39;s dark out album review???
if you you&#39;re a Real human being with Real emotions and REAL life situations, you understand the album... every one else just keep it moving
Review G-Eazy just so you can shit on another album.  Go straight up AVGN on it.
U gave barter 6 a great review and than talked shit about this album both are great albums and pushing the culture forward of course nobody understand this album because it&#39;s light years ahead and ur favorite artist will copy years later
kid cudi is a god
yo do you think you could review the new Aseop Rock and Homeboy Sandman EP.
I actually like this album tho its not that even that bad as he says it is
I actually like this album.  The song Adventures is dope.  &quot;No more chicken sandwiches, yes i&#39;ll pay for the damages&quot;  He is obviously referring to some inside relationship stuff that us as listeners aren&#39;t going to understand.  Plenty of artists do that I don&#39;t see why it is such a crime that Cudi did it.  This dude who did the review seemed like a tool, I don&#39;t really wanna listen to anything he likes lol.
Anthony. THIS was that Album that even the harcore fans said fuck it. DICKRIDERS only at this point man. I always thought you gave Cudi a hard time, but this is garbage. It is not good sonically, emotionally, and even the lyrics are throwaway. Damn. It&#39;s sad, really.
I liked this album no lie. One man&#39;s trash is another man&#39;s treasure
I love kid cudi, as a rapper. My favorite rapper in fact. BUT THIS SHIT MADE ME WANT TO KILL MYSELF... I AM A KID CUDI FAN, BUT NOT A DICK RIDER! This was basically Scott, a guitar, and a whole lot of depression... geez
you should review more trash stuff bc that was pretty funny. basically just become the angry video game man
You should review  G Eazy&#39;s new album
You should review  G Eazy&#39;s new album
G-EAZY-WHEN ITS DARK OUT
hahahahaha he didn&#39;t even to a traaaan-sition that&#39;s how much he hates it hahaha
turn your volume down before <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=110">1:50</a>, you&#39;ll thank me later
This is pretty accurate.
man you really review some shit
New Coldplay album review??
This is a 0.58541 at best.
All wrong. gotta be at the level of cudi to understand these songs. Stop judging and actually listen to it instead of judging.
he should just stick to comedy bang bang
THANK YOU.
your opinion is complete shit
WTF are U talking about Kid Cudi sounds almost as good as Kurt Cobain..............<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>After he shot himself.
But hey at least the album art is kina cool
This album is absolute garbage. I don&#39;t know how Cudi thinks this is art. I&#39;m not musically inclined at all, but I could make a better album.
Someone PLEASE make a gif of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=599">9:59</a>
this is my favorite review of all time
Been going through some of your older reviews on the likes of QotSA, Aphex Twin, FlyLo, BoC, etc., and really enjoy listening to you articulate my own opinions so much better than I could.<br><br>If I might make some recommendations for listening, you might check out Yan Wagner, Kid Francescoli, Palmbomen, and Metronomy.<br><br>Also hoping you review the new Tool album, whenever they get around to actually releasing it.
i agree....drugs are only oil..not the engine
THE FILTHY FRANK HAIR CAKE REFERENCE AHAHAHAHAHHHAHHA

this album was the worst thing I have ever heard in my life and if you are alive after listening to it congrats because you escaped death
how many albums has antwone fantwone given a straight 0 to?
Well now I have to listen to it.
Man, this review was straight savage. To be honest, Kid Cudi has a few songs that I like. But, he&#39;s never made an entire project that I could listen to from start to finish.
i kinda like it because its terrible. i&#39;ll use it to torture
extremely entertaining
the existence of this record and miley cyrus DEMANDS there to be a cal chuchesta end of year list. BRING IT BACK!!!!!
Please review Coldplay&#39;s new album
APEXKEK
its funny how he says,&quot;Im feeling a zero&quot; then my eyes go over to the album with cutis arms out, like bruh lol
do the young Roddy album
When It&#39;s Dark Out review????
still can&#39;t belee you slept on Beirut&#39;s epic new masterpiece tho <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23floptano">#floptano</a>
I came to this video expecting ragethony madtano but i didn&#39;t expect to leave without a &quot;TRAN-SITION&quot; and &quot;FOREVER&quot;. I feel empty....
Review When it&#39;s Dark Out by G-Eazy
Cudi is one of my all-time favorite artists and even I can admit this shit was so ass.
God, this guy is such a hipster lol
Go fuck off
Thank God, I wasn&#39;t the only one who thought this album was hot trash. I was listening to the first couple songs like... WTF is this Rock shit he is trying to do. Give me Man on the Moon Cudi. Real talk.
This album is so bad that the review was hard to watch
I actually really like a 2 or 3 songs on the album!  The edge of the earth/post mortem boredom is probably my favorite kid cudi song perhaps ever!  2 or 3 song on any album is a lot for me personally...  Not bad if you ask me.  I think that was a harsh review...
Fantano are you ok... you seem so angry, and frustrated its weird you&#39;re usually so calm.
I can appreciate your enthusiasm but the inflation and change of pitch in your voices for when you really sell your point, thats fine, but its so loud in contrast to the rest of your speech that it hurts my head. I really hope you do something about this for future videos. Also with this said, I appreciate the hard work you put into your reviews but maybe invest in better sound production. <br><br>also yes the album was utter trash I 100% agree.
No need to watch the whole video guys just skip to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=503">8:23</a> pretty much sums it all up lmao
Hey Anthony, I&#39;m not sure if you review stuff like this, but a rapper from Philly, Lil Uzi Vert, released a mixtape called, LUV is Rage. I thought you would have a good time listening to it, and possibly giving us a review. Here is the soundcloud link: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/liluzivert/sets/luv-is-rage">https://soundcloud.com/liluzivert/sets/luv-is-rage</a>
Damn didnt even get a one...
Nothing brightens my day like watching Anthony review Kid Cudi and/or Big Sean
...I thought the album was pretty cool
&quot;Kid Cudi loses his mind&quot; lmfaoooooo
Woaahhh u mad bro ? Hahaha
it doesn&#39;t sound that bad. the song wedding tux is pretty decent
I feel so bad for Kid Cudi fans. It must be like being in an abusive relationship. He just keeps on giving them horrendous album after horrendous album yet for some reason that none of us can understand, they always come back to him
The only way this will be fire is if someone burned it
so did you like it or no?
Well I mean, we already had an album that got a 10 this year, so it only makes sense that we get an album that scored a 0 in the same year too.....
This made me laugh till I cried. What would you say is the worst track? Because I wanna listen to that one.
I admit, coming from a cudi Stan, this album was a disappointment, but oh my goodness it wasn&#39;t this bad lol. I&#39;d say a 5-6/10
You gettin bodied by a reviewin nigga
Dear, Kid Cudi <br>YOU JUST GOT ROASTED <br>YAAAAOOOWWWWW
I can&#39;t wait for the &quot;Still better than SB2H&quot; memes that are gonna be all over the internet after this
Comedy bang bang aka comedy brraaat brraaat influence showing
I&#39;ve been going through some of the tracks on the record, and it sounds really poorly mixed. Nothing has any real punch to it. Maybe the guitar on &#39;AMEN&#39;, but that&#39;s all I&#39;ve found that really had me intrigued. Everything is so over-compressed that it doesn&#39;t do anything whatsoever.
Big love for the Polaris album in the back!
I&#39;d say 5.5
Well damn, is this Fandango&#39;s very first strong 0 (lil b doesn&#39;t count)? Congratulations Kid Cudi, you managed to make something worse than &quot;Why they put the dick in the pussy?&quot; and &quot;WHAT DOES IT MEAN????&quot;
You just saved me the trouble... waisten a gig of data on some complete bullshit thank you.
Z E R O<br>E<br>R<br>O
Just wait until you hear Black Market...
Just curious is Black Market going to get reviewed?  Cause I would actually love to see that review
just listened to it. Damn i honestly thought the album was okay and i could see people liking it
I liked the track &quot;Trauma&quot; because it reminded me a lot of Nirvana
I&#39;m not saying the album is decent but it should have gotten at less a 2 for effort.
The opening of thee first track had me interested and questioning Fanta&#39;s opinion. 30 secs in and I felt like physically smashing my speakers. What the fuck was this meant to be?
The gist of the album if you haven&#39;t heard it: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=460">7:40</a>
Review the new Dumbo Gets Mad record please.
Oh my days. This is just excellent.
It&#39;s like he listened to the first verse of Birds and thought, &quot;hey I should make an entire album like this&quot;.
The first 0/10 album he has ever given.
this is the fallout 4 of albums
I know it&#39;s not all good, and people are definitely hating it, but that makes me want to listen to it more now.
you done fucked it up
Nothany Chilltano
It&#39;s bad but I didn&#39;t hate the album as much as he did but some tracks stood out for me, it&#39;s like a 4
Not a Cudithony Fantano?
Hell I enjoyed this album. I&#39;ve listen to it several times
He&#39;s been listening to a lot of death grips
I want everyone to keep in mind that Justin Beiber &quot;Purpose&quot; got at least a 5/10. That&#39;s how bad Cudi&#39;s album was.....
Honestly, this review makes me want to listen to it even more.
hahahha wow! he&#39;s reeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaalllllly making bad music this time
Indicud was my favourite Cudi album tbh
Kid Cudi is ABSOLUTE GARBAGE!!!!! Hes always been terrible!!!
Just gonna wait for motm3
Did not expect to see filthy frank cameo
Fantano started this video like he was a disappointed Dad
I think he got shitty after indicud and even most of the later half of that Album wasn&#39;t his best work
Yeah like I was the BIGGEST kid cudi fan and I hated this album
last great cudi album was incuide
&quot;Anger&quot;thony &quot;Mad&quot;tano
This &gt; to pimp a butterfly
I love kid cudi but he fell off....
I love this album
How dare u say satellite flight wasn&#39;t a good album... But I do agree speedin bullet 2 heaven is whack. Still luv cudi tho
Ayee I see that portishead
review when its dark out - g-eazy?<br>i mean, might as well. can&#39;t be worse than this.
kid cuddly
Being not much of a cudi fan besides the MOTM tapes, and a couple of tracks here and there but I kinda enjoy this project in a strange this sounds like some bad inde film soundtrack kinda vibe. I still thinks its the worst project he put out over all. And to be honest if this wasnt on spotfiy, I might not have isten to it at all. This should have been a free tape or a ep so he could&#39;ve gotten some feed back of some kind from the public. Hopefully MOTM 3 well blend everything he has learn into to one big steamy pile of whyyyyyyyyyyy? 4/10
Only a garbage man can appreciate this trash.
Wait.....this is worse than Miley Cyrus&#39; dead pets???
new shirt anthony? looks good<br><br><br>e, nvm I saw u wear this in the Miley Cyrus review. this must be your shitty album shirt
I can&#39;t believe Fantano is reviewing this<br><br>Figured this was YUNOREVIEW material
People need to stop calling this a Nirvana parody, that&#39;s an insult to weird Al&#39;s Hilariously brilliant &quot;Smells like Nirvana&quot;
This like if you put the badly produced tracks on Cherry Bomb into a blender and then recorded it.
everyone expecting another rap album.. this is pure instrumentals, I&#39;m actually digging this album a lot
I&#39;m cool with him saying wzrd and satellite flight not being good because they really weren&#39;t.¬†But Indicud was a good fucking album
Usually a bad review makes me want to listen to at least one track to see why its bad or why other people like it but never before has a review alienated me so deeply to an artist. This is a tour de force in the power of media.
this feels like 2010 fantano<br>i missed u bb
Ahahahaha...this was hysterical
I don&#39;t know what in the entire hell Cudi was doing with this album. 4 tracks in and I had to stop the album and play Rick Ross&#39;s new album. Dead ass.
Can we get a Coldplay review
Review Rustie&#39;s new album! &quot;EVENIFUDONTBELIEVE&quot; is the name of it.
It&#39;s a lot to ask for but maybe G Eazy, Pimp C, curren$y and Rick Ross reviews would be dope. Maybe just a few of them
Damn, I&#39;ve never seen an album get a zero
What&#39;s that blue and yellow album in the back?
I&#39;ll be honest there were a few songs that I liked, but don&#39;t get me wrong this was a massive pile of shit. I also didn&#39;t like the no features part, I know this kinda music doesn&#39;t really need one but I needed a new voice other than Cudi and the shitty skits. I expected a lot better.
im the only person in the world that liked it
Do G-Eazy new album please
Do G-Eazy new album please
Kudi &gt; Ramones
I&#39;ve not heard this album, but I enjoyed &quot;Satellite Flight&quot;... I thought the quality was upgraded, and I liked the way the vocals were mixed. It seemed more like his Man On The Moon stuff. From the songs he released before this album, I liked &quot;Love&quot; and I liked the attitude of &quot;Judgmental Cunt&quot;. I probably won&#39;&#39;t really like this album though; when it comes to the more &quot;rock&quot; sound he produces, I prefer songs like &quot;Going To The Ceremony&quot;... and the unreleased &quot;rocket&quot; song.
We got two tens and a zero this year on theneedledrop. 2015.
Was it worse then dark sky paradise?
What album this year was worse than this to you Anthony? Perhaps something from a YUNO review
Never actually commeneted on one of your vids but tbh kid cudi fell off to me when he dropped indicud wzrd was OK for a few tracks
I am all for artist changing sounds, re-inventing themselves and going exploring completely new territory (Kanye, Scott Walker, Radiohead, ) but this album was just pathetic in every way and the fact that hes on Twitter with this self-righteous &quot;Sorry I don&#39;t sound like the radio nigga&#39;s U love&quot; as if that&#39;s an exuse to make trash, further illustrating his delusion.
Well....you didn&#39;t have to review it.
honestly, he should of just made this album into an EP or at least a short 8 song album. rock albums aren&#39;t really supposed to be 18 songs long or else everything will just start sounding the same and just become a mush of sound. Maybe then, the album would of been easier to digest.
lmao that album cover doe.
Wow I feel like I just witnessed needledrop history
I might be jumping to conclusions here, but i don&#39;t think this guy like Kid Cudi&#39;s latest album.
kid cudi:<br>because why try
Big fat goose egg !
the parts where my ears didn&#39;t bleed were good
i can tell this really frustrated you because this might have the least edits out of any of your videos in several years
definitely trying to hold back the laughter at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=1">0:01</a> lost my shit during this whole album. <br><br>Favorite comedy album of 2k15.
the album is different but there is some good here. the album has been out for a day and most albums take more than just one play through to fully understand what the artist is trying to do. Im not saying this album is perfect because its not but its far better than a 0. id say its a 6. i dont understand why this guy would buy kid cudis passion project after he didnt like MOTM 1 or 2, or indicud and straight up skipped satellite flight. He was just setting himself up for disappointment. If you like all of kid cudis albums or any of his later stuff then yea youll fimd some gems on this album. if youve never been a fan of cudi than why would you buy this? this album is just for cudfam and the people on cudis level
I can&#39;t stop laughing, this review is comedic gold!
Do g-eazy please
ANTHONY CAN YOU PLEASE REVIEW BLUE NEIGHBOURHOOD BY TROYE SIVAN IT WOULD MEAN THE WORLD TO ME
This was horrible man as a cudi fan I&#39;m really worried for my dude. I understand trying to experiment with music but this is just terrible. this is something you make for fun, keep in your computer and never release to the public. You must be extremely delusional and unhealthy narcissistic to release this and believe that others will enjoy it
Got hearing aids listening to this cancer
Damn indicud is actually my favorite cudi album... Every other project always felt mediocre, and this... Is complete shit. Fuck you cudi, fuck you
What feeling was that in the beginning?
your butt-head impersonation was pretty spot on
if you&#39;re rating is for listenability, i might agree with you, But as an original fan of Kid Cudi, I have listened to nearly every album/song the dude has released and I can say his songs are strictly Scott Mescudi venting his emotional/thoughts into a song form. and this album is 100% the album that is most true to WHO Scott actually is and thats what really matters to his true fans.
Anthony! Where did you get that Polaris vinyl behind you in this video? I remember them from Pete and Pete!

this kid cudi album is just plain boring and weak.  ouch a zero ohhhhhhhhhh
I liked one track.... CONFUSED! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23prayformotm3">#PrayForMOTM3</a>
The fuck. I&#39;m really enjoying this album.
are their any techno house albums or techno house songs that you can recommend?
I actually love this album lol 9/10 for me
you have great taste in music fantano like myself.  im a big fan of what you do and im a big fan of portishead dummy
What about the big Sean album? You hated that one lmao so cudis can&#39;t be the worse
Do Jeezys new album
All y&#39;all are catching zees like chimpan right NOW<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23koga">#KOGA</a>
Ok how is this as bad Miley Cyrus&#39;s piece of shit album
I&#39;m honestly worried about Cudi&#39;s mental health after listening to this album. Some of the lyrics are very unsettling to hear him say.
Shout out to that Dummy vinyl though...
Please do the new troye sivan&#39;s album Blue Neighbourhood!! It&#39;s great and he is a fellow youtuber so ...
Yooooo üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ I&#39;m so dead.
This has got to be Antoine&#39;s lowest score ever, right?
This is what a Kid Cudi fan looks like <a href="https://vine.co/v/O5MKeYg0UVL">https://vine.co/v/O5MKeYg0UVL</a>
Angry Fantano here lol, funniest review ever
Kid Cudi used to be one of my favorite artist but he completely left his day 1 fans in the cold. I miss the MOTM Cudi those where the days.
You went full coverkillernation here LMAO. Never seen you so upset over an album dude.
wowza anthony. wowza.<br><br>thanks for the review. rip kid cuddly.
Handle with care was good
You&#39;re a fucking clown
yooo you should review troye sivan&#39;s new album, Blue Neighbourhood
Portishead &lt;3
This makes Lil Wayne - Rebirth sound like a Classic Album.
I&#39;ve never seen any other musician fall this far. Not even Wayne. Cudi went from 100 to 0.
this is why I love you, Kidthony Cuditano.
MOTM3 will be the phoenix rising from the ashes of SBTH.
If you guys really believe this dudes reviews to music youre an idiot listen to it before you hear reviews about it wzrd was amazing and sb2h this shit was cool you just have to give it a chance
you gotta be on so,e serious drugs to enjoy this album
How did he go from MOTM to this, I just don&#39;t understand.
idunwannabeheeeraneemore
anthony&#39;s got the drink in him going back to back
It&#39;s not a 0 it&#39;s a light 5, it grew on me, kid Cudi is going into a new area of his career. I mean Anthony I understand where your coming from at first it sounds weird but as I kept listening I loved it,  this is the first album I&#39;ve scene you give a 0 kid Cudi is an awesome artist man just open our ears and your mind just not one.
I feel like people really overrate Kid Cudi. I respect the fact that he has his own sound and MOTM was pretty good but people make it seem like his music is God-like and absolutely genius, like bruh his first album was good, second one was ehh, Indicud was pretty bad, Satellite Flight was okay, and now this is just absolute trash, like damn this is TRASH. The only reason why I gave the album a listen is because of how he recorded it(I appreciate that this was recorded using analog machines) and the direction he was going in, I just wanted to hear what it was about, I regret it 100%. <br>I hear all his stans say shit like &quot;you don&#39;t understand it, it&#39;s genius&quot; like nah stop being a yes-man and just say what it is, Garbage. And to all the people comparing it to Nirvana (not a nirvana fan) that&#39;s just down right disrespectful. Definitely Cudi&#39;s worst album, I give it a 0 as well.
I think all those emotions that he&#39;s dealing with is getting to him honestly.... I can&#39;t say I liked the album but I think he really is starting to lose his mind to all that pain he&#39;s dealing with
I wasnt going to watch this, but then I thought of the possible memes....
I hope someone show this to cudi and he has the decency to watch the whole video, because I can&#39;t believe Anthony made it through the whole fucking album!
Internets jizziest music nerd
I&#39;m going to write this part of my comment then start the album and then finish my comment once I&#39;m done listening:<br><br>This is the mother of the commenter, my son was found dead due to overdose of awfulness. R.I.P
g eazy album!!!
holy shit, the third 1 in a single year. Music is doomed.
Review G-Eazy - When It&#39;s Dark Out
I used to be cudi fan, but his shit tailed off so hard. I really hope he sees this. I hung on to his shit just from his name being on it, but that has ended. I still see potential-like Anthony mentions a few times- In his skill for producing interesting sounds, and he&#39;s not a bad singer(until recently), or a bad lyricist(until recently). I feel like if Kid Cudi were shaken out of this deep sleep/haze/depression he were in, he would be capable of producing the upbeat interesting hits he used to make. I feel very frustrated.
Review when its dark out?
pls Antnee Kids Cuddly has a family
Anthony Fantano turns into the joker
As a huge cudi fan..... This album was fucking terrible
This album is horrible in every way. I love rock music, but this album sounds like a 11 year old trying to play a guitar.
This has to be one of Anthony&#39;s best videos holy shit lmao
when you going and do that Rick Ross black market
It really sucks to witness Kid Cudi fall like this. He used to be one of my favorite artist especially with MOTM and even some of the other albums. But now hes turned into some depressed, drugged out, washed up latex condom that&#39;s slowly crumbling away from the lack of moister and lubricant surrounding it.
Kid Cudi is to white kids what a nipple is to infants.
I&#39;m tired of him making these Rock albums just give us the old cudi sound and vibe
IM THE HUGEST CUDI FAN IN MILWAUKEE but...this album is just. NO COMMENT
Shrek did it better
I completely agree. album was horrible.Tthe only song I actually can say I liked was wedding tux. I can kinda relate to it. sadly. Anyway I find myself skimming through the rest of the album trying to find more gems like that and there really isn&#39;t any. It&#39;s pretty much worthless. Honestly I didn&#39;t really expect it to be good. I don&#39;t even think MOTM 3 is ever coming. And if it does there&#39;s no way it will be on par with his earlier music which was actually good. I say this as a huge fan of kid cudi.
I really liked Man on the Moon, but after that... fucking hell.
ok the beavis and butthead stuff is annoying but the album isnt that bad in my opinion
This meme was to strong for the world.
When its dark out by g eazy, review please!!
Dummy at the right tho
I&#39;m so glad I&#39;m not the only one who feels this way. This was so funny!
Haven&#39;t watched the review yet, but damn this should be good!
Cudi stans shook
Maybe when you&#39;ve recovered from listening this, are you considering to give a listen to G-eazys When It&#39;s Dark Out?
so bad he wouldn&#39;t want to make a transition
No/No
This album got a lower rating than <i>_____</i>.
this man did not give it a decimal lmao
please review black market
I like the album heard it twice
i knew this shit was coming by the thumbnail.
Dude this album is TERRIBLE.
the album cover loooool
This is worse than earls shit? Damn that&#39;s bad
Cudi gave Cleveland bigger a L with this album than the Browns did against Baltimore last week.
0? Come on man, the album may have been messy but there was obviously effort put into it. It was way better than mileys album. I didnt find it as offensive, but i guess that&#39;s ur opinion. I would have given it a 5
WHILE LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM, I THOUGHT TO MYSELF, THAT ANTHONY WOULD GIVE THIS A 8 OR HIGHER....I THINK I EXAGGERATED A LITTLE BIT
damn, that score thoo
Fuck you Anthony, I dont wanna hear anymore of your Cudi bashing. I loved A Kid Named Cudi,  MOTMI &amp; II, and half of Indicud, and most of WZRD (pre-watching video)<br>I mean I agree with most of your points. Cudi is one of my favorite artists, BUT this album isn&#39;t good imo BUT I don&#39;t like or really care for rock at all. But I will defend the singing because that&#39;s what makes Cudi Cudi. I really enjoy his singing and that&#39;s why I loved his old stuff.There actually wasn&#39;t enough of him doing his little OOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHH WOOOOOOOOOOOO thing. IF...IF MOTMIII sucks (I&#39;ll kill myself) and he keeps this whole rock hippy vibe (and does not improve) then yeah I may be done with caring about his future projects. So until then...
+theneedledrop this album is trash please check out Alex Wiley and his new album village party 2
As a long time fan when he drops shit like this it really feels like he&#39;s dropping this shit to purposefully fuck with people. I am a huge fan but some of the fans that praise this are ruining him. They really need to stop boosting his head. I knew things were going downhill when he dropped from G.O.O.D. Music. He&#39;s legit tuning out any criticism be it constructive or not. This album was ass someone close to him needs to tell him that slap him up a bit and help him start producing good music again. Help this nigga please. Stans gotta stop feeding this shitty side of him. I see why Lupe wants to throw hands with him. He&#39;ll find out next year though when this tour of his likely flops
Adventures was a GREAT song imo
Cudi fell off so hard, a real shame.
Damn Cudi just can&#39;t catch a break. <br>Also I think this is the few times he&#39;s actually gotten angry in a review due to the music.
And also Anthony if this album was so bad then why didn&#39;t you do a proper review for Dark Sky Paradise? Did you think this was worse?
i liked a few songs off of indicud
Bruh, Cudi just needs to stop this, just because its &quot;experimental&quot; doesnt mean it&#39;s good. It&#39;s simple as that for your simple ass.
I loved Indicud and Satellite Flight..bought them both. I&#39;m not a Cudi stan but I think y&#39;all just jumping on the bandwagon of hating on him. With that being said, I&#39;m afraid to listen this album.
Wow I&#39;ve never actually seen a physical copy of that Polaris record
The Beavis and Butthead sketches were AWFUL. The instruments sounded amateurish, the guitar feedback was aggravating, and the straight up screeching and screaming that he&#39;s doing on a couple of the songs actually managed to make music completely &#39;unenjoyable&#39; for the first time in my life.
Oh and travis scott, the weeknd, drake and future are all trash, they can&#39;t even make music and they bite off of everyone and everything that is good or actual musicians.
What 90% of you don&#39;t understand is that this is real music.... your favorite rappers do NOT make real music lmao do I have to paint this out for you guys. Rapping over trap beats isn&#39;t real music, a good example, asap rocky&#39;s last 3 albums sound exactly the same, no progression what so ever. At least people like tyler the creator, childish gambino, kid cudi and etc etc is that they make REAL music, playing real instruments, bad or not, it&#39;s real music. Go listen to your chief keef&#39;s and your future and shit that will not be relevant in 5 years
You couldn&#39;t get a more generic album title for a rock album than SPEEDIN&#39; BULLET TO HEAVEN
every album hes fetched out has decent songs in it, love him no matter what theres only 4songs i like on sbth tho
That&#39;s the lowest score I&#39;ve ever seen! Damn!
I stopped mid review to go to his soundcloud to listen to some of this stuff. I managed to get through &#39;Confused&#39; without too much harm, but halfway into the title track I almost died of boredom.
I have to agree with Anthony. This album sucked so bad.
I was a BIG Cudi fan, but this album is trash. I&#39;m just praying he released this shit to make MOTM 3 look good and shock everybody.
&quot;Trying to punk&quot; sigh.
Forever...
Got so mad he didn&#39;t even ask us what to review next.
No way you have found time to listen and dissect this album in this short time, especially seeing as this is a double disc. Am I saying this is a grade A album? No. But you&#39;ve praised rock albums with far less substance. Bias?
Anthony pope review when?
So I guess no motm 3 review then );
How does one review an able in a day... GTFOH
Soul-sucking? Oh God.
Cudi stans are some of the worst, they&#39;re up there with J Cole stans
Cudi is one of my favorites but he has put out some garbage.<br><br>Great: A Kid Named Cudi, Man on the Moon 1 &amp; 2<br>Good: Indicud, Satellite Flight<br>Terrible: WZRD and Speedin&#39; Bullet to Heaven
Lmao Kidthanoy Cudtano sounded exactly like him in that impression of confused
This should be -1//10 cause this album is advanced trash.
Kid Shut-In
I going to do a review of jeremih  album late night?
i guarantee man on the moon 3 will be dope
I&#39;m a kid cudi fan. This album was trash.
i didnt have a problem with it. I think Cudi wants us to lose our minds listening to his music. I dig that
Damn

Always hatin on the kid cuddly lmfao
Anthony Savagetano here
i didnt mind the first couple tracks
Everyone is looking at this album in the wrong light. It is an INDIE album. NOT a hip-hop album. Yall need to stop looking at it from that perspective.
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ 0.9 bro.
review Rick Ross - Black Market<br>It&#39;s not the regular Ross, Teflon Don shit
so i just attempted to give this a listen, tbh, Edge of the Earth peaked my interest. but immediately after that song the whole album seems to fall off the edge of the earth, i couldnt make it past confused
That Portishead album over his shoulder &lt;3
Kid Cudi is deaf
I&#39;m a cudi Stan &amp; wzrd is one of my fav albums of all time, but he shat the bed with this
Damm, i was gonna listen to this album,  but now....
Wow this album must be almost as bad as limp bizkit&#39;s gold cobra... no/10
Anthony with the ETHER! Dam you gon make cudi cry bruh! Did cal like it doe?
I knew he was going to flame his ass by the look of the thumbnail.
should&#39;ve just titled this video &quot;The Roast Of Kid Cudi&quot;
I ordered a pizza just to watch this. Not disappointed A_A
I listened to this album a few times. My response: it&#39;s terrible!

Lol, I was waiting for you to review thisüòÇüòÇüòÇ. Idk what CuDi is doing but he claims to be happy doing it so more power to him. I still don&#39;t get you niggas that claim indicud is trash. That shit was better than WZRD,SF, &amp; SBTH..
have to listen to it. no way it got  0/10
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=405">6:45</a> Fantano loses his mind
Am I the only one who thinks that&#39;s a Flatbush zombies jacket üëÄüëÄüëÄ
anthony is gonna feel really bad when cudi ends up killing himself :(
Cudi seems to just immediately make an album once he&#39;s in a phase. He&#39;s just sitting around and hears Nirvana &quot;I GOTTA MAKE AN ALBUM NOW&quot;
Damn his Kid Cudi impersonation at the end was on point LMAO
Lmao! But I thought the Miley Cyrus record was the worst record this year.
Who else is drinking kiwi watermelon syrup here?
He went in.
I think people ignore the great songs on the album because of the few songs that are really not listenable at all, but cudi put them on there on purpose, its him doing his crazy punk shit
I can&#39;t wait for him to tear apart that POS G-Eazy album.
Loved Cudi&#39;s early work like most people. MOTM 2 was one of my favorite albums and i didnt even mind indicud. It had some decent songs. But my god man. I mistakenly bought Satellite flights without even knowing what it was (still havent listened to it) but this &quot;thing&quot; that he just released is undeniably awful. He&#39;s lost his mind and Cudi fans cant act like this is anything close to coherent music. Scott needs some help.
It wasn&#39;t that bad. Speedin&#39; Bullet 2 Heaven, Handle With Care &amp; The Nothing are probably the best songs.
im legitimately having a hardtime making up my mind about this album. FIRST OFF: im NOT a kid cudi fan. never have been. ive always found him tolerable at best. but after listening to 4 songs from this album...theres something i like about it. maybe i need to hear more i dont know. something in my brain is telling me its bad, but for some reason im enjoying it. its...its fucked up.but now i need to leave because the walls have turned green and the lizards are returning, so i have to go back to my box.
I knew this was gonna be a good one from the look on your face in the preview
Yeah. I couldn&#39;t bare to listen to that album. Nails on a chalkboard.
Speedin bullet to the trash can.
I got a fucking headache from this album, and seriously thought about killing myself for a minute gg Cudi. fuck you
i think because he is such a huge rock fan he takes the genre a lot more serious than other genres i enjoyed a some of the songs on here i gave it a 4.5 out of 10
More savage than a 0.0 Pitchfork review.
Kid Cudi is one of my favourite artists, I really liked his first two albums and didn&#39;t think indicud was bad either, this album though is an atrocity.
what I don&#39;t get about cudi is.. I think almost a year ago he released this song called Love which had me fully convinced he was returning to his original sound :/ it was such a good song and heart warming too! then he goes off the rails with this. if he just stuck with that sound from Love though..
Fuck u Anthony
.....but is it really that bad....(gimme a minute)
My lord that was trash
i knew he was going to hate this, i love when he reviews kid cudi&#39;s stuff lol!
cal chuchesta&#39;s mixtape got a better review than this
fantano looking like the grinch in the thumbnail
He also said Yeezus sucks, sooo
I enjoy the album; kid cudi has been there for us since day one, and I&#39;ve been with him since, for his music, and for his purpose in music. But like I said: I enjoy this album.
Let&#39;s not forget he gave Lil B a light 0 on &quot;I&#39;m Gay&quot;
This album is all drugs and ego.
I agree, CuDi&#39;s early work was groundbreaking, but almost every single song he has released afterwards has been hair-wrapped shit lit on fire.
The people who say this record is good, do not list to punk or rock. It&#39;s not just bad for him as a &quot;Hip Hop&quot; artist. It&#39;s bad for a fuckin Punk Rock album. It&#39;s actually trash. And I forced myself to listen to the whole thing because I used to love CuDi.
Review the new Jeremih album Late Nights!
Haha god damn. That was brutal.
REVIEW IT AGAIN 10 OUTTA 10
lmao you got on this quick!<br><br>Yeah when I heard CONFUSED those months ago I knew it was gonna be trash. Gonna tweet this vid to him right quick.
no like deadass cudi couldnt switch up the chords atleast ONCE per song?
You skipped the only Cudi album I actually really like. Except for the song Balmain jeans that album is dope imo, it isn&#39;t hiphop or an attempt at punk rock though..
My thoughts on his first mixtape: wow, this guy is the future. <br>Man on the moon: wow, album of the year, 9/10. <br>Man on the moon II: hmmm, kinda has some weird songs on it, don&#39;t really care for half of it. <br>WZRD: seriously, wtf is this? Deleted every song except one. <br>Indicud: some of the songs were so bad, but there were maybe 3 ok songs. <br><br>And that&#39;s it. I&#39;m not listening to kid cudi ever again. He could have been great but he went psycho. Guy needs to tone his huge ego down.
Ultha - Pain cleanses every doubt or Mgla - Exercises in Futility review, please?

Man this album fucked Fandangos soul in the ass
TELL EM HOW YOU FEEL ANTWONFANTWON
You say this is the worst album you HAD to review. Why did you HAVE to review this? You hated his previous stuff so why don&#39;t you simply ignore his new stuff?
Lollll funniest needledrop review xD
Review ROYALTYTHEALBUM
This has to be the funniest TND review ever
so..Lil Wayne&#39;s Rebirth or this
i must be the only person who likes this album
H Anthoney I downloaded the new Animal collective song Flridada based on your recommendation and I like it. Thank you! Trish
Whats it gonna be Antwon a 0 or a 0.94721?
savage lmaoo
this guy doesn&#39;t like anyones album
I like how the album cover is just Cudi freaking out in the middle of a slightly swirly forest lol
that impersonation was spot on
AYYYEE that Portishead vinyl tho!!!
I agree with him. I couldn&#39;t even sit through indicud. I do NOT at all blame him.
Worse than Miley Cyrus?
LOL this interview made my weekend, thanks Anthony.<br><br>Was looking forward to this album for months Cudi being one of my favorite artists, but what a huge let down.
Cudi is sober
Holy Shitty Titties, your review made it to the album&#39;s Wikipedia article, thats brilliant.
How do you make an honest review of a 26 album in less than 48 hours?
0 üò≠üò≠üòÇ
Hahaha this is the review I&#39;ve been waiting for
I just came here for that Portishead LP
Ever since he went the straight rock route he went downhill, he should of stuck to the man of the moon theme, he criticizes hiphop &amp; how mediocre music is but comes out with bullshit like this smh
did he take some molly and wander through Seattle? I feel like that&#39;s what happened. I just kept yelling &quot;you&#39;re not fucking Cobain!!&quot; as I skipped through the tracks
album is absolute trash. And lmao @ the cover.
every comment section i see very negative reviews of this album. this album is great. listen to Hole and educate your palate.
Hair cake reference
you will look back in 2 years and feel like the biggest idiot
Kid Cudi is the rap game M. Night Shyamalan.
this album is amazing
YESSSSS Finally!!!! lol please Roast lmao
the only track i liked was the opener/intro Edge of the Earth -- i thought that was a cute song
im sorry but i love cudi and always will, i love all of his work and I will forever. idc what that says about my taste in music but the man means a lot to me and i will support anything he does
&lt;3 u antFAM 
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDcbwpsjU0&amp;t=515">8:35</a> he&#39;s straight up laughing at the fact that he may be losing his mind. Wonder how he&#39;d feel if he offs himself.
I don&#39;t know what&#39;s worse. Anthony giving him a terrible score or Anthony being a Bernie sanders supporter
dear anthony, thank you for saving me from this album before i listened to it
That is a fantastic album cover. I give it a light to decent 8.
The face in the thumbnail says it all lmao.
rip me i thought it was pretty sick but everyone thinks differently
fuck you buddy!
anyone know any good artist like 08 cudi?
Cudi career is done now
I&#39;m actually not a cudi fan, but I actually really enjoyed this for some reason
&quot;kids don&#39;t do drugs and embark on some musical adventure because <b>this</b> will happen&quot;<br>* points at the album art *<br><br>I fucking lost it
Guys this is Cudi&#39;s Yeezus - Kid Cudi Dickriders
At least Scott is trying to do something different, meanwhile your favorite artists have been sounding the same since they&#39;ve been out. I get the hate for this album though I still like it. But I really think Wzrd is great.
As a Cudi fan, this makes me dont want to check this out at all
Omg This Ablum was Amazing this is coming from a guy who hates rock it had a lil of bad songs in it but it shows cudi is not just a hiphop artist but he has his own sound also Indicud and Satelight Flight were dope too but not WZRD,we never speak of WZRD.......
speeding bullet to heaven or dark sky paradNO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO
Yes.
Confused and Handle With Care were the only ones I can bare lmao
I love your intro
Jesus the Cal skit at the end killed me. But seriously, this album blows whale bubbles.
Wow that score is straight savagery
Kid Cudi saved my life in middle school. Now I feel like he&#39;s trying to take it...
Fantano is a savage. I do agree that a lot of the tracks sound very similar, BUT, after having listened to most of the initial 18, I didn&#39;t hate it. I wish there was more diversity, but I actually like it. I even liked the B&amp;B skits. I have Adventures in a playlist, and it goes right into Gone, by The Weeknd. The shroom skit plays well into that. I haven&#39;t listened to the demos. I plan to.

the hair cake
I really have to unsubscribe now. A few of your reviews I disagree with but you really fucked this one up. I enjoyed this album and your review just fucked up my mood
Satellite Flight was tolerable.
He&#39;s a better actor than a music artist.
Great album. Some fucking music nerd that just so happens to lack taste
Your singing was spot on hahahhahhah
that polaris album though
High high high dislike ,bro why the hate on cudi? This was a classic and the last 3 were phenomenal and his first 2 were back to back all time classics
do G Eazy review
Boy I saw that thumbnail and I just knew he was about to flame this album to hell lol. But I agree completely, this album sucks.
Please review G-Eazy&#39;s &quot;When It&#39;s Dark Out&quot;
I feel as though Kid Cudi&#39;s issues are a combination of a) his fans willingness to listen/support anything, and b) the drugs. Unfortunately I think he has done way too many drugs and has gone so deep in his head he thinks he is Jimmy Hendrix reincarnate. He may actually be really delusional
08-09 Cudi &gt;
he didn&#39;t say forever
U should do a Jhene Aiko record review
Score is too generous. Cudi sounds like he recorded every song while nodding in and out of sleep.
&quot;haircake&quot; *vomitcomet.
I remember when people were putting cudi into their top 5 lists lmao
You look kida black, but you aren&#39;t... What?
I thought confused was ok, but everything else on the album just makeS me CRINGE AND THEN PROCEED JUMP OFF A CLIFF
I have never had someone make me feel so wrong for liking a couple of songs on a record.
1) title track was catchy <br>2) this is lulu level<br>3) Your Beavis was on point light 9<br>4)srry4Damages
How do you review crap like this but not the new built to spill album that came out this year. oh yeah, all about getting more views. I&#39;ve refused subscribing since the BTS fail, but now I&#39;ve decided I will be better off going to pitchfork to find out about new music.
This could be an album meant to be heard live
I couldn&#39;t even finish listening to the album. That&#39;s how fucking terrible it was.<br><br><br>LMAO he put in the description &quot;Buy this album if you dare&quot;
bahahaha album didnt even earn a 1
This was no review, this was a roasting session üòÇüòÇ
What exactly was this album? Kid Cudi only had one classic album. ONE. I really don&#39;t understand how bad this guy has fallen off. MOTM 1 is so good and MOTM 2 had a few great songs but it&#39;s a below average album. The rest of his catalog is trash, very forgettable, and cringey. Unbelievable this moron should retire.
It&#39;s sad but I completely agree with this review. Long live the MOTM days.
.94721...
I&#39;m waiting for someone to say they liked it üòÇüòÇüòÇ
&quot;Who am I? who are we? I just want to feel complete!&quot; - Lyrical genius
Has Kid Cudi become the Shia LaBeouf of modern music?
The album cover says it all
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ I love this
Can you review The Pope&#39;s album?... for the sake of humanity
Lmaoo this album was God awful, I gave every song a chance I promise
FUCKING DESTROYED
pls review black market
Hey Anthony, I was wondering if you could review the album &#39;The Devil and God are Raging Inside Me&#39; by the band Brand New.  I found it surprising that you didn&#39;t have a review of this album as it seems like something you would have reviewed.  Now that I know you haven&#39;t it&#39;s like I have an itch to scratch.  I really want to know your in depth opinion.  Thanks for your time.
I love cudi but this album is shit
Tried to listen to this while working this morning, couldn&#39;t get passed track 2. Usually I don&#39;t agree with Kidthony Cudtano, but this was a very surprising change.
ahahaha kid cuddly
With this album, I got my coal early this Christmas.
worse than Callasic? Actually yeah, it really is.
You should make a video of the top 10 worst albums you reviews since you started this channel.
kind of pissed I bought the album. Should&#39;ve just torrented it first.
But when are you reviewing that new Nxworries EP duuuude
I enjoyed Wzrd, Indicud, &amp; especially Satellite Flight. I can enjoy this one after deleting a few songs &amp; skipping when the B&amp;B skits come in.
10 outta 10 review it again
This is the one cuds album I cant defend
I have to say, this is the nail in the coffin when it comes to Cudi pissing off his fans, this is not a good album, R.I.P Scott Mescudi.
Best album of the year
Would you rather listen to this or Planningtorock?
The only thing I&#39;ve liked from Cudi is that hook on Guilt Trip... that was amazing...
I thought SBTH was fireee
Review g eazys new album
yeah future and young thug are much better . Its made for the fans you don&#39;t like it cuz you can&#39;t understand it so stfu!
I love Indicud. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s bad at all.
It is really terrible, no matter how many times you listen to it... It&#39;s so boring and repetitive imo
TND man... that cudi impression was so on point that I almost forgive you for the Bad Neighbor review. At least Indicud had redeeming qualities, but this is totally inept. But of course it&#39;s soo artistic that only his real fans get it, amirite guys?
I would give it a 5. I thought it was decent. I wouldn&#39;t go back to it but it wasn&#39;t the worst thing.
This is one of the most entertaining reviews in 6 years of watching your channel
If Kanye west made this garbage people would call it genius
Has Anthony ever given a 0 before?
L/10
FIRE! FIRE!
lol fuck kid cudi.Review that new curren$y. But godamn you went ham on this shit
Big fat zero haha. O
The uh...the mental breakdown has to end at some point, Cudi.
i viewed the first 10 seconds of each song and didnt like them at all at first but last night i listened to the album and listened to the lyrics and the tone in cudi&#39;s voice and i understand the state that he is in at the moment and I appreciate this album a lot more as not music to enjoy but music as a message to the world, somewhat of a translation.
this album is fucking garbage lol. I kinda liked MOTM1, dug a couple tracks on WZRD, loved MOTM2 (most of the love is probably just nostalgia of my friends playing the album all the time) but, other than that, I don&#39;t like Cudi. He&#39;s so far up his own ass, he just releases unlistenable bullshit every year or two, and his fans will tell you he&#39;s some kind of visionary lmao.
Review G-Eazy&#39;s When It&#39;s Dark Out. You never reviewed any of his stuff yet.
Cudi, please retire.
Damn. This album made you mad lol.
am i the only one who actually enjoys indicud and doesnt mind sattelite flight. but wzrd and this... i cant fuck with
While I agree that this album is about a 3/10, it does have some bright spots. Speedin&#39; Bullet 2 Heaven, The Nothing, and Red Sabbath are decent tracks. But it really is nothing like old Cudi. Confused sounds so cheap. It really sounds like these songs were recorded once in a garage. Not very pretty at all.
Kid Cudi broke you
I liked confused
THE ENDING IM SO DONE FANTOINE üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
im fucking dying lmaooooooo üò≠üò≠
Savage lol
Woo nice vinyls. Portishead AND Polaris.
I love the comments on Soundcloud. &quot;Fuck all you haters honestly smh.&quot; Kid Cudi fanboys are the best.
...worse than Miley Cyrus?
Cudi has always been whack, but I&#39;ll always enjoy a review that tears his insincere bull shit apart.
Nigga left G.O.O.D. music for that?
I listened the first 30 seconds and shut it off and yelled &quot;THIS IS SHIT!&quot; Cudi I was bars 16 of them can u give it to me? Fanta no do you agree?
Help me move out my parents house <a href="https://soundcloud.com/flow349/hoe-having-options-everywhere">https://soundcloud.com/flow349/hoe-having-options-everywhere</a>
This his first ever 0/10?
Yup, yup. Thought I was the only one who got that Kurt Kobain documentary vibe. Lmao
Kid Cuddly
I loved everything until satellite flight. I liked some from SF but he is definitely trying some things that aren&#39;t working out.
here&#39;s an idea. What if Travi$ Scott took over man on the moon series and made &quot;Man on the moon 3&quot;
Never heard a Kid Cudi album until this. This album makes me smile for some reason.
fucking 0?! damn
review blue neighbourhood (deluxe), likely there&#39;ll be lots of people listening to it????
Review Rick Ross - Black Market !! His best album since Teflon Don!!
completely agree with this review, anybody whos praising this album is lying. straight up. RIP Kid Cudi, you had a good run
I listened to almost the whole album today. It made me angry too. What a trainwreck this &quot;album&quot; is...
nice polaris album. think i&#39;l go listen to it right now ^_^
Ironically Satellite was actually good lol
2015: The first year that Fantano gave both a 10 and a 0.
I&#39;ve been a fan of Cudi since the beginning but this album fucking sucks. Goddamn.
Motm 2 was when kid Cudi released his last good album.  This shit he is pulling at is passing me off.  Wtf is he doing...  All respect I had for him is almost all gone.  His old stuff is still fucking great.
Fantano got some serious ear ulcers from this album
You make me hate white people more than I already do.
Im a huge fan and even i have to agree with this review.
Anthony charged up!
It&#39;s like if Brand New smashed there guitars against the floor the whole album while singing badly.
i liked the album... what does that say about me exactly?
Anthony, Please review Embrace - Armin Van Buuren
Fairy Tale Remains and Melting are actually pretty good Mr. Needledrop!
Anthony SNAPPED
Does anyone remember the last time Anthony&#39;s reviewed something and gave it a zero?
Stop teasing us with Captain Beefheart!
Don&#39;t let a review shape your mind. Give it a listen. I love the needle drop. I liked the album. I don&#39;t have any knowledge on rock music. I&#39;ve been a hip hop fan all my life. So from what I heard the structure of the album is terrible and musically at its core the album is terrible. I enjoyed my experience with this album. I&#39;m not going to put this joint on repeat but I had a great experience with it. Never been a huge cudi fan. Some peoples favorite movies receive shitty reviews. It&#39;s all about what you take from it and what you see. I can&#39;t tell you if the album is good. Anthony can cause he has plenty of experience with this genre. I trust his reviews. I just found my own way to enjoy the album. It&#39;s all love at the end of the day.
WHY THE FUCK IS IT A ROCK ALBUM IF HES A RAP ARTIST NIGGA WHAT THE FUCK
this shit is fuckin&#39; trash
i couldn&#39;t finish this album
I am a Kid Cudi fan but I agree 100%! It&#39;s funny because he made MOTM while having a Coke addiction. Now he is just &quot;sober&quot; and delusional. This album was a 0 for sure.
Portishead in the back!!!
fuck u :)
Jesusony Christano you went beyond ethering him in this review lol. On a serious note, it&#39;s really hard to see Cudi fall so far into the depressing state he is in. I don&#39;t even care about the music anymore, I just hope he can find the help that he needs to get into a better place in his  life.
A 0?  I&#39;ve never seen Anthony be this angry...
I&#39;m guessing a 0.94721
0/10 lol. Only 3 good songs out of the 20 something. Das it mane!
lmao I read it as a 9.4 in the description and was optimistic when I started the vid, 20 seconds in i knew I had made a grave mistake
I woke up at 5 AM excited, bought the album and caught the biggest L of my entire existence. Still waiting for iTunes to refund me on that one.
I knew it was a bad idea for Cudi to get off G.O.O.D. Music.
fantano is heartless lol
Savagothy Withthatratingtano
I get it, the album is actually inspiring because you think to urself &quot;if this person can live off this shit I can too&quot; lol
Review idea, G-Eazy &quot;When it&#39;s dark out&quot;
You know, that something wrong happened, when there&#39;s no tran-<br>sition and &quot;forever&quot; at the end
waiting for g-eazy...
Kid Cudi is the worst artist of all time now
I have no doubt this is a terrible album. But is it really worse than Miley, Migos and Young Thug???
Anthony Fantano, keeping it real
All his albums are dope although WZRD (it was descent) also satellite flight was a half ass EP. This has to be my least fav Cudi album and possibly his worst but I can&#39;t really judge this album a lot cuz I&#39;m no huge alternative fan other then listening to Raury and rappers that release alternative. Ya&#39;ll might say he fell but most of y&#39;all rap fans judging an alternative album. Just listen to his next album all of you will be back.
I thought this album was gonna suck, I really liked this album. it was different and I liked the new sound. it&#39;s not bad, I feel like most people have a closed mind. I&#39;m a big hip hop head.. but I really liked this punk rock sound. 9/10
this shit worse than iggy azalea&#39;s like bruh
this was a trash album his label wanted him gone
cudi&#39;s insanity did fall off smh
I liked it
Usually I like this guys opinion...<br>But expand your mind there needle <br>Cudi is the most creative artist out rn aside Kendrick Lamar and the underachievers <br><br>I give this album a 8 or 9 <br>... Let it grow on you needle
I liked indicud but not sb2h
Completely agree, I thought it was almost unlistenable, I was so disappointed. Cudi had a few huge, timeless hits in 2009 but that was his peak and he never again reached that.
No bad album could make a person this angry.
As a huge cudi fan i gotta say i was dissapointed. Indicud might be where i stop with cudi...smfh
Hey anthony, have you listened the album 100% Electronica from George Clanton?
review trout mask replica
WHY THEY PUT THE DICK IN THE PUSSY?????
I&#39;m just going to sit here and wait for MOTM3 lol.
The score though. That&#39;s cruel. lmao.
Lmao Chicken Sandwiches
wow... the only 0.<br><br><br>can it be that bad?<br><br>do i want to know
I think a... 1
CLASSIC üòÇüòÇ
ode lmao
Wait, it&#39;s a &quot;≈óock&quot; album? What?
What makes the fact that this album is complete trash even better is knowing that Cudi turned into a douchebag and deserves it
Daaaaaaamn Fantano Ethered Cudder lol. Lupe&#39;s got Cudi shook, lol Scott&#39;s gonna bounce back hard....I hope
REVIEW THE VID OF STITCHES GETTING CLAPPED
Wow wasn&#39;t expecting a 6/10
Now I have to listen to the album...
Still listening to the album and i like it so far.
Not surprised tbh
this is pretty much what i expected
Dam, not even a Forever?
Amazing.
When was the last time you used decimals in a review especially for ratings under 1?
Sucks you dont like it :/
my nigga You don&#39;t like indicud wtf is wrong with you shit was a classic from the production to the message he was giving us it wasn&#39;t even a hip hop album it was a feel good album like it was suppose to give you confidence like it was suppose to set a fire in you
savage anthony &gt; praisin anthony
This album was the biggest disappointment ever. and I love cudi.
Is that the pete&amp;pete soundtrack on the background? what a gem
Can u review canal street confidential
it is utterly horrendous
For once I actually agree with your review! huge Kid Cudi fan but this album just went downhill...
Anthony should add a playlist called roasts to his channel with this being the first one on the list
Cudi just needs to accept he&#39;s nothing without the genuine guidance of Emile and Plain Pat. I&#39;m kind of disappointed that Plain Pat was even involved with this. GET Emile back Cudi.
&quot;Completely unlistenable&quot; LMFAO NOOO
great review
Look at the bright side, someone might check out or remember that Polaris album and have something great to listen to for the day. <br><br>I sure did :)
Gotta say, couldn&#39;t disagree more. I was not really a huge Cudi fan. I liked Solo Dolo, and that was about it. This album intrigues me. It&#39;s too clean for my taste. But his vocals are not terrible for this style of music. Plus, we&#39;re all ignoring the fact that he took a major risk in going in this direction. And I personally think this album will open up the door for more black youth to get into the punk/rock scene. There hasn&#39;t been a rocker of color in the mainstream limelight in a very, very long time. So, think of this album as the first stepping stone to introducing new people to punk &amp; more grungey rock. And this is coming from a fan of Jay Reatard, Mean Jeans, Manateees, Ex-Cult, Ty Segall, and many more grittier sounding groups/artists. I just honestly think you were too harsh on this album. Was it amazing? No. Great? No. Good? Ehh. Decent? I&#39;d say so. Culturally significant? Hell fuckin&#39; yeah.
I really hope Cudi sees this review.
the moment you realize some even heard rappers have never released a single album in their whole lives and this guy just dropped this...lmao
Kid Cudi&#39;s past work was interesting, what happened? <br>why does some of this decade artists who start avant garde, try to be more experimental and end up being a stupid mess, grunge band wannabes and shit????<br>p.s. I loved that Filthy Frank Reference
BRUH I WAS IN TEAAAARRSS HE WAS LIKE IM FEELIN A ZEROOO üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
I&#39;m curious about your thoughts on Handle with Care? I agree with the pass on SATELLITE FLIGHT but I actually do enjoy this album when chilling, after listening to it multiple times. Kid Cudi&#39;s sound has defiantly become more unique over the years but, I must say before the demo portion I did enjoy the album. (maybe I&#39;m who you were reference when you said his die hard fans lol) can wait for MM III
is kid Cudi copying Black Sabbath cause I&#39;m not influence.....
wtf cudi
Lupe Won
ether
I really liked the beavis and butthead parts, so I&#39;ll give it a 2
THE ETHER, THE SHIT THAT MAKES YA SOUL BURN SLOW
Now I&#39;ll listen to this just of pure curiosity. I feel kinda ashamed but hyped af at the same time.
I just Dont want motm 3 to be rock. like cudi please.
Savageny Ethertano
fantano :(
Damn I was just about to ask to review this :/
As a huge Kid Cudi fan, his music helped get me through some rough times, and an advocate of the MOTM Series, Indicud, and even some parts of Satellite Flight, I must say that this &quot;album&quot; is complete trash. Trust me, I am a rock and alternative fan just as much as rap and hip-hop, and I must say that this album has nothing good going for it. It genuinely made me nauseous listening to it. I&#39;m sorry Cudder, and I want to say I understand what you were going for with the whole Nirvana and grunge feel, but the album is just so disembodied that it is impossible to listen to. I hope you comeback with MOTM3, and move past this stage of terrible &quot;garage rock grunge music.&quot; <br>Still a fan, but, am not pleased right now with the Kid&#39;s work. <br>:/
this album is a poor man&#39;s wannabe Jimmy hendrix hipster redux stinking pile of shit. 2 songs I couldn&#39;t finish before going, really nigga? What provoked this dude to lose his shit and make this crap? Is he stuck in some kind of record deal from the 90&#39;s were he can&#39;t stop making a certain number of albums? Smh
Anthony is in the thumbnail like &quot;I hope y&#39;all ready for this heat. I&#39;m finna roast this nigga&quot;
Tasty haircake...
Drugs don&#39;t make good music? How about Eminems early albums haha
Miley Cyrus and Cudi got the same dealer.
Speedin&#39; Bullet To My Garbage Can
This was like an AVGN review
It was a sad moment when the video ended and I said out loud &quot;TRAN-SITION!&quot;
Still better than g eazy tho lmao that nigga looks like a 40yr old greaser
Been a big kid cudi fan and have to say with all the time looking forward to his new album I was really disappointed it was just awful :(
I&#39;ve been an ardent cudi fan since his Man on the Moon mixtape in 2008, but even I completely acknowledge that he&#39;s been falling off as a musical artist. That WZRD album was the first mark of his downfall. But at least I can keep listening to Man on the Moon The End of Day with a smile on my face. Good review Fantano
Kid cudi hasn&#39;t made a decent album since man on the moon 1 everything he dropped after had only 1 good song on each project, and what makes it worse is that he&#39;s not humble he drops projects thinking everyone will come out of it thinking he&#39;s a genius but his shit is garbage how you gonna shit of wattba and then drop a fucking wack record
So happy I did not pay for this record.
BASED FANTANO SAVAGE AS FUCK!
Damn chill badthony savagetano
Obviously you don&#39;t understand avant garde post ironic satire
I donnt wannnt to be hereeee anymore
Kid Cudi hasn&#39;t been good since 2009.
Lel you are mentioned in the &quot;critical reception&quot; part from the wikipedia article of this album
He needs to go back to his a kid named cudi and man on the man days
Yeah I agree. His peak was MOTM 1. Ever since then he&#39;s just been downspiraling, to the point where I&#39;m not even looking forward to MOTM 3 anymore. In my opinion, he needs Kanye behind him. He left GOOD Music because he thought he didn&#39;t need Kanye anymore, but he was sadly very mistaken :/
Review marauding in paradise pls
Went and listened to the titular track. Started off a little generic but didn&#39;t sound too bad. Then the vocals started and they weren&#39;t very good but not horrible. A minute later of awful worthless lyrics being delivered in Kid Cudi&#39;s droning voice and I had had enough.
damn, I was never a Cudi fan, I always thought MOTM was overrated as fuck, but I really like this new album, I had low expectations because of everyone bashing it but it&#39;s a solid 7/10 for me.
lmao just ripped this album a new assholeüòÇüòÇ I feel bad cause I like kid cudi I really do but the beevis and butthead skits and the lyrics on the album was a little to cringe worthy for me also I loved his hip hop record I even liked indicud after it grew on me but at this point it feels like cudi is just winging it with his music at this point and makes me really scared to listen to motm 3...
I actually really like Man in the Night
I&#39;m really hoping MOTM3 returns to the music style of his i&#39;ve come to know and love.
Why do you continue to review this guy? Face it, you&#39;ll never dig Cudi, Slowtony Learntano
o fucc
I lost it when he gave it a zero.
On the speeding&#39; bullet 2 heaven wiki in the critical reception &quot;Anthony Fantano, the Internet&#39;s busies music nerd absolutely massacred that album by giving it a note of 0 out of 10&quot;
Hop on the new G-Eazy album, I&#39;m digging it
this abum is bad, really bad. i forced myself to listen to the whole thing to give it a honest try, and jesus fucking christ i honestly think something is wrong with the guy.
2 minutes in and this is the most fun time I&#39;ve ever had seeing a Fantano pan.
Oh boy... I didn&#39;t plan to listen to this, but now i have to! :&#39;(
You didn&#39;t get it, Anthony.. <br><br>It&#39;s a metaphor for Career Suicide. <br><br>Kid Cudi- well played, sir, well played.
Jesus Christ give me back that 2010 cudi
Fantano hit Cudi with the goose egg wow savage
in this review anthony roasts kid cudi harder than miley cyrus
I only liked 3 song off this smh disappointed
how did this get a 0 but miley cyrus&#39;s album got a strong 1?
People would&#39;ve complained if Anthony didn&#39;t review this. So he did. I don&#39;t understand the &quot;hit bait&quot; slander.
Well this wasn&#39;t exactly the Man on the Moon III I wanted.<br><br>Did this album make anyone else appreciate Satellite Fight a little bit more? Lol
Should&#39;ve stayed with GOOD, maybe that would&#39;ve helped a little.
This album is dope wtf
i like embers but for 1 track you love there is 20 something tracks you hate so..
Best album ever ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Man you&#39;re always hating on that kid cuddly!!
Yo fam when you coming out with a &quot;When it&#39;s Dark Out&quot; review
I passed on this to get RIck ROss RUH! lol
Hopefully this was an experiment what would be great kid goes back to his old sound on MOTM3
How did he go from Pursuit of Happiness, to this shit man
so. is it 2 late to jump on the cudi bandwagon. is it over
The Return of Chip Douglas is genuinely a contender for the worst song I&#39;ve ever heard. 2 and a half minutes in he just starts making weird noises, and the last thirty seconds it sounds like he&#39;s being strangled to death.
I honestly think you&#39;re completely wrong slutano
Not gonna argue because I love how experimental the album is and I&#39;m genuinely a Cudi fan. But How can you do a review of a 26 track album after it&#39;s been out for only a day.
Hahahaha a decimal
It&#39;s like the episode of Family Guy when Louis and Peter take drugs and perform at the talent show
Dat Portishead album doe....
Anthony Slaytano
The Cudi kids are coming....
:(
I&#39;m a huge Cudi fan but besides the song Speedin Bullet To Heaven it&#39;s pretty trash tbh
Smh, I actually liked this album...
UR A FUCKIN HATER IT WAS EASILY A 0.94722/10
Yeah, he&#39;s terrible. And his acting career is God-awful too.
how the fuck do you give deathgrips a 10 but this a 0. It was bad, but not a 0
10 outta 10, review it again!
kanye better not let us down like his student.
I&#39;ve been a cudi fan ever since my stoner friend showed me balmain jeans from satellite flight.. I ended up looking more into his music and loved just about every bit of it.. it&#39;s like you  have to know the sound, the feel, vibes &amp; lyrics he provides. I listened to WZRD and it&#39;s just not so great, we can all agree on that.. but last year I think it was Cudi released his &quot;Love&quot; single and then the &quot;fans&quot; and the TRUE KiD CuDi listeners were prepared for a possible MOTM 3.. well he shortly claimed MOTM 3 was just a title, an idea, that it may not even exist. Well that put us all down just a bit, but then he drops information on how his music will be from now on.. you can search the tweets yourself but he basically explained it wouldnt be that spacey electronic hip hop vibe we love.. them he goes on to drop Confused, and the fans and everybody else had their mixed feelings about it, well then comes another two tracks Wedding Tux &amp; Judgemental Cunt, thats when we knew the new direction he was going in. I had honestly enjoyed these tracks, it was like I didn&#39;t focus on any repeating guitar rifts and the same drums being played over &amp; over, but I focused on the feel, the lyrics and how it compared to my own life &amp; how his old music could somewhat fit my situations.. thats where CuDi became an amazing artist to me, it wasn&#39;t just in the sound or way the music is made but it just being him and the lyrics.. Don&#39;t get me wrong I loved vibing to that spacey trippy vibe he had composed like a mad genius, it took me places and did so to many others. Well now that SBTH has dropped it&#39;s just like a another amazing record from Scott.. I feel like theres so much hate on it either because 1. He&#39;s not rapping bars, 2. His music is now alternate/ punk rock influenced or 3. The sound or lyrics he&#39;s now providing, many people can&#39;t seem to understand or recognize. Me being the huge CuDi fan I am, I absolutely love this record, I&#39;ll admit some tracks aren&#39;t as easy to listen to compared to some others, but it&#39;s about the music coming from Scott that matters to me, plus I want to add that I thought the Beavis and Butthead skits were hilarious, B&amp;B is one of my favorite shows and it was so sick hearing them on this record.. I guess I&#39;m no judgemental cunt when it comes to music.
Thank you for referencing papa franku, hairthony caketano
Cudi is one of those dudes that thinks he&#39;s super artistic because he isn&#39;t doing mainstream music but when in reality he acutally kinda sucks.  I read this in a review, but some website called it the &quot;poor man&#39;s Yeezus,&quot; and I found that extremely accurate.  He&#39;s trying to be artistic and expanding his sound, but it just plain sucks
Do the new SikTh EP already.
Damn Cudi Not Even Kanye can save U from this one.
God Damn
Dismantled
PLEASE KANYE Please T-T dont be like Cudi leave that yeezus shit alone PLEASE
Future&#39;s verse on Digital Dash is better than this whole album.
OH MY FUCKING GOD I DIED THAT WS HILARIOUS but i gotta agree after MOTM2 cudi just lost his mind
loved MOTM ii, indicud, but this my dear people is .............batshit lol

best video 2k15
BEST REVIEW OF THE YEAR!! XD
Can you legally change your name to Kidthany Cudtano? Maybe just Indicud? You really should do an interview with him, maybe give him a hug? Pledge your undying love? Swear your allegiance to Bjork together?
Kid Cudi &gt; Kendrick Lamar
Dam Cal Chuchesta album blew this shit out the window we need his sophmore Album
Man this album was horrible it makes professional rapper look like good kid maad city
Please make G-Eazy stans cry, please
so this is the first album that got rated by fantano as 0.  Well that makes it memorable I guess
Honestly i made a music in 30 minutes in garage band in the ipad for my friends bday , that is better than 90 minutes of kid cudi bullshit --&gt; <a href="https://soundcloud.com/fernando-marchetti-1/minha-mu-sica">https://soundcloud.com/fernando-marchetti-1/minha-mu-sica</a>
I can see myself enjoying this album when I&#39;m intoxicated, but other than that it&#39;s a not that great.
What is the font at the start of the video?
Die hard cudi fan but damn... this album was shit.
lmao i haven&#39;t even listened to the album but this video is hilarious
Dislike bar increasing in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Dam My Cudi taking Ls
i had red liquid spewing out my ears just listening to the opening.
Kid cudi probably had a bad trip when he made this album... It is honestly one of the worst albums I&#39;ve heard in my life time.
Review Jarrod Alonge&#39;s album? :D
If Death Grips had severe autism, this album would exist in their name.
Review HermitOfEastGrandRiver
Loved the album ‚ù§Ô∏è
Plain Pat and Emile were the best when they worked with him
Kidthony Cudtano, it may be that you loved it so much you can&#39;t fathom enjoying a project so much so.
this shit is trash bruh n I&#39;m a cudi fan
Okay, I just read Aesthetic Theory by Adorno. Maybe this music is actually so derivative and lacks so much conventional skill that it actually defies it&#39;s purpose which makes it great art.
HOLY FUCK THIS WAS AMAZING
U ALWEYS H8TED ON DA KID CUADALEE
Absolutely true that drugs do not make you make good music. They make already good music even better hahaha
Eyy don&#39;t be bringing up the hair cake. Don&#39;t justify that shit
Nothony Chilltano
idunno anthony, give it like 20 more listens to see if it grows on you
you should listen to it again
review no ceilings 2
I checked the description.<br><br>After seeing this rating, im scared of the comments section.
It&#39;s so obvious you made this review for the money lol. I bet you gave it only one listen.
Damn, Fantano&#39;s being very generous this year
I didn&#39;t even give this album the time of day. Thanks for reassuring me. I kind of felt like it would be a disaster.<br>&quot;Man on the Moon III&quot; is his last chance. If that flops then he&#39;s done.
really??<br>This gets a 0 but TPAB gets a 10???
Coldthany Fantanplay: A Head Full of Reviews.
Cudi is trash
I liked the album personally
Fantano went HAM!
This is the funniest review I&#39;ve watched üòÇ and even though I don&#39;t usually agree with your opinion sometimes, I must admit this album was pretty trash üòÇ
This album got a lower rating than the one that graced us with the lyric &quot;Why they put the dick in the pussy?&quot; Is this really worse than dead pets?
That boy went all the way fucking in
Miley Cyrus And Her Dead Petz VS Speedin Bullet To Heaven
can u review smyle by Kyle
Judgony Cuntano
Holy shit, he laid into this. I&#39;m a bit afraid to check it out now. Cudi has been missing me with a lot of his music lately, if it really is this bad, I may completely cut him off
MANTHONY FANBRAHNO
this album is awful
when is cudi gonna get back to rapping? i hate to see one of my favorite artists ever to turn into this, although i did like indicud and SOME songs on wzrd
Why you always so harsh on cudi?
Holy shit this is gonna be good (grabs popcorn)
rip cudi<br>fight me cudi stans
When&#39;s that TMR review coming Anthony?
Fuck you Anthony I can&#39;t believe you didn&#39;t even mention &quot;The Return Of Chip Douglas&quot; he was spittin straight flames on there
What The hell<br>I listened to the linked track.. it&#39;s really shocking
I agree this record is Shit
Anthony can be mean. I guess you need to be able to be mean if you&#39;re a critic... :( but i still have faith that cudi can make something good.
I like the Album Art
Hey Anthony! speedin bullet to heaven = To pimp a butterfly/Tetso &amp; Youth. You just don&#39;t get it
This is what happens when you&#39;re surrounded by delusional fans and yes men.
I love kid cudi and I couldnt wait for his new album. But this record makes me want to swallow my own head. The disappointment is real.....
Honestly there were some &quot;ok&quot; songs here. The title track, Trauma, Melting, Handle With Care, Embers (that goat outro) and even Adventures isn&#39;t too bad minus the stupid skit. None of these songs are really good or anything but still. Or maybe the album was so shit that these songs were alright in that context
Probably one of the worst albums I&#39;ve ever heard
I feel you, Anthony. I didn&#39;t know how to feel about WZRD and Indicud, because I&#39;d been such a fan before that. But I know how to feel about this. It&#39;s garbage and I hope whatever weird thing is plaguing Scott goes away soon.
Did Anthony like Kid Cudi&#39;s first album? Thats the only Cudi album I enjoyed lol
Kurt Cobain&#39;s album is worse than this one
and i always wondered why kid cudi was in a relationship with amanda bynes. they have a lot more in common then i thought
i was never huge on cudi but i did enjoy his old work when i heard it but ever since he became the new band leader on Comedy  Bang Bang i found myself listening to all his old stuff and i really enjoyed it... but c&#39;mon w/ this album cudi...
HE GAVE AN ALBUM A 0 HOLY SHIT
Kudi is experiencing the same thing as Eminem. His old fans just want him back on drugs because he can&#39;t make good music sober. <br><br>Still though, this album sucked.
lol
Damn was the album that bad? It&#39;s sad to see an artist fall off this much.
IN the future this album will be legendary,right now it seems wierd or out of place but in the future these sounds will be considered genius <br>Personally I had a different experience,I turned off all the lights in my room,layed on my bed and listened to the album and drifted,shit was crazy what I saw,even so I went to sleep with it on and fuckin had lucid dreams of like Hell and like a female I loved,u can&#39;t just listen to a kid Cudi album like every other album,it&#39;s an experience
wtf even is this album? ive been listening to it like &quot;ok that song was weird as fuck. this next one has gotta be the hit.&quot; but, no. wtf even is this album?
Nice Portishead vinyl :)
WHOA. A 9/10! Everybody buy this album!
I was praying that this would be terrible just so I could see this review lmao. Thank you Kid Cudi üòÇ
NONONONONONONONO<br>NONONONO NO NO NO?
I respect Anthony&#39;s reviews cause he knows what he&#39;s talking about most of the time, I didn&#39;t like the album the first time, but I think it&#39;s wrong to review an album the day after it came out, usually he waits at least 3 or 4 days
This was just savage... A score below 1 üòÇüòÇüòÇ
This is fucking hilarious
I couldn&#39;t even finish listening to this album.<br>That&#39;s how bad it is
just that smug look on the thumbnail lol...you savage
pls shit on g-eazy
I miss when kid cudi was himself....last good thing he put out was Man on The Moon 2
Is this worse than planningtorock- all love&#39;s legal?
I listened to the first two songs and didn&#39;t really get the hate, then soon enough I understood.
haha epic video kevin! keep it up dude
Not even kidding I think Kid Cudi has lost his mind.
Holy shit, I have to listen to this myself
Danm a 0
destroyed
Going to cry myself to sleep listening to A Kid Named Cudi and Man on the Moon
can i have a Chef pls?
You gotta review G-Eazy&#39;s When It&#39;s Dark Out!
he fell off the edge of sanity
he&#39;s so shit now lollllllllll
The album is a shroom trip. I got chu Cudder mah boi. Not everyone will understand.
bruh.. how you have 2 favourite tracks but give it a zero? while i obviously agree that kid cudis new music obviously is well.. you know. But i will never disrespect cudi because he gave the world 2 classic alt hip hop albums, whether you like them or not! and the things he does for kids like him is super cool too, so yeah while i agree i miss the old cudi, people need to chill with the disrespect for real. like a zero? nah man...
but &#39;ye tweeted out a song from it so, 10
He really said 0
TRAVIS BECAME THE TEACHER
For anyone who hasn&#39;t heard the album, yes it&#39;s actually that bad. I even tried so hard to like it, but it&#39;s so boring, amateur and has no redeeming qualities
Could you review the new Johnny Cash album Man In Black live in Denmark 1971.
So you didn&#39;t like it?
I love when you review terrible albums, reminds me of when AVGN suffered through shitty games for our entertainment. Cal bless you, Anthony.
yeah this album wasn&#39;t good
This is definitely one of the worst albums of 2015.
I agree
LMFAOOOOOO
Indicud was great though :/
What&#39;s next? G eazy and Coldplay albums seem logical.
Love that Polaris/Pete &amp; Pete album.
this guys fuckin hilarious
10/10 REVIEW IT AGAIN
DESTROYE<br>        D
Light 3. only like maybe 3 or 4. I was huge a cudi fan he helped me fight depression. but this album is so bad like funny bad lol.
WZRD is one of my favorite albums hehe
Damn Anthony, shots fired at Kurt
I&#39;m a huge Cudi stan and this might&#39;ve been that album for me. I&#39;ll still support him because he&#39;s doing what he wants and I respect artist integrity, but I&#39;m not enjoying this music at all anymore.
That smug ass smile in the thumbnail though lol
I couldn&#39;t get through it either.
.9 lolüôÄ
Worst album of the decade
Lid Ludi
This is the greatest ether you&#39;ve ever done.
holy shit.
Kind of wondering if Curren$y, Cudi, Coldplay, and G-Eazy teamed up for the worst day in recent musical history
BLOWN THE FUCK OUT
Lmao this is gold. I used to enjoy Cudi&#39;s music, but he&#39;s transformed into an absolute joke of an artist. I don&#39;t know how anyone in their right mind can call themselves a fan of his current music. Also, he has zero classics, so stop that nonsense, stans.
Im go out there and say Lil b&#39;s california boy trumps this whole album
ahaha &#39;no!no!no!&#39;
What is the vinyl left to the Portishead vinyl? Also nice Filthy Frank comparisment Anthony.
Shouldn&#39;t you be turning us on to new music instead of making hit bait like this?
Damn this album seems like it pissed you off it was so bad x&#39;D
inb4 Cudi&#39;s dickriders say &quot;but this is good because he went for a different route!!!!!11!&quot;
I could tell this album was gonna be sadly disappointing just by the cover art.
I used to be a huge Kid Cudi fan, but even I know this album is garbage.
Savage as fuck
10/10 if not, you don&#39;t know rock&amp;roll
Indicud was a great album btw
I could tell by the thumbnail that he didn&#39;t like it
Damn bro a 0? Lol, got to respect ur opinion though.
I loved it! Fuck it! My opinion. Whatever.
i guess fantano is just not a chosen one, feel sorry for him tho
I hated it.
just looking at that thumbnail, i can already tell this is a ten on ten
Wow, Fantano&#39;s second 10/10 for the year.¬† Amazing.
review g eazy and curren$y
Dummy
Lmfao! Anthony is a genius!
Deepthony Noisetano
I LOVE YOU ANTHONY!!!

Regi Blinker

Oh boy...

KIDTHONY CUDTANO

KTT
Glad I&#39;m here so early, but Jesus Christ that score/description. Thought this was like a 4.
Ayy lmao
I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m the first one here for this trainwreck
