rip bh sat trilogy is so good
I can&#39;t be the only one who thinks this is easily one of their worst albums. I don&#39;t know what it is, but the songwriting, hooks and vocal effects are just night and day between even just this and Sat2 for me.
how is face your least fav what
These guys are the only examples i know of good ripoffs
2023?
the beginning of something amazing
Damn it‚Äôs all over üò¢.
I can&#39;t believe this is already 5 years old
This was the first Hip Hop/Rap album I ever really connected with back in Winter 2017 and I checked it out because of this review. I remember working at shoe store for shit wage, age 24, cleaning the staff bathroom, listening to this for the first time because Anthony sounded so ecstatic about the album. I was nearly moved to tears when WASTE finished. I listened to the album a second time immediately. The BOOGIE video dropped like a week later and the rest is history.
Coming back to this following The Family and TM‚Äôs release is bittersweet. No matter how good something seems, it could end in just a few days, months, or for BH years. Take time to appreciate memories as they‚Äôre being created!
Good times
When and where did it all go wrong‚Ä¶
who else is here after he gave the albums a 3 and 4/10
here after TF and TM reviews üò¢üò¢
i miss the band already
watching this in late 2022.. sad times lol
Man the way anthony describes heat just gets me PUMPED
What i‚Äôd do to go back in time man‚Ä¶
This video came out on my birthday 5 years ago, thank you anthony! Really enjoyed this revisit to your review. It&#39;s a shame this was your last video, rest in peace
FACE IS SO GOOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
‚Äúevery track is great, too bad kevin is gay 3/10‚Äù man
: (
I love and I&#39;ll always love BROCKHAMPTON. Hope they reunite soon and I really hope that bearface drops a solo project.
Almost unsubscribed because of rating this shit boyband a 9 - but then I saw the rating for Ariel Pink and Badbadnotgood
I&#39;m going through all your video to just disslike
This album has aged the best out of all the saturation projects imo
I remember when these guys were still small and I went to the topic video for bump with only twenty comments. One guy just said ‚Äú?‚Äù Lol
Best saturation‚Äôs out of all 3
face is still the second best track on this album man I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s his least favorite
Is Gold on Fifa 21?
Album was ahead of it‚Äôs time. Literally, he‚Äôs wearing a face mask.
What I don&#39;t understand, is how american boyfriend was on why you no review, yet melon is singing the albums praises at the beginning here üòë
Ameer wearing that mask trying to tell us years in advance
What a legendary review and put me on Brockhampton but still shocked to see Face as least fav :( but I see what you&#39;re saying with that track
The masked fella on this album cover predicted the pandemic
Do &quot;As Above So Below&quot; by ANKHLEJOHN
Gei
MERLYN!
HOW IS WASTE NOT A LIKED SONG, that‚Äôs one of the best closers of the decade, up there with To Be Kind and Guest House
here from the future to tell you that BOOGIE sends me flying out of the back of an ambulance going full speed down the highway
FACE is prob my fav brockhampton song wth
Melon I can&#39;t believe pretended to wear a burqa for 11 minutes and screamed Islamaphobic slurs. Horrible &quot;review&quot;
Loved it
i agree.
I think this should have been a 10, but you bring some great and honest points. I respect your opinion completely. Unsubbed
We all know where we were when you heard the beat drop to swim for the first time
Anthony &quot;I have an ability to break an artist&quot; Fantano
Cmon melon we‚Äôve gone over this, WASTE should be in the fav tracks what‚Äôre you doing!?
face is good.
I got secrets only me and all my melons know
Imagine saying Brockhampton is for people who went to college nowadays
MILK is the best track in my opinion
anthony‚Äôs, u scared me
How is WASTE not in ur favorite tracks???
Waste not in favs track ? you a joke melon
WASTE not a favorite track!? MELON.
i know you can&#39;t be referencing infatuation &gt;:(
Why every single least fav track in any fantano‚Äôs album review is my fav track
‚ñ°
face was great:(
The fact that he gave  face the worst track just shows how great this album is.  I still feel like Face is one of the best on the album.
FACE is so good!
LEAST FAV TRACK: FACE
I‚Äôm happy this got a 9, but the way he was talking, I don‚Äôt get why he didn‚Äôt give it a 10
how tf his least favorite track face
Honestly i appreciate your views
Anthony&#39;s wearing the wife beaterüò≥
If FACE is his least favorite you know it‚Äôs a great album. FACE is so good.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBHjkRZQbv8&amp;t=612">10:12</a> thats the first time ive heard a voice crack from melon
I liked FACE a lot. Jobas singing and the instrumental really make it for me. The lyrics arent much to me but I also really dig the flow
I like that Animals in the background
anthony fantano is dad
fake is the best song on this album
Brockhampton is for the zoomers melon. Don&#39;t take away Brockhampton from the zoomers.
LEAST FAVE TRACK FACE. Bro Anthony I know you‚Äôre my step dad and you‚Äôll beat me for this but YOURE PLAYING RN. THAT IS A CAP. This is like saying Nikes is least fave smh
Wow.
&quot;I feel like I&#39;m listening to an OddFuture for people who went to college&quot; - Fantano<br><br>I still quote this to this day.
Face as Least Favorite? Come on you silly melon
I literally can not understand a word in brockhamptons songs
Ameer&#39;s verse on HEAT did not age well
Life was better during these days
1 million biiiiiiiiiiiitch!!!
Putting FACE on least favorite tracks list is a hate crime
bruh face was my fav
It‚Äôs so nice coming back to this review and seeing how amazing the boys are even 2 years ago
This is what started it all
This is where it all started
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBHjkRZQbv8&amp;t=246">04:06</a> - Melon predicted SWEET üî•
i dont get why this isnt a 10/10
Gels*
Me llamo Antonio. Y esto es un mel√≥n.
anyone notice he changed the description for this video recently
But.....but how is face your least favorite? I&#39;ve listened to every album Including ginger and face is still my favorite song they ever made
How was this not a 10?
Review GINGER...........NOW<br><br>PS. Plz
I‚Äôm still mad he said FACE was his least favorite.
I can‚Äôt believe you gave this a 9 but not Sat 3
anyone else notice the twitching going on on the pink floyd vinyl to the right of melon?
u always hate all the songs i like
These were truly the good ole days
This project highkey a 10/10
Still a great album
Take a shot everytime he says &#39;quality&#39;
thank you for letting me know about this band! they are fucking dope! didnt know brockhampton was this dope
9 from this guy is like 100000 or something üòÇ great album üî•
sodas not piss ur piss boiiii
I love this review but how in the fucking world is FACE the least favourite track in any list? I think that not even if you make a list that only has FACE in it could it be the least favourite track
I still don‚Äôt get how he said that face was a great track in his weekly review, but then he marks it as his least favorite track right here
How do brockhampton get so many good reviews, they get mediocre reviews everywhere else
least favorite track: FACE
I kinda hate he made face his least fav
LEAST FAV TRACK: FACE<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>no
Jesus melon, I&#39;m in the middle of NoFap. Put your shirt back on
What‚Äôs the point of having a fav tracks list if the entire album (almost) is on it
Says Face is FANTASTIC yet has it as his least fav? ü§î
Why is Yondu from Guardians of the Galaxy on the album cover of Saturation?
I just want that bump bump BUMP BUMP

Missed apportunity to say ‚Äúhi everyone, antony phantom here‚Äù
thicctony fantano
Best rap album of all time in my opinion
i cant believe there are mf‚Äôs that think this is their worst album
Which one‚Äôs Brock?
I loved face
Damn fantano back at it again with that muscle shirt
Are y&#39;all logic
Best album of all time
I‚Äôm trying to rank every Brockhampton song best to worst but it‚Äôs so hard because all of them are so good, hence why BUMP is so low cause all the other tracks are just as good. I mean dang BUMP hits hard.
FACE least fav track? C¬¥mon Melon, you are seriously on drugs...
<b>LEAST FAV TRACK: FACE</b><br>wat
This video I feel like pushed them into a larger fame
How did you not like face, i thought it was one of the best. I thought Fake, Swim and Boys were what was holding the album back
Looking back, most important music review of my life. Thank you Anthony
I haven‚Äôt seen Waterthony Melontano this excited since TPAB<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>speaking of tpab HOW WAS THIS NOT A 10!!! WHAT THE FUCK HOLDS IT BACK!!!
CUM was a kinda weird track that didn‚Äôt really fit in the flow of the album but other than that Pretty Cool!
I fucking hate swim because I begun listening to the band just when i broke up with my girlfriend at the time and that you loved to show out new outfit sentiment was just so fitting and its still like damn...
Now i listened to the singles, but they don&#39;t seem all to special. Low fi beats with a bunch of guys rapping nonsensical verses and a chris tucker rip off being obnoxious. What&#39;s so special about them?
This review is absolutely ON-POINT. And dude, your fluency and inventive articulation makes a review like this RE-WATCH-WORTHY and then some. You are the doyen of music reviews; no fucker comes close. Love you, Forever, brother. John.
Yall know if Fantano reviewed this now it‚Äôd be a 10
I will not forgive you for calling face your least favorite.
Its crazy how music you talked them up and didn‚Äôt give them a ten back then. I had to come back and watch this after I agreed with your iridescence review
hey I loved this review but you didn‚Äôt have to call ameer the n word and then proceed to call Kevin a bad musician
Came back to get a feel for melons review of iridescence when that comes out
MELON PREDICTED IRIDESCENCE YALL <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBHjkRZQbv8&amp;t=128">2:08</a>
How is FACE your least fav?
Fuck rap i want rock n roll!
You can argue that this review singlehandedly skyrocketed Brockhampton
am i the only person who thought he was gonna do the entire review in the yellow flannel?
Where it all began
ok.. i subscribed.

Heath Ledger with the dreads
Hey!! Animals record in the background :D
Handsomny Hunktano.
face is my favorite.
little tip for a fellow spectacles wearer. Get yourself some beeswax lip balm and put a little on the nose pads. Stops them from slipping constantly when its hot outside. Peace.
uuuuuh 10/10 just do it sirrrr
Na it was a 10
Follow me on twitter Glenn in the cut
i feel like if you liked face more you would have strong 9 to 10&#39;ed it
You insufferable pleb. You actually have the GALL to call Fall Out Boy&#39;s &quot;Mania&quot; anything LESS than &quot;an instant classic that pulls the rock genre back into its glory days&quot;? I will tell you that if you cannot appreciate such works of art like XXXTentacion&#39;s &quot;17&quot; or Kid Cudi&#39;s &quot;Speedin Bullet to Heaven&quot;, then I feel very sad for your sad, sad mind. I first came into contact with your train wreck of a musical taste on Tumblr where you mindlessly posted &quot;Chicken Spongebob&quot; and &quot;Sczechuan Sauce&quot; memes without any fear of what it might mean for the memescape as a whole. After that, I tracked your online presence everywhere from Wikipedia to Bandcamp, and I must admit that with every encounter I had, I grew more fearful of what your presence on this online platform might mean for the future of humanity. I STRONGLY urge you to turn off your router permanently. If not, I will use the 3.417 bitcoins I have to my name to pay my hacker to remove you from the Internet. You have 48 hours to comply.
Time travelin honda swervin thats so melon
I also like Animals by Pink Floyd
its hot cos ur in the room
Face is actually my favorite track.
me llamo Roberto y Saturation lll deserves a 10/10
how in the world did they made this album in three weeks.
this review a classic
Ghosthany Spooktano here
FACE IS THE BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM
SMH you gave this a 10/10 but Channel Orange a 7? SMH
How is face your least favorite track that is a great track
Heat amd star are so hype
&quot;LEAST FAV TRACK: FACE&quot;??<br>fight me boi
Trash

Aminals
light 8 for me
I slept on this until last night I finally put it on as I was falling asleep, and I literally couldn&#39;t sleep the entire way through cause it was too good, I didn&#39;t want to miss it. fuck man this blew my balls off
face is my fav track
It gets a 7-8 for me
Sticky album you got there
blue man group collab when
the beginning of a love story
I know it‚Äôs essential to have a mind of your own, but Antoine Fantoine gives so much insight, perspective, and thought into his reviews and has been for years. Just listened to this album before watching this, and there are a lot of moments in this review I think, ‚Äúaaaahhh YYEEAaaaahh, I get that...‚Äù
But, but, but FACE was my favorite track
FACE IS MY FAVOURITE SONG ON THE ALBUM ANTHONY HOW DARE YOU
Gold is the best song
The guy on the cover looks like a blue tyler1
MILK is a beautiful song.
I wish Anthony would‚Äôve painted himself blue in this review lmaooooo
How is Face the least favorite track
i come back to yellow flannel reviews because its so great to watch
Peep animals in the back
the start of it all
Ok call me crazy but anthony saying ‚Äúslipped through the cracks‚Äù in reference to Kevin‚Äôs album only for Kevin to spit ‚ÄúI slipped through the cracks‚Äù on Junky is NOT A DAMN COINCIDENCE
wtf bank is the worst track
He called face excellent and said it was his least fav track lol
Waste is a perfect ender
Says FACE is a fantastic track puts as least favorite
BL00D I SEE THAT FLANNEL
MILK had me crying bro. Hit too close
How the fuck do you not like FACE
If this album had a &#39;theme&#39; Melon would&#39;ve gave it a 10 a hundred percent.
not even a solid 9. wooooooooow
Me llamo Henrique, y me gusta FACE
<b>F L A N N E L</b>
LEGENDS
Hugh Janus goes absolutely off in this album, super cool
Isn&#39;t anyone else a little bothered by the occasional over use of autotune.<br>Boys is funny, and it is good but if I&#39;ve heard it recently I&#39;m just going to skip.<br>edit: I know it&#39;s deliberate but I find it hard listening.
anyone else made that his least favorite track was face
least favorite track is face!
Did melon change the score?
I just do not see any appealing in this music, just sonically they just do nothing to stimulate me me.  I mean this in best way possible, but this is just not for me it seems.
Its a boy band bro.
This is bs, Doomtree set the standard for what brockhampton is doing on this project
Nice tats
BEST BOY BAND SINCE ONE DIRECTION
That&#39;s not an undershirt that&#39;s a wife beater
Face ? Worst track? ANTHONY WHAT ARE YOU EVEN FUCKING TALKING ABOUT
Albu cover looks like yondu from guardians of the galaxy lol
BROCKHAMPTON is ONLINE
I just listened to this album just after listening to Eminems new shit.<br>Brochampton is officially gospel now.
PALE!<br>get out, more.
J O R B A
Wish I had found them earlier but glad I did at all, it&#39;s been a journey
His head looks like the bottom and top of an egg badly combined in a photoshop knockoff
9/10 every song is so creative and catchy. Bump, heat, &amp; face are the best.
FACE is the best track you melon headed fuck
FACE is a 10/10 doe
Might as well change this to classic/10
THEY SHOUTED U OUT MELON BABY!!!!!!
RIP SATURATION SZN GONE TOO SOON
Coming back after the release of the amazing Saturation III
Face is one of my favorite songs on this album
face is my favorite song in the album, waste is definetly the worst track by far. such a waste
9 was a little too much Saturation 2 was better.
Face is my favourite on the album - shows what a standout album this is Brocktano has this as his least favourite track.
Lets all not forget about Oldie now
II is better tho
please don&#39;t forget this album for ur end of year favourites!! i listened to this due to ur recommendation and I love brockhamptons work!!!
I really like BrockHampton and I just love American Boyfriend
I loved face, I love your face. Give me your face.
HOW DID YOU NOT LIKE FACE
THIS WAS NOT BETTER THAN KENDRICK
Does he say there are songs on this album that run deeper than rap? Meaning any other genre BESIDES rap is &quot;deeper&quot;?? he&#39;s biased!
This shit did go hard asf. These guys are just good
Do you think Brockhampton is the new and improved Odd Future?
I can&#39;t believe face is your least fav track..........
How you not like FACE though?
this dude looks like he smells
But face is my favourite :(
BROCKHAMPTON is ahead of its time
Trump trump trump we don‚Äôt like Donald trump
It should&#39;ve been: CANThony SEEthano
Man I can‚Äôt stand all these alt right ideas this melon is putting in his reviews.
Im fucking sinning<br>Hit the forehead chest <br>Left right im grinning <br>Name it
Can anyone tell me why that absolutely magically outro in the music video for STAR doesn&#39;t make it onto the album. I honestly don&#39;t fuck with that song until that  section but it&#39;s my favorite part of the album along with the sonics to SWIM. Why did BROCKHAMPTON not put that magical recording on the album I&#39;m SO FUCKING CONFUSED. HOW DO YOU B SIDE SOMETHING SO PERFECT WHAT THE FUCK.
How can you review music I thought it was just your opinion
when fantamno says in the beginning of the video that FACE is a ‚Äúfantastic track‚Äù and then puts it as his least favorite track in the description
These are Kanye&#39;s chilren expect nothing less
KTT we outchea
Some seriously great tracks on here but no way is this album a 9
I forgave them bitches, so now it&#39;s off to millions.
Ride or die like seabiscuit
Face is the best fucking song u melon
Light 9
That&#39;s so melon.<br>That&#39;s so melon.<br>That&#39;s so melon.
did nobody else notice that he gave american boyfriend a bad review and then in this one he&#39;s all on that shit
Face is the best song on this entire thing wtf
The one time the &quot;FOREVER&quot; moment fits the dialogue
kevin abstract so gay that not even his teeth straight
I liked this album a lot
bruh this aint a 9
You know that the world is making a big change when wikipedia shows you the score of theneedledrop on review scores
this dude high
FACE is one of the best imo
Aaawwww shit <br>It&#39;s ya boy Sexy Melon Wrapped in that Spicy Dijon yo!!<br>Ahhhh fuck he Removed the Dressing!! Aww hell Naw Yo!
You just knew he was gonna sing the Gold hook haha
saturation II &gt; saturation
Anyone came back after watching the Saturation 2 review?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBHjkRZQbv8&amp;t=87">1:27</a> oh you one of those ones with the little sausage fingers. I got you now.
Am I the only one that got semi-hard when they saw the yellow flannel in the thumbnail?
holy shit, this album is fuckin&#39; awesome!
If this was a 9, Saturation II must be a 10
if FACE is the least fav track, of course the album is GOLD
Better have the yellow flannel pressed for saturation 2 and 3
THEY RELEASED AOTY TWICE<br><br>T<br>W<br>I<br>C<br>E
Brockhampton &gt; Migos
I think he&#39;s mixing up FAKE and FACE......
9s don&#39;t come up often with melon !!
rewatching to prep myself for SATURATION 2. will it be another 9??
I get the feeling he goin shit on Saturation II...Smh
Saturation 2
When&#39;s pt 2 review?

How u gonna call all the singles before release &quot;excellent&quot; and &quot;fantastic&quot; but then put face on ur least fav tracks list?
real dips ask for a reveal face then nigga
I see Animals in the background!
Review Felly - Wild Strawberries (you wild melon)
Where&#39;s all the JOBA love at? Man is mad talented at vocals, and produces a good amount of their stuff. Give him some love!
amazing
the one album anthony likes and i hate
Thank you for making this review. I love Brockhampton so much now.
Brockhampton is Odd Future 2.0
honestly love how positive u are even when u dont absolutely LOVE the album not a lot of ppl are like that so thank you for that.
I want that Pink Floyd vinyl thooo......
The whole review should&#39;ve been done with the flannel on your head so we didn&#39;t have to see your face &#39;Twan.
how is face ur least favorite song melon ? :(
I didn&#39;t like this album, I can see the quality but experemental hip hop isn&#39;t my thing. Death grips as an exeption of course
He said his least fav track was face, then he says it&#39;s a fire track when he starts talking about them releasing the singles towards saturation haha
you need to do a review on the new suicideboys songs coming out on 9/11
How did you not like FACE????
Ameer Vann is literally MC Ride without a beard
awesome
Did they get anthony to pose for that album cover? I&#39;m seeing the resemblance
Brockhampthony Facetano
It`s inconsistent as fuck boi, what yall talking about , no way in hell has every song held up; I guess it has potential but you`re making it an overhyped overnight novelty smh
I ain&#39;t fuck with no white boys, unless a nigga Shawn Mendes.
yellowthony flanneltano
bruh you didnt like face WHAT THA FUCK MELON
classic/10
I GOT PIPE DREAMS OF CRACK ROCKS AND STRIPPER POLES
Unless he Shawn Mendez
Brockthany Hamptano
this the first time I see you give a 9 üò≠ but yeah I agree
Idk how face is your least favorite track that song is amazing
CAN SOME ONE EXPLAIN WHY THIS ALBUM IS GOOD IM TRYING TO UNDERSTAND.
Hey melon
Thank you for bringing brockhampton to my attention. I&#39;m so head over heels for this album I can&#39;t even turn this comment into a meme.
Flower Boy is better
I know Dom lol
OF still better when you compare the 2. And no, I&#39;m not a crazed KPBSFS OF fanboy, though I was and still am a crazy OF fan. I still support all of the people in the crew and what they individually. There&#39;d be no BROCKHAMPTON if it weren&#39;t for OF. Not to mention that OF had more personalities and did just as much (if not more) with less all around talent than these guys. I can go on and on.<br><br>That being said, the first 16 bars of Kevin&#39;s verse in &quot;GOLD&quot; is one of the best I&#39;ve heard in a while.
When I tried to find this vid, I typed in search &quot;saturation melon.&quot; <br><br>Got it immediately.
&quot;Waste woulda fit perfectly on American Boyfriend&quot; .....but that&#39;s a Bearface song
fyi kevin abstract wasn&#39;t on waste
I only watch full reviews after i listened to the whole album
He didn&#39;t even mention trip. And Noisy Images dissed on Trip. Trip is my favorite damn track.
just so refreshing hearing all these new artist bringing back these old classic hip hop sounds these guys will definitely make a huge impact on the culture
I agree on this review, the only thing I disagree with is with Faces being the worst track on here. For me it&#39;s so personal and it reminds me of a therapy session when the chorus goes &quot;tell me what you&#39;re in here for&quot;. It&#39;s something like a broken heart ballade imo
I was pretty amazed how average this was for how many great people worked on it.... I really can&#39;t get a feel for if you actually know what you&#39;re talking about.
We need Little World by Zack Villere
How is face his least favorite song
I&#39;m on an Anthony Blandtano binge
Keep a yellow flannel on my head, fly as a jet
6/10, GOLD is fucking masterful but nothing else
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBHjkRZQbv8&amp;t=327">5:27</a> Idk why you always downplay anything &quot;emo&quot; because we all know that you love it.
Merlyn Wood is god just so you guys are aware
Shoulda said Anthony Phantomtano in the intro
Whomst&#39;ve have notified the authorities in regards to my good friends
omfg
Melon, you must&#39;ve forgot that Frank Ocean was in Odd Future too ;-)
&quot;LEAST FAV TRACK: FACE&quot;&quot;<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBHjkRZQbv8&amp;t=176">2:56</a><br><br>make ur melon up, melon
Important ‚úîÔ∏è
I loved it. I would give it a 9 as well.
Welcome to the melondome, bitch.
lol I thought the first half of this album was so uninspired. looks like I gotta listen again
10
I thought you&#39;re rich buth you don&#39;t have air conditioner
overrated album
if you&#39;re gay or vegan mandingo shall give you 8+
RobMyHbby
SP
NeeLe
It&#39;s definitely a great album, definitely. But no way it is better than DAMN. tho...
Anthony, those noobs over at DeadEndHipHop just shit all over this album. Go get them daddy!
Wow and y&#39;all people take his opinion as law???  He gave DAMN a 7 and this a 9??? SMH . I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s bad, it just shows he put Kendrick in a box. Anything but TPAB part 2 won&#39;t be good enough for this clown. Damn had a way bigger message behind it It&#39;s about the sins we commit that will lead us to hell. But obviously you didn&#39;t catch that. Thank God For REAL criticics who did and it&#39;s critically acclaimed by them. 
ok BOYS is sooooo annoying
this album is trash only 3 songs on here I fucked with
How is it possible to have so many different artists n still produce consistent gems ???their has to be one mastermind behind the whole group because this is bs!!
I know the saturation of the rap game is huge right now. That&#39;s why concept mixtapes like T.R.U.S.T/ LMHFWT by to be should get a review please!
Lol the reason u think of odd future is because their idols are odd future lol they literally sold a merch shirt saying on it &#39;tyler the creator is my hero&#39;
YO FANTANO:<br><br>EXPLAIN YOSELF <br><br>&quot;LEAST FAV TRACK: FACE&quot;<br>I would like some insight ... Cause that track is smooth af.
brockthony hamptano
I just gave my melon head.
fandango saw the melon on the cover art and was like &quot;that&#39;s a 9/10 melon&quot;
if you say nocturnal trunknocker one more time imma nut
wow, and i liked face. looks like i gotta change my opinion
Anthony bought coke from a guy my brother knows
FACE is such a great song, despite being such an &quot;off&quot; sounding song compared to the others.
I want a Injury Reserve/Brockhampton collab mixtape!
Kevin abstract has said Tyler is like a mentor on an interview on the Shane show that&#39;s where I first herd of him
&quot;that isn&#39;t a slight against odd future or against brockhampton...but i feel like im litening to an odd future for people who went to college&quot; Wow. I mean obviously that wasn&#39;t a slight against either group....it was a slight against all your fans who may have gone to college. That was you just blatantly insinuating that you have better taste and more maturity than those who haven&#39;t gone. Also not, only was that disrespectful, but it was nonsensical because everytime i go to brockhampton/kevin abstract comment section it&#39;s a bunch of teen fangirls talking about &quot;troye sivian&quot; and &quot;shawn mendez&quot; so I doubt a large portion of the groups fanbase is even old enough to be in college. Same thing when Odd Future came out. Also, how can Brockhampton be OF for people who went to college when multiple members of Brockhampton haven&#39;t gone to college? Think about what you say before you say it man. This is why people think you&#39;re condescending and tell you not to review hip hop.
&quot;An odd future for people who went to college&quot; well that was condescending and elitist as fuck
Roscoes Wetsuit
Seems like half the internet is reviewing SATURATION.  THIS IS THE MOMENT!  THIS IS A MOVEMENT!
Rap album of the year for me
Where was the American boyfriend review was it in a yuno review?
Idk man :/ i dont really like the album and dont understand where the praise is coming from
pitchfork gave this shit a 6.5 what the fuuuuuuck
rock the boat like a one eyed pirate
me llamo Roberto y esta es mi cadena
trip slapps anigga
Pitchfork gave it a 6.5
I literally can&#39;t get past the song GOLD
‚ÄúI just gave my nigga head‚Äù
Heath Ledger with some dreads
im late but holy fuck these comments
HA! Really...? This album is soooo average. 6/10 best. One listen and meh. Its so plain...not much repeat listen value at all.
Saturation and Album Review next to each other make a lot of sense.
HEAT and GOLD were not fantastic though.
This album was pretty meh for me, and there were a lot of rappers that just sounded annoying.
<b>I&#39;M THE BLACK TOM HANKS</b>
KEEP A GOLD CHAIN ON MY NECK. FLY AS A JET.
REVIEW SYRINGE - ANTI-WORLD PLEASE!
I JUST GAVE MY MELON HEAD
They deserve a Grammy for this. It&#39;s unfortunate they won&#39;t just on exposure levels alone
Good job Merlyn!
You don&#39;t like Phoenix huh? I mean I get it. I would just like to see rip apart one of my favorite bands
Too bad the cover is a piece of shit. Dope album tho!
Anthony likes the new odd future project that&#39;s nice
Bruh you know this album&#39;s fire when a good portion of the comments are ACTUALLY ABOUT THE ALBUM. Good job Kevin and co.
what ethnicity is this nigga?
you say this project doesnt need a direction as long as all the songs bang, yet the underachievers new project got a 6/10. just curious
SATURATION &gt; DAMN.
Frank Ocean needs to work with them so bad....
u put face on the best tracks of the week and here as your least fav track<br>wtf
the paper clip made the blue guy look like yondu
Y did flannel make me click.  DAMN YOU PAVLOV!
I wish he would have spent a segment talking about WASTE aside from the 1 second reference. Fucking love that track.
around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBHjkRZQbv8&amp;t=490">8:10</a> there is a cut. did you ramble on and fix your glasses, and cut the ramble and unfix your glasses so that we could watch you fix them around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBHjkRZQbv8&amp;t=492">8:12</a>? love you.
I AGREE
This deserves a Cal skit where he complains you didn&#39;t give it a decent 9 to light 10
ÿßŸÜÿ™ ÿ±ÿ£ÿ≥ŸÉ ŸÖÿ´ŸÑ ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿ∑ŸäÿÆ
Review the new Pond album, and Nick Hakim¬¥s debut! :)
Matt champion stole the show on Face and I love itüëèüèΩ
Seeing an 9/10 from fantano just scared the living shit out of me.
next wu tang
9 danggggg
Bump reminds me of a better version of Snow White by Odd Future
I don&#39;t fuck with no white boys, unless the nigga fantano
Clicked on this because of the thumbnail. Glad I did.
Face is like my favorite track on the album.
i dont fuck with no white boy<br>unless that nigga Fantano
This is fucking crazy.
i stopped giving my male romantic partner, who happens to be african-american, head to watch this
The actual anime starts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBHjkRZQbv8&amp;t=696">11:36</a>
Could not agree more with this review
I was actually supposed to collaborate with Kevin Abstract last year or something<br>but his manager was such a dick to me.<br><br>i&#39;m glad u reviewed this. I saw Kevin&#39;s performance in Brooklyn at this Vinyl Shop for Pigeons &amp; Planes event &amp; it was a pretty awful show. ;x
logic is half black and half white and kevin abstract is gay
Real ratings look at the rating and then rate
i dont know if this is relevant, but have u guys noticed that every song is 4 letters except the last track waste? idk if they tried doing somethign there but its interesting lmao

Dirt is so good
Ameer
More Cal Skits
Try disliking this album, you won&#39;t be able to because of anthony. The greatest trick the Devil¬†ever pulled was convincing the world he didn&#39;t exist.
That intro was foolish af lol
GET READY FOR SATURATION 2 BOIS
I listened to the album, saved it and listened to it again. Actually a quality album.
this is my favorite album of the year so far
I thought alot of songs were cheesy. Still a good project
üòÅüòÅüòÅ
you gave them 9 because one of the members is bisexual
wow, light 9? i should listen
if thys was a kendrick album you&#39;d give it a 7
I wouldn&#39;t have found Brockhampton or this album without this video. Thanks melon the album is amazing
i&#39;ve been jamming this for a little over a week and I&#39;ve been loving &quot;Face&quot; lately. And I come here and see this review and this ass puts that as his least fav track. ok
my name is Hampton :)
You all know that if Kevin was replaced with logic but logic literally did everything the exact same as Kevin Anthony would say &quot;This tape sounds far too much like a Blonde/Endless rip off. Strong 6.&quot;
I understand the production praise for this album and the cohesiveness of the group, but praising this album lyrically !? there are verses that you can barely find a rhyme on this project! its a solid enjoyable project but lyrically nah it&#39;s wack this thing lyrically can&#39;t even touch All Amerikkkan Badass
i found kevin back in the late summer, and later found brockhampton. ive been excited for this album since they dropped the first single. This is probably my favourite hip hop album. I listen to this shit daily.
Brockhampton project really didnt appeal to me much after the first listen. Do i give it another shot?
Is there a video when Cal lets him have the yellow flannel back? He got it taken away after the Kendrick Review.
Andoni Fandango
Take that Kendrick Lamar
Anthony is the base template of the magnet toy where you give a guy facial hair
Will someone please tell me what&#39;s sampled in skit 3?
I don&#39;t fuck with no white boys <br>Unless a nigga Antony Fantony
What are you saying about people who didnt go to college?<br><br>I did not get the earl vibe on any verses.
Ill definitely be checking for a lot of these guys possible solo material too, especially ameer kevin and merlyn. I thought matt was the shit before the album but he seems too one dimensional compared to the other members
Wow I feel this album so much at this point in my life üôÇ
If you give this album a 7 I BREAK YA NECK TILL YOU CAN WATCH YA BACK
Review Drakes Selfies
I think Antoine might enjoy experimental hip hop

ANTHONY FANTANO DIDN&#39;T DO THE NEW BONES MIXTAPE!!!!

Review Healy&#39;s SUBLUX album!

Really glad this review exists. Would have never heard this boy band if it didn&#39;t. They are amazing. Thanks, man.
&quot;Bruh, I don&#39;t fuck with no white boys<br>Less the nigga Shawn Mendes&quot;
Literally doesn&#39;t say one negative thing about the album in the entire review = 9/10 ok Fantano sure<br>For real tho this album is stupid good, like goddamn
I LOVE BROCKHAMPTON
i staphed being depressed 2 watch this
tis a great album for sure.
If you blur your eyes there are two Melon Heads saying &quot;light 9&quot;

adthony noskiptano

FACE was great!
Damn WASTE fucked me up. Coming out of a 4 year relationship, this will be my late night jam for a while
I&#39;m obsessed with the &quot;Face&quot; beat
AMERICAN BOY
this is my favorite ever
review sleep party people!
You didn&#39;t take animals down from the last video. 5/10 too much consistency
Anyone see the red clip making Ameer look like Yondu???
Yondu?
Real 9/10&#39;s give damn a 4/10 then wear a melon flannel
First time hearing about this album, just listened to it and its hyped my entire week up <br>Thank u melon
9/10 got a DAMN. but 7/10 got a Saturation? fakin melon hed
agreed, fucking legendary project
I was not expecting such shitty songs on this album. The album started great but it took a huge nosedive with the auto tuned trash that is thrown in
Does anyone actually recommend this album to me ??
All you need to hear is &quot;experimental hip hop&quot; and you know it&#39;s a 9/10
w0w
That score... Wow
This reminds me of that Kodak Black Interview on the Breakfast club.
I love this album so much

review kwon jiyoung by gdragon. it&#39;s from a kpop artist but it is different
real niggas check the score out of ten then go listen to the album to make their own opinion about the album and then watch the review after to compare opinions in a civilized manner
I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been so long since OF was relevant that we&#39;re talking about how they &#39;set the foundation&#39; for modern rap posses
So you&#39;re just not gonna review the Underachievers album...
hey y&#39;all, Anthony had uploaded a video about getting into death metal somewhere, but i can&#39;t seem to find it. can someone lend me a hand?
sza ctrl pleaseee review it
Damn I&#39;m excited to listen to this one now

i
Hey, Anthony, I was wondering if you&#39;ll be reviewing The Mountain Goats new album Goths. I would love to hear your thoughts on it!
lowkey fantano a heartthrob
Ok thanks anthony I will like this now and impress people by having an opinion on it, good looking out. So, have you guys heard of brockhamptons?
The &quot;Odd Future for people who went to college&quot; comparison convinced me to give it a try
nice undershirt, you sexy round bitch.
definition of overrating an album.
Gave them a listen with you put em in a best of the week vid and I&#39;ve been listening to them a ton ever since. Saturation is amongst the best albums this year so far in my book and I&#39;m very happy you hyped them earlier.
waste was my favorite.
Let me guess, 7/10?
&quot;I just gave my nigga head&quot;
Tyler fuckin 1
wait why is face the worst song if he said it was a fire single
Yoo any you guys know how to tame a horse in minecraft?
Can everyone please stop spoiling the review score, I&#39;m want to watch the video... jeez.
Holy shit heat fucking bangs!!!!
wow that was actually so good, would have never heard of this without you ! :)
I hated this album
I&#39;m getting highhhh expectations to hear this man
what&#39;s even crazier is that they said they made this album in 3 and a half weeks
I was literally so fucking scared he was going to dislike this album, I loved and to see it torn to shreds by Melon would suck
Yo Anthony, you reviewing the new Phoenix album?
I can&#39;t believe this nigga just said &quot;odd future for people who went to college&quot;<br>boi
This shit got a 9? Fuck you, nigga.
LETS GOOOOOOOOOO
imo, 7.7/10, certain tracks dug under my skin too much because of the tonality of the vocal performance/edits or felt like over-exaggerated attempts at embracing gender identity.<br><br>gold, waste, 2pac, &amp; swim are MUSTS. really cool stuff overall
not enough like kendrick/10
Remember when you said Kevin Abstract was a copy of Frank Ocean?
That sneak diss to odd future had me dying
Least favorite track was Face?! HOW SWAY
FACE is a good song, sad day
This album is not 9 worthy. Its 8 worthy.
boy why haven&#39;t you reviewed the new black lips LP
&quot;Clunky heavy drum beat&quot;
I&#39;ve figured out what that &#39;blip&#39; noise you hear on theneedledrop videos is - it&#39;s about a quarter of a second of Iggy Pop&#39;s &quot;The Passenger&quot;.
I&#39;m on that 9 on that yellow flannel shit
some of the best hip hop I&#39;ve heard in a long LONG time

STOP SLEEPING ON COSMO PYKE REVIEW THAT INSTANTLY

Great review fam, would never have known about this amazing project if it werent for you and shawn cee.
Mountain goats review taking ages
Melon where is the SZA Crtl album review at boiii???
I though the album art was Yondu from Guardians of The Galaxy
Anny Fantanny
Hip hop lyrical tropes are as bad as commercial country music tropes.  They both glorify bullshit, and it&#39;s bullshit. Zero.
A new PVRIS single will be released tomorrow. Will you put it in your next available Best/Wrost tracks of the week?
If they put LAMB on the album it woulda been a 10
I&#39;ve been waiting for this album for months tbh
this melon gay
I WAS WAITING FOR THIS REVIEW FINALLY OMG THIS ALBUM IS SO GOOD

Thumbs up for accurate thumbnail
The cover kind of reminds me of Yondu from GOTG.
What&#39;s the vinyl in the background? Love the cover art
So what does an album have to do to be a 10/10?
9/10<br>oh boy
Yellow flantano here
FUCK YES. THESE BOYS ARE UNSTOPPABLE
Real niggas leave an ironic comment based on the once common &quot;real niggas look at the score then dip&quot; joke common around Anthony Fantano&#39;s music reviews, often substituting the key words with other, random nouns, or shuffling around the more prominent phrases or buzzwords.
REVIEW TI AMOOOOOO
hey anthony check out Moist Babies and the No U&#39;s on <a href="http://bandcamp.com">bandcamp.com</a>
He&#39;s gonna take the yellow shirt off half way through a review and give something a 0 one of these days.
He really gave this 9/10. Well damn I guess I have to listen to this now
Review Cigarettes After Sex&#39; new LP
Everything Kevin Abstract touches is gold
When Fantano took off the flannel I was kinda expecting that he dyed his face blue for this review like in the Saturation album cover and Star music video lol
YES. WILL EDIT WHEN I KNOW IF I AM PLEASED WITH THE RATE OR NOT.
Damn I thought it would be a 10/10
i sotp porn
I don&#39;t fuck with no white melons, unless that nigga Fantano.
anthony the type of melon to be listening to death grips during his daughter&#39;s graduation speech
This album got eventually worse as you go further into it. Shit is whack
Me llamo Antonio Fantano y soy el nerd de la m√∫sica m√°s ocupado del internet.
This better be fuckin&#39; good! I&#39;m buying it on iTunes.
Least fav track: FACE<br><br>yo, are you feeling good?
Should&#39;ve just made it a 10
Wait for the mahonymixtape project. All I will say
these guy are Odd Future rip offs
This album was alright
Brockthony<br>Hamptano here

Not gonna lie. I only clicked on this because of the yellow flannel...
Animals is still in the background from the Roger Waters review. I ain&#39;t mad, that&#39;s my favorite album.
Have you listened to THEY&#39;s debut album, N√º Religion: Hyena? I&#39;m curious to hear what you think about it.
man, this album is about Roberto. translate the skits
these comments are annoying
HEATH LEDGER WITH SOME DREADS I JUST GAVE MY NIGGA HEAD
dip you dip i dip dip you dip i dip you dip
About time you got ashamed of that ugly melon head
I&#39;m glad he lured me in with the yellow flannel cause this is the hardest shit i&#39;ve ever heard
man this is why i love your reviews putting me onto great music i otherwise wouldnt have known about. thanks melon!
First 9 this year?
Real African-American gentlemen watch the first thirty seconds of this review, check they&#39;re not accidentally in the wrong Antony Fantano channel, watch the rest of the review, then dip
Review Jon Sudano covers!!!
LETS FUCKIMN GOOO BROCKHAMPTON BABAY

So bored of the memes now.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBHjkRZQbv8&amp;t=317">5:17</a> fantano knuckle crack
Fantano the type of nigga to write &quot;pton&quot; on the screen in post, because he forgot the name of the group when he wrote &quot;brockham&quot; in the intro at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBHjkRZQbv8&amp;t=14">0:14</a>.
I fuggin&#39; love Brockhampton
But lowkey this let Ameer really really really shine, it felt like this was his album, not in a bad way, but he felt like the front man and that was awesome to hear
Brockthany Hamptano
that thumbnail wil probably draw people in
this was a ten you fuck
I&#39;m guessing AOTY
Real niggas watch the entire review, support the sponsors, check out that amazon associates link, drop a like and THEN dip. Real shit üò≥
ANT THANKS FOR OPENING ME UP TO THIS ARTIST THIS SHIT IS SICK
we gotta new wu
He gave it a 9 Ooooo that&#39;s awesome I remember he was iffy about Kevin&#39;s album it&#39;s tight he supports the collective
I saw comments to learn when to dip, but decided I&#39;m not a real nigga, so I watched the review and then dip
GAVE THIS A NINE BUT DAMN A SEVEN FK U MELON
I miss odd future. They need to come back...<br>Especially earl. He has been stuck somewhere in the soundcloud dimension for too long... :(
boys is one of the most annoying tracks of the year imo. i hate the song but the project is dope overall
BROCKHAMPTON the new Injury Reserve?
I thought that was Yondu from Guardians of the Galaxy on the album cover
I really don&#39;t get the hype around these guys. Nothing about it seems outstanding. Vocals, lyrics, beats, whatever.
BROCKHAMPTON made the tape within 4 weeks. Crazy.
BROCKHAMPTON or Injury Reserve?
They could be the new Wu-tang, I&#39;m hype
Wow
This is the best new album I&#39;ve heard in a very very long time. Highly recommend giving it a listen
You give this a 9/10 but Pink Guy a MYSCOREWHENTHEPU$$YTOOGOOD/10 ? Incredible
Yellow = Melon // Red = Melon
This album wasn&#39;t as good as I thought it was tbh. I think they already released all the best singles before the album which kinda sucked. Wasn&#39;t a bad album but still.
Could you do the Volumes ‚ÄúDifferent Animals‚Äù album ?
Anyone else think of Brock Sampson when they hear this groups name?
THIS IS THE BEST REVIEW YOU&#39;VE DONE THIS YEAR MELON!! I LOVE YOU

review Rejjie Snow new album, its great
It&#39;s the yellow flannel!!!!
Oh my... the album started so good w√¨th this banging, raw, aggressive hip hop which than developed mostly into... awful, boring, shallow auto tune pop.
Does not in any way deserve a 9. Pretty average, I&#39;d give it a light 6.
FINALLY
the first time in a while I agre with melon head
who done called the cops on my melon?!?!
Why is your comment section completely mememified? Anyways, loving this project and still been blasting that Sinjin Hawke album, don&#39;t know how I would&#39;ve heard of either without you.
I give up on you reviewing new The Underachievers album. Go fuck yourself melon head.

how does it feel to have your comment section be purely memes
Real dips check the nigga then score
Yeah I mean this is a good album... But 9 out of 10?  Hmmm.
&quot;It bumps in the whip.&quot;<br>-Feeftano
YYYYOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
if this isnt top 10 albums of 2017 at the  end of this year imma be pissed
Hey, very good music review, congratulations, I&#39;ll definetely give this interesting artist a listen!
I wish I could filter out meme comments I&#39;m trying to see what people actually think, not some copy and paste shit.
sa t√™te ressemble √† un melon
Someone needs to start a gofundme to get melon a central air conditioning unit.
as a 23 year old student i realy liked a lot of the topics presented here in a down to earth manner and as a music and rock fan I think you hit the nail  on the head with the comparison, didn&#39;t skip a single track. Favourites: bump heat milk and fake
when this ends, at least I&#39;ll have a reason to live
I stopped watching this to watch this
&quot;Milk&quot; is the best I think
No way this is better than DAMN or Rosebudd&#39;s Revenge. SLEEP
this album is actually fire. listened to it after the review. thanks Fantano.
real fantanos wear the flannel then dip
THE ONE ALBUM THIS GUY ENJOYS
You reviewing billy woods???
This definitely deserved a 9/10, great review!
Ameer Vann was a 10/10 on this album. The dude is special.
air conditioning!?
issa 9
the only bad part about this is that you have Face as your least favorite track.
dude i am sweaty too!
Damn, I was hoping you&#39;d give this a good score (6-8) but a 9? Showing my boys some love, I see.
Nice review: best lyrics: the shawn mendes mention
can u do a phoenix ti amo review?
Yet he gave DAMN. a 0.7
Oh look a yellow flannel without a 7/10. You used it right melonüëèüëèüëè
waiting for them to become huge
It was quite conceptual I thought. The part before the first skit is their backgrounds. After this the skits dictate what the songs are about.
THE SHADOWS KEEPS FOLLOWING ME :3
Anyone else been waiting anxiously since the album dropped for this?
I DON&#39;T FUCK WITH NO WHITE BOYS<br>UNLESS THE NIGGA SHAWN MENDES
Album title should be: &quot;Saturation: How to Use Autotune Correctly, A Users Guide&quot;
Oh my God, it&#39;s the yellow flannel ghost!
I AM FUCKING ANGRY!! did you really slept over the &quot;i just gave my nigga head&quot; line?. god dammit fantano i was waiting for you to talk about that line since weeks!!!
Thank you. That&#39;s all.
Exist - So True, So Bound<br>Elder - Reflections of a Floating World
stop trying to make me vegan, great review though
ahahaha that What i said. They are the next Odd Future but a more mature one.
anthony please post the video where i show how i exposed xxxtentacion.
&quot;Definitely my frontrunner for hip hop project of the year at the moment.&quot; I guess Mr. Fantango hasn&#39;t listened to DROOL yet.
is Anthony cosplaying as Giles Corey in the beginning of the video
Wow, you gave Teenage Emotions a 9 but this a 3?
Honestly thought this project was a mess. Love Star tho
Brockhampton is like Odd Future but they actual take their music seriously and make good shit and have good chemistry and have hard beats and actually they&#39;re nothing like Odd Future.
Reviewing the debut cigarettes after sex album?
I really think you should check out Marika Hackman, she released a new album at June 2
Fuck yes Anthony!! This album is insane!
I think there&#39;s going to be a return of hip hop groups
I agree. Brockhampton was what I wanted Odd Future to be in terms of overall musical quality.
I thought you&#39;d give this a good score as soon as I heard the album. I was not wrong :D
Thanks so much for doing what you do. You&#39;ve gotten me into these guys and so much more. I love this record.
checkin this out right away!!! also where is the, the Underachievers, Renassaince review
boi he did it
FUCK YES
Never heard of this one man boy band
What if these dudes just randomly blew up and went mainstream? These dudes been dope, if people catch on it could be.... interesting, at least.
I discovered these guys literally yesterday and was disappointed to see that melon boy didn&#39;t have a review out for them. i got on youtube today to see he drops a fire review with a 9/10 like wtf
HE HAS THE SHIRT ON
why is face the worst track on the tape? it has some of the best one-liners on the whole project
&gt;&quot;experimental hip-hop&quot;<br>&gt;every track is a standard 808 trap instrumental
Oh I&#39;m so beyond hype to listen to this album now!
wgg
Connecticut is hot as fuck right now I don&#39;t blame you.
Fucking yes, we don&#39;t need the underachievers review anymore now.
And they are dropping another project this year. Feels good to be alive right now
Bruh ... this album is weak as fuck.
Im tha black tom hanks
heard alot about them. youve just affirmed that theyre legit. ok downloading their shit now. appreciate u sir
üÖ±rock hampton
This album took me by surprise. Had low to no expectations for it because of how underwhelming the last album was but now I cannot stop listening to it
ayy thats right fantano
It&#39;s gonna be an 11! It&#39;s a classic, he&#39;s wearing the yella&#39; flannel. It&#39;s a 12, it&#39;s a 12
Absolutely loved this album! It will probably be my favourite for the year and can&#39;t wait to see what they do next! Glad you liked it too‚Äã Mr Melon.
THE FLANNEL
this project was magical to me
yes... it&#39;s time for the yellow shirt
but what did you think about their first single of the second album &quot;LAMP&quot; ?
whats Yondu doing on that cover ?
YES FINALLY A SCORE I CAN RELATE
Animals on the back.. Pink floyd worst to best?
i was so ready for this review, then i died when i saw the yellow flannel on the thumbnail
You know the albums great when face is the least favorite track
I fucking loved this album and I&#39;m so glad other appreciate it aswell
Little miss melon in the yellow, hello, would you like to push petals through the meadow with me?
me llamo roberto
LEAST FAV TRACK: FACE<br><br>what in the fuck
Review my overwhelming respect for women
Well said, I am glad you stumbled across this.
I meaaaan it&#39;s good but to me it&#39;s more like a 7 but thanks for putting me on a few weeks ago i fuck with them
Coverthony Facetano
being vegan and a melon at the same time must feel weird. you are basically eating your own species smh
You&#39;re alright melon head.
Real niggas dip, download the album, come back, drop a fuck u melon comment, check the score, delete the comment, say you&#39;re alright melon head, then dip.
A top 5 album of the year for me. After only one listen you can tell this thing is for real.
Quality content begins around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBHjkRZQbv8&amp;t=695">11:35</a>
I&#39;m glad you like it too
Damn Boi
By the thumbnail I thought Yondu from the Guardians of the Galaxy made an album.
I love HEAT and GOLD!
Your rock contemporary music bias is showing melon. It‚Äôs a good album but it‚Äôs not a 9. But you‚Äôre th best man
Do a best to worst of Bob Dylan.
rip face ig
Surprised y&#39;all didn&#39;t mention Frank in Odd Future, especially since he might&#39;ve shouted out Kevin Abstract in his new single &quot;Lens&quot;
Album is straight fire!
Melonheads best to worst?
Damn fantany anthano this album is, really good.
anybody else see yondu when u look at the album cover?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBHjkRZQbv8">0:00</a>
i predict he&#39;ll say strong 7 light 8... before watching
Okay cool but where is the CTRL review
Underachievers album review when?
kneel riggs drop teh diddly and then flip
Real ones look at his teeth then dip
&gt;tfw you see the yellow flannel in the thumbnail
SZA&#39;S ABLUM NOW MELON!
He&#39;s wearing the yellow shirt, so you know this album&#39;s good.
Not fake not white ppl dont close the description don&#39;t not look at the score and sauce
Now for the SZA review
AOTY
luv u big dawg
i was really bored by most of the hooks on this album. they seemed to weak compared to the verse
You gave this random ass band a 81237687312/5 but DAMN. a NOT GOOD???????
Anyone else saw Yondu in the thumbnail and be like &quot;I&#39;m Mary Poppins yall!&quot;
Real fans eat fun dip.
But Needledrop, he fuck with me
Woah I like Saturation but you gave this a higher score than Blonde
Damn. Brockhampton beats out Kung-fu Kenny for best hip-hop of the year? Shit just got real.
real niggas check the description then beat their meat
You a star
Ehh it&#39;s not that amazing apart from the singles
tfw no 10
1 hour nigga
brockhampton are the beeeesssssttttüíìüíìüíìüéâüéâ
wtf i love melonhead now
Can you review Rise Against&#39;s new album Wolves?
Clickbait. Unsubbed.
damn melon good look with that american bf
Ayyy loving the Pink Floyd representation with the Animals record!!!
JESUS ANTHONY GIVE A SPOOK WARNING
It was a damn fine album. I&#39;d give it an 8 for now. Cool that you had such a positive review for it.
yellow flannel/10
I was surprised on how much I liked this album, glad I heard it
I&#39;m not very cool so I haven&#39;t heard of this before. i checked out a few tracks based on this review and really like. thanks melon, keep up the good work.
Where my Helmet Babies at?
HOLY FUCK YES
I used to not come to the comments section because it would spoil the review. No I don&#39;t come to the comments section because it&#39;s all lame ass stale ass memes
Smh should have reserved the 9 for Kirin
planetarium review?
Brockhampton deserved more yellow flannel than this, Fantano
I was kinda mixed when I first heard the mixtape. But after hearing your review, I feel like I should give it a second chance
REVIEW THE PHARCYDE THEY ARE THE BEST THEY ARE AMAZING THEY ARE pretty good
For those wondering, the performers in Brockhampton are: Kevin Abstract (dude w/ french fry hair and headband), Ameer Vann (bald black dude), Merlyn Wood (eccentric blonde black dude), Matt Champion (cute white rapper), Joba (long haired dude with beautiful falsettos), Dom McLennon (husky black dude) and Bearface (tbh idk what he looks like but he only appears on Waste),
still waiting on your renaissance review by the underachievers
When are you going to review Islam
Review the Jake Paul EP
Yellow Flannel on my neck fly as a jet boy better treat melon with respect
I&#39;m so happy for themmmmmm
One of the best hip hop projects this year. &quot;I break your neck so you can watch your back!!!&quot;
God do I love fake
glad you brought up the odd future lineage here
why isn&#39;t lamb on this album?
There&#39;s been a surprising amount of 9s this year
Hell Yeah BoY!
wow i need to make sure to give this a listen! you&#39;re always give projects such low numbers which makes a 9 seem even better
Least fav track Face?? nah man
aoty duh
Review Kajagoogoo&#39;s White Feathers.
ill let u live today melonhead...
A 9 HOLY SHIT
Anthony, do a Ariel Pink&#39;s new single review
The odd future influence is most likely because Tyler is one of Kevin&#39;s favourite rappers
They made this album in 3 weeks think bout that for a second...
YOU GAVE LIL YACHTY A 7 BUT THIS A 5????¬ø¬øüòÖü§£‚òπÔ∏èüòîüòØ‚òπÔ∏èüòëüò§üò†üò°üçÜüçÜüçÜ
Damn, this will probably go unnoticed but I&#39;m just curious, Fantano, what is holding this album back from a ten? Why isn&#39;t it good enough? <br>bless.
i gasped
Honestly my favourite album of the year so far
Where is the Melon?
nice
Brockhampton is odd future went to college
damn, FACE is your least favorite track? :thinking:
You keep whistling when you say S sounds
big up melon light 9 like that pal
I just teared up a bit
Remember when you said &quot;Is Kevin Abstract trying to be Frank Ocean?&quot;
Personally I appreciate a lot of the tracks more artistically than musically, that&#39;s why I disagree with the sentiment that there are no skipable tracks on this. I felt strong 7 to light 8.
Just because Kevin abstract follows you on Twitter you gotta suck up to his group&#39;s work
I JUST finished listening to this album.
He&#39;s wearin&#39; the yella!
thank you melon
This will be a massive boost to their fanbase.
I see a golden flannel, I click<br>also Under 301 club
THE YELLOW FLANNELLLLLLL
I just gave my melon head
Sorry if this was answered already but why hasn&#39;t he reviewed the Russ album &quot;There&#39;s Really A Wolf&quot;

real ones look at the thumbnail, guess the score and dip
I T   I S    H O T - Melon

The fuck is up with your thumbnail you idiotic melon, goddamn I fucking hate you
CMON MELON, FACE IS THE BEST TRACK
The hook of Gold is stuck in my head from days.Fantastic album
Well fucking deserved.  Album of the year imo.
I hate how we&#39;re putting our hearts and souls into dank meme comments but this melon just talks about boring music for cheap entertainment
<b>I stopped giving my nigga head to watch this</b>
You sound like thatistheplan
LEAST FAV TRACK: FACE<br><br>HOW
Clicked so fast
This album is Half awesome half ok imo
Please review my album &quot;Ether Soaked Rags&quot;<br>You can find it free on my YouTube channel
your opinions suck
When are you going to give SZA&#39;s new record a 6 so that I can get pissed in the comments and tell you it&#39;s an 8?
why do you hate hip hop melon head?
This is a great album. Thank you for reviewing it!
THey made this in 3 1/2 weeks fyi
dude review Dua Lipa
When is the jamiroquai music review coming up
Brockhampton is fucking awesome
album isn&#39;t that good. I don&#39;t get all the hype
At this point Anthony might as well change all the scores over 9 to a FLANNEL/10
Do ice cubes new track
Thanks for the recommendation melon lord
wheres fleet foxes anthony
do you have legs anthony?

Issa 9 erybody a 9!!
BROCKFLANNELTON
Fantano did you know they made this in under four weeks? Also Kevin says Odd future is a huge influence.
OHHH shit the yellow shirt SPOOOOKED
A NEW IT MA NIGGA
FUCK YOU MELON
Your comment sections give me cancer. dope album though
that&#39;s fucking right, brockhampton the best in the game rn
The fact that he has FACE as his least favorite track despite saying that it is a fantastic single, shows how amazing this album is.
you gave teenage emotions a 9 but brock hampton a 2?
I thought this gonna be a 10 :(((
The hook on the song milk is a generic version of the hook on soundtrack 2 my life
Damn, I knew it was too short to be a 10
Damn they came a long ass way, I remember just bumping mtv1987
Me llamo Roberto. Y esto es un mel√≥n.
Finally I can have an opinion on this. Can&#39;t wait to be buying merch and being the filthy elitist that I exactly know I am.
I SAW THE FLANNEL AND CAME
Album cover looks like yondu
Naked Anthony 21/9
hip hop aoty.
Boys is catchy as hell.
Odd Hampton
that moment when you accidentally spit &quot;i just gave my nigga head&quot; while singing &quot;star&quot; üò´üò´
sometimes i wonder what would happen if anthony rubbed his head against beezy430&#39;s
ameer vann really shines on this project
So where does the yellow flannel hijab fit into the lore?
but i thought you put face in the best tracks section in one video
Anthony Phantomano, he&#39;s going ghost
I thought it was officially and album not a mixtape?
BUMP sounds eerily similar to Fried Noodles by Pink Guy structure-wise
Verythony Sweatytano
yellow flannel is such a turn on
This album was so so so good
Kevin Abstract has 13 letters in it Anthony Fantano has 14 letters in it. 14-13 = 1. One rhymes with won. Donald Trump won the US presidential election. Donald Trump is an orange. An orange is a fruit. A melon is also a fruit. Anthony Fantano is a melon. I don&#39;t know where I&#39;m going with this. I&#39;m not funny. Anthony will you review the Lil Pump Tape when it drops?
shouldve had the flannel over your head the entire video
üò°
i saw yellow flannel, i clicked faster then ever
honestly, i was disappointed. i really wanted to like it. now i gotta listen to it another thousand times until i like it.
Face is the best song bro
YA FANTANO! I hope this review gets some more ears on this project cause IT&#39;S FUCKING AWESOME!!
Sorry Melon, comment machine broke
Pokemon avatar. Something something MELON. Review I didn&#39;t entirely agree with.
This album is TOO  GOOD
I loved this project as well thanks for shouting them out! Oh AND THE FUCKING SHIRT! !! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
melon why have you not released a Renaissance review on yt or twitter
I love masturbating to a meme review...wait, wrong chat
OH SHIT MELON
Mary Poppins?

It&#39;s ironic that you&#39;re hiding your face in the beginning of this review, and your least favorite track is Face.

You loved it because he is also a melon, don&#39;t lie to us.
&quot;mixtape&quot; &quot;experimental hip hop&quot; &quot;9/10&quot;<br><br>is this death grips?
ITS THE YELLOW
You said you liked brockhampton but then couldn&#39;t even stick it out and wear the flannel. More like least dedicated melon of the year üçà
&quot;I just gave my nigga head&quot; took the album from a 8 to a strong 5.

Review Phoenix&#39;s Ti Amo

FUCK YEAH BOY!!!!! FUCKING 9/10!!!! SHIT YEAH!!!!!!!!  MY TASTE IS PASSABLE!!!!!!!!!!!!
Eh, We Are Retards are a great underground band
Thx for including the score in the description pleighboi
the only reason you gave this a 9/10 is because the cover art features a melon
Melon....MF DOOM bets to worst....W H E N
