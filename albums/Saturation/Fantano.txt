[Music] hi everyone its Anthony Fantan oh here the internet sweatiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Brock Hampton project saturation Brock Hampton is a hip-hop outfit that was once based down in Texas I think they relocated to the internet or something I think they have seven members or nine members or 12 members or like 15 members not entirely sure oh it's it's I know I'm trying to be festive over here because this is a very good project and I did want to have the yellow flannel on here you know just to make a little appearance but it is hot it is very hot and I'm just going to be super unprofessional and wear my undershirt okay now if you weren't already aware there's some notable underground names already affiliated with the Brock Hampton project that is one Kevin abstract down McLennan both of whose solo material I have been aware of I have heard much of it admittedly more of Kevin's music has stuck with me than Dom's especially his American boyfriend project that dropped not too long ago a lot of fans and music writers hype up the fact that he is so open about his sexuality in his music is like this big selling point but I think what makes him unique as an artist runs much deeper than that just listen to American boyfriend and see for yourself I'm not going to talk too much about it here I'm just going to say make sure you've heard it if it slipped through the cracks for you because there are a lot of elements to that project a lot of ideas forged on that project that do show up in spades on saturation quite a bit there's actually one track the last track on the entire project waste which is this deeply melodic and passionate guitar ballad that would have fit snugly on American boyfriend and I think will remind some fans of cuts that were on Frank ocean's blond all that being said though there are other names affiliated with Brockhampton that you're going to get to know just because of how much talent they bring to the table on this thing just because of how much they steal the show on these tracks whether that be Java or net champion or Merlyn would or mere van just to name a few and this is not Brock Hamptons first rodeo either I remember first hearing about them back in 2015 when I heard that dirt single played on ebro's beats one show or whatever and I thought that single really hit hard it was a hard as nails track it was wild it was youthful it was off-the-wall it was crazy and then the subsequent mixtape all-american trash that the group dropped not too long after really underwhelmed there were some hard gritty tracks on there but much of the project I think was bogged down with a lot of impersonal slow burners that really took the wind out of the sails of the entire tape and I most likely would not have looked for another Brockhampton project ever again if it had not been for the fact that teasing up to saturation they released one fire single after another there was out a bad track promoting this album it was actually not a track that was not excellent promoting this album whether it be fake or gold or boys or heat or face or star it was just like non-stop fantastic tracks coming out with this much material you could risk spoiling the album experience once you actually hear the entire thing but you know going into this at least I thought I knew that I'm that most of it was going to be good but now that I have the entire thing in front of me this thing is 17 tracks it's 50 minutes and there's only like a couple skits and you know all American trash did have a few duds on it so I'm coming to this thinking is Brock Hampton going to consistently deliver great material for the entire e of this thing somehow they do shockingly this up-and-coming group has delivered one of the most consistent rap projects I've heard this year consistent in terms of quality this thing is wall-to-wall creative colorful visceral bouncy sweet catchy hard production and the music they create on this thing runs deeper than rap like that's on waste that I mentioned earlier the song swim is this dreamy serene kind of sensual auto-tune ballad that is beautiful it's feel-good I love the distant tones whaling way in the background very faintly they kind of sound like horns kind of I'm not saying they are but they're very beautiful I love the sentiment of the track too coming through in the lyrics and the vocal effects don't exactly take away from the emotional performance of the singing either the string sections that were worked into the song cache various points are gorgeous as well the song bump is easily one of the biggest bangers on the entire record but the hook is very unique because it features kind of a breakdown a breakaway every piece of instrumentation melts or disappears just so we can hear this one lonely tiny guitar line with Kevin abstract singing over it he takes on most of the song hooks if not all of them on the entire project he sings very well but match with this guitar line it's almost like I'm hearing some kind of sad angsty guy alt-rock from the 90s or something and that's not the only point on the album where the group seems to pull some very clear influence from rock music ten to twenty years ago the song milk might have a sequence beat and other fundamentals of hip hop production worked into the instrumental but the lyrics and the vocal melody sounds like I'm listening to the limitations of some kind of 2000 Zehra emo band singing about struggling to be yourself and wishing you had a friend you just kind of hang out with and be on the couch with there might not be an overall scheme or theme to this album or whether it be conceptually or lyrically or even musically sometimes but again I think in terms of quality song quality production quality lyrical quality every song is so high there are a few tracks on the back end that feel kind of way out in terms of musical style and stick out like a sore thumb a little bit but even these songs for me are not really skippable there's so much great material on here and I haven't even gotten to the core tracks yet like the opener heat I really don't know what to praise about this track first the insane aggressive in-your-face off the wall animalistic verses and rapping throughout the track or the instrumental which features this clunky heavy drumbeat that just knocks this fuzzy somewhat distorted bass line and on the hook this wall of shrill ear piercing noise and sinister melodies like flies in and creates this loschen of sonic mayhem the song gold is much lighter and smoother and catchy er by comparison kevin's hook on this thing is one of the best on the entire project keep a gun chained on my neck sighs again boy I bet a trim you ever spent Brockhampton here effectively proves that they could dial it back from 11 to a very chill laid-back 5 but still come through the track that's very sticky has a lot of personality a lot of character in a good sense of humor to the song star features all of these hilarious pop-culture references from music to movies and so on and so forth Kevin abstracts verse toward the back end cleans up shop and is a little more personal in the previous two talking about how he needs to get his teeth fixed and his association with Vice Land the beat on this thing is a nocturnal trunk knocker that segues seamlessly in the next track boys the following track Tupac might just be like a bit of a one-minute instrumental but it's still one of the most emotionally compelling song within the entire album Brockhampton isn't just dropping aggressive bangers on here they are very versatile group they are great at dropping those aggressive and kind of mid paced tracks though because these guys go into each track with a lot of chemistry lyrically they play off of each other so well and extrapolate fantastically on whatever flow that they have chosen on a track it gives each song a lot of momentum to the point where they don't even really need to go into a track with so much in the way of a super strong lyrical topic or concept for it to be entertaining case in point Bank case in point fake not to mention the fact that the forward-thinking production and quality hooks also add to the winning mix of these songs but to get back to my earlier point about sad songs on this thing these guys don't just drop bangers their real moments of personal turmoil on here they're really introspective tracks that seemed to reflect at least a little bit on the current political and social state of America being yourself loneliness struggling through a thankless and unforgiving economy love being unsure of your future in a way Brock Hampton more than any of their contemporaries I think has embodied the woes of the average millennial and they've done it without making an album or making a project that is overly political or is like Trump Trump Trump we don't like Donald Trump yeah I mean I assume that and my point here about these woes embodying them is especially true when you consider that the last gang of young upstarts rabble rousers to take the rap game by storm was Odd Future whose rage just kind of turned out to be a phase fueled by their teenage angst and I'm not saying that as a slight against odd feature or as a slight against Brockhampton but I can't help but feel like listen to this as much as I enjoy it I feel like I'm almost listening to an odd future for people who went to college or graduated college because I feel like Brock Hampton in a way is delivering what so many music writers and fans had banked on odd future doing as a collective delivering these perfectly crafted energetic crazy forward thinking ahead of the curve posse tracks with each member having their own distinct personality with each member functioning on a similarly high level of talent Odd Future unfortunately as a collective did not do that that's not to say that they weren't an incredibly influential group and that they didn't have talent at their disposal I just thought each member saw more artistic success individually than they did as a group because Tyler has come out with his solid projects so his Earl Sol has said I don't mean to turn this whole review into an odd feature conversation but I can't help but feel like they kind of set the foundation for what Brock Hampton is doing here on this project I mean certainly there are a lot of verses on here that I think give off a little bit of an earl vibe Brock Hampton though seems to gel in a way that no other group their size has in a long time which is what makes this album so electrifying because the quality of the songs here again is so fantastically consistent you have so much diversity across the album in terms of emotion musical style the personalities and lyrical styles of each member also the producers on this thing bring an incredibly large amount of talent and creativity to the table too and this thing is so dense and detailed in terms of each verse each be what each member is overall adding to this project individually as much as I have talked about this project I feel like I've only sort of scratched the surface of what makes this thing so good so I mean I'm just going to leave it here and say this is fantastic sure you listen to this it's an excellent project and I am feeling a light nine on it transition have you given saturation to listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best which guy are you next to like if you like please subscribe and
