@Kyoko_,2022-11-29T10:05:43Z,2022-11-29T10:05:43Z,5,"This was the first Hip Hop/Rap album I ever really connected with back in Winter 2017 and I checked it out because of this review. I remember working at shoe store for shit wage, age 24, cleaning the staff bathroom, listening to this for the first time because Anthony sounded so ecstatic about the album. I was nearly moved to tears when WASTE finished. I listened to the album a second time immediately. The BOOGIE video dropped like a week later and the rest is history."
