nice
He didn&#39;t like it because it wasn&#39;t as twisted as his melon fantasy
I swear he called this album overrated in this review. Am I tweaking
i saw &quot;13 years ago&quot; and thought wtf mbtf did not release in 2007 then i clicked on more and realized it was in 2010 (TFMMFO)
Disagree about the hooks lmao
Imma give this dislike button a 6/10
“I did not care for the godfather”
You gave sexyy reds album more than mbdtf wow
Yeah ive just listened to this Album and now I understand how terrible this review is lmao
i bet if kanye had 200 monthly listeners, this would be a masterpiece, dumbass melon
Maybe Thanos was right...
As of May 2024, this review has about 68k dislikes
atleast kanye has a wife
i respect your opinion.
Too high a score
How come it says Nov 16. When the album came out 22nd Nov
Let me get this straight: The music is fantastic in every way but you weren&#39;t vibing with the message so the album is a 6? Absolute nonsense 😂
I disagree Anthony, this is a 10/10
I agree with him
dude ur delusional pls dont speak again do me a favour
no one cares lil bro
S T R O N G L Y disagree, have a nice day!
iconic internet moment. ive never seen people get this universally angry at a guy saying a thing was just pretty good instead of amazing. this dislike bar will be studied by historians centuries into the future.
This was uploaded on my 6th birthday
Reviewing vultures1.... Atleast anthony&#39;s consistent.
In 2077<br><br>Fantano review is in the history books
You are bald and divorced knd ragards carlie lasso. <br><br>P.S. You are not nice and should never reproduce.<br><br>P.P.S. I am 10 yers old and alredy no mor than u<br><br>P.P.P.S. My dad drunk al the alcehole in the hose and now my mummy is mad! 😠 <br><br>P.P.P.P.S. I wood beet u in a figt!
I&#39;m not a huge Kanye fan but this album aged like fine wine. Every song feels so different and the production is so grandeur. Not a 10 but it&#39;s close
This is scarily similar to the vultures review, fantano been a ye hater since day 1, I lowk respect it
the sound on this is ass
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo4S2qlQGs0&amp;t=55">0:55</a> “This is music, pay attention to the music.”<br>Vultures Rating:
I agree this does deserve a 9 (I live in Australia btw)
yea i hate u bald man
here are the like/dislike stats<br><br>21k likes<br>68k dislikes
You cant review the album without listening to the album
hello mellon man
&quot;pay attention to the music leave your hate at the door&quot;
trash
💀
Yet sexy red album gets a higher review that’s crazy man get ur ears checked
this video is probably the reason they stopped showing the amount of dislikes
Why does this look like it was filmed in 1993
it somehow got ratioed even harder
Kanye meat riders came to battle in these comments lmao
Does Fantano even know how to mix a youtube video?
Interesting juxtaposition with the new review. Or non-review.
His main gripe back then was that you’d need to have interest in Kanye as a person to truly enjoy this album. <br><br>Today, his main gripe is that he knows too much about Kanye as a person to enjoy his new album. <br><br>Bookends.
Delete your account
I miss the dislike button
this fkin sucks
“I’m feeling a light to decent 6 on this record”<br>Famous last words
I think I&#39;m the only guy who agrees with this rating
Lost all credibility I think he’s better at reviewing rock or metal but he’s pretty bad at hip hop
21K LIKES 67K DISLIKES AS OF RIGHT NOW
“Kanye’s favorite thing to rap about is himself” literally every rapper ever in history
Cant believe he gave this album a 6/5,thank you melon man
Kanye on MBDTF: “I was never much of a romantic, couldn’t take the intimacy, but I know I did damage, ‘cause the look in your eyes are killing me, I guess you knew of that advantage, ‘cause you could blame me for everything, and I don&#39;t know how I&#39;ma manage, if one day, you just up and leave.” <br>Melon: 6/10 (twice)<br>Kanye of KSG: “GRRAT GRRAT, GRRAT GAT GAT GAT, GRRAT GAT GAT GAT, GRRAT GAT GAT.”<br>Melon: 10/10
This album is amazing perfect production perfect lyricsm perfect storytelling perfect sequencing, 6/10
He gave ksi’s album a 7 and this a 6🤦🏾‍♂️ ridiculous
lol mbdtf is so incredibly overrated. 808s &amp; heartbreak, yeezus, and graduation are literally better.
Guys chill! He gave it a 6 out of 6…right?
Yeah, that&#39;s just, like, your opinion, man.
In this video you admit that you rate albums lower for artists you don’t like personally
you will never reach the gates of heaven
6 XD? wtf is wrong with this guy
Nah he just did this for the exposure
<b>THAT 6 BETTER BE OUTTA 6 MA NIGGA</b>
I dont see anything wrong with not liking Mbdtf its not even that great 💀
ffs
Worst review ever
2010 was crazy
It’s crazy because he’s absolutely right.
Bro played himself
w take
Hopefully by 6 he means 10
This was the day needledrop lost his credibility
The fact that this review didn’t end this clown’s credibility immediately is insane
Finally decided to watch this review, and it’s good to know that his take on this album is incredibly wrong
This is where Anthony Fantano became melon
You gave it a 6 because you love Drake more
best album fr
crazy as bitch
This video was Fantano&#39;s canon event
GREAT VDIEO
Bro you forgot to flip the 6 upside down
Hes kinda right on the drama part
Bros just yappin
Cool review Anthony!
I’m just gonna do my part and dislike it
This review is almost as bad as your My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy review
If it was My beautiful dark twisted fantasy by Kanye West you would’ve given this a 6
if he called it &quot;to twist a fantasy&quot; you would&#39;ve given it a 10
I mean this is one of Kanye&#39;s nest albums. I didn&#39;t really get into him until this album. So I don&#39;t know old old Kanye it wasn&#39;t ever my vibe really. <br><br>I like : yeezus, mbdtf, life of Pablo, and 808s.
Fantano talks about how critics “jUsT dIdNt UnDeRsTaNd KaNyEs GeNiUs aT tHe TiMe oF rElEaSe”  but neither has he, until recently.
If it was called KIDS SEE MY BEAUTIFUL DARK TWISTED FANTASY he would&#39;ve given it a 10
This nigga lost all credibility as a music reviewer to me after this shit. I watch his videos from time to time, but just for the LOLZ
Yeezy didn&#39;t teach him
I think the melon hate masterpiece and like music sounding like a guy shitting.
It’s okay guys, it’s out of 5!
how is it a 6/10 yet you have no least fav tracks 💀
at first, i didn&#39;t understand why people hated this review so much, i mean, it&#39;s just his opinion, surely it isn&#39;t that bad right. now, all this time later, i&#39;ve sat down and listened to the album all the way through, and after doing so, i promptly decided to come to this review, and give it the dislike that it so rightfully deserves.
SO GEHT ES ABSOLUT NICHT
Devil in a new dress might be Rick Ross’s best feature to date
What thats West best.. and one of the best hip-hop albums ever made.. it was a dark twisted fantasy 😈
THIS NIGGA IS CRAZY
He really is this album’s devil in a new dress
this is the same guy that said ksi&#39;s song were hits
When I used to watch these reviews on my blackberry phone 😊😊😊. That intro, YouTube at the time 😮😊 …. Time!
Him not liking Kanye talk about his personal life, I have to disagree with. I think the reason this album is so good is because of his honesty with his emotions with his emotions in this album, and it ads to a relate-ability that we haven’t seen before in kanye. The production is amazing also. For me, a 10/10 album
6 is not a low rating
Learning some melon lore today
triple the dislikes to likes is crazy
This is where men went to die
This is where it all started
always coming back to this to be more and more shocked an opinion this wrong was made
All of the Lights is easily the worst song on this album and I&#39;m not sure why it&#39;s so popular individually. Still a 6/10 is wildly low given the rest of the album
He really just gave this, which is definitely a Top 10 album of the 2010s at least, and a top 100 album of all time, a 6 lmfaoooo
Silly Melon you forgot da &quot;+4&quot; wich would be a 10
Literally &quot;Dark Fantasy&quot;
What if you<br>Wanted to go to heaven?<br>But God said:<br>You gave MBDTF a 6/10
stupid melon
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo4S2qlQGs0&amp;t=391">6:31</a> bruh he said it’s just his opinion y’all don’t have to go nuts on him for just saying what he thinks
64k dislikes vs 20k likes jesus christ...
valid review tbh
That intro!
broh, it&#39;s light 6/5
W
I kinda get it. I think the second half of the album is way better than the first half except for Power
This shit is so old that is has the original album cover before it had to be pixelated
Kanye West sucks as a rapper. His flow is fucking wack and his lyrics and rhymes sound like something a 7th grader would write..
I didn&#39;t know it was possible to be this masterfully incorrect
Terrible score, 6 is too high. I would have gave it a 3/10 kanye is not even a good rapper
I feel like you&#39;re saying the album is an 8/10 but Kanye&#39;s shenanigans outside the album are a 4/10 and so you&#39;re averaging the two. And so you&#39;re bored by the subject matter of the lyrics yet early in the video you noticeably praised very highly some of the rhymes and even said they save songs that otherwise might not have held for the music.<br><br>Um, I think you should review the album. I&#39;m reading between the lines here and saying you&#39;re really giving this thing an 8/10. You don&#39;t like ALL the subject matter but the music and lyrics are entertaining even if some of the hooks are too conventional (?).
Can someone please explain to me how this video was posted November 16 2010, but MBDTF wasn&#39;t released before November 22? Am I just stupid or???
we never realized how right he was
I love this album and think it&#39;s Kanyes magnum opus. That being said, I can respect and understand this review.
This aged so well it’s unreal
You are wrong.
Yeah this is the hell of the Internet here🎉
Gotta dislike bcoz the redux review did a much better job conveying your opinion instead of 6 minutes of praise just to conclude everything with a light six.
Wow.  Someone who saw through the hype, even when it was at its most fervent.  Fair play.
It is a fact that it his opinion. so 6/10 is fact
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo4S2qlQGs0&amp;t=313">5:13</a> lol. lmao.
6/5 is damn crazy
Where&#39;s the original comments
Brother
Imao can anyone take this joker of a man serious, I like his videos cuz they&#39;re funny but does anyone take him seriously as a reviewer? 6?SIX? and he gave damn a 7 and that boring ass TPAB album a 10 just because of its lyrical content, when the tracks weren&#39;t that innovative instrumentally except a few like mortal man or wesley&#39;s theory or for free? this guy doesn&#39;t know jack shit about music
Oh Boy
I will forever hate you for this
16.11.2010<br>never forget
This melon is fucked up
What a review, I wonder what your fan base would think of it
rated yeat higher
The only objectively wrong opinion of all time
For the people still wondering today, this video has 62,500 dislikes and a ratio of 3.2 dislikes per like; I personally don’t think that’s enough. This review alone has ruined all credibility on any and all of his takes on music.
I agree
im writing a college essay on how much I disagree with this review.
He did not say &quot;Yall know this is just my opinon right&quot; so this is a fact
tbh this is the only fantano review i respect for being actually honest and sticking to his guns.
For the people here, the dislike ratio is 19k (Likes) to 62k (Dislikes)
&quot;I&#39;m feeling a light to decent 6&quot;💀💀
This makes me want to eat a big fat bacon cheeseburger while listening to Gorgeous
how did fantano review this album before its supposed release<br><br><br>i found out its release is probs the same day as when kanye released the runaway movie (October 26th)
Guys he liked the album the only thing he doesn&#39;t like is kanye&#39;s shmeat  I don&#39;t see a problem with that
I’m didn’t know this dude was swole like that
i comlpetely agree
Remember when Kanye’s biggest and  most unforgivable scandal was the vma Taylor swift thing
im sorry but i agree
Agree, MBDTF is overrated now that I listened to Kanye&#39;s other stuff. It&#39;s great, but he just has so much good music. If Graduation is a 10 and TLOP is an 8, then it makes sense that MBDTF is a 6.
No one on the internet:<br><br>Anthony Fantano: proceeds to give great review then gives an awful score like a douche
blame game deserves more
Who would have thought melon let his personal opinion get in the way of a review
To pimp a butterfly &gt; My beautiful dark twisted fantasy
This guy should stop making reviews
I think that MBDTF is kinda overrated and definitely not a ten and I fucking hate this video
e dislaiky na hora cara meu deos
Melon knew the whole time. He was only trying to warn us
how could he give this a 6, this guy literally supports hitler!! should be a 0
I owe you an apology. I wasn&#39;t familiar with your game.
the worst possible way this meme could&#39;ve ended
We all owe this man an apology. He was way ahead of the time
there is an above 0 percent chance Kanye has watched this video
Perhaps I treated you too harshly
Maybe this deserved to get a 6 after all
Was he cooking this whole time?
It&#39;s all your fault melon all yours
Oh god you were more right than you knew
This wouldnt have happened if you gave MBDTF an 8 Fantano
Most people rejected his message<br><br>They hated the Melon because he told the truth
Damn, Melon Man. You clearly knew something we didn&#39;t.
This album is not a six my guy
Who comes here every so often
for everyone here after youtube removes the dislike button: 19k likes and 61k dislikes
What?
Kanye had to be canceled, you&#39;re forgiven Melon Man
You are a criminal u fuckin bitch u give this masterpiece a 6
non capisci un cazzo ritirati, hai dato lo stesso sputato voto ad herr loss, come cazzo fai, cosa ti entra nelle orecchie americano guerrafondaio di merda, torna a sparare i razzi nelle lande desolate del texas, coglione.
Dislike button gang<br><br><br>              👇
you are an idiot.
The fact that he gave Her Loss the same score doesn&#39;t sit right with me.
i give this video a not good
i agree with it being a 6, mid album
Say what you will about the review, Fantano severed ties with Kanye much earlier than adidas here
Lol
I love the part where you mentioned, &quot;Can we get much higher?&quot;
for people who don&#39;t have the see dislikes extension, this video currently has 19k likes and 61k dislikes.
He really thought he was Plato with this review<br>“Is his MBDTF himself??????”
This is literally an overwhelmingly positive review. What the fuck is everyone on about?
i haven&#39;t listened to this album but i don&#39;t understand why this is such a disliked video when you voice a lot of praise for the album, and you&#39;ve made it clear that your gripes with the album are subjective
💀💀💀
feeling a light 6 on your existence. could be improved.
Hey guys remember when fantano gave this album a six? No way he would do that again
This video humbles me
madmelony by madmelon
Now Review your wife melon <br>You would feel light to decent 3 at least on her ✌️
This is my favorite album of all time yet I feel this video is overhated it just some guys opinion and 6/10 isn’t the worst score ever I would be glad if my own music was given a 6/10
Imagine if Kanye&#39;s next album started with a really obnoxious noise after how this symphony ended.
The one piece
Fantano is the only person that i love and i hate at the same time
bro???
Needle Drop Will
While I don’t think it’s a 6, I don’t think it’s a 10 either. I think it comfortably sits at a strong 8 for me. TLOP is much more enjoyable imo, sonically it’s just a lot more interesting
classic.
you should review my beautiful dark twisted marriage next
Sadly melon didn&#39;t believe the one piece is real
Just what the hell was he thinking??? Was he even thinking to start with?
Fantano will soon listen to runaway and realise that this is 10/10.
LIGHT 6
TROOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLLLL<br>TROOOOOOOOOOOLLLLLLL IN THE DUNGEON.<br>everyone is losing their pants/shit/shirt over da Kendrick album. I think its pretty good.
11 years later and it’s still an ass take
i hate you
Thanks Anthony for investing in a new microphone since this, and more so for staying true to yourself. You shout out what you like and give all your honest opinion when you don’t and we don’t have to guess where your head is at. Keep on keeping on bro. Thanks for all the time editing and listening and letting us in on your feels.
He really gave Ksi exactly 1 point lower than this Jesus Christ
Melon looks the exact same as today
Unpopular opinion: I agree with him
This use to be my favorite Kanye West album, but after listening to The Money Store, I realized that it’s kind of overrated. So with that being said, Late Registration is my favorite Kanye album.
Friendly reminder that this man thinks Gucci Gang is better than Runaway
What I&#39;m wondering is how Anthony reviewed the album six days before it released
Wtf he has always been sitting
This man has been sitting for 12+ years it seems... Would&#39;ve been a 10/10 if you were standing.
Everyone seems to like his opinion, I don&#39;t see a single dislike
I came here for you to change my mind, and the first half of the video really seemed supportive of this album but I can agree with the later half of this video also. In retrospect, this album has a lot of drama. I however had that drama Kanye west had when putting out this album in the form of my teenage angst and the moment when I was a teenager listening to this album it went over well with me. In hindsight I can see how you do find this album to be about feeding into his drama
I visibly cringed and recoiled when I heard that score
I disagree with the score. I do think that this is one of Kanye’s best work. But I do think Anthony does bring up some good points. And I definitely can understand why he gave it this score. But yet again I think this album sounds absolutely incredible and I love it and always will
Guess how many dislike this video have rn.
Sorry Fantano, had to make the journey back to dislike this.
If only I could see the comments from 11 years ago 😳😒
&quot;I don&#39;t wanna sit through 9 minutes of Runaway&quot;<br><br><b>sits through 12 minutes of Ye rambling on Last Call and calls The College Midout his best album</b>
jokes aside this genuinely might be the best album of all time and this guy gave it a 6
People HATE this review to oblivion, but he&#39;s low-key valid with his concerns here. Still, I have My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy as a 10/10. It&#39;s quite literally the perfect &quot;Kanye album.&quot;
I honestly agree with Fantano on this review, and no, i&#39;m not saying that because i&#39;m a Fantano stan. I genuinely feel like if you&#39;re not an ultra Kanye West stan and buying into whatever he says on this album, turning your brain off while listening to it,  you&#39;ll give it a 6/10 too. Maybe even a 5/10. It&#39;s got good music, and really nothing else but dirty laundry.
The origin of hate in this world is pinpointed directly to this video
Giving this album a 6 should be a sin. This album was amazing
Totally agree, 6/6
☹
It&#39;s actually hilarious how for a decade this 7 minute review has been infamous amongst not just Kanye fans, but music circles in general, and what it boils down to, is Fantano not thinking that this album is the greatest thing ever, he&#39;s literally mostly positive about everything but just doesn&#39;t hold it to a higher standard and people have been mad about it for a decade lmao
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo4S2qlQGs0&amp;t=389">6:29</a>
Still can&#39;t believe he said light 6
this is the worst video on the internet.
this is the video where walter white became heisenberg
Good luck explaining this one to God Melon
Damn 0 dislikes, this must be a good review
Bro said all of the lights hook is corny 😆
Common Fantano W
why it got so much glitches
Review this Ratio, Bitch
how are people still bitter about some guys opinion on an album literally over a decade later 💀ya’ll stan kanye too hard lol
100% agree and hate how overhyped this album is
His reasons for not liking it are perfectly understandable he just wasn&#39;t invested in kanye Life to really like the album were he messed up was  giving a lil pumps album a higher score
2010 the light 6 incident…
FANTANO YOU ARE 💀💀🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Lil pump album was given a higher rating
classic
Even though he still rates the album a 6/10, I appreciate the fact that he actually went <b>more in-depth with his thought process</b> and explanations in his second review. <br><br>Because here he basically just says <b>“nice ambition but the hooks mid and idc about Kanye’s drama”</b> and then concludes the video with 6/10, leaving everyone in a state of visible confusion.
“Nice ambitious project but I don’t care that much about Kanye’s drama.” <br><br><b>gives 6/10 and ends the video</b> 🤦🏽‍♂️
I&#39;m gonna say it. I actually agree.
The fact that he gave this a low score is a SIN
There&#39;s a google extension where you can still see the dislikes. Currently the ratio is at 17k likes and 57k dislikes. I use &quot;Return YouTube Dislikes&quot;.
youre racist for that
💀
OK AFTER RESLITENING I REALLY DONT UNDERSTAND WHAT THE FUCK GOIING ON IN UR BRAIN OMFL BRO YOU ON SOME OTHER SHIT LIKE YOUR WIFE NEEDS TO DIVORCE YOU AND FILE FULL CUSTODY ON YOUR FUTURE CHILDREN LIKE THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU DAWG ARE YOU HIGH? STUPID? DUMB EVEN? I JUST CANT FATHOM WHY YOU THOUGHT THIS WAS A 6... THERES A LOT OF EMOTION YOU JUST CANT UNDERSTAND WITH YOUR ASPERGER ASS I GUESS.. MY GOD....... LIKE WHAT THE FUCK BRO I JUST SHIT MY PANTS WATCHING THIS OUT ANGER AND FURY AND ALSO LOTS OF CUM
Definitely one of the reviews of all time.
Hot take: This album isnt a 6, is a 7.
There&#39;s a little something for everyone.
anthony basedtano
Still come back to see if it’s a 6/10 :(
Bruhhhi thought people liked this review with 17k likes until i saw the fucken loool.<br>This is why we need the dislike button bruh
Anthony, your opinion is ass. Stfu. MBDTF is one of the best albums ever made. Easy 10/10 not 6/10. Fuck you
Melon got better. A great content creator.
This did not age well.
All of the lights, so appalled... can be found on in mainstream albums.. Where? i have yet to hear a masterpiece like all of the lights
how did you review an album a week before it drops?
Whatever, sleepy-music hater
Has anyone checked on this guy to make sure the brain damage wasn&#39;t permanent?
the butthurt fans will always be hilarious

Did he even listen to the right album?

Seeing this without the numbers of the dislike button is just wrong
When they finally removed the dislike button from YouTube, this was the first video that came to mind.
Your tastes are like a soggy 5000 year old piece of dusty cake with 10000 year old diarrhea on it.
Yet another casualty of the dislike purge
Oh wow a review with 17k likes. People must agree with this man’s opinion due to the amount of likes shown.  It’s impossible for there to be &gt;2 times the amount of dislikes but unfortunately, I have no way of knowing.
Rip to all the dislikes this review had
If he’s wrong then why does this video have 0 dislikes?
WHERE ARE THE DISLIKES

Oh no. the dislikes are fading to dust
Wow! 17k likes? I’m sure everyone agrees with this review and he didn’t give it the same score 10 years later
dislike counter
Dislike
This is cursed without seeing the dislikes
ratio
this has gotta be racist
Since the dislike button is removed, use me. <br>Dislike:
Conspiracy Theory: Melon campaigned YouTube to remove dislikes because of this video
Who’s here to dislike from Reddit
A decade ago and he this review still sucks
Everyone make sure to dislike this before the dislike button is removed
Naw lmao
oh will you look at that! no dislikes. im glad we are all on the same page as anthony on this one
how are people supposed to make you feel bad about this review now that there are no dislikes? 😔
fart
YouTube is getting rid of dislikes... RIP to this Legendary video, currently at 54k dislikes
Wow 17k likes! Everyone must&#39;ve agreed with Melon&#39;s review here
it would be pretty sad if youtube decided to remove dislikes and now this mbdtf review has no dislikes
It hurts me so much that I can&#39;t see the like/dislike ratio
I’m so mad that you would rate this a 6/10. I dislike your videos
Ah yes. Always feels great coming back to a classic life this one🔥
racism
When did the &quot;dislike&quot; button become the &quot;disagree&quot; button?
i just listened to it for the first time last night and how fucking dare you
Fantano&#39;s last good review.
Guys, stop the hate. He meant 6/5
We are all back for the yearly purge I see 🤨
I watch this every night to cry myself to sleep
Is it a 6/10 or a 6/10 <b>for Kanye</b> they don&#39;t mean the same thing.
6/10 more like 6/6
I&#39;m going through all your video to just disslike
Holy shit runaway was 9 min? I honestly didn&#39;t even realize.
Hi everyone. Anthony Fantano here, the internet&#39;s busiest music nerd, it&#39;s time for an album review, an album that everyone has been begging for. Begging for, begging. Kanye West&#39;s &quot;My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy&quot;. Before listening to this album, I had all of this stuff just running through my head, things I would say to kind of preface this review, stuff like &quot;Hey, you know, the stuff like the VMA&#39;s, the Today Show interview, the Katrina/George Bush debacle, all the media gaffes, all that stuff, that&#39;s just context, man. It&#39;s not important. This is music. Pay attention to the music. Leave your hate at the door&quot;. It&#39;s a very similar argument I made when I reviewed MIA&#39;s last album. But the more I listened to Twisted Fantasy, the more I kind of came to realize that that position is total and utter bullsh\*t. Not because Kanye&#39;s gaffes are so unforgivable that we need to scrutinize this album using everything he says. That&#39;s not the case. The reason it&#39;s hard to ignore context on this LP is because Kanye&#39;s favorite thing to rap about is himself. On here he puts both his strengths and his flaws on display. And it kind of makes me wonder what his &quot;beautiful dark twisted fantasy&quot; is. Is it himself? Is it his life? Is it an album about his life? Basically the music here and Kanye West&#39;s personal life are pretty inseparable on this album. The lyrics here reference everything to the fish sticks joke on South Park to the dude&#39;s very emotionally damaged love life. Rhyme wise, flow wise, I feel like Kanye is really creative here, very much on the ball, like the opener Dark Fantasy, there&#39;s a point where I laughed my ass off, when he said &quot;you got too many Urkels on your team, thats why you Winslow&quot;. DAAAAAAAMN! I&#39;m loving a lot of the rhymes here, and even when I don&#39;t like a certain track, they are a little bit of a saving grace for me. And I think that track is a particularly awesome start to the album, just kind of paints Kanye&#39;s rise to the top, and it&#39;s a little exciting. But Kanye does not just think of himself as a rapper, he also feels he is a singer. And I will say, singing is not the strongest tool in Kanye&#39;s toolbox, sometimes his singing is a little off. But it basically gets the job done. But the best thing this LP has going for it for me is the beats, the production. Just great sounds, interesting samples. I remember when watching live performances of the song POWER I didn&#39;t exactly know how to feel about the King Crimson sample in that track but I&#39;m really loving the studio version. The song clips flow together really well in that song and make something that&#39;s really really cinematic. It&#39;s just kind of a brave new world for sampling in my opinion. I&#39;ve always been a fan of sampling, always been an advocate, always felt like there&#39;s so much more potential for it but copyright is kind of standing in the way of that. I would say the song POWER is a great example of the artistry that sampling music can offer if the artist is freely allowed to do so. And there are other tracks that surprisingly enough do a lot with a little, like the song Monster just has, not really lush sounds, but very kind of stripped down and simple, primal drums, minimal synthesizers, but still sounds very dramatic and kind of eerie. The track Blame Game kind of fits that bill too, very dramatic but not overdoing it. There&#39;s soul samples on here, a very fiery and classic spoken word piece delivered by Gil Scott-Heron, crowd sounds, just a lot of clips flying by every moment on this album. Whether you like Kanye or not, this thing is ambitious as hell, especially from a sonic perspective. All the tracks flow together really well, it&#39;s very cohesive, Kanye takes most of his guest MC spots and relegates them to a few posse tracks that come together really well. And even though I&#39;m not the biggest Nicki Minaj fan, the biggest Rick Ross fan, they contribute some pretty good stuff to the album. But, gripes gripes gripes, because there are gripes that I have, and sort of the first one, maybe an appetizer, are the hooks. A lot of the hooks on this thing, either to me, anyway, just an opinion, kind of come off a little corny or a little generic. I&#39;m thinking of tracks like Hell of a Life, So Appalled, All of the Lights, maybe something that I could just kind of come across on any new rap song in the mainstream on the radio. And that kind of lets me down because most of this album doesn&#39;t really strike me as being that type of music. I&#39;m gonna say something that may spark a lot of angry comments, but at least half of what I&#39;m hearing here feels very artful to me for a mainstream hip hop album. But my biggest gripe with this LP is something I mentioned earlier in the review, and that&#39;s how essential it is, to me, to be a fan, or at least be interested in Kanye on a personal level to enjoy this. I think even someone who hates Kanye can get into some of the storylines on this album at least a little. The position I&#39;m in is that I don&#39;t care. There&#39;s fantastic production here, there&#39;s great rhymes, but I&#39;m not so interested in hearing about Kanye&#39;s f**ked up social life so much that that I&#39;ll just be sitting on the edge of my seat through 8 minutes of the Blame Game or 9 minutes of Runaway. I get kind of bored! What do you want me to do? But people love the sick little details. People love dirty laundry and I can see this album appealing in a big way because of that, especially because of how expensive and impressive the music sounds. I enjoyed a lot of what I heard here, I just didn&#39;t like a lot of the drama that this thing served up because it just doesn&#39;t sound all that relevant. I&#39;m feeling a light to decent 6 on this thing, but that&#39;s just my opinion. You guys, you were asking for this, let me know what you think of this album. Is it Kanye&#39;s greatest work yet? Should we even be taking context into consideration when enjoying this album? And what should I review next? Anthony Fantano, Kanye West, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, forever.
ty łysy grzybie
He’s way off this is not a 6. It’s a 4
do it again
sorry Tony...
hi, came just to dislike. ok bye
Wtf
i have disliked 2 videos
The camera quality looks like parody. I get that this was ten years ago, but going back to his old videos just feels wrong. The only thing more wrong is the rating.
Genius marketing Mr Fantano
Every year the dislikes grow and the likes stay the same, it’s beautiful
This is why Fantano has no creditability as a music critic
This guy is a clueless clown.
Unpopular opinion a 6/10 is actually too high. Album is trash and Kanye is trash.
Cap
I think this album is a 8/10
He is racist I see how they way he was explaining it
10 years later and I have now just realized he was rating on a score of 1-5 for this album 🙏🏼
This guy has the weirdest taste of all time. This is a 6/10 but look at his best albums and songs of the last decade. Most of the crap is so shit that barely one listens to the crap. And here we have one of the best LPs ever. Just a troll. He knew that he will gather attention.
I actually agree with him 6/10 indeed
Don&#39;t worry, he&#39;s just rating MBDTF just like a wrestling match and 6 stars is beyond better than 5 stars.
funny cuz Kanye stole the Winslow line
I hate you so much :)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo4S2qlQGs0&amp;t=1">0:01</a> Fantano has legs?
I can’t believe we still listen to what Melon says after this
10/10 album. A sad day in your career
How can you be this unintelligent
Love Melon, but this really is one of his worst reviews. I mean, his critiques barely make sense here, it especially hurts since he has also made some of the funniest, intelligent and in-depth music reviews on YouTube. This is not one of them.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo4S2qlQGs0">0:00</a> Did melon man just predict Kanye’s Donda album cover?
This video is easily a 6/10
Racially motivated
How could one possibly lower their rating by 4 points over these fire hooks
He had us in the first half not gonna lie
So let me get this straight….<br><br>‘My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy’ (2010)<br><br>An artistic masterpiece of an album about the beauty and dangers of fame and love presented in amazing ways with extremely realistic musical elements and orchestral sounds, and amazing usage of sampling small elements of old school songs to make something completely original. Also extraordinary mature subject matter used very well lyrically throughout the album gets a 6/10.<br><br>While: ‘Lil Pump debut mixtape’ (2017)<br><br>An album about nothing, just getting stoned and high, talking and mumbling about flexing and making love to girls and repeating dumb words that mean nothing for most of the songs. While mixing generic, boring trap beats that have the same generic feel over and over again with distorted bass that overpowers the record gets a 7/10?<br><br><br>What The Actual Fuck?!
it’s been 10 years but this review is one or the biggest ratio + L + cancel oat
Great review Fantano still watching this to this day 👍<br><br>Happily Unsubscribed forever
Tbh I kinda of agree
I agree 6/3
This is actually a very fair review.
Ow man
Nearly 11 years later and I&#39;m still flabbergasted by your immense stupidity
If Swans made this album he’d give it a 10
This album review is a light 1/10
I think yeezus is better than mbdtf
mbdtf really isnt all that good lol its too crowded and busy.
@Homosneksual the Return please put his review of Daughter - Not to Disappear in the playlist, thank you :-}
Tbh people wouldn’t have complained about this review if he didn’t give it a score
Holy fucking shit this video really is as terrible as they say
Ratio
Satan
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo4S2qlQGs0&amp;t=388">6:28</a>  this was truly the moment Walter white became heisenberg
I would&#39;ve been happy with a light 8...
It’s the best overall album he’s done yet.  But to me, his music always gets better over time.  He just hasn’t packaged it this well since then.  But he will.  His best album hasn’t happened yet.
A video got about 50K dislikes, around 36K more than the liked amount.<br><br><br>All over a light 6...
Stop reviewing<br><br>Find God<br><br>Come back after you found God
Haha just watched the Donda review where he gave it a 7, which is higher than MBDTF... We need an update Anthony
<b>man shares personal opinion on music</b><br><br>Everyone: 😡
ohhh what a fucken melon
This video is so funny idk why
how can you have credibility after this ?
this whole video is cursed
….so there it happened, right?
I found this from a “Top Ten most disturbing videos on the internet” video
homophobia.
11 years later this still haunts him
made the pilgrimage as a Kanye fan to give this video a dislike
“This is the best thing I’ve ever heard, it’s fucking amazing, production is amazing, literally the best thing on earth, 6/10”
Nice ratio
He gave Donda a higher score than MBDTF.
23% like percentage. nice...
I get mad when people say that they dont like something that I enjoy without explanation. But when they could explain why their thoughts don&#39;t reallg match up with mine, I could respect them. And he literally says it&#39;s his opinion only. Take it as another person&#39;s professional perspective. Don&#39;t  take it personally
Anthony, describing your darkest deepest fantasies on involving Kanye West is not a review.
can you get much higher
I agree on opposite day 😈
This review still haunts me
XDD
A fat ratio in the dislikes. Well reserved
If he gives Donda a 7, we riot.
Came back to remove my dislike so I can dislike this video
If Kanye was white, this would be a 10/10
Imagine...This didn&#39;t age well
I&#39;ve never witnessed somebody be <b>so wrong</b> before.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo4S2qlQGs0&amp;t=388">6:28</a> 💀
I bet you gonna give Donda much higher than MBDTF
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo4S2qlQGs0&amp;t=388">6:28</a> Is where the hate started.
you would&#39;ve given it a 10 if he was black smh
Donda
People seem to forget he actually put this album in his top of the year list, put it on nr.2 on the Kanye ranking, POWER was in the top 10 for song of the year, and this is not even the lowest critic score it has gotten.
I do not agree with you... this album is much worse! The first two tracks are pretty good and then the rest of it to very middle-of-the-road nothing interesting to painful to my ears and disappointing. Probably a light 4. Also I don&#39;t understand the hate on this video it&#39;s just one man giving his opinion what the hell is wrong with that?
&quot;Hell of a Life, So Appalled and All of the Lights are something you could find on any album coming out in the mainstream. &quot;<br><br>We have gotten all of the music there is to get from the 2010s. I haven&#39;t found a song like All of the Lights on <b>*any*</b> other album.
whos watching this side by side with his new vid lol
I think his score is completely fine if I&#39;m being honest, I think that he didnt explain himself or his thought process very well here, and that&#39;s the outrage
When did he change to a 5 point rating system?
Anthony really thought he could say &quot;too mainstream&quot; in the most verbose way and that nobody would notice.
Damn I definitely get the hate for the video. I never actually watched it until now. Its not a 10 outra 10 imo but a 6? Rough
Who edited that one stock footage video from August 17th 2021 and went back in time to post it here to give it a bad funny review
What if it was all a dream...
It was all a dream.
apparently this never happened according to new lore
It was all a dream.
It was a dream guys
Who else left a like to support his opinion?
Anthony, you gave this a 6 and said that &quot;People love dirty laundry&quot;<br>but nearly 10 years later when Jesus Christ did the laundry you gave it a 5...<br><br>Make up your mind melon...
6/10 to my beautiful dark twisted fantasy, from kanye west.<br><br>7/10 to sour, from olivia rodrigo.<br><br>what on the actual f
Drop Donda Kanye
No wonder DEHH think that fantano fans are trash. Yall keep saying the same thing over and over.
Anthony, I disagree.
Everyone went crazy on this guy
I came here just to dislike
The way Fantano described the album really made it feel like he was going to give it a high 7-8, but let&#39;s be real guys this album really is a solid 6
6/6
I like how he censored bullshit with a photo of my favourite album of all time. Powerslave by Iron Maiden.
GODDAMN THIS IS STUPID. I DONT CARE ABOUT KANYE&#39;S LIFE SO IT&#39;S BAD. I understand it&#39;s just his opinion, but damn.
Tbh I don&#39;t agree with the rating but it is still overrated af and id rate it a 8/10
this is like hearing somebody say &quot;this movie was pretty good i really enjoyed it good characters, good plot, minor problems with story that are easily ignored all in all really cohesive, 3/10&quot;
I&#39;m watching this upside down, it&#39;s pretty cool you gave it a 9, Melon.
wrong still wrong
this guy cant even grow hair and thinks he can talk shit about kanyes best album?
This was the last straw Melon!!!
fuck this bullshit
Lmao all the kanye stans came back to defend him 10 years later kinda gay tbh
Who likes this?!
I agree. very overrated album
fun fact: fantano just gave this album a 6 because he wanted to be the guy that gave MBDTF a 6
average youngboy fan
I kinda agree with him on this score because the songs on this album are hit or miss
I guess Anthony is a South Park writer
hell of a life is absolutely insane
More like a 666
You&#39;ll never live this down.
I honestly agree with fantano on this one. Perhaps not a light 6 but the hype surrounding this album was so crazy and it fell a little flat for me. There are great songs and songs I would skip so it&#39;s a 7 for me.
the only explanation for this is racism
8
whats crazy is that he could have given this and 8 or a 9 and people wouldnt be that mad but simply because he gave this a 6 everyone wants a 10
I will never forgive you for this anthony
Nobody:<br>Me: <b>Tryna find a comment from 10 yrs ago</b>
can we talk about how hot he looks here?
This review is proof that people just look at the score and like/dislike
&quot;Generic hooks&quot; <b>is a rap album</b>
Guys just because something gets a higher score than mbdtf doesn&#39;t mean its necessarily better
Nice. Finally someone who reviews this objectivelly
Can&#39;t be the only one who kinda agrees with him. This album is a tad bit overated, no?
This is why I rate things out of 6.
stfu u melon
Guys he many 6/5
As much as I love kids see ghosts, it getting a 10 and MBDTF getting a 6 is stupid.
Same dude that gave oliver tree a 7
Ya know? I think people overuse the whole 10/10 thing.<br><br>Coming from someone who doesn’t like Kanye’s music.
the 9/11 of album reviews
This right here is the moment Fantano became a living meme
&quot;this is so amazing and cinematic, anyway 6/10&quot;
Haha imagine if this guy reviewed this album again 10 years later and gave it the same score man that would be crazy
Racism
Sad that this has gotten so many dislikes, yeah it may be an unpopular opinion, but he&#39;s being honest and there&#39;s nothing wrong with liking an album less than everyone else
Damn he gave MBDTF the same rating as MOTS7
How can you get bored with Runaway? That&#39;s simply sacrilege
Honestly I only disliked for the meme
Now Fantano gave 6 10s. You what this mean? MBDTF is a 10!
the legendary review
why does everyone disagree with this? its a very good point and fair review
He made a mistake the minute he turned on the camera
wtf
this guy angers me so much. music is so incredibly subjective and i litterally respect everyones opinions but he just spits out his negative opinions on every album like he&#39;s throwing up and is trying to find problems in every song. (i&#39;m not talking about this review in particular) like music doesn&#39;t have to be perfect to be good. would like to see what music he has to offer from himself
In My Opinion: My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy: 10/10<br><br>Fav Tracks: Dark Fantasy, Gorgeous, POWER, All Of The Lights (Interlude/Song), Monster, So Appalled, Devil In New Dress, Runaway, Hell Of A Life, Blame Game, Lost In The World, Who Will Survive In America<br><br>Least Fav: Ummmmm
😟
lol
fuck you
fuck you
He would’ve given it a 10 if mbdtf stood for : melon boy down to fuck
Him: he displays all of his strengths and his flaws<br><br>Me: nope that’s no possible he has no flaws
His most disliked video lmao 🤣🤣🤣🤣
😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
never forget 9 minutes of Runaway bores him but he gave Swans - To Be Kind a 10/10 while it has 17 minute and 34 minute long tracks lmfao
I agree. This is a 6/6 album
This is just an awful piece of journalism in general forget the rating
Nov 16 2010. The “light 6” incident.
BASED
I don&#39;t get why people were mad about his rating, he said it sounds great and it&#39;s only real flaw for him was the subject matter, literally he said mostly good things throughout the whole video
kinda based ngl
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo4S2qlQGs0&amp;t=388">6:28</a> = Pain
November 16th, 2010 - The &quot;6&quot; incident
I torture myself daily with this review, pretty good self-harm core
Melon man: &quot;Kanye&#39;s fifth studio album is easily his most ambitious effort yet. The production is extremely stunning. To be honest, this album sounds like a really huge undertaking with all of it&#39;s extra instrumentation, studio tricks and samples.<br><br>Kanye has stepped up his rhyme game too. It&#39;s also comforting to hear his guest MCs are rapping on his level.&quot;<br><br>Also Melon man: 6/10.
I still can’t believe this
Just got back here from watching his review of Lil Durk and Lil Baby&#39;s &quot;Voice of the Heroes&quot; album. He said that collab is just as good as MBDTF.
the internet hates opinions what are you doing????
Yeah....this proves what i always thought. This guy doesn&#39;t know good rap if it slapped him in the face
I come here from time to time just to get upset about someone else&#39;s opinion on something I believe is a masterpiece. Crazy world, huh?
Geez the like to dislike ratio
Its funny because this album is actually a 4/10 and people are mad he gave it a 6/10.
its june 2021, the corona virus is beginnning to fade and dark fantasy remains one of the greatest albums of all time
Bro the picture is fucking now weird since there is sus and Hoya and others but it looks like a girl Fuckkkkking
Melon has never fucked with the lights on
Hot take Anthony fantano is a fucking idiot
Don&#39;t let this distract you from the fact that he gave MBDTF a 6/10
For all of you comparing this review to his other reviews and complaining that Lil Pump got a 7 and this got a 6, you misunderstand the point of these reviews. According to Melon himself, he grades albums based on their execution relative to what he percieved their goal was. In his opinion, Lil Pump, no matter how bad his album was, got closer to just making some fun songs than this album did to whatever Kanye envisioned it to be.
Did he just call All of the Lights...<br><br><br><b>generic?</b>
Olivia rodrigo got a higher score 😐
melon: explains how its a 10/10 album <br>melons score: 6
Some day you gonna pay for this
Runaway is a song about narcissism, as is this entire album, as is kanye&#39;s entire persona. You don&#39;t need any context because what he&#39;s presenting is the essence of modern society
just listened to the album for the first time, Monster was the only track i liked. nice vid
Ironically, a review that supposed to age badly because the album aged well had aged well.
Ners
BOOOOOOO!!!!👎👎👎👎👎
This actually a training video on how to become a 🤡
sheeeeeeesh
I agree with him.
Literally a 10. Proved himself to be a complete spineless dweeb in the years since. Sam hyde says hi.
kanye&#39;s singing is very good tho
Nice Patsy Cline shirt.
Fantano is my favorite youtuber.
I cant find one comment one comment agreeing with him
your opinion is invalid
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo4S2qlQGs0&amp;t=312">5:12</a><br>oh man, you have no idea...
nice fantanoooooooooooo best review ever
shut up melon
He is a Taylor swift Fan I suppose
And they hated him, for he told the truth, and they did not want to hear it.
that like to dislike ratio
This is easily one of Melon’s reviews.
I love how his explanation for the low score is that he doesn’t like Kanye as a person. What a shitty review.
The only fantano video<br><br>That i disliked 😭😭😭😭
I love coming to this video just to look at all the triggered kanye fanbois
In an alternate universe he gave this album a 10/10
Thanks for recommending this to me YouTube in 2021
the most based video on youtube
gay
I don’t like you
It feels like you had covid since you started this channel
I just listened to this album just like 20 mins ago along with pinata and to pimp a butterfly and I have come to the conclusion that Anthony fantano is mentally crazy to the point it&#39;s scaring me. How could you say that this album is a 6/10? Strong 9 to light 10 for me
why hasn&#39;t he aged
🥺
Man he looked so much better without the dirt-stache
no
This is what ruined him
he really dont know shit about music
THE FUCK IS THIS
My god this video a square
Hmmm, I wonder if this youtube video is an opinion..?
it sounded like he was gonna give it an 8
What would it take for this man to give someone a high 9 or a perfect 10/10 lol
I feel like I’ve been abused by this review in every way except Physically
Love you fantano, but this is my least favorite video on the internet
We need melon on a lie detector test and ask him if MBDTF is really a 6
This album is not a 6 but it’s definitely not a 10 either
I come back every year to make sure I disliked the video. See you guys next year
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo4S2qlQGs0&amp;t=17">0:17</a><br>Melon says &quot;Hazbin&quot;
100% agree
God I hate italians
If it was made by Lil Pump you would have given it a 10/10
Agreed.
hey
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo4S2qlQGs0&amp;t=390">6:30</a>, a very important part of melon lore
ah yes, the &quot;light 6&quot; incident
The 16 november 2010 incidence
16th November 2010, the light 6 incident.
I still can&#39;t see how Anthony doesn&#39;t like &quot;All of the lights&quot;
He already knew he was going to get so much flak, he had restated how it was his opinion that it was a light 6. Still didn’t save him all these years afterward...
Lol the likes and dislikes are mirrored
hes off the rails bullshit review
ur stupid
i think this album is a 6/10, what about you 24 year old melon?
fuck you.
Racism is alive and well in America folks
Hes prob the guy that doesnt like 808s cuz it&#39;s sad, like yeah it&#39;s supposed to be.  You&#39;re listening to a kanye album, it&#39;s going to be about him and his life
What, Tha Fuck, Is Wrong with you.??😤
Yes
Its been 10 years. And he still hasnt aged one day
How did this video come out on November 16, 2010 if the album came out on November 22, 2010?
I can’t be the only one who listens to this album everyday
This may very well haunt you for years to come
I feel like 95% of the views came like 8 years after he uploaded the video lmao
6 is a fair score but id give it a 7, its a great album its just the most overrated album of all time.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo4S2qlQGs0&amp;t=389">6:29</a> <br>Is the second he changed history..
ur gay
Fav Kanye album: the college dropout
I come back to this just to make sure its still disliked melon
Based review.
Am I the only one who actually agrees with this review?
Came back to make sure I had disliked it
Disliking this video is basically a rite of passage to becoming a Fantano subscriber at this point
He did it for the clicks
you fucked up...
This albums sucks!!!! Worst Kanye by far!!!
fuck you
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo4S2qlQGs0&amp;t=395">6:35</a> ‘Let me know what you think of this album’<br><br>Melon probably regretted saying this ever since
“Light to decent 6” is what the gates of hell will say as they open for fantano to enter.
hush melon
This is the 9/11 of hip hop reviews
i feel like the lowest possible rating on this album could ever be is a 7
When times where easier...
Lets be honest here if this album had released 20 yrs ago fantano would have done a classis review on this
Where it all begun...
BASED MELON<br><br><br>BASED MELON
this copy is for hype williams
I would actually kill myself if I ever gave this album a 6, and I&#39;m a drunken asshole who hates kids. &quot;Kanye talks too much about himself&quot;. Hahahahahahaha fucking idiot.
This was definitely a review
Never forget
Says it falls apart in the 2nd 1/2 and then lists lost in the world as one of the best tracks
Man’s genuinely hasn’t aged in 10 years
9/11 of music reviews
fuck you
Y&#39;all know this is just his opinion right?
Clown
That ratio tho
So appalled had a bad hook I agree but all of the lights???? Wtf?? Aigjt bruh
“Easily his most ambitious work yet. The production is stunning and his lyric game is stepping up” <br><br><br><br>6/10
The first objectively wrong opinion
This review is fine lol he&#39;s not even that hard on it
fuck you melon man you ruined my life
&quot;And I always find, yeah I always find somethin&#39; wrong<br>You been puttin&#39; up wit&#39; my shit just way too long<br>I&#39;m so gifted at findin&#39; what I don&#39;t like the most<br>So I think it&#39;s time for us to have a toast&quot; <br>Fantano: 6/10<br><br><b>H E Y,  L I T T L E  P I S S  B A B Y</b><br>Mfkin fantano: 7/10
i hate ouy
A national tragedy
It&#39;s great album but fantano is right, it&#39;s all over the place. The lyrics go from racial issues, to materialism, to fame, to Kanye wanting to fuck a pornstar. Thematically is also over the place, the samples are all amazing but have little to no connection thematically. Songs are also dragged way too long, and while some of them are justified, most of the long tracks just don&#39;t know when or where to stop. As an album, it&#39;s maybe a 6. But experiencing the songs individually are way better. The only sort of thematic cohesion (if you want to call it that) is the period of Kanye&#39;s life in which the record was made, but out of that, as an album, I agree, it&#39;s a 6.
Probably the stupidest video on YouTube
One day he will know, just give him time
Common reminder why this guys a fucking joke
your right that album is fucking ass cheeks
if you think about it, you can round 6 up to a 10. so he really meant to say 10 but he wanted us to use our math brain to find the actual answer.
When I first found this channel, I had heard about this video’s controversy. And even though I hadn’t heard the album, I gave the video a like because of the courage it takes to say something like that. Now, over 10 years after the album came out, I finally listened to the album, and I’m back to give this video the dislike it so rightfully deserves
Agree.
best comment section on yt
Kanye will not survive in america
6 is harsh but mbdtf is overrated af. To me Late Registration, College Dropout, 808s and Graduation are better.
ratio
I first listened to this, then I watched this review.<br><br>Screw you Anthony 10 years ago, this album <b>is</b> good.
why does 2010 look like 1990 here
currently thinking about freedom of speech
Oi
13k likes, 39k dislikes... I think we all knew what we were walking into when we tapped on this video
The people who liked this video are Taylor&#39;s cuntie band of twaties
wait this video came out on the 16th of november and mbdtf dropped the 22 😳😳😳
I almost wiped my ass with my phone
The people did not like this video
What a nice young man, surely he wouldn’t give on of the greatest hip hop albums of all time a 6/10.
Anthony keeps turning his head to the man with a gun to his head, looking him in the eye before he faces his death.
Sometimes I come back here just to make sure I didn’t dream this by mistake
Racism
Fuck you anthony
Lol he certainly won’t rate this album the exact same score years later &amp; give a lil pump album a higher score
not everyone can be right
his old videos hold up as much as mbdtf
<b>*frick you egg*</b>
L
Agree with a lot of points on this review but will never understand why Melon thinks the hook to All of the Lights sounds mainstream and generic
He gave the same grade to Kanye West and Miley Cyrus ...<br>Someone stop this man
Greatest Kanye work is Melon worst interview. Ever.
This video is a sin
For the first time I watched this infamous review, and yeah I get he doesn&#39;t like the subject matter, but you give it so much praise production and sonically that surely it would be atleast a 7, I think Melon was way too harsh. But it&#39;s not as bad as sinister of a review that ppl make it out to be.
10 years later and this is still the most controversial review Fantano has ever done
This review is seven minutes long. I can&#39;t be bothered.
Hahahahahahah he said runaway was mid hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhaahahhahahah
Fair score imo
This discredits everything else you have to say
Lmao going back 10 years and this guy was still a tool
Imagine how much more dull life must be when you don’t like MBDTF
&quot;Great production, amazing lyrics and flow, cinematic, creative sampling, soul touching....  feeling a strong 0 to a light 1&quot;
10 years, same melon
I come back to this 10 years later as I never finished the video<br><br><br><br>And he gives it a 6/10
It&#39;s funny how it looks like he&#39;s looking at the album as if it&#39;s there behind him

Anthony... you really need to stop looking at animated butts when you are reviewing an album, get it together man.
BIGGEST CAP OF ALL TIME
this man is gonna have trouble explaining this in front of the gates of heaven
fuck you melon
Who’s here after the albums 10th anniversary?
10 years of 6/10
Who here for the birthday of MBDTF 10 years
The album turned 10 years old today
Ten year anniversary baby
Happy 10th anniversary
Dude gave the best rap album of all time a 6/10
it is the ten year anniversary of this 6/10 project today!😄
How the fuck was this video posted six days before the album actually came out.
Happy 10 Year Anniversary to the release of the album: ‘My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy!’ by Kanye West (November 22nd 2010 - November 22nd 2020) 😎🐐🔥🔥🔥🔥🐐😎!!!!
10
YouTube knows what it’s doing by giving this on my recommended on November 22, 2020
Melon really got ratiod by his own dislikes 😂
Damn 10 years.
The like to dislike ratio lol. I gotta like it just to help the melon out.
Let&#39;s put it this way:<br>Lil Pump got a 7
10 years anniversary babyyyyyy
10 years of a shity opinion!
It&#39;s been 10 years since this atrocity was uploaded. I turned 6 on the same day this was uploaded.
10 Years
i come back to this video every halloween and i still get scared shitless every time
I’m glad Fantano agreed that this album is overrated af
Is this melons most disliked video???
&quot;Awesome Album, One of the Best Albums of All Time, Easily in My Top 10 Albums of 21st Century,  Insane Production, Awesome Lyrics and Just an Awesome Project&quot;<br>- Melon 2010 <br><b>But I&#39;m Cutting 4 Points Because I Didn&#39;t like How he Crashed Taylor Swift&#39;s Speech.</b>
Annual fantano h8 comment
Man has youtube Evolved
“six” is a weird way to pronounce 9.
I agree with him this  album is so ovverated
The fuck?
happy halloween guys
Ok, how the fuck are you going to give Ye a 8/10 when that album is also a personal project.<br><br>I thought you didn&#39;t care about Kanye&#39;s personal life.
no ❤️
Lil Pump Album = 7/10<br>Lil Yachty Album = 7/10 <br>MBDTF = 6/10<br><br><br>Melon = 0/10
why it says it was published on nov. 16th 2010? didn&#39;t this album come out on 22th, 6 days after?
Imagine not respect the opinion from others.
I would sit through runaway if it was an hour long lol
You gave this album a 6, lmao........<br><br><br><br><br><br>BET YOU WON’T DO IT AGAIN!
🤦🏽‍♂️
he right
jacksepticeye
Lil Pump got a 7
Is bad enough that he gave it a 6, universally most hip-hop fans consider this a classic, but there was waaaaay to much drama around this project, and its easy to say &quot;jUsT iNgOrE tHe dRaMaAaAa!&quot; but you can&#39;t, at the time of this review, Kanye was fucking everywhere, with the VMAs and the head turning political statement, you couldn&#39;t go a day without someone saying &quot;Kanye is a fucking asshole!&quot; or something of that matter.<br><br>But that&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing, Kanye&#39;s audacity and personality is &quot;partially&quot; responsible of what makes his music so interesting, he such a strange and confusing person, and his music lets us see what&#39;s inside
this here is ground zero for the abusive relationship between anthony and his fans
is this the meme?
CONFIRMED<br>LIL PUMP IS A BETTER RAPPER THAN KANYE WEST
📂Documents<br>  └📁 Melon<br>      └📁 Bad Reviews<br>           └  Lmao this one
Teacher: “Alright class, what is 5+5?”<br><br>Pitchfork: 10!<br>Fantano: 6?<br><br>Teacher: “No, Mr. Fantano, that’s wrong; EXTREMELY wrong; are you OK? There’s only one answer to that question. Any other answer is unacceptable, and flat-out incorrect.”
god the memes in these comment sections are amazing
I mean I love MBDTF, but he was pretty fair here. All of the fucking idiots in the comments need to calm down. A six for him is actually pretty good considering he does the 5/10 = average thing. It&#39;s not school mother fuckers you don&#39;t need a 70% to pass.
Let’s do some maths:<br><br>MBDTF + JIK = 10<br><br>So if we add both of these albums, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is a 10.<br><br>Fantano your an idiot
well guess what Anthony, you&#39;re not invited to my birthday party
6/10 is deserved lol
Anthony is a 6/10
Don&#39;t let this distract you from the fact that Acai FC&#39;ed this on Clone Hero
Fantano: <b>says that Lost in the World was always one of his least favorite tracks</b><br>Also Fantano: <b>put Lost in the World as a favorite track</b>
this
I’m probably the only person that agrees with this review album was mad average, devil in a new dress is fucking unreal tho but really mostly for the Rick Ross verse
All the black people who loved this guy trashing eminem are butthurt now
ratio&#39;d
ratio&#39;d
ratio&#39;d
ratio&#39;d
If you think about it, a 6 is basically a 7, a 7 is basically an 8, an 8 is basically a 9, and a 9 is basically a ten, so mbdtf is a 10/10 thank you melon
<i>fuck you melon</i>
This is the moment melon became Heisenberg
I swear he hasn’t changed a bit since like forever
This album is definitely a 6, it&#39;s the most overrated album of all time, all of the pitched up vocals sound like fucking shit
Acai’s FC on this review sent me here.
Shut up Anthony, just shut up, you don’t get to speak on a Masterpiece like this
Dislike for the culture
Did you dislike it?<br><b>Yes</b><br>But at what cost?<br><b>A view</b>
Mah man cantano disrespected runaway like that
Fantano is so fucking wrong with this review. It should&#39;ve been a 4/10.
imagine this guy comes back 10 years later and reviews the album again just to give it the same score, that would be so kanye
yall know 6 is positive right
Man look at all of these fanboys in the comments
u suck
this looks like something i would see on public broadcasting at 3 in the morning
Do your part and dislike this video
Nice review, but you used the wrong clip for the rating at the end
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo4S2qlQGs0&amp;t=390">6:30</a>
This is one of the most disliked videos ive ever seen in my life lmao its not even from the amount of dislikes, the ratio is severely towards dislikes. I’ve never seen more evidence as to why an opinion is “wrong”. I didn’t even know an opinion could be wrong, but melon somehow proves it
Wait is this a troll?
Only 35k deslikes? Really
I come back here once in a while to have a laugh
I like this fantano, he always says something like &quot;in my opinion&quot; and tries to stay positive
I hope my friends are wrong, but they think Anthony gave this album a 6 only because of the marketing reasons. Any thoughts on that?
WH-what?!!? A SIX.. WHY NO 10?? &gt;:((( My FaVOrite Album MANOH NO WHY HOW ever could I live ;((
Fantastic production, great rhymes, good transitions.  6/10
how did u think hell of a life had a generic hook and sound lol
To the commenter reading this, this is the positive zone of the comment section. Take a Cookie then carry on if ready :)
10 years later you still a bitch
melon lol
Rip
do this review again melon, i dare you. you cant just dock 4 points because kanye&#39;s black!
are you fucking kidding me
Hi everyone. Anthony Fantano here, the internet&#39;s busiest music nerd, it&#39;s time for an album review, an album that everyone has been begging for. Begging for, begging. Kanye West&#39;s &quot;My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy&quot;. Before listening to this album, I had all of this stuff just running through my head, things I would say to kind of preface this review, stuff like &quot;Hey, you know, the stuff like the VMA&#39;s, the Today Show interview, the Katrina/George Bush debacle, all the media gaffes, all that stuff, that&#39;s just context, man. It&#39;s not important. This is music. Pay attention to the music. Leave your hate at the door&quot;. It&#39;s a very similar argument I made when I reviewed MIA&#39;s last album. But the more I listened to Twisted Fantasy, the more I kind of came to realize that that position is total and utter bullsh*t. Not because Kanye&#39;s gaffes are so unforgivable that we need to scrutinize this album using everything he says. That&#39;s not the case. The reason it&#39;s hard to ignore context on this LP is because Kanye&#39;s favorite thing to rap about is himself. On here he puts both his strengths and his flaws on display. And it kind of makes me wonder what his &quot;beautiful dark twisted fantasy&quot; is. Is it himself? Is it his life? Is it an album about his life? Basically the music here and Kanye West&#39;s personal life are pretty inseparable on this album. The lyrics here reference everything to the fish sticks joke on South Park to the dude&#39;s very emotionally damaged love life. Rhyme wise, flow wise, I feel like Kanye is really creative here, very much on the ball, like the opener Dark Fantasy, there&#39;s a point where I laughed my ass off, when he said &quot;you got too many Urkels on your team, thats why you Winslow&quot;. DAAAAAAAMN! I&#39;m loving a lot of the rhymes here, and even when I don&#39;t like a certain track, they are a little bit of a saving grace for me. And I think that track is a particularly awesome start to the album, just kind of paints Kanye&#39;s rise to the top, and it&#39;s a little exciting. But Kanye does not just think of himself as a rapper, he also feels he is a singer. And I will say, singing is not the strongest tool in Kanye&#39;s toolbox, sometimes his singing is a little off. But it basically gets the job done. But the best thing this LP has going for it for me is the beats, the production. Just great sounds, interesting samples. I remember when watching live performances of the song POWER I didn&#39;t exactly know how to feel about the King Crimson sample in that track but I&#39;m really loving the studio version. The song clips flow together really well in that song and make something that&#39;s really really cinematic. It&#39;s just kind of a brave new world for sampling in my opinion. I&#39;ve always been a fan of sampling, always been an advocate, always felt like there&#39;s so much more potential for it but copyright is kind of standing in the way of that. I would say the song POWER is a great example of the artistry that sampling music can offer if the artist is freely allowed to do so. And there are other tracks that surprisingly enough do a lot with a little, like the song Monster just has, not really lush sounds, but very kind of stripped down and simple, primal drums, minimal synthesizers, but still sounds very dramatic and kind of eerie. The track Blame Game kind of fits that bill too, very dramatic but not overdoing it. There&#39;s soul samples on here, a very fiery and classic spoken word piece delivered by Gil Scott-Heron, crowd sounds, just a lot of clips flying by every moment on this album. Whether you like Kanye or not, this thing is ambitious as hell, especially from a sonic perspective. All the tracks flow together really well, it&#39;s very cohesive, Kanye takes most of his guest MC spots and relegates them to a few posse tracks that come together really well. And even though I&#39;m not the biggest Nicki Minaj fan, the biggest Rick Ross fan, they contribute some pretty good stuff to the album. But, gripes gripes gripes, because there are gripes that I have, and sort of the first one, maybe an appetizer, are the hooks. A lot of the hooks on this thing, either to me, anyway, just an opinion, kind of come off a little corny or a little generic. I&#39;m thinking of tracks like Hell of a Life, So Appalled, All of the Lights, maybe something that I could just kind of come across on any new rap song in the mainstream on the radio. And that kind of lets me down because most of this album doesn&#39;t really strike me as being that type of music. I&#39;m gonna say something that may spark a lot of angry comments, but at least half of what I&#39;m hearing here feels very artful to me for a mainstream hip hop album. But my biggest gripe with this LP is something I mentioned earlier in the review, and that&#39;s how essential it is, to me, to be a fan, or at least be interested in Kanye on a personal level to enjoy this. I think even someone who hates Kanye can get into some of the storylines on this album at least a little. The position I&#39;m in is that I don&#39;t care. There&#39;s fantastic production here, there&#39;s great rhymes, but I&#39;m not so interested in hearing about Kanye&#39;s f**ked up social life so much that that I&#39;ll just be sitting on the edge of my seat through 8 minutes of the Blame Game or 9 minutes of Runaway. I get kind of bored! What do you want me to do? But people love the sick little details. People love dirty laundry and I can see this album appealing in a big way because of that, especially because of how expensive and impressive the music sounds. I enjoyed a lot of what I heard here, I just didn&#39;t like a lot of the drama that this thing served up because it just doesn&#39;t sound all that relevant. I&#39;m feeling a light to decent 6 on this thing, but that&#39;s just my opinion. You guys, you were asking for this, let me know what you think of this album. Is it Kanye&#39;s greatest work yet? Should we even be taking context into consideration when enjoying this album? And what should I review next? Anthony Fantano, Kanye West, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, forever.
Absolute moron
I’ve never seen someone take a bigger L than this
I can see why people don&#39;t like this review. You can&#39;t just mock Elton John for not saying the N-word on &quot;All of the Lights&quot; Melon, he just wanted to do a brief feature, not start a race war
Oh shit, 66% of support are dislikes
Maybe Ye wanted to be president so that he could kick Fantano out of the country for this review.
My friend holds this album to “best rap album” standards... and i honestly wasn’t surprised. It’s not a 10 but certainly isn’t a 6
The Chris Rock skit was so cringey
ANGER
Hm 9 years late to tell you, no jxjdnfmc
Funny how he gave it the same score 10 years later yet the like/dislike ratio is reversed....
So you’re telling devil in a new dress and gorgeous arent on your favorite tracks. Yea see you in hell buddy.
wtf
Ooooooo you goin to hell now
I can’t believe Kanye West created 34,000 different YouTube accounts just to dislike this video
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo4S2qlQGs0&amp;t=387">6:27</a> <b>top ten moment before disaster</b>
i respect you but actually i don&#39;t
So this is the turning point at which the world turned to shit
Classic
confuse with mbdtf review and ye review. you hate his life stories in mbdtf but you like his story telling with ye
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo4S2qlQGs0&amp;t=141">2:21</a> Fantano whenever he gives something a 7
To this day I get this video in my recommendations. It&#39;s like the YouTube algorithm is bullying me rubbing this in my face.
People were acting as if he was sucking off the album in the review and then gave it a 6 out of nowhere. He said that he was bored listening to certain songs, found some of the hooks to be mediocre, and didn&#39;t give a shit about the drama some of the songs were throwing out there. Y&#39;all know a 6 is still positive, right?
Anthony’s internally rotated shoulders are the most annoying part of this video. Triggers my ocd
You got to be out your damn mind
Am I seriously the only person who 100% agrees with his opinion?
I only disliked it because Anthony was wrong.
Biggest L Fantano has taken. And there has been a bunch he’s taken
I may 9 years to late to tell you this but calling this review stupid would be a complement
*10/10<br><br>bitch
“People love dirty laundry” hitting different after JIK 😭
yo what the fuck are you talking about it’s been 9 years ik but what tf are you talking about what
Give The Overrated Dropout a 10<br>Give Late Registration a 9<br>Give MBDTF a 6<br>WTF Anthony
this got the same score as a 100 gecs album
Lancei o disLIKE, GUYS bay bay
That&#39;s fair
Omg 10 years already I feel old😭😭😭😭😭😭
This man put Lost In The World in his fav. tracks, now on the Redux Review, he dislikes it.<br><br><b>Bruh.</b>
There are people who have memorized it so much that it is on the guitar hero workshop as a song
A 6/10 ISNT A BAD RATING (it means he thought it was good but not great) HOWEVER ITS A LOWER SCORE THAN IT SHOULD BE
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo4S2qlQGs0&amp;t=388">6:28</a>
first
Hoowwww? It’s supposed to be a 8-9
And y&#39;all thought the pandemic was bad...
the review reads like a 8 or a 9 but gave it a 6 because he doesn&#39;t like him
this video is the exact representation of IGN
delete this
Melon man
They called me a mad man
What is overrated in this?
What if Anthony wanted to go to heaven but god watched his dark fantasy review?
Hear cause Of quarantine? Yeah same
АХАХАХАХАХАХХАХАХАХАХАХАХХАХАХАХАХАХАХХАХАХАХАХАХАХАХХАХАХАХАХА РУССКИЕ ЕСТЬ?
Legendary review.
Yo is it stuttering with colors for other people? I feel sick
Internet legends
It&#39;s like his 4th best album tops, get over it people
Is it just me or Anthony fantano is just a trashy music reviewer?
I agree melon can I hug you now?
no
how did the album come out November 22 but this review was November 16th
I don’t get why ppl are so mad abt this. It’s not like he’s god or anything u don’t have to take his opinion seriously. He isn’t more right/wrong about music than anybody else is he just has clout cuz he’s smart. I don’t trust his opinion more than I do the next guy
I heard to this album, it was progressing good but All of the lights rolled, Runaway and Hell of a life wasn&#39;t a great fan of those tracks. Other than that I feel like the album is great! I&#39;d give it a solid 8 honestly even the enjoyment is SOLID.
Hooks on KSG:<br>Kids see ghosts sometimes <br>Kids see ghosts sometimes <br>(X10)<br>Melon : issa a 10
Interesting how he changed the title from &quot;Kanye gets mega cucked by a review HD&quot; to this. Very clever melon
The infamous
Wait what
Y’all give him shit for this review but he’s right about the latter half of the album, it’s actually not even worth listening to.
Your hairline is a 6/10
Uhhhhh.... How was this review posted on November 16th, 2010 if MBDTF didn&#39;t come out until November 22nd, 2010?
I not a fan.
Ayy i was here when it hit 1 mil
It hit 1 million views
Wtf is wrong with you melon
I still disagree with this melon but at least the redux is much more informative
This is the biggest bruh moment I’ve ever seen
Melons head seems like it keeps wanting to twist right
After knowing all the hate he got for this, the review is way nicer than I thought
Nearly 1 million views guys!
I&#39;ve never wanted to crush an egg so bad
People who are clowning on him for giving the album a 6 clearly never watched the review of the album and only saw the score.
This is a bullshit review
January 24th
wrong
This album is an 11/10, it&#39;s that beautifully composed.
Best Kanye&#39;s Album still on 2020!

Yeah, which Kanye album are you, Anthony?
Melon keeps looking stage left like he got someone tied up over there.
&quot;I&#39;m going to say something that may spark a lot of angry comments...&quot; <br><br>He has no idea
Damn melon aged good
Went from the future and I can say that is still a 6
You fucks are pathetic lol,you religiously hate on a genuine,regular guy who loves music just like all of us because what? He reviews music and gave a Kanye West album a 6/10? What kind of fuckery is that? He never even said his opinions are the only right ones or anything egotistic like that,he reviews music and that’s it.He gives his grading for a piece of music and explains the reasoning behind his score in a pretty articulate way,it’s all of you losers that get borderline butthurt anytime someone feels like Kanye West isn’t a literal perfect being.
No
idk why people hate him for this review, he gave his opinion on it and explained why it doesn&#39;t vibe with him like it does with Kanye&#39;s stans so why get mad?
I like this review.
Who’s here after the redux review
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo4S2qlQGs0&amp;t=312">5:12</a> oh are you
This is one of those reviews that feels much more positive than the reviewer&#39;s rating. <br><br>Fantano sounds in this video the same as he would when speaking on an album he would rate a strong 7 or a light 8. I definitely wouldn&#39;t expect him to give it a light 6 given how positives he was on the album. <br><br>Now time to go watch his redux review where he gives it a 10, says he&#39;s a dumb slut, and rubs crisco all over his body. See yall later!
came back after the redux to re dislike this
Could you imagine him doing a redux and giving it a 6/10 again
Fuck off!
Melon: Dislikes MBDTF for the fact that all Kanye talks about is his life.<br>Also Melon: Loves Kids See Ghosts and Ye because all Kanye talks about is his life.
There has to be a lot of people coming here because of the redux review.
Who’s here after he re reviewed it?
No tony You did it again tony nooo
Melon trolled us hard
Who&#39;s here after the redux video
We never knew how good we had it when we only had this one mbdtf review
Top 10 craziest conspiracy theories
He added another 6 on top of this review so it’s a 12 now
I’ve come here for solace after the Redux.
10 years baby
Who here after he gave it a 6 again?
Damn i feel old now
&quot;I&#39;m gonna say something that <b>may</b> spark a lot of angry comments&quot; and look where we are 10 years later. Never underestimate your words Melon.
Nice
Who&#39;s here after his redux review
LMFAOOO
Who&#39;s here after he re reviewed it and gave it a 10?
2020: &quot;Strong 5 to a light 6&quot;<br><br><br>it went downhill lmao
I&#39;m back at the original video after watching you give this album a 6 again smfh
I come from the future. Nothing has changed.
Melon still doesnt get it
Ok bois we need a redux of the redux
Same rating but his 2020 review definatly has more backing it up
Who is here after the rdux review in 2020??<br>Like if you are
Bless
Can’t wait till this album is a strong 5 in 2030
Who’s here after the redux review?
Well well, lets see what you originally thought.
LOOK AT THE REDUX IF YOU HAVEN&#39;T ALREADY! He came a long way from this review (this may seem dated now) and he gets a lot of hate for the score he gave it but in the redux, he explains why he gave it that more thoroughly
10 years later he gave it a 6 as well. That was something of very poor taste, Melon, bullying Ye for 10 years straight.Remember, he’s with God now, watch out!
Came back just to say it’s been almost 10 years and Melon still doesn’t see his mistake.
Bamboozled yet again
Haha imagine if this guy reviewed this album again 10 years later and gave it the same score man that would be crazy
whose here after he gave the best album of the decade a 6 again :(
coming back to this after 10 YEARS of maintaining a 6 for melon to go and give it a 6 again
Who’s here after he reviewed it again?
Back after the re-review to see if he just copied it word for word smh melon
you maniac
Yup, came from the redux review.
hi i’m from the future he reviewed it again melon is still wrong
BRUH
LMAOOOOOOOOO
Who else is here after he gave it a 6/10 again in 2030
lmaooooooo this is even funnier
2010: Light to decent 6<br>2020: Strong 5 to a light 6
No...no
Who’s here after he gave it a 6/10 again?
Here after it&#39;s still light a 6.
Little did we know, he&#39;d give it an even lower score almost 10 years later
Who’s here after watching the Redux Review?
The Redux review brought me here
the madlad actually did it
Look who made a re review
Leaked Transmissions from the Cosmos
You little shit.
Redux score 6.1/10
You said there would be a Redux melon 🧐🤨😡
Place your bets on what the score will be<br><br>My guess is a 6
what if he just reuploads this exact video
The redux has to be better than this
Let’s get that redux
Racism
Who’s here before the Redux review?
You HAVE TO give this a higher rating on the updated video out later today bro.... PLEASE BRO!
Redux today
Here when this is about to be reduxed
Anyone here before the Redux review?
My birthday is Nov 16, 2000. This video was uploaded on Nov 16, 2010. I turned 10 that day. Meaning that melon gave this album a 10
I&#39;m from the future and Fantano will put out a redux review, rating this album even lower than last time
The album is so overrated
U R WORNG U CANNOT HAVE DIS OPININ GAY ASS B WORD
Ah This has aged like milk.
I&#39;m actually surprised that not even half of your subscribers have watched this review, how is it not your most-watched video?
Kanye can have a little 6/10. As a treat
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo4S2qlQGs0&amp;t=389">6:29</a> made me want to intentionally get last place in the hunger games
A “Light 6” awarded to this album should be considered a crime against humanity.
Wait 6 out of 10 is a positive review
Bad album
How do you praise this album, then give it a 6??😂😂
My trip has lead me to the void which is this video... it is true... he really gave MBDTF a 6
runaway
In my opinion it’s a decent 7
Everyone always talks about how he gave it a 6/10, but can we acknowledge how neither Runaway or Devil In A New Dress are in his favorite tracks?
Ew this video is gross
melon literally gave it a 6 after complimenting it for seven minutes.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo4S2qlQGs0&amp;t=141">2:21</a>
Srry melon but you’re wrong
Lmaooo 9 years later you still look the same💀
Melon’s never looked so smooth and glossy
YOU ARE A FUCKING MORON GIVING THIS A 6 YOU KNOW FUCK ALL ABOUT MUSIC
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo4S2qlQGs0&amp;t=311">5:11</a> &quot;I&#39;m gonna say something that may spark some angry comments&quot;
It doesn&#39;t even have too much water, surly it mus be higher than 7.8 at least.
Ok but why you got to do Powerslave like that?
Well if you take into account inflation this would be a 10 in today’s standards
To put this in perspective Lil Pump got a 7/10
Fantano: leave your hate at the door!<br><br>Also Fant ano: THATS BULLSHIT!!!
Anthony,<br><br><br><br>It’s been nine years since this dark day. But now I can kind of see your argument. I was blinded by hatred those years ago... but now I would give MBDTF a solid 7.
U suk
You&#39;re not qualified to not give this a 10
Just know when you get rejected at the gates of heaven, you’ll know if was for this very reasoning. May the day of reckoning show you mercy
Classic review
9.7k watched the review<br><br>30k skipped to the end
YOUR GAY YOU REVIEW MUSIC
&quot;Can we get much higher?&quot;
7.5 in the time it was released, 9.99/10 rn
Is there anyone that really didnt like this album? Be honest
To put this into perspective The Big Day is only 6 points worse then MBDTF
Damn<br><br>This is the worst thing on you tube
Best album of 2010s.<br>BRUH.
This review came out when I was still trying to find my way home
This man didn’t put Runaway, Devil In a New Dress or Gorgeous in best tracks...
So you deleted your thatistheplan channel but not this review?
Never noticed the like ratio lmao this is going to haunt him for life
fuck you fantano
watching this in 2019, my jaw actually dropped when i read 6. melon. you are stupid and predjudice to kanye
for april 1st 2020 anthony should do a redux review and trash it even more
i had to look this video up because of your album of the decade video, and you mentioned flaws and gripes with MBDTF. the actual fuck are you talking about? think the 30k dislikes to the 10k likes really says it all.
ANTHONY PLEASE REVISIT THIS, MY WIFE HAS THREATEN ME WITH TAKING THE KIDS OUT OF ANGER OF THIS REVIEW
In my opinion it’s one of the best albums ever
this man hasnt aged one bit
All this controversy and still under a million views?
Gets bored of a 9 minute song *Listens to Death Grips do meth and yell in a New York subway for 3 hours
KANYE WEST’S ‘MY BEAUTIFUL DARK TWISTED FANTASY’ NAMED #1 ALBUM OF THE DECADE-2019 So I&#39;m not going to take you serious.
If the album was called “Our beautiful dark twisted fantasy,” Melon would’ve given it a 10
The 9/11 of music reviews
Album of the decade and he gave it a light 6 🤭🤭
How could someone make this decision.
Who’s here after it was voted album of the decade?
Who is here now that this is album of the decade??
r/Kanye users unite.
Album of the Decade
Just came back to say #1 Album of the Decade by Rolling Stone and Billboard... lol 6/10
This review didn’t age well
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo4S2qlQGs0">0:00</a> hey guys it&#39;s Scarce
Who is here after Billboard announced MBDTF the Best Album Of The Decade?
how do you give it a light 6 and still ask if it could be his best work, man I’m appalled
I cannot believe this video.
I turned the 6 upside down it&#39;s a 9 now
I looked up Anthony Fantano 6/10 and this video was the first to pop up
DAT RATIO. DAT FUCKING RATIO.
A 6/10 cuz you don’t like some fuckin lyrics. Holy shit
This is a joke
10/10
Classic meme
Why does he keep looking back at the album cover
What did you film this on?
just realized i haven’t disliked this yet
so is this where he lost all respect?
Wow he was much less gay back then.
THOSE FUCKING OLD YOUTUBE COMMENTS
I feel like this review is actually fair. He’s basically saying “If I cared about Kanye’s personal life it’d be a 10, but because I don’t and all the material is about that I get bored and it’s a 6.” <br><br>Leave your hate below.
Damn all these Kanye fans getting butthurt over a opinion is hilarious
Album of the decade
Well happy 9th anniversary of the album of the decade
Damn he really is stupid this just won album of the decade
Never forget the worst review in YouTube history
how is this Published 16/11/2010 <br>When the album released in 22/11 !!??
Sometimes I just go through the comments of this video just because
Top 10 mistakes in life
<b>Gets bored of a 9 min Kanye West song</b><br><br><br><b>Will sit through 35 min of Swans playing one chord</b>
might I say that... this was pretty reasonable?
for all those kanye fans still unimpressed in 2019<br><br>10 - 6 = 4<br>6 + 4 = 10<br>MBDTF 10/10
highly subjective
Came back to say that this album just got billboard’s album of the decade vote. Sounds like a 6/10 to me
How u gon review this and not talk bout runaway
“Greatest Album of the 2010s” -billboard
Runaway is ye’s best song—quit playin fantano <br><br>smh 😣
This album was pure MAGIC. No one who is out now (Drake included) could even TOUCH this album. Jesus is King makes me think Kanye is not one of the greatest but then I go revisit his classics and HOLY SHIT. This music transcends me into another universe. Kanye is the GOAT.
Happy Birthday to this one!
Just checking bad in... Yup, it&#39;s still a bullshit review.
Its been 9 years.....
remember lil pump?
How did he review this in Nov 16 if it was released Nov 22?
A LIGHT 6???? The artist of our generations best work and it&#39;s a light 6?
you lowkey gunna burn it hell fo’ this one.🤦🏼‍♂️🖕🏼
infamous
Its almost the end of 2019 going on to a new decade and is the album of the decade for most if not many people including me
Just combine the score of this and JIK and you have the correct score for this album
Dude, shut the fuck up
At this point I just thought, does nothing please melon
Teebs
4 minutes in and hes still talking about what he likes...
Booooo this man!
Sometimes I replay this video and turn the volume to mute to prove I don’t care about melons opinion
Well I was going to let that new born child in the other room live but I watched this review and now I have to hold the poor thing under the water till the bubbles stop. :/
I think people should respect that when they watch a review of an album they are hearing an individuals take on it, if you&#39;re too sensitive to take a different opinion to yours then don&#39;t watch reviews. Also imo Kanye is a trash person making trash music
Album of the decade
disgusting
I&#39;m giving this a like because of how legendary this review is
Anyone else here from his album of the decade video?
So lil pump self titled is better??
How many subs did he have at this time?
Thats a funny way to pronounce strong 10.
Am I the only one who kinda agrees with Melon here?
I haven&#39;t even listened to the album and I&#39;m offended
people who haven&#39;t listened to the album and still dislike the video gang wya
stfu
I gotta be honest MBDTF probably the most overrated and overpraised album of all time. The top tier production literally carried the whole shallow and shitty lyricism. <br><br>Fat booty celine dion? fucking and choking you? 24/7 365 pussy stay on my mind? put a pussy in sarcophagus? <br><br>I still prefer Illmatic and TPAB to be the greatest rap album of all time though. <br><br>It&#39;s 8/10 for me dawg. This album might influence some people to make longer tracks but other than that, I haven&#39;t heard any album or even a song that kinda resemble or inspired by MBDTF.<br><br>Yeezus and 808s are more influential these days.
I can&#39;t believe this review is turning 10 next year.
Who&#39;s here after the MBDTF redux review?
u trippin
He&#39;s right you know
IGREGIOUS
JIK got the same score  ....
This review is a disgrace. Never eating a melon again
Mbstf : Insane album but i didn’t like how he spoke only about himself, 6/10<br><br>Kids see ghosts : Cool album, i especially loved how kanye spoke about himself during the whole album, 10/10
I just came here to read the comments
can&#39;t really hate on him, he really just kinda vibin tho
This review sounds like an 8/10 not a 6/10
The dislikes!!
LOL
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo4S2qlQGs0&amp;t=141">2:21</a> me when melon gave kids see ghosts a 10
fucking melon
If Kanye was a democratic pleb it would be a 10
Came here 9 years later to dislike this.....
nr1
e top
6/10
<b>HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND</b>
Me: I’ve been listening to MBDTF for 8 years, I’ve heard the album hundreds of times. It’s one of my favorite albums of all time, 10/10.<br>Melon Man: Light 6<br>Me: yeah this album gets a light to decent 6 for me
Friendly reminder that Die Lit got a 7
Is this is still his opinion?
nonce
If MBDTF is a 6, you should have given Jesus Is King a 0.
just when we thought this would be lowest score anthony would give kanye
Who&#39;s here after that Jesus Is King review. I know I am Melone.
Who is here after the disappointing Jesus is King review
A 6?!?!?!
On April fool&#39;s day one year, he should redux this and give it a 2
Watching this after listening to Runaway like 1000 times and im think “damn Anthony is so wrong”
That intro reminds me of scarce face reveal
I’m here before Jesus is king gets a worse rating than this, but this time the score will be granted.
YOU GAVE ONE OF MY FAVORITE ALBUMS A FUCKING 6?! IT&#39;S KANYE AT HIS BEST
I still can&#39;t believe you gave this a 6
What a shitty mic
damn.. even hip hop dx came across this in the breakdown people really dont really let him live this down!
2 words, personal enjoyment. Y’all mad bc a fruit didn’t enjoy something as much as you did 😂
I loved this album but it aged in a very bad way. I&#39;m with Fantano, other websites giving this a 10... what a joke. This album is a 7.5.
That dislike number °_°.
how
7 minutes
He didn’t like the hook to All of the Lights? That shit is legendary
Anthony Fantano: 10/28/1985-11/22/2020<br>Death cause: MBDTF 10th anniversary
this rating was a bigger tragedy than when united airlines flight 175 hit the north tower
The 10th anniversary of this album is going to destroy Melon&#39;s social media
This review would later inspire the opening track on ye
MBDTF: 6/10 too much water.
his first vid of 2020 should just be a redux review and giving it a not good
When lil pump gets a better score
Boooo!
Back when Melon didn&#39;t do meths. Just look how clean he looks.
This didn’t age well
6/10 seriously? cmon now
SHUT THE FUCKING FUCK UP MELON YOU GODDAMN HAIRLESS BITCH.
Just here after pitchfork’s top 200 albums of the decade to remind you you’re wrong and everyone thinks you’re wrong
Wasnt his best album
I can see President Trump using this video as leverage during the 2020 elections!
Imagine a Lil Pump album getting a better score than MBDTF<br><br>Silly Melon
Graduation &gt; mbdtf
To put this in perspective, 1000 gecs got a 7
No
Can you review My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy by Kanye West?
Shut up melon
Wow.... This is probably the only review I strongly disagree with you with.
Melon reviewed it like it was 7 or an 8 and gave it a 6 lmao
imma just do it before you guys do, ArE yoU heRE aFtER LiStENiNG tO JeSuS iS KiiiiiNG?
This review is just complete bullshit. MBDTF is a masterpiece honestly fuck you.
Man there were many hoes mad in 2010.
who&#39;s here for the new ar tv video?
Fuck you melon
you better atleast like So Appalled and Devil in a New Dress
Off the goop
Why do I keep on coming back to this video?
“By the power of christ I condemn you!”
to put this into perspective, he gave To Pimp a Butterfly a 10/10
It it currently september 23 2019. I hope jesus is king comes out
How did you not even say anything about Runaway except how long it is.
Only person who agrees with me and for the same reasons
As much as I respect this review I gotta dislike button it for the culture
Here before Jesus is King makes Fantano see the face of god and return to this review with opened eyes
Yo fuck this guy and his garbage flip flop opinions. Serious human garbage with terrible musical opinions
Just dropping in 9 years later to say this review is a travesty
I only know this Video because of Guitar Hero
how
I didn&#39;t like how he rated the album 0/10 at the end with the only reason given, was that Kayne is black. Otherwise great video.
about once a day i create a new account only to downvote this video. Ive been doing this since about 2012,  that means that I account for 2555 downvotes on this video,  or about 10%.
An uneducated response filled with hate towards a man just because of his race. Mindless and blant racism and no arguments or facts whatsoever. Absolute worst interview ever. Subscribed.
So apparently not liking some of the hooks and &quot;ThE SoNgS ArE tOo LoNg&quot; bumps it down to a 6?<br><br><br>What the fuck melon
Coming from someone who isn’t even a big Kanye fan. It’s wild that this didn’t at least get a light 8. <br>To me this is a 9.5/10 easily.
can we just say after 8 years he looks and sounds the same
Biggest upset in Music Review History
2019: Gives an 8 to Lana Del Rey
It’s crazy to think that Melon was only 12 years old when he made this video
This is perhaps the most famous music review of all time
Runaway is a very human song, i see why you didn&#39;t like it since your a melon.
okay
How has this melon literally not changed at all in 10 years
To put this in perspective: DAMN. got a 7/10
How did this vegan soyboy even get a career badly reviewing albums?
Shouldn&#39;t this crime footage be on Liveleak? This is absolutely terrifying.
came here because of the new tool album review great job bud :] &lt;--  &lt;-- smiley face, knife,  knife emoji!!
You&#39;re still bald and wrong you fuck
whos here after the tool review?
This is the same guy who give die lit 7.
Only a kanye fanbase can get so mad over a flipping 6. A 6 means he enjoyed it, chill
You fucking suck this was a 10 and everyone knows it this album is iconic and revolutionary for the time.
If you keep track of all the times Melon turns his head, you can decode it into Morse code and it reads, <br><br>“I’m being held at gunpoint and am forced to give this opinion. This album is actually a 3”
if you dont listen to the full <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo4S2qlQGs0&amp;t=552">9:12</a> minutes of Runaway ur gay
Was this shot on a VHS camcorder?
Just watched the melon’s Ye review and heard him reference all the hate he got on this review, so I’m just here to add a dislike.
every single fantano video/social media comment sections have one reminder of this sinful review
ah yes, dislike video
He gave the the same rating for Cardi b
Yout righttt
def was a very easy album ..arguably th easiest when u realize he aint write or produce shit on here
I didn&#39;t listen to the entire album until yesterday so I came here to watch the review and this video has 3X more dislikes than likes 😂😂
Just made my fifth alt account  just to dislike this again
I thought he would change the score for some reason
Okay Anthony but saying you&#39;d literally rather listen to the sound of a garbage truck is a bit offensive
i wonder if the melon comes back to the crime scene
Your mic is 1/10
Re-do this review and give it an even lower score.
I can&#39;t believe he re-reviewed this and gave it a 10/10. Unbelievable.
The infamous review. Melon’s defining moment.
Still blows my mind to this day, personal favourite hip hop album of all time
I don&#39;t get what&#39;s wrong with the hooks. I really tried to understand his points but all of the lights has really one of the best hooks an hell of a life is literally a Black Sabbath hook
&quot;I may say something that&#39;s gonna warrant a bunch of angry comments&quot;
Why does this abomination keep popping in my recommended feed?
He talked about it like it is a strong 8, but gave it a 6.
this didnt age well
To put this into perspective, Melon gave the Steven Universe soundtrack a 193/10
melon, i’m glad you came back to change your opinion on a tomato being a vegetable
I’m only subbed to you because of the comment section.<br><br><br>Unsubbed
Why are his opinions given the time of day lmao
Silly Melon you wrote 10 in a cryptic ancient language that looks like a 6
I can&#39;t believe this is the same man who rated The Big Day as his first 11/10 for pure lyrical ability.
Here&#39;s a proof of how shity his taste is <br>Kanye is a fucking legend bitch
Worst review of all time
This album had some great songs like Gorgeous, All of the Lights, and Power. The other songs fucking suck though.
you are wrong
bruh moment
Redux review but you give it a &quot;NOT GOOD&quot;
YO MELON. WTF
Ahh yes an infamous review
Is there a way I can dislike this video more than once?
I came back to check if this still had a 6/10
Great production, clever sampling and lyrics.<br>Melon: Yea but Gucci Gang tho
Don’t worry ye, I come from 2019 and you got yourself a 10 last year
Girlfriend: Does smoking cause birth defects?<br>Me: shows her this video
The market has spoken
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo4S2qlQGs0&amp;t=1">0:01</a> Anthony visiting the tree he&#39;s gonna hang himself on after this review
Kanye poured his heart and fucking soul into this album. The fact that this got a 6 and House of Balloons got a 3 makes me unable to take any of his other reviews seriously...
If the album came out on November 22, how did Melon review it on the 16th? HMMmmmm
wtf does he keep looking at
Your lost in the world!!
you’re one stupid fuck
okay melon you didnt need to knock 4 points because you said kanye is the n word
the entire review makes you think itll be a 7-9
agreed
To put into perspective he gave Cal Chuchesta a 1753/10
Review it again and give it a 4.
Holy, the dislikes.
My Ugly Twisted Review
This man baby rlly gave Kanye&#39;s best album a 6
And he goes and gives kids see ghosts a 10
I hate you
This album is an 11 out of ten mate
I give this reveiw a light six
Almost 9 years later and this review is still total bullshit.
Dont trust a melon
Yes take context into consideration its what made the album so great
Why the video looks like it’s shooting in 1999
dude its a 7/10 just for that appalled beat alone
this has 24k dislikes
To this day I believe that Melon will do a redux review of MBDTF and release on the 10th anniversary of this video. <br>Will still give it a 6/10 tho.
1/10. That&#39;s my review of this review
Some good songs, but most of this album was a mess. Very good review.
2019
Kanye&#39;s politics changed. Melon wants to kiss his ass now.
Bro u posted cringe
Good review Anthony, but please just review IGOR already
Shut up you fucking melon
I flagged this as hate speech
This was his best album no cap of really is a 10/10 imo
I’m glad you’ve kept your hair melon.
This is his 808&#39;s
Bruh I can&#39;t believe that this man just gave one of the best albums of all time a 6. You have to appreciate Melons boldness
Uh oh, this infamous review decided to pop up in my recommended again.
I gEt BoReD wItH RuNaWaY
Let&#39;s not forget that it made it to the best albums of 2010 list as number 41
EHHHHHHHHHHH SHOOT THE MELONS OUT
Never make an album about yourself with a view corny hooks or you might end up with a melon doing a headstand while writing down a score
It messes with me that this video feels ancient but mbdtf hasn’t aged at all
One of the greatest albums of all time
Dumbass
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo4S2qlQGs0&amp;t=4">0:04</a> - Top 10 photos/videos taken before diaster.<br><br>#1:
Welcome to &quot;i like it so everyone that no give this album at least 10 have a bad music taste and must die&quot;
More overrated album ever.
Looking back, it’s obvious that melon only gave mbdtf a 6 due to kanye being an African American
While this video is embarrassing for Anthony, at least he’s aware of his goof and has definitely improved
I didn’t even know melon was making videos this long ago
This was literally one of his best albums bruh what u even talking about. It&#39;s been a while so ur opinion might have changed
In your words...you should have given MBDTF a 7
6 IS A POSITIVE REVIEW GUYS
Hey melon, <br>great review of this album I totally agree with it, I’m suing you, expect to see the letter in your mail in the next 2-4 business days <br>Kind Regards, <br>Dan
Wow melon, loved the review but did you really have to give MBDTF a 6?
Lil Nas X’s new EP and My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy both received a 6... i don’t have to say anything else
don&#39;t let this distract you from the fact that NAV got 2 not goods, and still hasn&#39;t had anything bad happen to him
Li nas x EP got a 6.
single handedly fucked all your credibility
6 but the death grips and swans get a 10......
remember he his speaking himself
This is so old wut
The amount of pissed off fanboys getting mad over a SUBJECTIVE REVIEW is goddamn hilarious, &quot;hOw DArE yOU gIVE A 6 tO sOMEthInG tHaT iS poPUlaR&quot; holy fuck people, learn to shut the fuck up.
Im so appalled that this melon gave it a 6/10
to put this into perspective, just remember that this is the same guy who reviewed my beautiful dark twisted fantasy by Kanye West
I actually agree with this
L
monster is the best track no cap
imagine if he were to do a redux review of this, only to give it a 4/10
Still the most blasphemous video on YouTube
you gave lil pump a 7
Poor Fantano. So lost in time. Imagine being so ignorant of your wrongs that he even won&#39;t apology. Shame on you, Anthony Fantano, you bald fraud.
I will never ever let you live this down down down
Same melon that gave lil pump a 7
oof that like-to-dislike ratio tho
I just hold my phone upside down during the entire review.
To put this in perspective this is the same guy who gave kawaii fart Nightcore remix a 9
“yeah so basically the album is amazing except for a few minor flaws. 6/10.”
Don’t you think a 3 is a little bit of a stretch melon?
do you give bad reviews sometimes on purpose?
This is the same guy who gave Kids See Ghosts a 6/10
!!!!!!!!!! BEST KANYE ALBUMMM
<b>THE INFANTANOMOUS</b>
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo4S2qlQGs0&amp;t=330">5:30</a> is where every video will be measured from here on out <br>By the way Igor received a 9 for the same reasons you blow balled MDTF
Basically gave it a 6 because it is on too much on a personal level with Kanye but you gave have YE a 8/10. YE is Kanyes most personal album
Guys if we round 6 up we get a 10 <br>So MBDTF is a 10/10
Lil Pump - 7/10<br>Thank U, Next - 8/10<br>Lil Yatchy - 7/10<br>MBDTF - 6/10<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>S E E M S  A B O U T  R I G H T
this is a solo reason why this fucker right here knows nothing about music
Isnt this just a guitar hero stage?
Yooo 22K dislikes 😂

I can see why you made an album called “Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind”
The day Fantano became the Armond White of music
Tfw when Runaway isnt one of Melon’s favorite songs on a 6/10 album
Tha FUCKKKKKKK!
bad review, you went out and had a 3/17 shooting performance in a big game. Its fine champ, youll live on to play another game. But god damn you turned the ball over alot on this review. L
MBDTF has aged better than this review
A light 6 is basically a medium 6 which is basically a high 6 which is basically a 7 which is pretty much an 8 which is pretty much a 9 which is literally a 10. <br><br>MBDTF 10/10
Bro I just want Yandhi
This video just makes me mad all over again
fuck you fantano, this review is garbaaaaaaage
Foh.
Coward
Is this a parody?
How the hell does this not have a million views yet?
This is the worst review I have ever watched 17 times

This is the worst review off all time. Dark Twisted Fantasy is one of the best albums of all time.
dumb wacky dumb baby boy cry hip hop album classic
L
lil boat and lil pump got a 7
This man&#39;s said it was in his opinion and people still assholes
I understand that he didn&#39;t love this album all the way but he didn&#39;t have to say that north koreans deserve they&#39;re leader..
Why is everyone saying this was a bad review?
tuurrrasshhh
Quite fair review, though some of the justification for the score was a tad confusing.
I&#39;m not someone who comes here to shit on the fact of the score, but I do think the score is important. I don&#39;t like that the rest of the review doesn&#39;t correlate with the score. You can say you don&#39;t care about an artists personal life, but you should take it into consideration with how well it&#39;s blended into the music or not. I get that to Fantano this album is a 6 by Kanye&#39;s standards but I really disagree. When you look at how it restarted his career in the public&#39;s eye&#39;s, it&#39;s gone down as one of the most important hip hop/ musical albums of all time - it&#39;s just confusing as hell to hold it in such low regard. All of these points I&#39;ve mentioned about how the public views the album and what it did for his career are points Fantano has acknowledged. It just doesn&#39;t make sense to me and a lot of other fans.<br><br>I love ya Ant Knee, I don&#39;t think you should get as much shit for this review as you get, but I do think I&#39;ve raised some points you should consider.
Just saw the video with DEHH, came back to make sure I left a dislike on this
Your op is shit your taste in music shit your channel is shit bro you don’t know shit about music your fuckkk you
To be fair, it’s actually not a bad review he just wasn’t interested in his personal life antics being the forefront lol still an extremely biased review Cos like he said it was creative and productions were tight.
This is up there with Pitchfork&#39;s review of Daft Punk - Discovery
When an admitted subjective opinion becomes interpreted by many as objectively wrong.
because of dead end hip-hop  I&#39;m back here again to say fuck you were wrong
Fuck you for this review dude
First
After watching Melon&#39;s content since 2012 I have decided to finally give this a watch. Melon, I agree. Thumbs up from me!
DEHH is right. After watching this review how can you be mad at it? You can definitely be confused because he seemed to dislike a small part of the album while giving it a 6. I think people were just caught up on the number instead of the review
It&#39;s a 6 because the hooks weren&#39;t that great and he didn&#39;t like the lyrical content, which are pretty essential things to consider when listening to rap. Also the comparisons to Lil Pump and Lil Yachty getting 7s are irrelevant because they have different rating criteria than people like Kanye and Jay-Z
Who&#39;s here again after Dead End hip hop reviewed this video?
Who&#39;s here after the Dead End guest video
Here from all the recent MBDTF collab videos he posted this week. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23mbdtfweek">#MBDTFWeek</a>
Honestly i’d give it a 6 too lol
This review is fucking ridiculous
This was a great first episode of “not good”
<b>Jay-Z voice</b> Fanteezy, you crazy for this one!!
Anthony Fantano, the real mad titan.
&quot;Fantano, I don&#39;t understand how you said all of these really intelligent and positive things and gave it a 6&quot; I&#39;m angry.
delete this nephew
Im here because of fantanos new vid
MY TEENAGE ANGST
Why is this so disliked
Posting a lot of MBDTF content this week, redux coming???!!
I&#39;m giving a sympathy like because that ratio is ridiculous

“Kanye&#39;s fifth studio album is easily his most ambitious effort yet. The production is extremely stunning. 6/10” - Anthony Fantano, 2010
(…)
worst thing Melon has ever said
&quot;I&#39;m going to say something that may spark a lot of angry comments&quot;<br><br>Sums up this review
The ending of the album gave me chills. Lost in the world and Who Will Survive in America?
What&#39;s going on? Big guy.
other than power and monster its a pretty average album
It’s kinda shocking to see a fantano review with an insane like dislike ratio
what a loser
why so many dislikes
TLOP &gt; MBDTF
YO NO LE DOY NI UN 6 A ESTE REVIEW.
what a confusing melon
My biggest problem with this review is that if you watch the video up until he gives the score, it sounds like he would give it an 8/10. Even in the description he says that he loves a lot of this album and that he only has one problem with this album. Usually when an album only has one problem, it is a 9/10. The issue with this review is that melon does a bad job actually reviewing the album to back up why he gave this album a 6/10.
And he gave die lit a 7 wtf this shit is a 10
He said that Hell of a Life is the kind of song that you can find on any other rap album. You see kids, this is why you don&#39;t get high before a review.
A 6, jesus christ.
it’s been 8 years and it’s still your worst review ever
This Guy is the Most Stupid n Ridiculous i Ever Seen,<br>He Critices Music on the Internet without Creating Anything Himself,<br>Talks Like He Really Know Stuff about Music,<br>The Only Way to Really Know Things about Music,<br>is When YOU Are Creating Your Own Kinda Music, <br>Not by Just Listening,<br>This Guy is Waisting Time n Energy,<br>Waisting His Soul.....<br>I Feel Sorry for Him...<br>He Thinks He&#39;s Sooo Great n Intelligent......<br>How More Lost Can u Be???....
You have valid criticism, but how do your 2 small points take off 4 points total
What is wrong with you? This is arguable one of his best albums
Ik we have our own opinions, but ye got a higher rating
Music is stunning. The production is amazing. I don’t care I give it a 6
Never liked him and that’s not just because of this review
your opinion is wrong
what he says in the review isn&#39;t even that bad. y&#39;all just sensitive
The first half in incredible, it kind of trails off after that, but ends on a high note with See Me Now. Honestly, I mostly agree with Anthony here
L for u
death gripes
This album deserves a 4
I am unsubscribeing Sir😎
But for real tho how the fuck is this a 6 Antonio Fantonio?
Im mad
You gave MBDTF a 6 but gave MBDTF a 6
Thoughts and prayers for your ear disease
We meet again
i never watched a single video of this dude i only came here to see how wrong his opinion is and dislike
I didn’t actually watch it, I just came to give it a thumbs down
The same guy who gave lil pumps album a 7
Ol Brad Hall head ass
6 is way too high
Dis negga STILL LOOKS THE EXACT SAME
Got a YNW Melly type beat vibe outta this
Melonhead on drugs
this is why melon shouldn&#39;t have political views smh
shame shame shame
Ah. The infamous 6/10 mbdtf video....<br><br>Edit:<br>So let me get this straight. You spend a total of 6 minutes praising the album then just because of a a few longer tracks and him talking about his personal life on them , you decide to give it a 6????? The way you talked about it for the first 4 minutes and 40 seconds that looked like a solid 9. Wtf?
It&#39;s ONE GUY&#39;S opinion. There are probably sooo many people out there that think the same way Fantano does. Accept it and move on with your life.
We won&#39;t forget.
To this day this is still fucked up
U can’t analyze this album u just feel it
I wonder if people even listened to what he said before he disliked.. He had some actually good reasons for why he didn&#39;t like some songs and he said it was still a great album soo..
WHATTHEFUCK
A light 6???? This man&#39;s crazy
lmao, jfc 20k dislikes!
I actually agree with everything he said in the review but I&#39;d give the album at least a strong 7 and add some other favourites
Lil pump got a 7
I still disagree with you Anthony, but I love you so it’s all good 🤜🏻🤛🏿
One of his best reviews ever. Agree with most what he says, except the production. Not the biggest fan of it
this isn&#39;t even that negative, what a bunch of crybabies
Can anyone tell me the song/sample at the end of those review?
The first true bruh moment.
WE STILL REMEMBER ANTHONY
“My opinion”
<b>a much simpler time</b>
God, his videos used to be way more enjoyable back then because he didn’t force his cringy ass humour in the video.
I wish he would have made this one of the reviews where he put no rating. Such a positive review destroyed by a completely different number. If you were to just hear what he’s saying, it easily sounds like he’s talking about an 8 or a 9.
Headass
You’re irrelevant
Why does this guy not look any different 9 years later
Worst review of all time? Worst review of all time.
Dislik
To put it into perspective yeezus got a 5
So i guess that&#39;s a no on having an opinion
&quot;im not gonna lie, they had us in the first half&quot;
Rabid Kanye fans can&#39;t take the truth.  Kanye&#39;s overrated in general.  This album was nothing special.
This shows that many people can hold grudges for years and not move on<br>It&#39;s his opinion and if you think it&#39;s a shit opinion, thats just an opinion of an opinion
Jason Molina &gt; Banjokazooie
This comment section has me dead
look at all these kanye fanboys triggered for a score. btw i agree with this one
Bullshit Anthony 10/10
This is Kanyes best album. This album was actually named one of the greatest albums of all time by several organizations. It&#39;s the 62nd most critically acclaimed album of all time. And it was named album of the year in 2010. This album was also included in the book &quot;1001 albums you must hear before you die&quot;. I personally believe this is the illmatic of this generation.
Silly Melon! You wrote the 9 upside down!
I had no idea that this album was dropped back in 2010 holy fucking shit also what blows my mind is that theneedledrop was around in 2010.
I wonder if he’d review this again! 🤔
6.9k likes
this album sucks
a decent 8 from me<br>together with kids see ghosts, this is my favorite project of Kanye
The vocabulary doesn&#39;t match the final rating at all.
Lil Pump: 7<br>Lil Yachty: 7<br>MBDTF: 6<br>Hmmmmmmmmm
First L for melon
we still hate you for this
I wonder what your opinion on this album is today in retrospect.
Has he done saint Pablo?
Ok…so… Melon gave Lil Pumps mixtape a 7… think about that 🤡😳
I mean, he’s right, the album isn’t even really that good
Don’t ever forget this man gave this album a 6/10.....an album that could quite possibly end up as a top 10 album in human history let alone just rap
Almost nine years of dog shit, who’s watching in 2019
Anthony your opinion sucks
oof it hurts me every time this pops up
kanye fans are the some of the most idiotic people on the planet
This aged surprisingly well!
A 6? Has he lost his mind? This is definitely a 10/10 🎼
This is by far the scariest video known to man
U wrote 10/6 wrong
I don&#39;t even know how he recovered from this
Jeez this isn&#39;t even a bad review. People pay too much attention to the rating.
Ahh here I come again to see the Fantank&#39;s wrongest review
LET&#39;S ARGUE: 6 is a positive review
niggaewe<br>&#39;<br>\\\\
YO BITCH U WRONG.
A “LIGHT DECENT” SIX?!?!?!?!?
A notorious moment in music review history.
Dude chill with the n-bombs just review the music smh
but thank u, next an 8?
fuk u
I give this review a 1
LOL seriously that was the most infamous review on this channel?? Die hard kanye fans are so stupid
wait... wasn&#39;t him the one that said that this album is the second best album from Kanye, on his Worst to Best ranking?
I can&#39;t even believe that his career continued after this rating
to put this in perspective<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>thank u next got an 8
melon: the rhyming is great, the production is fantastic, everything else is really good, i just don&#39;t like some of the hooks<br>also melon: 6/10
The day it all began
Do a redux on this
Sixthony Sixtano
what the fuck happened here
His mic sounds horrible
Its been almost 9 years and we still hate you for this Anthony
9 years later and I can’t get over this review. Still feel hurt and betrayed by the melon.
If you &quot;enjoyed a lot of this album&quot; you would not have given it a 6/10.
this was a wild ass ride.<br><br><br><br><br>FAV. TRACKS - GOREGOUS, POWER, SO APPALLED, RUNAWAY, BLAME GAME. (if i had to pick 5.)<br>LEAST FAV. TRACK - HELL OF A LIFE.<br><br>KANYE WEST - MY BEAUTIFUL DARK TWISTED FANTASY / 2010 / GOOD MUSIC / KANYE WEST MUSIC, EXPERIMENTAL HIP HOP.<br><br>9/10.
It’s about his like ability scale. If he doesn’t give that much of a fuck about Kanye’s life then he doesn’t like the album that much. It’s not saying at a professional level this album is a 6.
YOU STUPID FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT
Wow just saw this for the first time today. Giving this a 6/10 is just....hilarious. Kudos to melon for not deleting this and pretending it never happened.
why is this dude (look at this dude) rating kanye west music
this 6, the overhyped to pimp a butterfly 10, LOL
Holy shit more than 8 years
I’m dropping an agreement here almost 9 years later because this album is the most overrated album ever easily. This whole album feels like a massive excuse for Kanye’s character flaws to me and yeah its hard to listen to front to back. It’s kind of fucking boring.
I only disliked this because I love the memes surrounding this review.
Anthony didn&#39;t put &quot;yall know this is my opinion right&quot; in the description, therefore I take this video as a fact, a very wrong fact
Hahaha
Kanye west does not care about melon people
8 years later and there still haven’t been a been album out yet.
He should do a redux on it&#39;s 10th year mark
Die lit got 7/10
I don&#39;t know how I ended up here but there&#39;s no f way I&#39;m listening to a white boy grade hip hop bye😭
Well, we found it, the one that will never leave you
I agree
so much hate for this video. you got booiiiiiiiiii, dont listen to this BULLSHIT
Every now and then I look back at this review like that 6 is just going to magically change
The dark knight of music
How are you gonna do this to my favorite album
is that joji vlogs?
You look so dumb rn. Love you.
This comment section is, and will seemingly always be a complete dumpster fire of whiny manchildren.
It&#39;s 2019 and this is Fantano&#39;s worst review yet.
ban this kid from hip hop
On April 1st you should review the album again and it’s give it a 10/10.
U don’t know shit
this is better than ksg
anyone confused how this was uploaded 4 days before the album dropped????
watching this now after watching your review to Ye honestly makes no sense to me, since you gave this such a low score due to all the drama and details about his personal life that you &quot;don&#39;t care about&quot; but Ye is even more personal and dishes out even more details about an even more problematic existence but now you enjoy it? so you still wouldn&#39;t give this a re-review with a higher score now? &#39;cause I feel like it&#39;s you who&#39;s changed, not the Kanye that Kanye raps about in his songs.
This guy also gave ‘Damn’ a 7.
Great, witty, memorable lyrics<br>Production is grade A with Kanye perfectly displaying his sampling talents<br>Stripped down and simple at times, but grandiose at others, both done immaculately<br>cohesive flow from song to song<br>Features are very well used<br><br>The hooks are sometimes generic and I don&#39;t care about Kanye that much so lets give it a light 6<br><br>-seems like Fantano just had a stick up his ass on this one. Missing the old Kanye?
are you implying powerslave it shit?
This album will age like the Beatles have. Lets be real
Closing in on a 10 year anniversary!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo4S2qlQGs0&amp;t=390">6:30</a> is the moment where you put the &quot;We&#39;ll Be Right Back&quot; font and tune.
This is my favorite album and I’m not sure why but all the songs appeal to me very well and I love it but every one has there opinions
Am I alone in pretty much agreeing with everything he said. The score is definetly lower than I&#39;d rate or would&#39;ve expected from that generally positive review but I almost entirely share his opinions here.
Made a new gmail account and first thing I did was come dislike this.
This video will serve as political propaganda against Kanye in 2020<br><br>Edit: As will the Redux Review.
fucking goddamn melon
What a garbage review, this clearly deserves a 0
Acai and Clone Hero brought me back
This review is Anthony’s equivalent of the racist Disney cartoons
Almost ten years later<br>Why is this still up
damn how are you gonna give a positive critique and then say im feeling a 6 on this one smh
Worst review of all time #2019
Ok, so I rewatched this video and it&#39;s legitimately underwhelming. But granted, I forgive him because he has improved his reviewing style greatly in the eight years since this review came out. I would love Fantano to re-review this album and give it the same score unless he changes his mind which probably won&#39;t happen, but I want him to better defend his points with a more thought-out argument and a deeper understanding of what went wrong with the album. He has stated that his overall opinions have stayed the same, but he didn&#39;t really present strong opinions to begin with. Re-review it not because you&#39;re review is wrong, but because you can better defend yourself now.
Wrongthany Wrongtano
people hating on this review need to remember that he knows that the album is very good, he just lacks the interest to really relate or care about the album which is really understandable to be fair, still deserves a 10 tho js
Dw it’s a nine for us in Australia
This shit is legendary
&gt;doesn&#39;t like runaway <br>cringe
I love MBDTF, but this review is tame and you&#39;re all fucking stupid. A 6 is a good score.

This is funny because he&#39;s white and thinks he has a say in what is good and what isn&#39;t 😂😂😂

BULLSHIT
I feel the 17k people who disliked this video should kill the 6k who liked this video at a battlefield.
I come back to this every few months to remind me that no one is perfect
It&#39;s like you&#39;re all deliberately ignoring the fact that he said it&#39;s His opinion
HES RIGHT
a truly legendary blemish on the career of anthony fantano
Gave this a 6/10 for all the wrong reasons. The album doesn&#39;t hold up and it&#39;s not that great but he didn&#39;t ever get to why. He basically praised it for 7 minutes but knocked it because he didn&#39;t like the context
10/10
Wrong :)
&quot;Least Favorite Opinion: &quot;My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy&quot;
Whenever I like an album that melon doesn&#39;t I remember this video and remember his opinion is invalid
L
Anthony you picky fucking bastard why isn’t this an 8+
it is so awesome to see how far your channel has come, keep up the awesome work!
Still blows my mind that people think 6 is a bad score
It’s funny how everyone hates him for this but any other review they don’t agree with him on they will forgive
Still confused
dummies can&#39;t handle that lil pump is way more influential and talented than kanye west. sit down you little ye babies, this album deserved an even lower score
bruhhh big L on this
Fantano back at it again with the VHS quality reviews
CAN WE RATE IT MUCH HIGHER?!
WRONG
I&#39;m gonna start with how Kanye is my favorite artist. I felt that his criticisms were realistic. The number is how much he enjoyed the album. He seemed to revere the production, rhymes, and flow. But, since he doesn&#39;t care for the drama he doesnt care for what most of the album is about. Idk why everybody is freaking out about this.
This was hyped up to be so much worse. great review Annie fantannie
OMG is that the same guy that gave 2pac <b>dEeAtH</b>
Kendrick Lamar has a annoying voice which ruined tpab
Delete this review Melon
I came here for the front yard intro
After 8 years This is still a very, very, very strange review 6? 6? 6?
He&#39;s not wrong tbh
Happy birthday to the worst album review of all time
The album is now 8 years old and it’s still a 10/10.
It&#39;s been 8 years melon<br>Fuck you
Best reviewer on YouTube with the worst review on YouTube happy birthday MBDTF

Good review, Melon. Disagree but you expressed  your viewpoint well.
If this is a 6, your teeth are a strong 3
This and a lot of his reviews on some mumble rappers are the only ones I disagree with<br><br><br><br>oh and .DAMN ofc
<b>contrived soicla drama</b> lol NOT ANYMORE!
Up until about 4 minutes in it sounded like an 8 or 9 at least
Crazy how this is still the worst review of all time.
When you didn’t mention ye singing a 3 minute, hypnotising, guitar sounding solo I pooped my pants
been about 8 years. still some bullshit.
i’m sorry but this review is still terrible. you’re still dumb as fuck
This is almost as bad as your score for Speedin Bullet 2 Heaven
I don&#39;t think this is a terrible review, but the main problem isn&#39;t the opinion, it&#39;s how short the video is. Fantano barely goes into any detail at all to explain how he arrives at a light 6.
Real ones like the video despite the controversial opinion because we appreciate Melon’s unfiltered thoughts
To put this in perspective: Cardi B&#39;s Invasion of Privacy got the same score
This like to dislike ratio is hilarious.
Fanthony Antano
Holy shit 16k dislikes
Lol get off your high horse bald guy. It&#39;s clear you&#39;ve got some beef with Kanye and that&#39;s alright but to give this album a 6/10 shows you have no fucking clue how to judge music.<br><br>Embarrassing.
Came back for the tree intro and stayed to get triggered again 6/10 my fucking ass lol you’ve come a long way melon
Big goof
I miss the old melon straight up autistic melon
I agree
10 without a chance
I agree with this review.
Watching this is like a fever dream a bad one
lmao
You aren&#39;t a real melon fan if you haven&#39;t disliked this video.
RIP Fantano
What an absurd review
Hold This L
He’s right you know
Anthony considers music and the context behind it, not just the music itself. That’s goody
this video has aged like a fine wine<br><br>it always is honestly kinda surreal for me to look THIS far back in youtube history, especially with someone i still watch to this day
this still one of the top 10 biggest L’s ever taken by a youtuber
hi I stopped by to remove my thumbs down just so I can thumbs down the video again. I&#39;ve been doing this every week since 2010<br><br>thanks
Honestly, the album is nice but so fucking overrated. Same as TPAB. I honestly don&#39;t think a 6 is a crazy score as the comment section tries to imply.
I haven&#39;t listened to this album, but if Fantano thinks it&#39;s a 6 it&#39;s probably not worth my time.
This review still pisses me off. Fantano basically says a bunch of great shit about it and the gives it a mediocre score because of the “dirty laundry.” It feels like the songs Kanye presents us with discuss incredibly personal issues with fame and how it is a toxic influence. Not exactly the first person to do it, nor would it be the last time he does it, but it is done well. <br><br>The thing that’s bothered me the most recently however is how Fantano changes his mind about the topics. All of a sudden Real Friends, Wolves, FML, All Mine, are personal tracks, even though they discuss similar issues regarding Kanye’s social life. Changing your opinion in regards to a topic is fine, and I would say encouraged, but his opinion remains inconsistent with MBDTF (and Yeezus to some degree). Fantano also says stuff that is inconsistent with his initial review of the album. Sure, it’s ok to change your mind, but Fantano says that his personal opinion hasn’t changed of the album, but then he sites the album “falling apart in the second half,” which is not something he mentioned in the first review. Hell, one of the fav tracks is the closer! He absolutely needs to revisit this album.
I love you melon but shit, an album with POWER can&#39;t get a 6, sorry my guy
HOW SWAY?
8 years later, still the biggest L Fantano took
This video SHAT ON FANTANOS CAREER
Fantano’s terrible dark disturbing nightmare
Oh melon
absolute mad lad
The amount of music knowledge you have = The amount of hair you got in your head
I like how he didn&#39;t even give it a negative number
CURSED VIDEO CURSED VIDEO
they wrong for this
The video quality looks like a direct-to-video VHS release
your quality really has gotten better in 8 years
never forget Lil Pump&#39;s self title EP got a 7
Some of you Melonheads are so harsh. Gee. Fantano said not all the hooks wholly interested or grabbed him, and some lyrics expect a certain level of engagement (which Anthony did not meet at the time) in Kanye&#39;s life OUTSIDE of the album. It&#39;s an honest and humble opinion. I don&#39;t feel the same way, but I understand Anthony&#39;s perspective.
I literally came here for the meme
No more melon for me, yeezy and religion is all I need
You are sooo cute.
15k downvotes
Don&#39;t let this distract you from the fact that this guy gave day before rodeo a 3/10
scarce?  the fuck?
HOLY FUCK THAT L/D RATIO :O<br><br><br>THIS IS SOME BAD SHIT
I agreed with almost everything fantano said and yet im feeling a strong 8 to a light 9. Like fantano there were a lot of songs on here i didnt care for, but the good stuff here is so good that i think it more than makes up for some of the way too long songs and not-so-interesting lyrics. This isnt an album that i listen to all the way through without skipping because of some of the weaker tracks, but it&#39;s still a classic. For me if this album was trimmed down a bit it would be a 10.
MAYJOR L OF A REVIEW 😂
“You have to be a Kanye fan to really get into this album I think”<br>Kanye fans: WTF NO YOU DONT, MBDTF TLOP 808s AND COLLEGE DROPOUT ARE ALL 10s AND YOURE AN IDIOT!!!
This video was published on my birthday. Worst birthday present ever.
alexa this is disgusting play gucci gang
I know im late, but just think about him giving Lil boat a 7, and he gave this a 6.......
A SIX?? Because of the HOOK ON SO APPALLED???!!! What a maroon
turn that 6 upside down...and then add like 100 zeros behind it
I come back to this once a year to remind myself melons can have brain farts too
Runaway not being in your fav tracks just shows how stupid this review is melon
I cream myself at the first two beats
Pathetic
Made me wonder if anyone ever finished this video before disliking it and make a triggered ass comment
what a trash ass video
This album a straight 10 don’t @ me
i still hate this video
This is why I&#39;m not the biggest fan of numerical ratings. Everything he actually said was disregarded by everyone because of a number. The review itself is perfectly fine. <br><br>Good example as to why I rarely give things a numerical rating now, in any medium.
the fact that this bitch melon said LIGHT to decent 6
DAMN 14K DISLIKES
I&#39;m here to check if he finally changed his opinion. Nope...
No one melon should have all that power
This album sucks dick.
Well u hate mbdtf,recovery,1989 what&#39;s next?you&#39;ll give revival 2/10??!!!pffft
I said to myself this is such an iconic review to not dislike be4 watching
retro gamer
best ever hiphop album and i dislike Kanye. what a review
came here after the swimming review
Even if you think this album is perfect, this is a great review as long as you stop watching right at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo4S2qlQGs0&amp;t=382">6:22</a>
See, this is just where personal taste comes into play, I think. Kanye just dropped several bombshell albums in a very short timespan, and Melon was all over those, sucking Kanye&#39;s dingdong left and right. I agree they are great albums, but personally I enjoy MBDTF considerably more than I enjoyed Daytona or KSG. <br>That&#39;s not to say I don&#39;t see and appreciate the quality in those, but I have a much better time relistening this here album.<br>You&#39;re an odd fruit, Anny.<br><br>8/10 for me, Daytona and KSG were both 7/10 in my book. I agree with him on Nasir though.
One of the biggest fuck ups in history occurred here.
News flash you&#39;re opinion is wrong pal hehe
I&#39;m still upset.
Anthony, I love your thoughts and feelings on music, but I think we whole-heartedly disagree on this one.  You&#39;ve mentioned that you think this album falls apart in the second half, and I feel the exact opposite. From a &#39;Devil in a New Dress&#39; on, this album starts to spiral into a sad, depressing, but emotionally powerful set of tracks that ends with &#39;Lost in the World&#39; to sum it up.  The first part of the album is Kanye&#39;s ego in full swing all the way up to &#39;Monster&#39;, with &#39;So Appalled&#39; being like a neutral break in my opinion. Then, the second half of the album is Kanye&#39;s ego imploding on itself, expressed loudly in &#39;Runaway&#39;, and sadly in &#39;Blame Game&#39;, with the final track, &#39;Lost in the World&#39; being a reflection of self-awareness about this inevitable fall or ego crash that leads to a state of confusion or feeling &quot;lost in the world.&quot;  I think we can all relate to this album because we all, like Kanye, have egos, and experience the manic highs our egos bring, along with the inevitable lows that typically follow, making each of us feel lost in this world.  I think &#39;Hell of a Life&#39; is the weakest moment on this album, and I think this is when your brain started to feel that this album was getting worse in the second half. I think it&#39;s a track that represents the sick and twisted world that our minds live in when we fall into the dark place that this album makes us feel at times. It&#39;s like a diversion or an attempt to escape from this dark, twisted world, with the creeping and haunting awareness of itself lingering in the background.<br><br>I believe while this album&#39;s lyrics don&#39;t directly point to anything deep or poetic, the way Kanye sings or raps the words to these songs brings out a vibe that transcends the lyrics themselves.  I know where you&#39;re coming from when you feel that Kanye lost his lyrical touch or soulful way of making music from MBDTF through Pablo, but I think that Kanye is so true to himself, and where he is mentally and emotionally when making his albums, that MBDTF, Yeezus, and Pablo, honestly express his state of being in those time periods. Although these states may seem like &quot;lower&quot; states when you consider the mature lyrics Kanye raps on in his latest album &#39;ye,&#39; I don&#39;t think they are. I think they are representative of the &quot;states of being&quot; that the majority of us, perhaps even all, feel when experiencing the ups and downs of life.<br><br>I think Kanye has reached so many with his music in this time period because of this fact.  I think the courage and openness he brings when making music, is unapologetic and bare, and it makes many angry and uncomfortable to see someone expressing themselves so blatantly. But I think the awkward feelings arise because we all have similar feelings and thoughts, but don&#39;t have a platform or artistic medium to express them in, nor do many of us have the gumption to do so.<br><br>I love your videos, and actually love that we don&#39;t agree on everything.  Just because you don&#39;t feel the same way that I do about MBDTF or Yeezus, doesn&#39;t mean I think your opinion is void or null.  I respect it and get where your coming from with your opinions on this.  Maybe one day you&#39;ll be able to listen to this album and feel it the way me, and many others do, and understand why so many hold this album in such high regard and so close to their souls.
Yup, to enjoy music you seriously need to let it rot in the pile of Radio hits before you can really appreciate it. That&#39;s why nobody gave 80&#39;s music 10/10&#39;s when it came out in the 80&#39;s. You have to let it age, THEN appreciate it.
wtf
That aspect ratio is incredible
Holy Hell! Hello from 2018! I feel like I just went back in time. I had no idea this guy was an &quot;Og&quot; youtuber. Crazy to see him come so far!
I respect your opinion but you&#39;re wrong.
this is literally the worst video of the internet, I&#39;m aware this video is from the deep web
i think this is the best kanye album. almost every single guest verse is perfect, kanye’s underrated production shines, and his flow is amazing. Power, Runaway and Monster are one of the most iconic West songs ever. glad he strayed away from the sounds of 808s and Heartbreaks, which got a little bit irritating after a while (auto tune can only do so much.) 8.5/10
Lmao, he starts off so positive but we all know the blasphemy that will follow.
Omg I remember when I first found for your section 80 review and always ignored this one cause I already heard the album but yikes a 6/10 that’s insane
WOW REDO THIS PLEASE
I opened this review expecting he&#39;d give it a 10. Wtf
Lil Pump had a 7... this should be at least a 9.5
Update ---- He&#39;s currently on the Kanye Train now. 2018
I kinda agree with most of the things melon says and I give it a decent 7. I guess maybe Anthony puts more emphasis on lyrics in Kanye&#39;s music?
He gave this album 10/10 in a new cringe video. <i>Has he redeemed himself?</i>
Your biggest W
lil pumps album got a 7....
Nicki Minaj&#39;s feature in Monster was FIIIREE. It was just bursting with personality and interesting flow, I liked it.
Man, I feel like y&#39;all didn&#39;t even watch the video. It&#39;s not like he ripped this album to shreds and called it terrible or anything. He actually complimented the album very heavily, but he didn&#39;t Kayne&#39;s personality in the album, which he said made him bored for some songs.
I finally decided to watch this review through and I&#39;m surprised you didn&#39;t give it at least a 7. Your were just talking about everything you liked about it and halfway through I&#39;m just sitting here like &quot;Well where are we going to go so wrong that it gets a 8 instead of like a 7 or an 8.&quot; So then I finally get to his gripes with the album and I&#39;m like &quot;Seriously, that&#39;s it?&quot; But if those are your only real critiques then it sounds like it should&#39;ve gotten like a decent to strong 7 or something.
How is devil in a new dress not in fav tracks what the actual fuck
[Everyone disliked that]
It&#39;s funny that he considers this album as &quot;Kanye being way too into himself&quot;.... if only he knew what would drop in the years to come 😂
This album is overrated as hell
“Im gonna say something that might spark many angry comments...”<br>U sure Melon?(:
HEY. MELON. 8 YEARS BEFORE. DELETE THIS
how does this guy still have a career after this
you are wrong.
Saying that Nicki Minaj made a decent contribution is pretty funny in hindsight, I&#39;d say her rap on Monster is THE most well-known feature on a track ever. His musical critiques are respected, his opinion, but saying that it is important to be invested in the drama is a little odd. I wasn&#39;t super into Kanye before MBDTF, but G.O.O.D. Fridays and the leadup to MBDTF <b>pulled</b> me into his world. The music was honestly a musical revelation, and the journey into his mind was so fun that I can still giddily listen to this album in 2018.
KanYEE
its a right of passage as a r/kanye user to dislike this video
Some like dislike ratio...
I come back every once in a while to check the score because I still can&#39;t believe Melon rated MBDTF a 6/10
This opinion is disturbing.
One of the only reviews I feel Melon got essentially wrong.
Fantano just signed someone’s MBDTF vinyl with 7/10 so it’s now canon that the score is now 7/10
Most controversial review in history of humankind
The Lil Pump self titled mixtape got 7....
KSG a 10 but MBDTF a 6?? Oooooook then
10 Videos Taken Moments Before Disaster
Who knew that 8 years later melon would give “Ye” a great score because of how personal it was
please do a video now that explains why KSG is 4 points better than this...I dare you
wtf haha
Melon didn&#39;t even put runaway as a fav track
holy shit
Cringe Melon Circa 2010
had to come back so I can get triggered
I&#39;m still mad
MBDTF got a 6<br>Speedin Bullet To Heaven got a 0<br><br>Kids See Ghosts got a 10.<br>Some come back.<br><br>P.S. This review still makes me mad. A 6 MELON?!?!
We forgive you now, melon
8 years and this meme is still being used.
I can forgive you after you gave KSG a 10
Criticizing the hook of all of the lights in any way breaks like at least 3 articles of the geneva convention, what an awful thing to do
Kids See Ghosts got a 10
Damn 7/10
came back over here after ye &amp; sheesh...
a light to decent 6 how dare you
You gave Kids See Ghosts a 10 but this got a 6...
This video is basically a meme at this point lmaooo
KIDS SEE GHOSTS GOT A 10 ESSSSSKEEEEEEETIIIIIIIIIIT
u trippin white boi
im so appalled
See this record deserved a 6/10 but there are a bunch of others which got higher scores than this but are worse. He didn&#39;t underrate this album, but rather he overrated a bunch of others.
wow... you actually suck a lot more than i thought you did....
Redo this shit right now Melon
&quot;Kanye made me like things i didnt like in the past... 6/10&quot;
the like-dislike ratio is legendary
I love this review because it makes me trust your opinions much much less
Ye got an 8 mbdtf got 6 dafaq
And Ye is a decent 8.
&quot;the position that im in, i dont care&quot;<br><br>ye Review strong 8
whos here after that ye review
Fantano does not age or what?
Anthony hasn&#39;t aged a bit. He literally looks the same 8 years later. It&#39;s almost like he&#39;s a robot
Is no one gonna listen to this man&#39;s points? Personally I thought the album was a 7 bordering on a 6 because of Nicki&#39;s feature on Monster being so bad.
Never forget
I hope you give YE a 6 too
Biggest misjudging you did
Exquisite review
8 years later this album is still amazing
Fantano overrated the &#39;winslow&#39; line, and underrated the album<br><br>Light 3 fantano, light 3
colin cowherd of music reviewers
Still watching this in 2018
I give it a zero
REDUX
Lil pump got a better score than this
Bruh this is at least a 9 not a 7
damn, son, dis old af
My Beautiful Dark Twisted Melon
When a 6 was a 10.
Imagine being this wrong lol
He started fucking up from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo4S2qlQGs0&amp;t=284">4:44</a> and jay-z made a whole album about it
6/10? he should delete this video to avoid such embarrassment
College dropout: 7.5<br>Late registration:7.5<br>graduation: 9.0<br>808s: 9.5<br>MBDTF :10.0<br>yeezus: 9.0<br>Pablo: 7.0
2018 still salty. Fucking masterpiece. Masterpiece. 2018, Fantano gotta be giving these new rappers 1s
Someone didn’t like something as much as me I’m gonna kill myself ): - this comment section
He should make a redux review of this and just repeat word for word everything said here
Keep in melon this is the mind that West Beautiful Kanye Fantasy! and Damn got Pump seven Lil?
Whenever I&#39;m mad about something , I come and watch this video and tell to myself &quot;My life may be shit now, but at least I didn&#39;t give MBDTF a 6&quot;
lil pump &gt; kanye
still right
Okay so beer bongs and Bentleys got a light 7 but this....... fucj fantano
I think this is a great album. I’m not disliking the video.
7 years still legendary bs
Hahaha 6 are u kidding me. U gave jay Z <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo4S2qlQGs0&amp;t=284">4:44</a>  8/10 .. lmfao 🤣
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo4S2qlQGs0&amp;t=387">6:27</a> History was made
We need a re-review
Lil pump self titled got a 7
why so many negatives? this wasnt terribly provocative.
Lil Pump got a 7
This hurts me on a metaphysical level
Why does he have such an old setup, bad camera for the year 2010? LOL This shit looks like 2002 recordiing.
Damn, if the present back then didn&#39;t prove Anthony wrong on this one, then history certainly has.
Ah the legendary My Beautiful Dark Twisthony Fantanosy
10/10
You’re fucking trash
I wanted to see why it’s so infamous. <br><br>Like holy shit, people aren’t fucking normal. Everything he says is perfectly legitimate and was backed up eloquently and with a lot of respect. Real ironic how people misunderstand everything while accuse him of “not getting it”. <br><br>And it looks like 7 years worth of “grow up” changed nothing. Holy shit. Lol.
He’s still right bitches.
so.... no respect for this guy right here. his opinions ceased to have any significance after this video
Honestly it is a 6/10 at best. Half of it I like, but the rest I could go without listening to ever again and not really care.
This review is fucking infamous now.
Almost eight years ago and you still hear about this. I’m glad.
smh watching this again years on still makes me mad * disses best rap album ever made *
12k dislikes. Jesus.
Just to put this into perspective he gave Lil Pamp a 7
Devil in a New Dress alone should have warranted this album a 6/10, the rest of the album is just icing on the cake
This video should be called &quot;How to Lose All Sense of Entitlement and Credibility in 7 Minutes&quot;
BOY!
This put redditors on suicide watch.
All I&#39;m saying is that if he didnt put a score on it and just had his criticisms, you guys wouldnt have freaked out about it as much.
the college dropout 9.5/10<br>late registration 8.5/10<br>graduation 9/10<br>808s 9/10<br>MBDTF-9/10<br>Yeezus 8/10<br>TLOP 6/10
Fuck this Album. not a classic
This launched Melon’s career
To think he put this album at #1 in his Kanye: Worst to Best..
&quot;this is just my opinion&quot; didn&#39;t apply in 2010
To put this into perspective, Lil Pump&#39;s Lil pump got a 12/10.
crack is wack ladies and gentleman , exhibit a is this guy
I came here cuz the comments on Lil Boat 2 (Which got a 7) said MBTF is worse than Lil Boat 2 and i couldn&#39;t believe it but i&#39;m here now and ....JESUS LMAOOO
He ranked Lil Yachty and Lil Pump higher
Lil Boat 2&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; MBDTF
infamous as shit
I agree with you here melon. I found the album underwhelming
7 1/2 years later and this review is still bullshit
I bet you feel stupid now
You all realize 6/10 is a good score, right? 6/10 means he likes it.
Man. I even love this album, but absolutely nothing he say&#39;s is even remotely incorrect.
Boi
You should have absolutely zero gripes my friend. This is pure platinum!  Love everything Kanye!
The review haunts melon to this day
Devil in a new dress best song don&#39;t QUESTION it
Still can&#39;t believe he gave this a 6. A FUCKING 6!?!? This is a 10/10
Nefew
Bro me looking through all these comments in pure shock people thought this album was good. What in the fuck is going on in here
Agreed shitty album
I give it a 7.5 outta 10
Anthony gave this a 6 and I respect that even though I think it&#39;s at least an 8. Stop getting on the bandwagon people, it&#39;s his opinion. Bon Iver is annoying btw, acting so cool that they are on a Kanye tape but I wish someone else replaced them.
8 years later and I still think that&#39;s bullshit! MBDTF is a Masterpiece!!!
Redux when
I personally love this album the most out of all of his work, but you&#39;ve presented your opinion and I respect it.
You look like you smell
A stain on the Fantano career
is anyone else getting the audio out of sync
blasphemic melon at work, this highkey made me not respect him as much as I used to
joke of a review - aged amazingly- this is laughable
lil pump got a 7.....
wait so what’s wrong with him admitting that the music is good but he isn’t interested in the topics/context of the song?
8 years and this shit still makes mad smh
This is Melob us still bald
LMAO MELON HEADASS
after 6 years this album is still praised and critically acclaimed meanwhile anthony is the biggest music reviewer on the planet. who&#39;s wrong ?
anthonys beautiful dark twisted history
Lil Pump got a light 7...
How the bottom of the description should look:<br><br>10/10<br><br>FAV TRACKS: DARK FANTASY, GORGEOUS, POWER, ALL OF THE LIGHTS, MONSTER, SO APPALLED, DEVIL IN A NEW DRESS, RUNAWAY, HELL OF A LIFE, BLAME GAME, LOST IN THE WORLD<br><br>LEAST FAV TRACKS: UHHHHH...WHO WILL SURVIVE IN AMERICA.... IF I HAD TO PICK ONE
Crazy how do you give this a 6
the score is too damn high
this has too be one of the most controversial album reviews of this generation. Surprised it has only half a million views.
BALD FUCKER
you&#39;re a fuckin six anthony
i come back to this vid everyday just to get mad at this 6/10
Conspiracy theorists argue that this was a publicity stunt by the melon, apparently, this bumps in his secret whip
He gave Lil Pump&#39;s album a higher score...
Anthony Fantanto doesn&#39;t care about black people
Re-review
When you gonna re review this album and give it a more legitimate score?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo4S2qlQGs0&amp;t=5">0:05</a> hey what’s up guys it’s scarce here
I stabbed my left nut with a filed down Barbie doll leg first time I saw this
hahah lotta kanye fans in these comments eyyy.
Forgot to dislike this morning
lil pump is better than this
This looks like it was found from a VHS or something
He gave Lil pump&#39;s album higher Lmao
You fucked up melon. You fucked up.
This is actually the greatest review on youtube ever
The legendary review. This shit happened back when I didn&#39;t even know this channel existed.
Most overrated album of all time
It floors me how people can be so upset with a 6/10. Odds are you don’t like everything that everyone else considers a masterpiece, this is Anthony’s. He’s not rude, he’s not vitriolic. Is the review dated? Yeah. Is he as thorough as he is nowadays? No. But that’s a given, critics get better the longer they hone their craft. But stop whining like this is some horrible personal offense. 6/10 is a positive review. Only internet comments would get angry about someone not being positive enough.
Legendary
I bet you&#39;re feeling pretty fucking stupid for this review after giving lil pump a 7
You&#39;re bad and your reviews are bad.
Kanye Fantasy only has 11 tracks on it <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23crackinthematrix">#crackinthematrix</a>
Light 6? Bruh if anyone still listens to your reviews after that they are mad. MBDTF is a solid 9 at worst. Get the fuck outa here you moby looking nerd
He&#39;s not wrong you know guys
2018
It’s at least a 9
I’m still mad about this
Just so you know, Lil pump got a 7.......
Imagine being this wrong
what&#39;s so great about the album?
I personally think this album is a 9, and while I feel like the score that he gave was too low for the gripes he had with the album, I feel like this review does still make a lot of valid points.
It’s been 7 yrs and this review is still wrong
i came here bc of anthonys twitter meme 2017-12-31
😤😤😤😤😤
I’m still mad
&quot;iM ThInKiNg A LiGhT tO DeCeNt SiX&quot;
Lil pump&gt;kanye West
Scores aside this is kind of just a bad review lol. He gives a critically acclaimed album an average score and then doesn’t really give a whole lot of justification for it. Most of what he says about it is pretty positive and then drops the score. Then the audience ends up just really confused about how he got there. He’s gotten much better at writing these since. Anyway I’m feeling a light to decent 6 on this video but that’s just my opinion, let me know what you guys think in the comments
The most legendary Shit review to ever be told in hiphop history.
This video has more than twice as many dislikes then likes
What I&#39;m wondering: how is Devil in a New Dress not a favorite track?
Fantano&#39;s greatest review, exposing Kanye stans as the worst hip hop fanbase after Eminem.
This remains the worst opinion of all time, congrats
I really like devil in a new dress...
wtf man. i hate u so much man. fuck u bro. this album deserves 8 or 9
The ONLY time I’ve ever disagreed with Anthony...
no
Top Ten Worst Things About MBDTF<br>10. The placement of So Appalled<br>9. The dreamy beat on Devil in a New Dress<br>8. The second Kanye verse on Blame Game<br>7. Who Will Survive in America<br>6. The AIDS line on Gorgeous <br>5. The Fergie feature on All of the Lights<br>4. The 3 min ending to Runaway<br>3. The Blame Game skit<br>2.  Almost everything about Hell of a Life<br>1. The Fanbase<br><br>Honorable mention: The tacked on ending of Dark Fantasy
Fuck youuuuuuuuu
He gave it a 6/10 which, according to HIMSELF, is a POSITIVE rating. Honestly, his &quot;fans&quot; suck.
Melon never ages☠
Dude you have a shitty taste in music
Oh boy...wait till 2016 and TLOP if you want to hear more about Kanye&#39;s fucked up life, Fantano.
Isnt the album his beautiful dark twisted fantasy?
Keep in mind this is the same guy that gave MBDTF a 7
Vintage Melon
Yung Melon
You should revisit this album
man fuck you melon
his opinion will always be worthless to me because of this review...actually though
So he gave this a 6 due to the content, but somehow gave Lil Pump a 7?...okay
Light 8/10
I didn&#39;t even know today was the 7-Year Anniversary, but today I just really wanted to wake up and watch this review
It&#39;s a tradition for me to come back every year for this video. Happy 7th anniversary you fucking melon
The day fantano died
xddddd
yu err gey
He was right you know
I love Anthony from this era. He&#39;s just so much more passionate in how he talks about music and it&#39;s adorable.
Every time I start to take the needle drops opinion seriously, I remember this video and just start busting out laughing
When he officially became a Melon
Tomorrow is the 7 year anniversary of this tragedy. I will never forget, and never forget
Damn, I love Kanye and all, but this fanbase is cringey as fuck. You guys do realize what an opinion is, right?
real ones watch 30 seconds in, read the description for the score, dislike then dip
Even after all these years, this review is Anthony&#39;s true masterpiece. Never will this comment section not make me laugh.
The best album ever hands down
The review sounded like he was going to give it an 8, but then gives it a 6 lol
A six was generous
Quite the radical reactions coming here in the comments. And it is a complicated matter; separating the art from the artist - because Kanye is a very special guy. And the drama that Fantano brings up is quite relevant as it directly impacts the music; f.ex. the quite nice track &quot;Blame Game&quot;, which CLEARLY samples Aphex Twin&#39;s &quot;April 14&quot;; yet Kanye refuses to acknowledge the sampling, even when he was confronted with it. It&#39;s extremely distasteful AND it impacts his musical presence, not just him as a person.
U my friend took an eternal L for this
Never was into hype on something, so  listening to this album 7 years after its release it gave me the chills. Also admitting, it sounds like Kanye has had a serious midlife crisis around that time. Kanye lost me mostly during his Stronger phase before. Mainstream music around that time was overall pretty bad. Especially in the condition where Hip Hop or Rap music was. This album really sounds memorable. Its something beyond. The production is almost timeless you could say. Here Kanye was ahead, videos still looking like they came out yesterday. Even Rihanna&#39;s singing i can enjoy in that one flashlights song, he made her voice blind in perfectly. And that means something, because her voice is possibly one of the worst things that could come near my ears. Maybe Kanye is controversial, but many artists/celebrities are.
I revisit this  video every year, to witness one of the greatest Ls ever taken
The intro reminds me of scarce
now your second worst review
This guy is a joke. Who can take his opinion seriously?
Y’all still mad lmao this is a great album but that’s it y’all act like it’s 12/10
He gave lil pump a 7 just let that sit in
He gave lil pumps mixtape a 7. Just let that sink in for a second
So many triggered hipsters in the comments
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo4S2qlQGs0&amp;t=141">2:21</a> is that you, fogel?
Lil Pump beats this
Sometimes I rewatch this review to remind myself that there&#39;s still evil in the world
Still want you to change it.
I really like Kanye but he didn&#39;t dropout of Harvard to save the rap game. That&#39;s why I think Lil Pump is better than the Beatles.
Lil pump got a 7 mbdtf got a 6....... WTF
This review might have been better received if he hadn&#39;t spent so little time talking about the negatives.
garbagethony opiniontano here
YOU GAVE LIL PUMP A 7
The fact MMLP2 got a better rating than this is a disgrace, and I&#39;m an Eminem fan
To put this in perspective. Lil yachty&#39;s Lil Boat got a 7
I agree with Anthony.
Who the fuck told him he could critique our art? Are you stupid or are you dumb?
This is why I know this square does not understand hiphop
Still really disagree with this review...
Real kniggas check the rating, drop a dislike, insult melon and dip
Never Forget.
Heard about this review. Had to see it to believe it. Hard to imagine he still feels this way 6 years later. What a misstep.
6!!! What?!?!!?!!
I don&#39;t think this is a bad review at all.
4/10
RE REVIEW THISS
Fuck you
The thing is the score. His thoughts were actually really positive. And very understandable and fair. His thoughts made it sound like a decent to strong 7.
phucin melon
fuck you fantano
1. Illmatic<br>2. Madvillainy <br>3. MBDTF <br>4. 36 Chambers<br>5. Ready To die
I did not like this album very much. I would give it a 6/10 or 5/10.
u suck!
Bruh
Oof
Super late but why is everyone so pissed about this video he gave it a 6 but praised the album for more than half the video. The reason it got a 6 is because he said he didn&#39;t care for Kanye concept for this album.
<b>Whenever I&#39;m happy I come back to this video so I can get pissed at this fucking potato head again</b>
Does anyone know the person on his shirt? I swear it&#39;s Patsy Cline.
darkthony fantansy
this album is like one of the most overrated records of all time. This album&#39;s start is fucking amazing, but the end is fucking boring. Come on, throw your little Ls at me- this album is mediocre.
I don&#39;t think he will ever live this down, down, down
Anthony always finds,always finds something wrong
He’s so wrong that Runaway isn’t even on his favourite tracks
he&#39;s talking about it like it&#39;s a light 8 not a light 6 lol
It&#39;s very obvious that the more context there is for an artist outside of the music, the more he dislikes an album.
meme
9K Complex hipsters disliked this video...
I wonder if Kanye has or ever would respond to this review.
You didn&#39;t even mention the fact that there&#39;s a 3 minute vocoder solo/outro? With a string section acting as a rhythm section? That&#39;s UNHEARD OF, not just for hip hop, but for all music. And that is not even a major part of the album. The details on this project are phenominally executed
the VHS quality make it looks like he is a time traveller
AYYYE WHAT THE FUCK<br>HOW DARE YOUR OPINION BE DIFFERENT THAN MINE?<br>JK BUT A 6? WTFFFFFFFF
He did not like So Appalled. HE DID NOT LIKE SO APPALLED.
is this the album review to end all album reviews?
Hi there! Subscriberthany Losstano here!
At what points does Kanye really go on about the details of his social life? He talks about himself on Power, sure, and I guess on Hell Of A Life, but in All Of The Lights he&#39;s playing a character and in Gorgeous he&#39;s mostly spitting social commentary. Then you&#39;ve got Blame Game and Runaway, which you could say detail his romantic problems, but that&#39;s just him telling stories and exploring themes, I don&#39;t think his approach to them is particularly self centred.
Copper cab brought me here
Hmm when I listen to the review now it sounds like a strong 7 to a light 8.
This review is the biggest sin to happen to mankind since Eve gave Adam the Apple.
The review sounded like he was going to give it a light 8 maybe.
wrong.
im angry
this album is 4/10 frankly
delete this shit
this fucking melon
Fuck you
This album is a masterpiece wtf
What a melon how dare he
When you realize some losers are legitimately mad he gave it a 6/10.
Six out of ten... Six out of ten!? SIX OUT OF TEN!?!??!?!?!?!
This is the worst video ever uploaded to YouTube
still pissed off 😲😲
WRONG! <br><br>ISSA 10
Apologize Melon
2017 and u still wrong nigga
you gave this the same score as mbdtf?!?!
This fucker said he gets bored with runaway🙃
Strong 6 for me. A little overrated album imo. With that being said I&#39;m not the idiot that would put Lil Boat over a Kanye record.
This album is one of the best ever, STFU
You&#39;d better re-review this album, melon...<br><br><br><br><br><br>And give it a 2. Because you Kanye fans are seriously irritating.
mrw runaway isnt on fav tracks
So surreal to see this now after your most recent reviews &amp; over the years. The vehement infamousness (dislike ratio) is hilarious to me<br>(I love the album but sheeeeeesh, get over it Yeezystans)
Cant believe DAMN got a lower review than this
7 years old, and yeah this album is not good
My beautiful OVERRATED twisted fantasy
so was this a good album and thats why people are mad?
This album deserves no better than 2. It&#39;s the product of a pop star that has become so deluded that he genuinely thinks he is an artist. Even when the best he can come up with is just backing tracks stolen from respectable artists and lyrics surrounding blatant simple-minded egotism. It&#39;s stolen music re-packaged like it is genius for idiots. There is nothing original, nothing provocative, nothing powerful. That is sonically, within songwriting or lyric writing. It just looks smart next to the hoards of shit that reside within hip-hop/rnb/trap/pop. At least that garbage presents itself as what it is. Kanye genuinely believes he is a genius because of the countlessly ignorant people that kiss his ass. The sad thing is his tricks have worked, people think this is a masterpiece. It&#39;s terrible, it reflects what is wrong with people these days. It&#39;s focussed on the look, the trends and himself (really, really on himself). This album does reflect Kanye, I&#39;m sure he poured himself into it but it isn&#39;t something worth acknowledging. He has nothing to say, no interesting qualities. He married fucking Kim Kardashian, he&#39;s a simpleton.
He gave the album an above average rating<br><br>The people still complain. There is no understanding you guys.
very young melon reviewing at incredible hihg speed
I broke my phone screen watching this I&#39;m fucking pissed
Fuck u idk why u hate kanye for no reason
I&#39;m actually just here for the memes
listen mate if u wanna keep trolling me thats fine but im tired of being internet bullied honestly. in school im very popular and have very good grades which is not something many people can say. my parents are divorced but that doesnt matter. just let me be part of this community... ok?
On the real tho, you should delete your account for this review
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo4S2qlQGs0&amp;t=140">2:20</a> I&#39;m giving this &#39;damn&#39; a decent 7
How is the hook in So Appalled corny and &quot;radio like&quot;<br><br>Kendrick Lamar sampled it on Hiiipower
CopperCab sent me.
I give this video a 6/10 🖕🏻
So what albums were better?
I&#39;ve seen people whining about this review on literally every review of his I&#39;ve ever watched. I was expecting some savage takedown. Only thing dude said was &quot;It&#39;s really creative and great in a lot of ways, but it didn&#39;t really connect with me personally in any meaningful way even though I can see how other people would really love it.&quot;<br><br>Wow, you&#39;re right, internet. UNFORGIVABLE! I shall now rage about it for the next 7 years to catch up with y&#39;all.
one of the greatest rap  album of all time
Monster is the worst song in this album.
Still mad
how are people still talking about this review it happened like six years ago
Listening to this review and then seeing the score was like 1+1=7
I don&#39;t agree with the rating, it&#39;s an 8 or 9 in my opinion but I do agree with the review. I know Anthony likes to be controversial (and fucking wrong sometimes) but at least he backs it up.
He didn&#39;t t like the album because it was about Kanye, but the album is titled My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.
Theneedledrop- Great production, great rhymes 6/10
This comment section is garbage.
I agree that the hooks feel very generic in places.I could do without Blame Game and Lost in the World. I don&#39;t really think the context matters very much. It&#39;s easily a 7 imo
&quot;But that&#39;s just my opinion&quot; Will unfortunately be on Tano&#39;s tombstone
So this is where the memes come from..
A History of Fantano&#39;s Biggest L&#39;s:<br>1. MBDTF<br>2. Blank Face LP<br>3. Lil Boat <br>4. The Suns Tirade <br>5. Jeffrey
Lost in the world, runaway, devil wears a new dress &amp; dark fantasy give me chills to this day. Kanye constructed a masterpiece and it&#39;s sad how some people take it for granted.
OK, I just listened to it for the first time (listened to it 3 times today actually). I understand now why you get hate for this review. It is most definitely not a 6/10.
Remember guys, freakin&#39; Migos and Lil&#39; Yachty got higher scores than My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. Rolling Stone, Pitchfork etc everyone gave this a perfect score saying it&#39;s one of the greatest hip-hop albums of all time. It was also commercially successful.
Here because I&#39;m annoyed about the DAMN. review
UPDATE: In the future he&#39;ll give a certain Kendrick Lamar a decent 7 on a certain &#39;Damn.&#39; album.
DELETE THIS
Kanye&#39;s magnum opus. Memetano forever lost credibility after this review
TCD:  9.5/10<br>LR:  8.5/10<br>Graduation:  7/10<br>808s:  8.5/10<br>MBDTF:  10/10<br>WTT:  6/10<br>Yeezus:  7/10<br>TLOP:  5.5/10
still fuck you for this
Wtf the whole video I thought he was loving the album and was atleast giving it an 8 but then He gives it a 6 . Wtf lol
lil yachty got a 7 and this got a 6
it wasnt that great you stupid fanboys
And Migos- Culture got an 8... -.-
How to destroy your career in 10 minutes or less
He&#39;s not wrong you guys.
I think this is a bad review from Anthony (a blemish in his great career.) He doesn&#39;t have to like the album, but I feel his reasoning is weak (It is not music related, it&#39;s an interest in his life) and he only highlights positives. I respect his opinion, but I don&#39;t think this is a high point for him
do logic the album is call &quot;EVERYBODY&quot;
/mu/ will defend this
&quot;But that&#39;s just my opinion-&quot;<br><br>and then no one ever let him live it down.
I really have no idea why people like this album so much
it&#39;s 2017 and I cannot fucking believe you have this only a 6/10
So basically MBDTF is a 6/10 because Kanye is a douche?
I really love this album a lot honestly, but I didn&#39;t get upset at all by this review or the score. I&#39;m probably the only one lol
RECOUNT
&quot;But that&#39;s just my opinion. You guys were asking for this&quot;
Anyone else came to watch this after his List and get mad all over again?
Anthony fantano is a Kanye hater, probably just jealousy, in all honesty. MBDTF is the one of the best albums ever made in history.
Review TPAB
You say the lyric and production were all on point on this album but you give t a six just because the his stories don&#39;t appeal to you. Yet you give young thugs barter 6 a 5 only because the beats are catchy and choruses were catchy to you
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo4S2qlQGs0&amp;t=109">1:49</a> an album about his life?????? He can predict the future
Delete this video.
Lmaooo the comments made me laugh my ass off. I disagree with the score, but you actually criticised the album pretty well, and gave fair reasoning why so.
The like to dislike ratio here is insane.
WOW
Lil Boat is higher than this. Wut
Hhahaha the dislikes
this video is classic
Stupid stupid melon FUCK boy. I hate you. ):
anthony needs to redo this review
The only problem I have with this album is some of the choruses/hooks, they can be boring, unoriginal and repetitive, e.g., &quot;Blame Game&quot;, &quot;Monster&quot;. The lyrics on this album are good but not great, at times they are pretty generic. But just about every other aspect of this LP is phenomenal. Great production, great variety of songs, great contributions by featured artists. Almost sounds like a compilation record (maybe that&#39;s just &#39;cause I mostly listen to concept albums), but at the same time it feels very unified. Lots of different stories and quite an interesting track at the end. I like that this album isn&#39;t very political and that it gives it some staying power for me. I can&#39;t personally relate to most of the tracks but i still feel like I very much understand the message. This album is covered with some legendary tracks (All of the Lights, Runaway) that really lift up this album as a whole. For someone who rarely listens to hip-hop, and typically doesn&#39;t enjoy it, this album is incredible. Using Anthony&#39;s system, I would probably give it a strong 8/light 9. Part of me thinks the lyrics could be better, but then I realize that some of the generic and direct lyrics provide the listener with a quicker connection and add to the culture of the music. Surprisingly great LP.
This gets a 6 and Lil Boat got a 7 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23neverforget">#neverforget</a>
Trash ass rating
real niggas check the description, get triggered by the score, leave a dislike and then dip
The stupidest part of all this is that the 6 is just how much he enjoyed it not like how much youre allowed to enjoy it or even a measure of how much Fantano enjoyed it??? Just like youre music and if you don&#39;t agree with the opinion ignore it
frick you
i really look back now and ask why fantano... why...?
What the fuck.
2017, still pissed about this.
Hold this L fantano
The comment section is still filled with idiots.
&gt;not acknowledging Runaway as one of the best songs in history<br>u played urself
It&#39;s 2017, look at everyone clutching to their little opinions and screeching for validation
You can&#39;t have an opinion without someone ridiculously blowing shit out of proportion he liked it but it wasn&#39;t his cup of tea wtf is wrong with that?
It&#39;s Kim
This review really made me think about the small things in life. Some days I go walking out by my garden, and I see the butterflies (this was a while ago, because it&#39;s winter now.) I look out past the yard at middle America. We all have our ups and downs, or ins and lows. We&#39;re all human on this pale blue dot. And then I remember Anthony Fantano and his smug ass bald head of his, and I wonder, maybe I should start drinking again.
LOL, I actually kinda agree with this review although I would give it a light 8
I hope you guys know I&#39;m really really trying to join the Anthonty Fantano hate train and I really wanted to try Kanye Wests stuff out... but I was really bored with it, I&#39;m sorry
one of the best albums of all time and bro gives him a light 6 lmao
1.- The College Dropout = 9.2/10.0<br>2.- Late Registration = 8.5/10.0<br>3.- Graduation = 8.0/10.0<br>4.- 808s &amp; Heartbreak = 7.5/10.0<br>5.- My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy = 10.0/10.0<br>6.- Yeezus = 3.1/10.0<br>7.- The Life Of Pablo = 7.0/10.0
Like if he spoke so positive about an album in 2017 it wil be at least 8... the review is positive..not the rating tho
fuck kanye west
I come back here every once in a while just to gather up Kanye fan tears to drink
wow some people really care about someone else&#39;s opinion way too much.
i remember when this album came out my first reaction was being pissed that kanye had sampled an aphex twin song. i still am a bit.
He never spoke about Devil In A New Dress. Always bugged me
Pathetic.
You mean nothing to me as a reviewer because you gave this album a 6/10
Why? I just don&#39;t get it. The whole review you treat it so positively and you&#39;d think you were about to give it an 8 and you just hit out with 6. Just out of nowhere. Why?
NEVER FORGET
9/10 for me
Almost 7 years later and there&#39;s still an alarming amount of salt. <br><br>It&#39;s just his opinion people. Nothing is stopping <i>you</i> from enjoying the album.
Ya&#39;ll know this is just his opinion, right?
I STILL DON&#39;T UNDERSTAND HOW MBDTF IS 6? CAN SOMEBODY PLEASE EXPLAIN HIS RATING TO ME?
Hating on this rating in 2017. Worst I&#39;ve ever seen.
You have your opinion but i dont agree
I&#39;ve always thought this shit was way too completist and kanye is just trying too hard with his production, but of course, everyone just loves hype even if its bullshit
Gee this comment section is just full of pouring sait.
this melonhead rated this album on kanye&#39;s personality
IF YOU&#39;RE MAD AT THE RATING READ THE FUCKING DESCRIPTION. Thnx
I&#39;m not gonna be one of those people who tries to force my opinion and try to make him like what I like but I honestly will never understand why he rated this a 6. This was nearly a 10 imo
Where is the graduation review?!?
I REALLY hope you don&#39;t take this review down (what pitchfork does and I hate that too) - this was simply your opinion at that point and one I actually still agree with in many ways (I always thought the album was pretty solid but hugely overrated despite a really strong first half or so)
He reviewed it like it would be an 8. He gave it a 6.
I feel like he just did this for buzz. He does not give a real reason for it to be a 6. He says he isn&#39;t &quot;interested&quot; in Kanye&#39;s personal life. That&#39;s stupid, a terrible reason.
Melon pros:<br>Good sense of humor/wordplay<br>Quite artful with samples<br>Ambitious af<br>Good features<br><br>Melon cons:<br>Mediocre singing<br>Mediocre hooks<br>Mediocre storytelling (eg. failing to build sympathy for protagonist)<br>Lyrical themes spread thin across album
I hear about this review so much I had to come to it. The analysis isn&#39;t as bad as the score. How the fuck is this a 6/10 when it&#39;s easily a classic and critically acclaimed as a unanimous Top 5 of the entire decade by pubs like Rolling Stone, Billboard, Pitchfork etc. lol A 6
Anthony should go make his own album and see how good it sounds
Lil Boat got 7/10
6 years later and this is still the worst album review of all time. Props!
Favourite Fantano review, Album&#39;s overrated as FUCK!
eh heh
It is a little odd how the entire review is basically positive and then you say light 6 XD
6/10 is still laughable
I just stopped by to drop a dislike.
Bruh this was filmed before I turned 14 lol Damn
wtf? &quot;flaws&quot;? there&#39;s no fucking flaws
&gt;not AT THE VERY LEAST pointing Runaway as one of the best rap songs of the century<br>you fucking melon i hate you
wow this shitty album got a higher score than blank face
i think review is fine over all. It is the score that really fucked everything though. You stated so many positives about the album and then you give it a 6. At worst, the album is an 8/10. Its very hard for me to believe an album of this quality can end up with a 6/10. it just makes no sense. Compare that with his recent reviews...hes easily giving artists like Lil Yatchy 8/10. When Yatchys album is no where near as ambitious and sonically impressive as MBDTF. Its mainly the score people have an issue with. not so much the review. There simply weren&#39;t enough negatives for it to be a 6/10.
badthony audiotano
honestly, everyones getting so mad over the fact that he gave it a 6, which I can see where you&#39;re coming from as this is one of my favourite albums, but if you actually watch the review or read what he has to say in the description, he was very positive about it. I personally think it was just a mistake. anthony seems to really enjoy this album aside from the small things such as personal lyrics and some iffy hooks.
I honestly dont understand  how you couldnt like the hook on all of the lights
I like Anthony he cool but he needs to give that shit a 9 or 10
You should review 311!!!
get your shit together tnd
MBDTF was Kanye at his finest moment. What a jewel of an album. Magnificent 10/10.
6 years on people are still salty about this review.
All people care about is the final rating.  Nobody cares about the positives he gave at the beginning.  And it&#39;s not a matter of whether you think this review is right or not.  It&#39;s just his opinion.
This is his best album
L
The song &#39;gorgeous&#39; make this album 10/10 alone! This album is amazing!!
6 years later and this review is still wrong
Im still mad
6 years later and I still love this review 😂😂😂
Six years have passed, and the album still proves how wrong this review was from the beginning.
Is it bad if I sorta agree with him?
For anyone wondering, someone asked Anthony back in like 2013 on his <a href="http://ask.fm">ask.fm</a> account about how MBDTF made it to his top 50. He said it&#39;s a light 7 for him
Diez/10 this shit harder than my dick.
The only good verse I&#39;ve heard from Nicki Minaj is on this album
Wow it&#39;s been 6 years and this is still your worst review ever
I love this album. I also thought this was a fair review. Chill out, guys.
good lord dude, im at a loss<br><br>whats wrong with you
Still mad at this dumb shit...
can&#39;t believe melon man hasn&#39;t changed his mind
It was LtCorbis&#39; &quot;Pretentious People&quot; video that brought me here...
This is Anthony&#39;s only review that I feel comfortable just saying he&#39;s precisely wrong.
I agree that this review was pretty bad considering all the praise he gave it yet giving it such a low score and not explaining well enough why he gave it such a low score other than he didn&#39;t care about the drama. However I can&#39;t see why some of you think it deserves a 10. It wasn&#39;t a perfect album by any means. Sure there were 6 songs I would almost rate a 10 individually but the other 6 I could give a 5 which really makes it far from a perfect album. I would give it higher than a 6 for sure but not a 10.<br><br>Songs that didn&#39;t really stand out:<br><br>Lost In The World<br>Who Will Survive In America<br>Hell Of A Life<br>Devil In A New Dress<br>So Apalled (other than having good features)<br>Monster (other than having good features)<br><br>Let me know if I should revisit any of those tracks and see if they&#39;re worth listening to. I thought the last 2 were okay because they had a lot of verses but the others just didn&#39;t catch on to me.
This album is EASILY a 10/10. Some of Kanyes absolute best work right there on that record.
grr
what the fuck dude
MBDTF is Kanyes magnum opus
&quot;...put this bum in the shower!&quot;
unpopular opinion alert but i dont agree with this review!!!
A prime example of needledrop fans taking the score far more seriously than the review,
Bald fuck
For me: <br><br>1) Yeezus<br>2) MBDTF<br>3) TLOP<br>4) 808&#39;s<br>5) Graduation<br>6) Late Registration<br>7) College Dropout
anthony, you probably won’t see this, but if you took the time to re-review this, do you think you’d give it a different score? why or why not?
LMAO he gave one of the best albums of all time a 6/10. ok im out
Fuck off! This album is one of the greatest of our time
Take that 6 turn it upside down then turn it upside down again that&#39;s a 6 again which is what this album is
Personally, I think this is one of the most overrated album in the past decade.
but...but.... runaway is amazing
holy fuck are kanye fans cringeworthy as shit. 6,000+ dislikes because this guy didn&#39;t give an album a 10. it&#39;s not even like he trashed the record, 6/10 is a decent score. unbelievable
.....wait how did it get a 6....
never forget...
This albums entire theme is excess. From the extravagant production, to the high number  of A-list features, to kanyes rapping style. His melodramatic verses are done purposely, this album is supposed to feel like a success story gone wrong. Someone who&#39;s succumbed to all the drama in their life brought on by their celebrity, and while they&#39;re aware it&#39;s all fake it drives them insane anyway. I&#39;m surprised you didn&#39;t pick that up and just labelled it Kanye throwing a tantrum.
so people just dislike when they disagree with an opinion?
BOI WHA T THE FUK
i came back here just to dislike the shit outta this
YOU FUCKING MELON.
This guy is a complete moron
HOLY SHIT. HE DOESNT LOVE THE ALBUM. FUCK. SHIT. WHAT DO WE DO???? IT&#39;S ALL OVER! HE DOESN&#39;T HAVE THE SAME OPOINION AS US1 THIS CANYT HAPPEBN HOLY SHITNKFKK;;UPDVKJKJDVFJKBVVBVKJEEVBVOFV
L
I personally disagree with the rating of the review, I loved the album and am a big Kanye fan. But after reading the video description, how can you give this video so many dislikes? He gave very fair and reasonable points. He even said &quot;There&#39;s a lot to love about this thing&quot;. He&#39;s just not attracted to Kanye&#39;s over the top personality.
BLUNDER OF THE CENTURY
This and Jeffry were 2 of fantanos worst reviews for opposite reason
he basically said everything is good but I don&#39;t like Kanye West drama shit so a 6/10
HAHAHAHA 6 / 10 WHAT
A light to decent 6/10? That is a -D to a D
he&#39;s secretly a Kanye Stan but he needs some extra views
you don&#39;t like listening to kanyes issues for nine minutes but half of runaway is kanye humming over strings.
Holy shit look at that subscriber number. I swear you were at 100k in 2015.
this album is a 90&#39;s classic. I miss the 90&#39;s now we have justin beiber and lil gayne and yeesuz
10 outta 10, review it again
I respect your opinion but damn this was not a 6 😂
hes saying the only thing thats wrong with it is the content. He just doesnt care about it. If you care this album could easily be a 9 or 10 because the beats and the performances are there. This review isnt as bad as I thought it was going to be.
It irks me that this video actually exists.
Look, this review was made in 2010. Anthony has come a long way since then. I think he made a mistake here and if he were to re-review it, he would definitely give it an 8 or so. The thing is, as with pretty much all of Kanye&#39;s albums, MBDTF was misunderstood when it came out. Kanye constantly raps in a way that seems so strange and unorthodox upon release, but soon becomes the norm for every popular rapper. <br><br>So, all in all, don&#39;t bring this up for every album that Anthony gives a 7+ to and say &quot;_<i>__</i> is better than MBDTF? You&#39;re full of shit.&quot; Our opinions on music change over time, so cut him some slack for a mistake that he made 6 years ago.
Looking at the Like:Dislike - I guess he didn&#39;t like the album
I think ye&#39;s first three albums were his best. this album is definitely good, but I don&#39;t really fuck with almost any of the features, and that synthesizer became unbearable at times
He was clearly scared of getting hated on for liking a Kanye album. The way he said &#39;I may get hate for saying this&#39;  before saying he found half the album artistic. (how is it not all artistic??).  And his main gripe was that he didn&#39;t care about kanye&#39;s personal life? Why does he never mention other artists social life&#39;s? He bottled it in this,  think if he redid this review today it would get a higher score as he&#39;s more confident on his opinions
If you look beyond the rating, this review is actually really positive and aware of the quality of the album
Your crazy this album is atleast an 8 or 9
Category: Comedy
did you guys watch the review if he didn&#39;t rate it no one would care the rating is inconsequential
Do &quot;808&#39;s and Heatbreaks&quot; please.
A memorable blemish on Fantano&#39;s career
6/10 u suck fantano
10/10 don give a single flying fuck
Boy if you don&#39;t get ...
A 6??? You gotta be fucking kidding me.
Anthony looking like he bout to paint a bob ross paintings
Needs more dislikes
My question is, did you take context into consideration when listening to TPAB?
The best Kanye album by far
Kanye west fans get triggered any time someone criticizes him. He is the most overrated rapper I can think of.
he sounded so nasally back then.
I&#39;m but this the one review I completely disagree with Anthony about, this is a masterpiece of an album, 9.5/10
In all honesty I give this album an 8/10. While I belive the 6/10 is blasphemous, I think alot of people are giving it too much credit. Giving this album a 10/10 or even a 9/10 would not be a fair review, if you gave it that score it would mean it&#39;s as good of a hip hop album as The Blueprint, Moment of Truth, Midnight Marauders, Criminal Minded, Me Against The World, or Illmatic... and it&#39;s not. In my opinion it&#39;s just shy of a masterpiece. Dark Fantasy was great production great performance, Power had a sick beat to it with powerful delivery (naturally), and Gorgeous is without a doubt the best song on the album. But the album has its okay marks. Hell of a Life was meh, mostly catchy for airplay with typical crazy party life lyrics, Monster, I fucking hate it, not because of Ye or Nicki, because of Jay, Jay ruined that song for me (not very fair point but that&#39;s how I feel about it). All Of The Lights was also meh, and Lost in the World didn&#39;t have any actual verses in it (good song though). I ferl like alot of millenials and/or 20-somethings feel the hype way too much for this album. It is in no way shape or form the best hip hop album of all time, or even top 10 albums of all time
tbh i thought the review was fair except for the &quot;i don&#39;t care about his social life&quot; part, especially regarding runaway. kanye is painting this portrait of a flawed man, that&#39;s the idea, and it&#39;s not like it&#39;s an  uncommon goal. to say &quot;i&#39;m bored of it&quot; is basically to ignore the (entirely valid) point he&#39;s trying to make.<br>personally, strong 7 to light 8. some of the hooks are defs corny and generic.
808s of heartbreaks
This review is like the equivalent of saying &quot;The Dark Knight(insert any acclaimed movie) had great acting, cinematography, music, directing, etc. Really good movie. It gets a C+ grade.&quot;
You&#39;re a piece of shit
6?
Only 6? You don&#39;t know nothing about music.
6 is exactly what i would give it.  you guys gotta be honest.  no way you&#39;re listening to runaway and blame game all the way through very often.   those 2 tracks being several minutes too long hurts the album.   personally,  I&#39;m not a fan of Monster.   just not my style.   power isn&#39;t bad but it doesn&#39;t have much replay value.  the opening track is cool.  so is the one with cudi.  i really like the beat on that other track with rick ross.  but in general,  i feel like there are a lot of mediocre songs here.  it is always funny watching how mad people get at opinions,  though.   as if every single person on earth must accept your opinion as fact.   it&#39;s so silly to me
6. a 6. go home youre drunk. or go outside i guess
You suck
Outkast
To this day I&#39;m still pissed off about this review but I respect you opinion Anthony.
College Dropout: 10/10<br>Late Registration: 10/10<br>Graduation: 10/10<br>808s &amp; Heartbreak: 10/10 (Underrated AF)<br>MBDTF: 11/10<br>Yeezus: 10/10 (Underrated AF)<br>The Life of Pablo: 10/10
Why&#39;d you record this on a fucking 90s recording device?
sesh bones
If you ask Kanye, the projects he&#39;s most proud of are 808s and Yeezus. If you know anything about Kanye, you know that he strives to push the boundaries of what&#39;s considered &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;good&quot;. To him, MBDTF was almost like giving people exactly what they wanted from him, to reclaim the part of the audience that he lost after 808s &amp; Heartbreak and the Taylor Swift VMA incident. In the simplest terms, it&#39;s his most &quot;clean-cut&quot; album.
He&#39;s right, though
on point review
tbh....I didn&#39;t really like the album... a few songs were good tho
6/10 for any good rapper that isn&#39;t Kendrick right
This album is a 99/10, no mames.
@theneedledrop start doing throwback reviews. First one 808s &amp; heartbreaks
You&#39;re shit
How do you give one of kanye&#39;s best album a 6/10
it&#39;s 2016 and I&#39;m still blown away that he gave one of the best hip hop albums of all time this rating 😑
This is literally the most garbage review I&#39;ve ever heard
This album is a 30/10 fantano.
This album is kanyes best album after graduation, deserves 8.5 at least
Am I the only one who agrees with Anthony lmao
DELET
Turn the 6 upside down it&#39;s a 9 now.
NEVER trust a person that gives mbdtf &lt; 8/10
never forget
This album is an 8 for the production and instrumentals alone when compared to any other &quot;mainstream&quot; hip-hop albums at the time of this ilk.  To answer your question: Yes, the album is great--even better if reviewed in a vacuum with all context removed. <br><br>I can&#39;t disrespect your opinion because I respect Anthony but the cadence of the review doesn&#39;t necessarily match the score for me. I&#39;d be interested to see Anthony review 808s and other past Kanye albums.  Keep on rockin&#39;, Anthony! Love ya!
TURN THE 6 UPSIDE DOWN ITS A 9 NOW
still not over this u fuckwit
I like how people go crazy over the 6/10 despite him saying how ambitius and great the album is. He just didn&#39;t like some of the lyrics.
If you don&#39;t rap about yourself who do you rap about you make music to express yourself not somebody else am I wrong
6 years later and ye fans are still salty...<br><br>I don&#39;t agree with this guy but holy fucking shit its his opinion.
Its not even about being a ye fan, as a listener of this piece you have to respect its level of greatness
when will you fix this Fantano
almost subscribed until I saw this bs
Ok dude you can&#39;t rate this the same as Justin bieber. Jesus even if you don&#39;t like him this album is at the vary least an 8.5. This makes me angry
You know, if you hear Anthony out, his review actually makes sense. Hmm.
Listen to this again Fandango
Why do you assholes only look at the score and not listen to the words he&#39;s saying?? He actually liked a lot about this album.
I&#39;m all for his opinion. To say that you&#39;re not interested in his personal life so the music isn&#39;t as good as it could be though is an awful reason to gripe. The whole time you were talking about how awesome the production is lol
So...<br><br>Some corny hooks and Kanye&#39;s personality is what gave this album a 6/10...<br><br>This review is terrible lol.
I&#39;m well aware that this is your opinion. But your opinion is complete shit.
the 1st time i listened to this album it was 10.....now its a 6....agree with fantano.....kanye cocksuckers are too hypnotised by the beats....lyrics are absolute shit.....
6?
his only review i disagree with
6 is harsh man. You acknowledged its uniqueness and creativity as an album, that alone should deserve at least a 7. In my opinion, it&#39;s a 9 and easily Kanye&#39;s best work. We all have opinions, but I don&#39;t think you really justified giving this album that low of a score.
this idiot still thinks death grips is the greatest hip hop of all time with their shitty casio beats
Ur gay lol
one piece of advice to everyone out there, if the reviewer is not a big fan of the genre of music of the album and you are, dont listen to the review, i learned that lesson as soon as i watched this review
Kanye fanboys are salty AF. Get off Kanye&#39;s peter.
anthony can you re-review this album
I don&#39;t understand how you didn&#39;t love All of the Lights, such an amazing song and a true Kanye ballad
God, that review is so embarrassing
He gave lil yatchy trash bag of an album a 7...
Fuck You Fantano !!!!!<br>MBDTF is the greatest album of 2000&#39;s
Finally someone who gets it
After seeing how wrong his rating for TLOP was. I decided to back and check out a few of his older reviews. This just proved that Anthony Fagtano&#39;s opinion is trash. His critiques are trash. Unscubscribed from this trash.
all credibility lost after hearing 6...
this some legendary bullshit right here
does nobody understand that anthony just gave it a low score for the publicity. come on now. gotta get more attention somehow
Is that a Margareth Tatcher shirt? If it is i&#39;m more mad about this than the 6/10 thing.
fantano deserves all the backlash and hate he got after this review. contrarian for the sake of being contrairian. pseudo reasons he gave for trying to dislike the albums.
L
Whoever rates this masterpiece below 10/10 has dreamliner size dick inside ears. It is the best hip-hop album of the twenty-first century ex-aequo with Speakerboxxx and The Blueprint.
wooooow stop reviewing please.
Graduation was better
Macklemore-The Heist <br>Lil Yachty- Lil Boat<br>Eminem- MMLP2<br>Drake-  IYRTITL<br>A$ap Ferg- Trap Lord<br>Lithurgy- The Ark Work<br><br>I don&#39;t hate these albums (Except for Lithurgy, disgrace to Black Metal imo)<br>But I dont know how anyone could put them above MBDTF.
Fucking hell, Kanye West fans piss me off so much. Like it&#39;s not enough that someone else is a fellow Kanye West fan, if they don&#39;t like ONE album to the EXACT SAME EXTENT as everyone else, then Kanye fans will bitch about it relentlessly for 6 years and counting.
10/10
i think it is at least a 7.5
lol that like to dislike ratio tho
&quot;OMG! Screw you for having an opinion that is different from mine! You are a jerk for being your own person and having your own opinion! If you have an opinion different from mine, then you&#39;re wrong!!!&quot;<br><br>Seriously though guys, it&#39;s just his opinion. Don&#39;t get your panties in a twist.
You praised like the most essential things about what music and what an album needs to sound great. told me this thing here has it all and still ended up giving it an underrated 6 because of the drama that went behind the music in Kanye&#39;s life, social media and stuff? Even if you don&#39;t give a damn about his lyrics/stories at all, this album is a total blast and I am sure all these negative comments and downvotes for this video happend because people don&#39;t share your opinion. This is something that shouldn&#39;t manipulate your &quot;objective&quot; review skills.
Best Album Ever
this guy hates kanye, album is amazing! done watching his reviews
LOL What a pathetic contrarian, U shit on MBDTF  due to your obvious bias against Kanye then realised U fucked up when every other more credible critic was praising it , so U then had the nerve to put it in your best albums of the year list above Girl Talk and Ratatat&#39;s albums which U gave 8s basically contradicting yourself. Man Ur full of shit.
Terrible review
Oh my god this video is soo old
You continue to be full of shit. <br><br>Even my racist grandmother thinks this album is a masterpiece.
After listening to MBDTF in it&#39;s entirety fith time round, you have to be really fucking pretentious to give this album lower than an 8
you are crazy!!!!!!!!
How can you listen to tracks like Gorgeous and All Of the Lights and still rate TLOP higher than this? What TLOP tracks have staying power like that? There&#39;s not a single memorable melody on the effort... You&#39;re a weirdo for real fam
Blame game was impossible for me to listen to because I&#39;m an Apex Twin fan. I though that was a very distasteful production decision.
woooooooooooooooow he really gave 6??? THIS IS A CLASSIC DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMN
Watching this while listening to TLOP... You gave THIS 6/10... Please change your profession
I understand it&#39;s your opinion but 6/10 is just wrong.<br><br>I&#39;m seeing this review for the first time and I&#39;ve heard this album 100&#39;s of times since it came out and it is easily one of the best albums ever. Not rap albums. Albums in general EVER and I&#39;m not even that huge of a Kanye fan.
soo Fantano....what was the score??<br><br>IMO best Kanye album overall. Yeah its self obsessed, but so much hip hop is far less interesting contentwise....so I can give that a pass.
cd - 9<br>lr - 10<br>grad - 9<br>808 - 7<br>mbdtf - a fuckin&#39; 10 <br>yeezus - 6<br>tlop - 8
FUCK YOU FANTANO
Lol, going back through these I&#39;m realizing you just review Kanye too soon after listening, you can&#39;t honestly still think this album deserves 6/10.
He is saying that MBDTF and TLOP are on the same level because he rated them both 6/10. SMH
Haven&#39;t even finished watching the video but based on these comments I hate u
T.L.O.P. got a 5....
No album is objectively good people, it&#39;s all opinion based.
You guys go to music reviews expecting to hear the same opinion that you have?
This album is a 10... Smh needle drop
&quot;you get kinda bored&quot; listening to Runaway? That song is one of Kanye&#39;s best. Yes, it&#39;s 9 minutes, but it&#39;s 9 minutes of amazing. It&#39;s complete genius imo

the most dislike video he ever dropped <br><br>TLOP just dropped, <br>give it less than 8 and ull get the second most disliked video ever <br>i fucking dare you
Why does a 2010 video look like it came from late 90s early 2000s!???!!! So weird
watching this on the eve of TLOP <br><br>f u for this still
The album&#39;s overrated.Get over it.
Half a decade later and Anthony still hasn&#39;t lived this one down. XD
Lol I come back to this review every time I re-listen to this album and feel like gagging. Love you Anthony but sometimes I disagree so vehemently with you
LIFE OF PABLO 10/10
Please don&#39;t disregard my legitimate question as &quot;hate&quot; just because it makes you realize a truth you didn&#39;t want to admit: What makes you qualified to review and score music? what musical accomplishments do you have under your belt that makes you an authority in music? what degrees or schooling do you have in the art of music? If the highest rated rap album of the decade gets a score of 6, what rap album did you give a 10?
I&#39;ve seen so many more butthurt people on this review than any video anthony made.
Some nights I wake up in a cold sweat from nightmares of this review...
Man this was like fantano&#39;s taylor swift moment..
CD: 10/10<br>LR: 9/10<br>G: 9/10<br>8&amp;H: 8/10<br>MBDTF: 10/10<br>Y: 6/10<br><br><br><br>Also GMCS: 8/10<br>Waves is gonna be a 9/10
I think it&#39;s kanye&#39;s best album yet I just really love the beats and rhymes alot.
This album literally got a 10/10 from music critics... This dude gave it a 6/10... Maybe he&#39;s getting his opinion of Ye mixed up with the musicality of this masterpiece
tbh that score hurts me. It&#39;s opinion but this is the only score I&#39;ve gotten butt hurt over. To me this album is a perfect depiction of modern day celebrity drama this whole album is a tabloid newspaper put into music and I think kanye knows that I think it&#39;s genius even if he didn&#39;t mean to I think it represents how the media represents celebrity drama. Also of coursE that production is God like.
i still have ptsd from this review
CD: 9/10<br>LR:8.5/10<br>Grad:8/10<br>808s: 7.5/10<br>MBDTF: 9.5/10<br>WTT: 7/10<br>Yeezus: 6.5/10
buggin
Oh Anthony, you opened Pandora&#39;s Box with this review.  No one&#39;s ever gonna let you forget that 6/10. :3
Back when the audio wasn&#39;t that good
Fantano just gave it a low score so he would get clout/more views stay woke everybody.
great album overall but the track &quot;monster&quot; i personally think is horrible
He picked my least favorite songs as his favorite songs lol
The College Dropout - 8/10<br>Late Registration - 5/10<br>Graduation - 7.5/10<br>808s and Heartbreak - 10/10<br>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy - 10/10<br>Watch the Throne - 9.5/10<br>Cruel Summer - 4.5/10<br>Yeezus - 10/10
Cd 9.2/10, Lr 6/10 Graduation 5.5/10 808&#39;s 8.3/10 yezus 6.7/10
This album is a fucking 10, I wish I could give it an 11. It is in my opinion the single best hip hop album of all time, and one of the best albums of all time. I have listened to it probably 100 times, it is the pulp fiction of hip hop. From the very beginning it grabs hold and doesn&#39;t let go. I mean the vocoder section of Runaway, the musical interlude in devil in a new dress, brilliant.
basically<br>great instru<br>shit lyrics
Ive watched this review every day since its dropped and ive shed a tear every night
He gave hovs MCHG a 6. He gave MMLP2 a 7. Let that sink in <b>knock knock</b>
I REALLY love the concept of this album, but I think the production of making this thing didn&#39;t catch up with this wonderful theme.<br>Although some lyrics are fine and gorgeous(except Runaway which is terrible, I think), the drums are so simple and weak that it&#39;s almost boring and, for me, the groove is not enough to bounce on it.<br><br>Other thing that I don&#39;t like about this album is some sampｌes. For example, King Crimson and Aphex Twin for &quot;Power&quot; and &quot;Blame Game&quot;. I DO like those two as a musician, but the way those are used in the tracks is too cheesy. It&#39;s like Kanye is trying to flatter non black music nerds with a very easy and corny way.<br><br>Particularly in Japan, this album is almost like an &quot;if you don&#39;t like this, then you are not a music fan(nor a hip-hop fan)&quot; thing, which is really bullshit. I believe that some of those who claim this album to be a &#39;classic&#39; in my country are just following what the internet or the authority says blindly. Fuck it.
I literally feel like this is one greatest albums of all time at least top 5
The only thing that kind of irks me about this review is your comments about how you don&#39;t care about Kanyes personal business. That&#39;s fine but you&#39;re coming across as &quot;how dare he talk about himself in his music, that he wrote and produced, that he put out.&quot; It&#39;s his art and art is personal. Its stupid to complain about an album being self indulgent. Art can be selfish, it&#39;s human expression, not made PURELY for your enjoyment. (I know it is in a lot of ways)
I saw the like/dislike ratio and got so scared. A 6? Shit, I&#39;ll take it. He didn&#39;t necessarily say it was bad. Hell, a 6 is good. I think it could be higher but I can see somebody who doesn&#39;t care for Kanye to just pass this one off.
On the plus side, that is a nice Patsy Cline t-shirt.
This video is 6 years ago yet I&#39;m still mad about it XD.
I hate this man.
CD=8.5<br>LR=9<br>G=8<br>808s=7.5<br>MBDTF=10<br>YZ=9

Classic album but he doesn&#39;t like it because it&#39;s not Kendrick lamar
He voted TPAB a 10/10 and this a 6?
Goddddddd. you reviewed it as if was a 8 or 9... but then you said 6
I agree with this review. but woulda scored it at a decent 7 instead of 6. I really could not care less about Ye&#39;s drama in this album. this is where his inflated ego started to get on my nerves. but the overall production was amazing.
Moron..a 6 ?? Your opinion doesnt matter in the long run cuz of dumb ass shit like this
College Dropout 10/10 (Classic)<br>Late Registration 9/10 <br>Graduation 9/10<br>80&#39;s &amp; Heartbreak 7/10<br>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy 9/10<br>Yeezus 5/10
It&#39;s atleast a 9
It deserves less than a 6.
I know it&#39;s been a long time but would you ever go back to 808s and heart break would like to hear your opinion @needledrop
bro how tf is this a fuckin 6, but you GAVE DEATH GRIPS AN 8, ???? unsubed.
Like Ye but Anthony was pretty spot on with this review :x
Haha. this review is worthless and yet intelligent :)
ab-soul these days got a higher score.
College Dropout- 8.5/10 A Masterpiece but I felt like it was unfinishedLate Registration- 8.5/10 I grew up on this album but I have to admit, its bulkiness weighs it down cut maybe 1/4 of the songs off it and I think it could&#39;ve been what Graduation wasGraduation- 9/10 This album is the product of what Kanye was trying to do on the last 2 albums, it was ambitious, really really confident, and had instrumentals and production that set the tone for the next few years till MBDTF808s- 8/10 Definitely solid as an album, auto tune was interesting and well used and placed. Only issue with this isn&#39;t even an issue its the lack of actual rap on it and pure auto tuned singing over atmospheric beats control 90% of the project. If that isn&#39;t your thing it can be a hard listen.MBDTF- 10/10 IN MY OPINION I&#39;m not hating on a 5 year old Fantano video, I&#39;m just saying this album was a masterpiece. The decadence and downfall of Kanye&#39;s character are what make this album interesting, not to mention the beat and sample selection. Gorgeous and Devil in A New Dress still give me chills. Kanye&#39;s had issues on his other albums with features where they&#39;d overshadow him (Sierra Leone/Diamonds Remix w/ Jay Z) or just non existent and almost pointless (Crack Music w/ The Game) but all of his features had excellent verses, stayed true to the theme of the album, and also Kanye was at his most impressive lyrically here. He was clever, had solid lines and bridges, he really showed the level of skill and production he was able to achieve in his 6 years making albums at that point. It&#39;s lean with only 12 tracks not including the deluxe version, its robust and also minimal at the time. This was the album that set the tone for all rap albums that came after it (Post 2010 rap music), and in my opinion one of the best albums of the last 10 years.Yeezus- 9/10 People don&#39;t like Yeezus because of how different it is and how he used this new style that rappers were adopting of industrial, Daft Punk-esque beats and synths but it really is artful and decadent in its own way. This album, although centered around Kanye, tackles a wider spectrum of things including race and the upper 1% he was apparently rebelling against. This album was a rebel against not just contemporary rap and hip hop standards, it was a middle finger to everyone, its unapologetic, raw, and dark in the way that Kanye isn&#39;t afraid to let down the doors he built up post Graduation era Kanye. That was him releasing everything stacked up against him, the anger, the loss of apparent control in his personal life, the album itself is very liberating and will go down to be classic as maybe not a rap album but a great album, period.
All the songs before So Apalled are a 10/10 for me, absolutely amazing, can&#39;t get into the rest of the album though.
Yea this score seriously perplexes me
Just came here after he gave Flockavelli 1.5 a 7..
Kanye West fans are some of the biggest cunts out there.  Which is fitting since Kanye West is Queen Cunt.  They drool over everything he does like the mindless mouth breathers they are.
So whats the big deal about this review? The man stated his opinion in a calm, clear manner. He didn&#39;t go on a rant. The subject matter just didn&#39;t appeal to him. Why is everyone so fucking butthurt?
I love all the Kanye fanboys still can&#39;t get over this crap. There&#39;s actually a comment saying this review &quot;is embarrassing to watch&quot;. How fucking pretentious can you be? You wouldn&#39;t give a shit if he didn&#39;t include the score. I&#39;ve never seen such butthurt over an album review. My favourite albums are Ride The Lightning, Sad Wings of Destiny and Suffer - if he gave all of them a 6, I wouldn&#39;t give a flying fuck. Crybabies.
how do you give this a 6 but give tpab a 10?? lol
Being that today mark a 5 year anniversary (which is premature to say the least let&#39;s wait to it hits 10 for proper perspective)I love it when everyone loved this album &amp; Anthony gave it a 6 makes me laugh every time 😂😂😂
The College Dropout: 9/10<br>Late Registration: 10/10<br>Graduation: 8/10<br>808s and Heartbreak: 7/10<br>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy: 10/10<br>Yeezus: 7/10

6/10 means that he liked it more than average, anthony doesn&#39;t have to agree with everyone else&#39;s opinion.
He gave the same rating for the bieber album smh
To put it into perspective Justin Bieber&#39;s new album got a 5.
Crazy how he rated so many albums 6&#39;s and they turned out to be amazing haha
1.) Late Registration <br>2.) Fantasy<br>3.)College Dropout <br>4.) Graduation=808s<br>5.) Yeezus
THANK YOU FANTANO FOR NOT BEING A SHEEP AND BLINDLY FOLLOWING WHAT CRITICS SAY
this is like the only review i slightly disagree w lmao ily fantano
this album is a 6 out of ten to him because unlike everyone else he actually goes into the review with his own personal judgment he&#39;s not a sheep just because everyone is saying great things about it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s great and that&#39;s how a review should be people nowadays buy things because of a critics score Wich is stupid you should go and listen and figure out for yourself and not let other people&#39;s judgment alter what you like or think about things
Imagine if a film critic said they couldn&#39;t watch Citizen Kane because they find newspapers boring. Sure, that&#39;s what Citizen Kane is &quot;about&quot; in narrative but ultimately that isn&#39;t where the quality of the film lies. That is film, a medium so attached to the narrative. Most albums don&#39;t even offer any kind of story or lyrical substance, and when Anthony is offered both he just can&#39;t stand it because it&#39;s too boring, despite conceding that the way the story is told is compelling even for those who hate Kanye. I don&#39;t even give a shit about any score, that complaint is so shallow that it&#39;s a wonder how Anthony has retained any kind of audience.
Terriblethony Scoretano
this review was attacked by fanboys... they killed this video
College Dropout - Shit/10<br>Late Registration - Feces/10<br>Graduation - Defecation/10<br>808s &amp; Heartbreak - Horse Shit/10<br>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy - 2 girls 1 cup/10<br>Yeezus -Anal sex after taking a shit and not wiping /10
honestly not even a big kanye fan but god damn this album is fucking gorgeous
This. Review. Makes. Me. Cry. Every. Night.
Not a very good review at the time and it has only soured with age. I&#39;m sorry Anthony.
young anthony.. no idea what can of worms he unleashed with this review.. so pure
this still angers me
I am convinced Anthony fantano just hates most fantastic albums.
I like this album but to me its overrated
Anthony, you look slimming.
MBDTF is so overrated. I don&#39;t get how people think it&#39;s his best. To me, it&#39;s one of his worst albums. IMO this is how his albums should be ranked from best to worst:<br>1. Late Registration<br>2. The College Dropout<br>3. Graduation<br>4. 808&#39;s &amp; Heartbreak<br>5. My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy<br>6. Yeezus
Everything said was on point but then he dropped a 6¿ come on 9.99 at the lowest
You&#39;ve really come a long way with your production, Startedony Fromthebottomtano
Amazing album, I feel like he should give it a second listen
I wonder if your opinion has changed over these past couple of years. I love this album and I don&#39;t even care about kanye&#39;s life. It&#39;s great to listen to. nearly flawless imo
CD: 9/10<br>LR: 10/10<br>Grad: 8/10<br>808s: 8.5/10<br>MBDTF: 10/10<br>Yeezus: 8.5/10
So many butthurt fans here lmao
Still my favorite Kanye album
9/10 to me
I don&#39;t like MBDTF. Come at me.
we are not defined by our past failures anthony
A six!!!!!!!! 😟💥🔫
college dropout 9/10 late registration 8.5/10 graduation 9/10 808 6/10 mbdtf 10/10  yeezus 9.5/10
I love how nobody would complain about this review if he didn&#39;t mention the score.
Maybe Kanye’s beautiful dark twisted fantasy is simply his album cover. Ever thought about that? Prolly not
Wow!!!!! Do u like it now??? You have to
Gives Rodeo an 8/10...
major throwback....
But don&#39;t you like other artists that have very personal stories? I know it might not be as deep as dumb social drama, but he still spits about what he knows.
This review has become a meme
one of the worst album reviews of all time
he fucked up
I think <i>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</i> is a nice album, beautiful even, but it doesn&#39;t do it for me. I think I&#39;ve listened to it in its entirety twice, and the select few songs on the same level that I replay his other albums, especially <i>Yeezus</i>, which has been my favorite so far (and maybe because it was the first album I tried of his); but, even that being said, I will always regard <i>Late Registration</i> as his finest work to date. You want to talk about an ambitious album? LR has all the ticks that Dark Fantasy has and did them several times better, in my opinion, not quite as cinematic or spanning as Dark Fantasy, but definitely, in my taste, the superior album. I regard his whole Dropout Trilogy as some of his best work, I mean <i>Graduation</i> was basically a greatest hits album (the first six tracks are themselves iconic, not to mention &quot;Flashing Lights&quot; and &quot;Homecoming&quot; in the latter half of the album), and need we even talk about TCD? The appeal of a great deal of Kanye&#39;s work--even including 808s--just isn&#39;t there, for me, in Dark Fantasy. It&#39;s lush, it&#39;s cinematic, but for me it was boring. I mean, the only songs most people will ever recall of that album are &quot;All of the Lights&quot;, &quot;Power,&quot; and &quot;Runaway,&quot; obviously, but as for the rest of it, I&#39;m somewhat impartial to. I don&#39;t know, my uneducated opinion I guess haha.
Im probably the only guy that likes this album the least of Kanye&#39;s stuff
Giving this album a 6 is like giving to Pimp a Butterfly a 0
If you don&#39;t think kanye has some of the best albums of all times than you just haven&#39;t listened to them
College Dropout - 9<br>Late Registration - 9<br>Graduation - 7.5<br>808&#39;s &amp; Heartbreak - 3.5<br>MBDTF - 9<br>Yeezus - 4
kanye&#39;s not a good rapper. kanye&#39;s not a good singer. he is a good producer. he&#39;s very creative in that regard. so overrated though.
College Dropout 10/10<br>MBDTF 9/10<br>Late Registration 9/10<br>808s and Heartbreak 6/10<br>Yeezus 7/10<br>Graduation 5/10
I truly believe that no one should judge you as a reviewer based on this review only
Does anyone know the end music on this video?
This still remains his most wackest review he ever did.
anyone who rates mbdtf 10/10 is an entry level listener. album&#39;s doo.
Needle drop you still think its a 6 ? Lol anything less then an 8 is unacceptable
This review was way too much, I need a moment.
&quot;This is just my opinion&quot; - Anthony Fantano
This is a classic dafuq is wrong with u 
Grow up, it&#39;s just his opinion
I wish I was able to add 1,000 more dislikes
The Dislike squad had it right on this one.
dam kanye stans dont even know LR is his best album and that is a fact<br>cd 9/10<br>lr 9.5/10<br>grad 8/10<br>808 6/10<br>mbdtf 9/10<br>yeezus 3/10
I can&#39;t even get mad at Fantano because of how thorough and independent his reviews are. I&#39;ve always disagreed, but I have immense respect for the man.
College Dropout - 9/10<br>Late Registration - 9/10<br>Graduation - 8.5/10<br>808s - 8/10<br>MBDTF - 10/10<br>Watch The Throne - 8/10<br>Cruel Summer - 7.5/10<br>Yeezus - 8.5/10
The only thing he resonated with from the whole album was<br><br><br><br><br>the nerd joke........................................................................................................ .........................................Cmon Fantano.
For all of the positive things he said, a 6/10?  Really?  It&#39;s a modern day masterpiece.
everything he said is completely fair. he kinda lowballed his score, but his complaints were valid
Hmmm. I&#39;ve seen a lot of music critics praise an album based on the situations surrounding the artist, but I&#39;ve rarely seen them undermine an album based on factors outside the music.
The College Dropout 10/10<br>Late Registration 9/10<br>Graduation 10/10<br>808s &amp; Heartbreak 9.5/10<br>MBDTF 10/10<br>Watch The Throne 8.5/10<br>Yeezus 9/10
Look at all the Kayne butthurt fanboys.
this album is a FUCKING MASTERPIECE, FUCK ANTHONY, FUCK CRITICS AND THEIR STUPID ASS REVIEWS, thankyou kanye for giving us the dopest shit ever
It&#39;s his opinion fuckwits. He can express it without getting hate can&#39;t he?<br><br>Kanye is the best artist in my opinion, and i love the sheer majority of his tracks, but damn can the man review the piece and not get all the shade?
White guys love kanye<br>Just ask george bush 
What&#39;s the song playing at the end of the video...it sounds so good 
Honestly, Runaway is such an amazing, beautiful song
If he had given TPAB a 6, I would have gotten so angry. I can see where this doesn&#39;t appeal to everyone, but how can you not like TPAB?
Dang! More than half of people hate this video?
College Dropout - 10/10<br>Late Registration - 9/10<br>Graduation - 8.5/10<br>808&#39;s &amp; Heartbreak - 7/10<br>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy - 9.5/10<br>Yeezus - 4/10<br><br>You were way off on this one, man.
LMAO
College dropout 10/10 late registration 9/10 graduation 9/10 808s 7.5/10 mbdtf 10/10 wtt 7/10 yeezus 9/10

Butthurt kanye fans everywhere, bet they didnt even watch the whole review &lt;3
What was the name of that beautiful song playing at the end?
6/10 isn&#39;t even that bad
Man when I hear the 6 rating I just can&#39;t believe it. this album is easily an 8 at the very least judging by your ratings on other hip hop albums. For me personally this and Graduation compete for my favorite Kanye album
he said hooks on mbdtf sucked ? damn last time i checked mbdtf had one of the best hooks !!
The College Dropout- 8.8<br>Late Registration- 10<br>Graduation- 7.9<br>808 &amp; Heartbreak- 6<br>MBDTF- 8.5<br>Yeezus- 9
vintagano
I have listening to this album, and am honestly doesn&#39;t get the hype. Lyrical delivery, pretty mediocre except from POWER. Beats, not really something special or unique unlike the production from example Dj Premier. The content, what the heck was &quot;Runaway&quot; about? &quot;Let&#39;s toast for the blablabla&quot;. Just give me some proper rapping and not some rambling!<br><br>This album is just mediocre, 5/10. Not really putting this in the category of greatest albums. Here are my list of the Top 5 Rap Albums Ever Existed:<br><br>1. MF Doom - Operation Doomsday<br>2. Deltron 3030 - 3030<br>3. Run The Jewels - Run The Jewels II<br>4. Notorious B.I.G - Ready To Die<br>5. Freddie Gibbs &amp; Madlib - Cocaine Pinata
God, these comments are idiotic.<br>Not Anthony&#39;s.
I used to respect your opinion until I saw this video. Embarrassing to be honest.
Damn even the video description makes it sound like he&#39;s gonna say 8 or something even with the negative part. and bam 6/10 lmao
This album is widely considered one of the best albums of the 21st Century of any genre and you give it a fucking 6/10?? smh normally you got good tasted but this deserves minimum 9/10
Kanye was singing without autotune to show his fragileness and flaws in Runaway, fits the song perfectly.
True
10/10 for eternity
You giving MMLP2 a better score than this killed three beautiful puppies
a 6? you gave the best hip hop album of the last 10 years a 6??????????
Have you ever considered going back and re-reviewing albums that your opinion may have changed on over time? I&#39;m not sure where you stand on this currently but I definitely think this might deserve a re-review
listening to my beautiful dark twisted fantasy did not make me interested in hip-hop.  it made me more open to listening to hip-hop, (and made me feel cool,) but like anthony, i didn&#39;t vibe with the lyrical topics.  on the other hand, good kid m.A.A.d city made me fall in love with hip-hop.  it&#39;s currently my favorite music genre, all thanks to kendrick lamar, not kanye west.
unrelated, i find it funny that pitchfork thinks joni mitchell is the only female artist with a perfect album.
Low 6.............
So appalled was so lame,  Jay&#39;s verse was so wack that I rolled my eyes like only two line got stucked to me, Swizz beats hook was meh and monster was meh too only good thing was Nicki and I&#39;m not a Nicki Minaj fan. 
The College Dropout: 10/10<br>Late Registration: 8/10<br>Graduation: 9/10<br>808&#39;s &amp; Heartbreaks: 7/10<br>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy: 7/10<br>Watch The Throne: 7/10<br>Yeezus: 5/10
Kanye is a legend I don&#39;t always like what he says but at least he is honest I feel like this dude is bias as shit
a lot of idiots from /mu/ jack off to this album, but if you can get past the gay fans this album really was ahead of its time
Honestly, I am someone who thinks MBDTF is one of the greatest albums of all time, but theneedledrop is 100% on point with this review. The production and sound are objectively great, but what makes Kanye&#39;s albums so amazing (particularly this one and Yeezus) is the context of himself within pop culture, and how the tracks are extremely personal and specific to him.<br><br>If Kanye was not the amazing pop icon that he is, his songs would be lauded, but not to the extent that they are right now. If other artists tried this similar approach to their albums it just wouldn&#39;t work. And that is why Kanye&#39;s earlier albums before pop icon status (particularly the College Dropout, and Late Registration) are not as overtly personal as his later works (MBDTF and Yeezus).<br><br>If you don&#39;t care about Kanye like Anthony, the album will lose much of its appeal. But if you are fascinated with Kanye like I am, MBDTF and Yeezus are more likely to stand out as legendary, groundbreak albums.
All these insufferable Kayne West fans on the comments. Ugh.
6/10?<br>You know you done f&#39;d up, right?
College Dropout- 10<br>Late Registration- 8<br>Graduation- 8.5<br>808s &amp; Heartbreaks- 7.5<br>MBDTF- 9<br>Yeezus- 9.5
I&#39;m sure this guy has some good, educated opinions but this review was a joke from the 10 second mark. It&#39;s very clear he&#39;s biased in a certain direction. I stumbled upon this video while listening to songs from the album and this will be the first and only video from this guy that I&#39;ll watch. He shows himself to be an immature female here. What a clown.
I&#39;m not mad about the score because this album is actually the best of the past decade (although that is true). I&#39;m mad because you talked about the album in an almost entirely positive light, saying that you thought the lyrics were interesting, the production was some of the best you&#39;ve heard in a while, and that you liked the structure of the album, and THEN gave it a 6. Bad hooks do not equal a bad album. The way you talked about it, I would&#39;ve guessed at least an 8. It really does seem like you gave it a low score just to stir up controversy. 
why do people think this is such a bad review? he made some good points imo
College Dropout - 9/10<br>Late Registration - 10/10<br>Graduation - 8.5/10<br>808s &amp; Heartbreak - 8/10<br>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy - 10/10<br>Yeezus - 8.5/10<br><br>Huge Kanye fan, this album is one of his two masterpieces to me. You were really off on this one, Fantano. Then again, that&#39;s just how I see it.
I actually think this review, while out of sync with the time, was quite prescient. For me at least. When MBDTF came out I loved it. These days though I find it a bit boring, and it&#39;s largely to do with the reasons mentioned here. I just don&#39;t care about what Kanye has to say about himself. It was exciting in a tabloid kinda way at the time but it doesn&#39;t retain much value for me. And it&#39;s not that an artist shouldn&#39;t express themselves either, it&#39;s that what he has to say isn&#39;t very interesting.
I love this album yet I completely agree with all the negatives about it. Kanye really doesn&#39;t touch on any real social topics or even remotely interesting story lines. His beats and rhymes are suck as hell as always but this is junk food for the brain compared to some of Kendricks albums or Biggie etc. 
Most overrated album of the last 10 years. It&#39;s ostentatious, over the top to a fault, and features some weaaaaak verses. If it was a mixtape it&#39;d be the best mixtape ever, but as an album it&#39;s a decent 7 imo
wow…the flaws you pointed out are so wrong 
College Dropout-9/10<br>Late Registration-9.5/10<br>Graduation-8.5/10<br>808&#39;s and Heartbreak-9/10<br>MBDTF-10/10<br>Yeezus-9/10<br><br>WTT-8.5/10<br>Cruel Summer-7/10
I obviously think this album is a 10/10 but it&#39;s his opinion. The only thing I have a problem with in this review is: How do you judge someone on making music about themselves? During this time in his life his mother had died, broke up with his finance, and just reached the height of his fame. He was at his musical peak. You can&#39;t judge someone&#39;s music for being about themselves because that&#39;s just why we love Kanye tbh
and i have unsubed
If you listen to what he actually says and stop focusing on the &quot;6&quot; aspect - he doesn&#39;t condemn it. He literally says, &quot;I enjoyed a lot of what I heard here&quot;.
College Dropout - 8.5/10<br>Late Registration - 9.5/10<br>Graduation - 9/10<br>808s and Heartbreaks - 8/10<br>MBDTF - 10/10<br>Watch The Throne - 6/10<br>Yeezus - 4/10 
The College Dropout - 9<br>Late Registration - 8.5<br>Graduation - 9.5<br>808 - 7.5<br>MBDTF - 8.5<br>Yeezus - 7.0
Very rare first needle drop review I watched. This shit got me butthurt 
Alright, I&#39;m not a Kanye fan at all, but I just listened to this album for the first time and I think it&#39;s pretty good. The only song I was even tempted to skip was Lost in the World, not really a fan of that one.
So, this is the review everyone is talking about? Lol nice Anthony!
The fuck y&#39;all talking about album of the century? this is the best album of ALL TIME
anthony fucktano
The College Dropout - 7.5/10<br>Late Registration - 8/10<br>Graduation - 8.5/10<br>808s &amp; Heartbreak - 9/10<br>MBDTF - 9.5/10<br>Yeezus - 10/10<br><br>Watch The Throne - 8/10<br>Cruel Summer  - 5/10
I thought Deep Puddle Dynamics:  The Taste of Rain... Why Kneel was much, much better.  But i like thought provoking material.
Ok, so, I&#39;m not really into rap, I prefer a melody, but my brother and other people have told me that  told m that this album is amazing.<br><br>But the thing is no one is ever able to tell me a specific reason why, or at least compare it to another album and tell me why it&#39;s better.<br><br>I get the feeling that people just overate this album because it has a different sound to other hip hop albums, and maybe it has elements of a more vocally driven/melodic album.<br><br>And maybe the people listening to it who think it is great ,may not have heared other albums from a different genre that perhaps this album might be inspired by. I really don&#39;t know I&#39;m just guessing here.<br><br>I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is can someone please tell me in an intelligent way why MBDTF is so great, with some objective, and critical reasons, rather than just personal reasons like &quot;it still gets me till this day&quot;.<br><br>Thanks
what /mu/ thinks about this review?
People are only saying this album is a 10/10 because Pitchfork said it is. 
Wow. Looking back five years later... this is a TERRIBLE review. Good to know to take anything you say with a rather large grain of salt.
When I first listened to this album, I was all in on it being one of the best albums on the decade. Going back and listening to it now... Well<br><br>8/10
Can somebody please explain the appeal of this album? I listened to it and I agree 100% with this review. Am I missing something?
6,,,
this album was aite, a few good songs the rest meh
@Dark Knight <br><br>I agree and I love Run tha Jewels btw... i see your profile pic :P My favoute from kanye;<br>MBDTF &amp; Graduation
LOOLOLOLOL :D THIS OLD VIDEO =D
Ein Heldenleben (A Hero&#39;s Life), Op. 40 is a tone poem by Richard Strauss. The piece is considered among many to the pinnacle of its composer&#39;s many tone poems: of which included the now iconic Also Sprach Zarathustra. The poem recounts the story of some great hero, doing heroic deeds. These deeds are made clear through the programmic subtitles to every movement. &quot;The Hero&#39;s Adversaries.&quot; &quot;The Hero at Battle.&quot; And of course, the fantastical &quot;The Hero&#39;s Retirement from this World and Consummation.&quot; The work is a triumphant journey by a triumphant composer, considered among the greatest of the Romantics.<br><br>That being said, the composition received criticism for something rather unexpected: the so-called Hero it is endebted to. Strauss himself claims the Hero is not any particular person, but rather the mythical depiction of a hero. However, many cues regarding the composition make it clear that the Hero is actually, somewhat narcissistic-ly, Strauss himself! The piece, though sounding of enormous stature and grave importance, is just a shallow, self congratulatory maneuver. Despite this, however, the piece is still held in high esteem. Mainly, due to its clear musical strengths and its true culmination in Strauss&#39; deft compositional skill.<br><br>Why mention this? Well, plenty of people (notably, The Melonhead himself: Anthony Fantano) dismiss My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, saying &quot;It&#39;s just about Kanye&#39;s life! Who cares about that except fans?&quot; This criticism is equivalent to the critic who slights Heldenleben simply because of its self-congratulation: and arguably, just as shallow. <br><br>Consider the music for its own strengths. Don&#39;t get so caught up into extramusical facts that detract from the music.
6/10 for the greatest album of the 2010&#39;s so far?
Nigga are you dumb a 6/10 lmfao it&#39;s the greatest album of all time.
Time to RE-review this album buddy.
You dont have the answers 
The 2k dislike 👏😁
I will try to review this without too much bias<br>MBDTF<br>Production:9/10 Probably some of the best production in a hip hop album ive ever heard<br>Lyrics: 4/10 some is good, but alot of annoying egoism and random stuff<br>Beats:8/10 Not the best, but this is DAMN good, way better than most<br>Catchiness:8/10 Pretty Catchy<br>Vocals:4/10 Some is good, but alot of annoying autotune and kanye&#39;s flow isnt the greatest thing ever<br>Lasting appeal: 7/10 Will last you a while but not the &quot;timeless music that lasts forever&quot; that kanye fans hype him up to be<br>Overall Strong 6 to light 7
Nicki minaj owns this album with one verse
I&#39;m sure Fantano&#39;s opinion has changed over the years, calm the fuck down everyone.<br><br>(because everyone else is doing this)<br><br>MBDTF - 9.5/10<br>Yeezus - 9/10<br>Late Registration - 9/10<br>College Dropout - 8/10<br>Graduation - 8/10<br>808&#39;s - 7/10
Might be the worst rating you&#39;ve EVER gave. Wow. 
Old review but this album is without a shadow the absolute classic of the past 15 years easily. The last album this good was the marshall mathers LP arguably. 
Listen, if fantano wants to give it a slightly lower rating because of the subject matter thats fine. But the fact that he said it had great production and lyrics but still gave it a 6 is ridiculous.
To answer your question Anthony, i think My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is a reference to the american dream<br>Not 100% sure though
I&#39;ve tried to love this album, but I just don&#39;t really believe it deserved all the hype it got in complete honesty. I think there are definitely some good tracks here, but people hail Kanye as a prophet when all he did was get overly ambitious. If this record wasn&#39;t slathered in expensive production sounds and a gauntlet of big name features, I don&#39;t think this album would be nearly as well-received, which in my mind means this record has several crutches that people barely seem to notice. 
FUCK YOU
Can you review Nicki Minajs Pink Print album?
Man, the butthurt about this review. You know, I think he&#39;s slightly off (I&#39;d give it a strong 7) but who cares? Not everyone has got the same taste. I think part of the reason why people are so butthurt is because their perception of his rating scale is off. Too many people rate stuff as if 7/10 is mediocre  which is completely irrational. I don&#39;t think so many people would be calling for 10/10 if they really knew how orgasmic an album has to be to get that rating.
All of your other videos are overwhelmingly given the thumbs up. This one isn&#39;t? I smell something. And it smells like d-bag Kayne told his followers to come give this video the thumbs-down. ha. p.s. i think you gave a great review. it seemed fair, honest, and professional.
Am I the only one who hated Lost In The World?
I love how I can watch this video over four years after it came out and people are still pissed off about it in the comments.
This has to be his most disliked video (percentage wise), and for good reason. 
kanye fans just suckin each others dicks in these comments lol
Shits a 9.5-10
I&#39;m not even a fan of Kanye West, but I love this album.
bro your not a deep music lover just a guy with a youtube page and this shows for it cause that album to this day is THE BEST ARTFULLY DEEP HIP HOP ALBUM
can&#39;t respect a 6 here. One of the greatest of all time
My Butchered Dark Twisted Review - Anthony Fantano
How I view it:<br>Lyrics are a 4/10<br>Beats are a 12/10<br>8/10 overall.
I want to you to re-review this album one day. From all your fans and Kanye fans, that would be awesome.
Timeless Album this absolutely deserves 10/10
doesn&#39;t care about social drama* talks about social drama* 
unsubscribed  
wow i thought this review was going to go in depth with each song.wrong! just talks and talks about nothing really...just a really generic basic review. smh 
to get past kanye rapping about himself you have to appreciate the concept that its about him/for himself (a lot of artists do this). he started the album with &#39;MY&#39;... BDTF. still its kind of just a filler for the listener
There are few albums in existence that truly deserve a 10/10, and this is one of them.
You done fucked up you bitch
Im trying to like this album but just cant. The production is amazing. I might buy the instrumental instead but idk. Lyrically its not that great to me. Being a huge classic/old school hip hop fan, ive heard far superior lyricism. College dropout is better than this album in my OPINION. I repeat, in my OPINION. I do love dark fantasy though, but maybe that has something to do with rza helping produce that track. 
Watch the full length movie of runaway you&#39;ll understand why kanye is just a genius
You should leeave if you can&#39;t accept the bay-sicks.
My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is overrated omg. It&#39;s good but people are making it seem that it&#39;s one of the greatest albums. No matter how many people say it is I don&#39;t think so, I honestly prefer Yeezus. I&#39;d like the &quot;amazing&quot; Runaway much better if he didn&#39;t sing in it. I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t like it like that. 
IMO this album is a strong 7. The only that drags this thing down is three tracks I just hated the single Monster being #1 worst song on the album in my opinion not because eof the beat but more cause I was unimpressed with the lyrics. Though there are a lot of amazing tracks on this record the single Power and the songs Devil in a New Dress stand and Dark Fantasy stand out to me the most. 
10 kid 
9.4, amazing album, best tracks: Dark Fantasy, Gorgeous, Power, Monster, Devil In A New Dress, Runaway, Lost In The World.
Most overrated album ever. Period.
This album and Kid A are the only albums that are a 10 for me. 10 isn&#39;t perfection, because I don&#39;t even know what &quot;perfection&quot; would sound like, but it&#39;s just that these two albums were so extraordinary that to this day I can listen to them from start to finish and still feel complete exhilaration. Of course, you&#39;ve listened to way more music than I have, but out of the music I&#39;ve been exposed to, it doesn&#39;t get much better than this.
4 years later it becomes the album of the century on GQ
9/10<br>FAV TRACKS: Dark Fantasy, Gorgeous, Monster, Devil in a New Dress, Runaway, Blame Game, Lost in the World<br>Least Fav: So Appalled
kanye vs anthony. the war is on.
God these comments make me ashamed of being a Kanye fan. Just because it&#39;s the best rated hip-hop album of all time after Illmatic doesn&#39;t mean that Anthony has to like it. This is his channel, not yours. If you don&#39;t agree back the fuck off.
ARE YOU DUMB FAM? ARE YOU DUMB?!
Lmao, this album is a classic. 9.5/10 gtfo
GQ ranked mbdtf as the #1 album of the century. critically acclaimed across the boards. Its also considered a top 10 hip hop record of all time. Fantano needs his ears checked. 
I love the album but the amount of butthurt in the comments is too damn high. I also guarantee that if Pitchfork, Rolling Stone, and every other music review site gave this a 6/10 instead of a 10, half of you guys wouldn&#39;t be saying this album was perfect.  My favorite Kanye album is Late Registration.  Like MBDTF, the production and rhymes were there.  However, MBDTF is DRENCHED in guest features.  Like for All of the Lights, Kanye just grabbed random singers that weren&#39;t even necessary, like who the fuck actually noticed that Drake and John Legend were on there.  And why was Kid Cudi on Gorgeous if all he did was the hook?  Kanye could&#39;ve done that hook just as well.  And don&#39;t even get me started on RZA as a guest feature on So Appalled or Rick Ross on Monster.  This album is way too overprocessed for lack of a better word.  Kanye grabbed features for the sake of grabbing features, and that definitely takes away from the album.  Plus Kanye&#39;s older albums had more personal and topical songs like Jesus Walks, Roses, Addiction, etc.  There&#39;s a lot of relationship drama on this album like Runaway, Blame Game, Devil in a New Dress.  Like I don&#39;t find it as annoying as Fantano does, I can understand where he&#39;s coming from.  Also, why is Hell of a Life in this album.  As far as a song it&#39;s not that great, and it completely messes up the mood after Runaway.  But that&#39;s just my personal gripe.  It&#39;s still a great album, but people take the image Kanye&#39;s trying to put forth too seriously.
i see your point of view, but i don&#39;t get it.. how can you give THE HEIST an 8 and this masterpiece a 6? come on, anthony, this album deserved more! 
I respect your review, after all this is your personal rating.  For me I would definitely give this album a 9
this guy is a fucking idiot who hates kanye west to seem cool, fuck you!
Guys, this is his opinion. Remember? 
I would&#39;ve given it at least an eight.
Im&#39; really surprised how little you&#39;re talking about the narrative in the album, and how little it&#39;s not really about Kanye personally, but rather about a character he&#39;s playing (which comments on his real life), and it&#39;s explicitly not about his personal life.
The fact that you name it &#39;Twisted Fantasy&#39; makes me realise you know shit about the record... It&#39;s referred to in short as- &#39;Dark Fantasy&#39;... show you dumb as far as hip-hop goes...
So this album is as good as magna carta which also got a 6? this is why I don&#39;t watch his reviews loool
He should have said gayview instead of review, since he&#39;s view on this album was hella gay
nigga.
<a href="http://www.metacritic.com/feature/music-critic-top-ten-lists-best-of-2010">http://www.metacritic.com/feature/music-critic-top-ten-lists-best-of-2010</a> <br><br>To be honest we will still be talking about My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy when it tops many best of the decade lists and gets added to many all time album lists 
@theneedledrop looking back would you still give this a 6?
I don&#39;t agree with this review. He gives reviews better scores if he likes the person more.
this is actually one of my fav albums ! i&#39;d give it a much higher score !!!!
I usually like people giving their opinions. Especially him. Even though you are entitled to your opinion but damn. This was a pretty horrible review. Blasphemous at the least. This album is one of the best albums I&#39;ve ever heard and thats rare to say. But who cares about my opinion right? Lol 
I think this is his greatest work right after the college dropout 
Nothing but kanye dick riders in the comments. I&#39;d probably give this a 5-6 too. Besides production, there is nothing special about this album. This is easily the most overrated album of all time. 
Kayne is like a semi matured grown up version of Tyler the creator 
The College Dropout - decent 9<br>Late Registration - light 8<br>Graduation - light 7<br>808s and Heartbreak - strong 6<br>MBDTF - 10<br>Yeezus - strong 7
ayy lmao, anything with more than 5/10 is a good album.
This review made me not take this nerds reviews seriously 
When judging/reviewing Kanye&#39;s music, you always have to separate the lyrics from the music. For I example i love Yeezus but think that most of the lyrics in there suck.
Kanye has never made a bad album.... Well 808&#39;s maybe but MBDTF is his best album with college dropout close second and yeezus is the shit.
Love the Patsy Cline T-shirt.
10/10 loved it 
all those kanye fanboys...
this guy is also one of the biggest j cole haters
I would have given lower, i really don&#39;t see why this album was so loved
Okay you said so much good stuff about the album, but your biggest part of not liking it is because you arent interested in Kanye? Therefore its a 6. As of now this album is debatable to be the greatest hip hop album of all time. A 6 may be humanly impossible to give.
wow you dun fucked up lol
You fcked up on this 1. U talked about beats and production...... What about the story telling and the meaning behind every track  . devil in a new dress,lost in the world,so appalled are the sound tracks of my life. Best rap album I  ever owned. Good review tho....
When you have as many dislikes as likes on this video, i think you know you fucked up the review 
If you&#39;re not interested in his personal life thats fine. But songs are meant to be something you can relate to. His longs about love definitely do that, so Kanye gets a higher rating from me!
This is the most generic argument for critics. You can call every artist an egotist and make a strong case. How can you fault him for mentioning South Park? He literally threw one bar at them. It was subtle.<br><br>This is just Anthony wanting attention, and I can understand. The world is full of people like Westboro Baptists, who picket funerals of dead soldiers just for attention. People want to be provocative, I get it.<br><br>But that&#39;s what you get when you don&#39;t even listen to the music. Anthony admits that he doesn&#39;t even know the theme of the album, even though the theme is presented by Gil Scott-Heron at the end.<br><br>I know most of you indie people have a hard time coming to terms with an album like MBDTF because it&#39;s Kanye and almost every major critic gave it 5 stars or 10/10 and you just can&#39;t STAND that this album is coveted as a classic. And that&#39;s ok. But at the end of the day, &quot;I know damn well y&#39;all feelin this shit.&quot;
Anthony idontunderstandalbums
What do his personal life gotta do with the album 10/10
WOAT review
The College Dropout 10/10<br>Late Registration 9/10<br>Graduation 8/10<br>808s 7/10<br>MBDTF 9/10<br>Yeezus 8/10
i really disagree with runaway being unrelatable. sure its kinda personal, but its a very general apologetic song. you can relate to it if you ever feel that way. same with blame game
no hate, but who is theneedledrop, is he a rapcritic? is he an artist? hes just a youtuber who talks shit about others albums
My god I hate Kanye West fans... they are so closed-minded to anyone who gives any criticism. He&#39;s not a musical genius. He&#39;s a good producer and a good songwriter, but he&#39;s really not the greatest person in the world.<br><br>Seriously, he says so many good things about the album, yet you dislike his video just because he has a different opinion than you. It&#39;s not like it&#39;s fact that his music is good. Music is subjective. Everyone has opinions. Deal with it.<br><br>That said, I do like the album a little bit. Not a huge fan, though. I&#39;m more of an electronic kind of person. That&#39;s just my opinion, though.
Well this is a really subjective review
terrible review.....he&#39;s not interested in Kanye&#39;s life? It&#39;s not about that.....some people can RELATE to the music, i could care less about Kanye&#39;s life specifically, from an events perspective, but the emotions, the feeling of confusion and anger in Runaway, I can relate to that........terrible review. 
Wow, you&#39;ve come a long way since making this video. Congrats on growth and development. 
How the hell did TrapLord get a 7 and this My Beatiful Dark Twisted Fantsy get a 6.
Dies he ever go over 6
Bored on Runaway? Serious? Song of the year on many critics lists buddy. 
it&#39;s like you guys will totally respect his opinion until it&#39;s different from yours
this is a modern day classic? 10/10 album. Got to respect Anthony&#39;s opinion though.
wow lol
why are people getting butthurt over an album review come on i mean i understand that for some on you this album is a masterpiece but you have to listen and understand what he didnt like on it he said the production was ambitious knaye was delivering some nice rhymes here and there he just didnt like the subject matter which is all the celebrity drama kanye is in you cant expect everybody to be interested in what kanye is rapping about to some people is comes off boring its his opinion let him have an opinion on an album even if its not the same as yours
Fuck you Fantano this album is one of the best albums ever.
damn kanye stans, review was correct
Kanye&#39;s a genius 
YOUR KANYE REVIEWS ARE YOUR ONLY PROBLEM. WHY!!!!!!!!<br>SERIOUSLY DUDE, STOP REVIEWING KANYE ALBUMS BASED ON HATE.
People must have forgotten what an opinion is.
im not interested in his social life so im going to take 4 points off a near perfect album...
I am an Kanye fan, 9/10. That is all. 
You usually have good insight on albums but you&#39;re dead wrong with this album&#39;s low rating. Thumbs down for sure needle drop 
Incredible production, wasnt very impressed lyrically 6/10  
Kanye&#39;s fans always seems to think that Kanye can&#39;t do &quot;nothing short of amazing&quot;.
This is a def hard 9.0 for me,I have mixed feelings about the man but this is to me is the best album/work of art from the guy ever. I absolutely love it.I&#39;m gonna go out on a limb here an say this is the like &quot;the dark side of the moon&quot; of the rap/hip-hop world. It is beautiful and the instrumentals Just pull at your heartstrings. Some of the lyrics are kind of blah and half-assed an stupid. Yet what remains is pure audio heroin.I have never heard a rap/hip-hop/pop album that had such a profound effect on me.I love the little stories and &quot;fantasies&quot; in here. Kanye just bleeds out his desires and shortcomings,he also kind of confronts himself and critiques himself on this album finding out that maybe he is a little superficial and flawed.There is a lot of rap and hip-hop out there that is very good  but lacks a certain dynamic quality.There&#39;s such a perfect balance of foolishness and sincerity on here that when it ends your like wow there is no bullshit here. Kanye really showcases his eccentricity on here (especially with the short film) and it leaves me feeling that when he does this he really makes some spectacular profound music.
This is a near perfect album. Fantano lost some credibility with this one.
this is my favorite Kanye album. 9.5/10. i love the extended &quot;runaway&quot; track. and i love &quot;blame game&quot; (it&#39;s insulting that he didn&#39;t mention Chris Rock&#39;s hilarious ft). or that Elton John, Raekwon, and Rza also appeared on the album. i am VERY disappointed in this review and you&#39;re entitled to your opinion but this will be my first needledrop thumbs down. let us MBDTF fans be grateful this album won six grammys, our opinion won in the end.
*your
You&#39;re a great critic Anthony, but I disagree with this review. I loved this album but hey, you&#39;re opinion
10/10
you said the beats are great, the lyrics are a saving grace, therefore 6/10
Still can&#39;t believe this only got a 6.
watch this. then, watch the el-p review for cancer 4 cure. exact same
i love you anthony but i love this album more
I know this is kind of unrelated, I just saw an album review of angles by the strokes which he gave a 7/10 and then I saw that he gave this a 6/10. I understand that music is all subjective but come on seriously! I love the strokes but that album was in no sense better than this work of genius, this album is completely faultess, the production is outstanding and the lyrics are the best kanye has ever done
If its true that the HEIST by MACKLEMORE got 7/10 and this got 6/10.. well... you&#39;re a bald fucking idiot 6/10 is ridiculous anyways
Best Kanye album 9/10 <br>
This album was damn near perfect just got it love it so much 
Easy 8/10 minimum. 
Oh my god u guys r such followers shut the hell up it&#39;s his opinion 
The only reason he doesn&#39;t like it as much as u dicks is because he studies it and listens to it and focuses I like this album too but he&#39;s doing a job not just listing to music  
I hate how people think Anthony has no interest and doesn&#39;t like his own thing f anyone who says he&#39;s wrong he&#39;s an amazing reviewer I&#39;ve disagreed w him sometimes but that&#39;s why God made us different so stfu about him bein wrong u the best Anthony 
can anyone (includiing you A.F.) recall a review of a hip hop album that has really good hooks?
Fantano: Great production and great rhymes, but everyone else loves it so &quot;light 6.&quot;<br><br>&quot;He only raps about himself.&quot; First of all, how is he different from any other rapper then? You don&#39;t seem to knock anyone else for this. Why is Kanye special? Second, on the album&#39;s biggest hit, All of the Lights, he doesn&#39;t even mention himself. He&#39;s rapping from the average person&#39;s perspective. It seems like you&#39;re just trying find things to knock because you don&#39;t want to give it a good review.<br><br>&quot;The hooks are generic.&quot; This is subjective obviously, but the only hooks I&#39;d consider just alright are the ones you mentioned: So Appalled and Hell of a Life (disagree on All of the Lights). The rest are insanely good. How are you about to say the album has bad hooks when 80% are great. Name another album with as many awesome hooks as MBDTF.<br><br>Also, how can you do a review of this album without mentioning Gorgeous? That&#39;s like reviewing GKMC and not mentioning Sing About Me/Dying of Thirst. Gorgeous contains three of the best verses I&#39;ve ever heard from any rapper. If they were on separate tracks they&#39;d still be GOAT verses, but Kanye strings all three in a row. Every line is a double or triple entendre and the flow is immaculate. And this is over a classic Kanye beat. The song has a fucking guitar solo playing throughout it. God dammit Fantano.<br><br>You care way too much about what other people think of things. Anything that&#39;s popular or &quot;mainstream&quot; as you say gets an average rating and anything more obscure like Death Grips gets 8s and above. It&#39;s so painfully obvious you do this on purpose to seem cool (cool to yourself at least). You&#39;re the textbook definition of a hipster.
you are a fucking ass hat. This album is pure musical gold. 
You should review one of Aphex  Twin&#39;s albums.
comments section: &#39;WAAAAAAH!!!! why didn&#39;t he agree with me????!!!!&#39;
I would give this album a strong 9/10...I thought it was absolutely amazing
You shouldn&#39;t review albums based off a score system. Because when you compare scores it&#39;s just bullshit...Like what are you basing it off of..
I&#39;m sorry but 6/10 is just ridiculous
You need to redo the reviews on 3/4 of your videos. I feel like all the mainstream albums you give either a 5 or a 6...
I agree with you. This album was very average.
Man, and I thought people cried over the Arctic Monkeys review! Some hilarious sob comments on this video. 
lets just pause and consider the fact, that he gave longliveasap a higher review than this
You might not not like my opinion but... I think this is the greatest rap album of all time!!! 
I think this album was the decline.
Anthony, you really need to fathom the weight of all the &quot;flaws&quot; on this album. You can&#39;t actually believe that a few &quot;mishaps&quot; drown this near-perfect album out to a 6/10. 
I get the feeling that a lot of idiots just skipped to the end of the review, saw the 6, and started raging. He made completely sound points and made it clear that this was just how he felt about the album, as he does in every review. But I guess this is what you get when you&#39;re dealing with children who don&#39;t understand the concept of having a personal opinion.
I always ignored this review just because it&#39;s my favorite album, and I know what score he gave it. But after finally watching this, Fantano actually praises the album on a lot of things it does and praises the album for how bold and grandiose it is.<br><br>But I&#39;m just curious if Fantano could ever like another Kanye album, because clearly he doesn&#39;t care about Kanye&#39;s personal life, and his personal life has always been at the forefront of his music.
fuck kanye west. 
damn<br>started from the bottom now u here needledrop
This clown gave MBDTF, a top 10 hip hop album of all time a 6/10?!?! thats just absurd man. youre a terrible hip hop album reviewer. i saw your motm 2 review and you gave that 6/10 i let that slide because some people just dont understand cudi. but you give mbdtf a 6!?! wtf is wrong with you?
I admit that many dickriders this lp, but sometimes I just don&#39;t understand Anthony...I mean you rated the new lady gaga album just like this album? C&#39;mon lady gaga? 
best album ever
Props on giving an honest and objective review. Kanye has too many dick riders praising his music, he&#39;s made some classic material, but mainly due to the fact that he&#39;s a talented producer. He was never and never will be a great rapper, he&#39;s slightly better than average in that category. 
Your worst review ever 
Anthony, you are better off not giving a numeric score because that&#39;s what offends everyone in the end. I love how detailed you are in your reviews and your points are very accurate, yet no one listens because all they hear is &quot;6.&quot;
You all do realize this is a personal opinon
6/10 is absolutely ridiculous, you shouldn&#39;t be a music reviewer.
Devil in a new dress, Lost in the world and Runaway made this for me
This album is beautiful and speaks to me. My life relates to this music and the times in life it brings. You know nothing. You are the hivemind. And prolly never had a real girl friend, cuz if you did this album and the lyrics of relationships and heartbreaks is all through it. Kanye is one of the greatest artist of all time. Every album hes made is fucking dope. Im in Chicago. Kanye is KING.
many publications are ranking this album near the likes of Thriller and Sgt Peppers. 

I have to agree that once 30 years have passed, this album will be held in that regard.
I&#39;d rate this album 9.5/10. That&#39;s because of the grandiose production, and the fact that half (or more) of the songs have meaning behind them. But the question I should as you is...Who&#39;s hivemind?
Amen to that.  I don&#39;t listen to a lot of hip hop/rap, but there are a few exceptions, and MBDTF is without question one of the best albums I&#39;ve heard in the last decade or so, maybe since the chronic.  To me, Kanye is the Thom Yorke of hip hop.

He kind of put his soul into it, and it&#39;s a chilling account of his emotions and what&#39;s going on in his life. It&#39;s bound to be a classic. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s overrated at all
this album is a 10/10 kanyes best album so far until part 2
This album is terrible.
No no no, not at all. Don&#39;t get me wrong. I can totally understand people that like commercial stuff (obviously vast majority of people - otherwise it wouldn&#39;t be commercial), people that like auto-tune and some other groups of people would enjoy this album.
What I don&#39;t get is how the same group of people that praise illmatic, Doe or Die, The Infamous, 36th chamber, mmlp.. as one of the best albums that have ever been put out, enjoys this also. This shit blows my mind.
how the FUCK do you not give this atleast an 8 out of 10?

6 is a fucking joke. He needs to re-review this classic. He will forever lose credibility is he doesn&#39;t. 6! Sindhi
Late registration and college dropout were good (or great), no doubt, but in my opinion, they lacked the &quot;epicness&quot; and overall grandiose MBDTF had. but of course this is a matter of opinion.

And actually, I have listened MMLP1, Tha Carter III, Dra Drought 3, Black Album, How I Got Over, Fishscale and Stankonia, and I own all those albums.
not really. late reg and college dropout were better. also marshall mathers lp1 + encore - eminem, tha carter 3 + da drought 3- lil wayne, black album - jay-z, how i got over - the roots, relax - das racist, m.i.a.&#39;s three albums, fishscale - ghostface killah, stankonia - outkast

listen to these 14 albums, before you say this was the best of the decade. (i&#39;m talking about albums released between the beginning of 2000 and the release of mbdtf).

yes, though, it should definitely be a strong 8.
how is this album not at leas a 8/10 this album has great production, creativity, and lyrics
It&#39;s so fun to watch the dickriding Kanye-fans try to persuade people with different opinions  into having the same opinion as them
I&#39;m not offended by Fantano not quite loving this album. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s an utter masterpiece like most people do. I&#39;m just offended by the fact that Runaway isn&#39;t in his top tracks.
Agreed.
Rating it 6 means it should be a blow off album. I may be bias towards kanye but this album has to be atleast a 8 for anyone with some music sense. 
So I&#39;m the only one who agrees with his score
If you are seriously considering this album to the best release of this decade, I don&#39;t think you don&#39;t listen to alot of music. In my opinion, Kanye became so extremely boring when he decided to move on from socially conscious and soulful rap (College Dropout, Late registration) to the egotistical, over-the-top and autotuned music that is Yeezus. This album is OK though but i find Late Registration to be a much better album
He considers Enter the Wu Tang: 36 Chambers and Madvillainy to be two of his favorite albums
Death grips - he gave it 10/10
fuk off 
He gave GKMC a solid 9 I think.
Does he like any hip hop album ive never seen him give any rap album higher than a 7
This album is 10/10 if kanye didnt have two other perfect albums ( college dropout, late registration) this would be his best album but none the less album still a classic and still the best album so far of this decade
Blasphemous! I really can&#39;t see how you can rate this 6/10! The fact that you gave Yeezus a 5 (which was creative) may be seen as a slight hatred towards Ye. And on top of that you give MCHG a 6 (same as MBDTF) is just preposterous and ludicrous. This review is just embarrassing. 
Anthony I love your videos. You are the man I go to get my music reviews and have been for a while now. I love the fact that you try to express that this is just your opinion as well. 

With that being said, You know good and well that this album is a God Damn Classic.
This is possibly the worst review on YouTube. Or maybe just the worst review is the history of the internet. It&#39;s like you just make negative comments, just for the sake of making them. this is at least 9/10
I&#39;d give it a strong 6 to light 7
Whatever he rated it is his opinion. But just like peoples opinions they change. Some albums take awhile to get into. I wasn&#39;t head over heals this album at first, but I slowly discovered the album song by song. Its just one of those things
ahahaha from everything you just said, it makes no sense to give it a 6, a 7-8 to what you said would of made sense.
I thought he gave this a 3 or 4
I know you said kanye didnt get death grips inspiration and i hate death grips i think they horrible. But how exactly does yeezus sounds like death grips? cause hes rapping to techno beats.. kanye was doing that before death grips or is it the beats like the screaming samples and all the stuff going around in their instrumentals? just askin cause i heard this from a lot of people some have even gone as far to say. &quot;kanye stole death grip sound&quot; and stuff along those lines
LIGHT 6? Tha fuck you smokin fantano? you say madvilliany is a &quot;flawless&quot; album turn around and rate this a 6.Meaning you putting a kanye album in the same category as a tyler the creator album
LMFAO 6? This guys an idiot, i will never watch another video of yours again you fuckin idiot.
Music is like a picture lol...some people see it diffrently
I feel sick after seeing this review
I don&#39;t know why anyone takes this guy seriously. Music is subjective on the person listening to it so why judge an album based on what one guy thinks?! Even when this one guy rated one of the the best rap albums which is considered &#39;perfect&#39; a SIX! out of ten.
I think I fell in love with a pornstar!  And got married in the bathroom....Honeymoon on the dancefloor.  And got divorced by the end of the niiiiight!!!!!  
the production team who worked with Kanye on Yeezus have said what their inspirations were and when asked if Death Grips was ever one of them, they said no. Death Grips is not the first band to create that sound, my friend. 
You just give literally everything a 6/10 except for Death Grips.
Okay, everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but I can&#39;t see why would anyone rate this album below 9/10 or 8/10. I mean, this may well be one of the greatest pop/hip hop releases of past decade
you shouldn&#39;t read and watch reviews to reaffirm your own opinion.
Kanye is one of the most mainstream underground artists. I can tell by the death grips inspired yeezus he has his eat to the underground. I feel he makes music like that In a way that is accessible to all the people that don&#39;t have their ear to the sidewalk. He&#39;s always been known as a trendsetter but even when he jumps on the industrial inspired stuff i still dig it. All my opinions as says the needledrop himself. I&#39;m not trying to be a shit starter. I ain&#39;t got time for that shit haha
I feel like the way you were speaking about felt like a 7 at least. I really love this album, it&#39;s in my personal Top 10, but I understand where you&#39;re coming from.
mbdtf is still better than late registration and the college dropout in my opinion. 
This is def a 9/10 album. It&#39;s almost flawless and the only reason I don&#39;t give it a 10/10 is because of sub-par collabs and the very last track of the album.
so this got a 6 because you don&#39;t care? SOOOOOOOO FUCKING BIASED
Thank fuck, I was beginning to think that I&#39;m the only person to think this album is nothing special.
I understand. After all, I think he&#39;s better as a producer than a rapper. One question? How can Yeezus be a copy of Death Grips? They&#39;re not the first industrial/Experimental band or something like that
Really? Isn&#39;t MBDTF over-rated as well? People keep expressing how this was a masterpiece. Something never heard before. Sure it&#39;s good for kanye to be innovative but for a Rap album, it doesn&#39;t quite hold a candle like LR and TCD. Kanye West was a way better lyricists then he was after Grad. mbdtf is a great album, but LR had more classics tracks to be a better rap album. Yeezus is actually good. Not the best lyrics but far from bad &amp; the production can get you pumped. Again, he&#39;s innovative. 
BEST ALBUM EVER
I agree. LR is the best album Kanye dropped 
This album is a masterpiece. It has crazy beats and hooks. I never heard a song that mixes Baroque, rock and hip-hop into one bundle. I just found that amazing. The soul samples are great and the songs with the piano are so dramatic and raw but still so lush an produced to the maximum. The lyrics are superb and the guest features are phenomenal. Which other hip-hop artist would get Elton John to sing on a track with them? 10/10
Meh. I think this album gets way too much hype. It&#39;s a dope album, no doubt about that, but can&#39;t say it&#39;s Kanye&#39;s best work. The production is good, the featuring artists did good, and Kanye&#39;s lyrics it&#39;s alright. I&#39;m personally think either The College Dropout or Late Registration is better and should be up there as hip-hop classics
My thoughts exactly. It has some great tracks (Dark Fantasy, Monster, AOTL (Interlude))  and no track is THAT bad (except for So Appalled IMO), but if I were to average out my scores for each individual track, my score would be 6.7.
i think the 6 is due in part to how crippling the minor mistakes are 
its a very polarizing album if you look at it in a certain light
this is the worst review ever ahahahaha
I mean it deserves a 6 though.
I honestly think this is the best non gangster/Non OG Big Brother album ever made or will ever be made.
Maybe that says more about me than about Kanye, but even still, this is easily an 8 out of 10 record for me just based on the artistry and the beats. I&#39;ve never heard another hip hop album quite like it.
I completely agree with you that the production is absolutely stunning. All the songs on this record sound really good, and Kayne West as an artist is very interesting. 

What gets me is not just his personality, but some of his lyrics involving women though. I can&#39;t really get into the first verse of Hell of a Life because I can&#39;t comfortably sing lines like &quot;Her bitter sweet taste made his gold teeth fake, uh/Make her knees shake, make a priest faint, uh/Make a nun cum, make her cremate, uh.&quot;
This album has no filler.
&quot;the more I listen to the album&quot; must have really   liked it
6/10 is just absurd lmao
shut up
I think this guy just doesnt like the idea of who Kanye is 
this was the review when i stopped taking fantanos opinions seriously
At least a 9/10...  Arguably the best Kanye album ever, best album of the 2010&#39;s with Kendrick&#39;s GKMC...  Sounds like you rated this album a little too early
I don&#39;t see how people can say &quot;this album is all about Kanye&quot;.

Do you not listen to the lyrics? &quot;All of the Lights&quot; isn&#39;t about him. Why would he write a song about having a daughter if he didn&#39;t have one?

Not to mention, he hands the mic off several times for A-list features throughout the entire album. This review sticks out like a sore thumb and after seeing Anthony give Acid Rap a 6/10, I think he&#39;s just being &quot;that&quot; guy that critics love to be.
I think this is the greatest album since Ok Computer, but I understand why some people wouldnt like this album. It&#39;s easy to hate Kanye 
but still it&#39;s a perfect album 10/10
Most overrated album
every song&#39;s amazing besides like, So Appalled. That&#39;s just my opinion.
Easily the most whack rating ever
Will people get off Kanye&#39;s dick already? He&#39;s absolutely amazing if all you&#39;ve ever heard is trap hop bullshit but he isn&#39;t the end all be all of music or even hip hop. Half of the tracks on this album are amazing and I love them and I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ll never get tired of hearing them but the other half is comprised of completely forgettable filler. That does not make a 10/10 album. 
lmao this guy gave it a 6/10 lmao 
I&#39;m going to respectfully disagree with your album score..
late registration was a close second 
Theneedledrop you just got alot of credibility in my eyes. Finally someone that doesn&#39;t join the bandwagon of sheep saying this was a 10/10, when the reality is this album has as much to do with hip hop as Justin Bieber does with blues. Sure he might be feeling blue every now and then on some of his songs. But how he expresses is doesn&#39;t have 1 single similarity with blues.
Just the way this album is strictly pop and labeling it hip hop is a dishonor to Illmatic (and countless other albums).
Wth 6/10 MBDTF is amazing. Kanye&#39;s skill on this album makes you look past all his ignorance, but come one, he a talented douchebag.
this was my favorite kanye album

6/10! Again! Dude fuck? Get your head out of your ass man!
I&#39;ve watched his more recent reviews of popular albums (Born Sinner, Take Care, Magna Carta Holy Grail) and I usually understand why he gives more unfavorable opinions than most. But damn, just because you&#39;re not as invested in Kanye as other people doesn&#39;t mean your review of the album should reflect that. The production is excellent, the songwriting was great, the guest appearances were useful and the introspection was intricate and vivid. This is at least a 9.
The album cover gets me every time lol. Undeniably one of the best albums of all time.
god damn, i&#39;m on your side yall. i LOVE this album. but whatever grammy&#39;s, vma&#39;s, bet awards etc. kanye wins don&#39;t say anything about the quality of his music.
MBDTF is absolutely flawless....

The production Quality is off the charts,Musically this album will NEVER get dated....15 years from now everybody can listen to it and still be impressed at the soundtracks.

Lyrically Kanye is at his best and most poignent and direct.

and one more thing.....FUCKING BLAME GAME!

that is all
The rating represents how much he personally enjoyed listening to the album, that&#39;s it. He clearly explained why he gave the rating he did, based on what it represents. You people are fucking stupid.
The needle drop really loves rating things 6/10
You my friend have just lost all credibility as a music critic
nah, I agree that Michael was amazing. you can achieve great artistry AND get all the awards. the problem is that Grammys often go to artists with the most sales, when they ought to be going to the artists with the best critical reception.
grammys are worthless. artistically speaking.
lmao who is this guy, he really gave dark fantasy a 6??? omg 
no, he would lose credibility if he gave a rating that he didn&#39;t really believe. 
6/10 for My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy???? Get the fuck outta here fuckkboii
6/10 is complete bullshit for this album. I&#39;m sorry, but its complete BS. You lost credibility with this rate 
My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is art.
I disagree but definitely in the top 5 if not 3. 
Despite entirely disagreeing with what you&#39;re saying here Fantano, I really respect you for giving your opinion. This album was so positively met by reviewers; I can see how it would be easy to conform and give it a good rating to appease the masses. Again, I think this album is gold and is much higher than a 6, but appreciate the balls you had to come out and give it a mediocre rating.
Dude, your reviews suck.
this is kanye west&#39;s best album so far
Yo Anthony you gave this shit a 6? YOU TRIPPIN bro. Honestly.
Not even remotely clever
&quot;He&#39;s got a lot of talent, but his relationships and various character flaws don&#39;t really pique my interest for the entire album&quot; Are you stupid? relationships and character flaws are the raw emotion and honesty that foster any good music. sorry you need to re-evaluate your life cause YOUre the one focusing on his persona and not the music
Wow, so many butthurt fans. He was asked by you people to make this review on HIS opinion, and you wanna give him hate? Pfft. Well, Personally this album may be his epic but College Dropout was much better. Keep at mind, we all have opinion on things
Not even remotely clever
he just doesn&#39;t fuck with everybody bro
he gave gambino a 2/10
Cornye West
He&#39;s not saying an album is &quot;better&quot; if it has a high score or not. He rates on his enjoyment of the album after he&quot;s finished listening to it.
i like needledrop, but seriously one of the worst fucking reviews ive seen in my life. you rated MACKELMORE higher than KANYE WESTS BEST ALBUM TO DATE?!?!?!?! so fucking ignorant im sorry.
lol just look at this dude, his opinion on anything hip hop related is invalid
i might hit em up if i needed a blink 182 review
It&#39;s an album about Kanye&#39;s dark side. What do you want him to do, NOT talk about his dark side when that&#39;s the point the entire time?
It&#39;s introspective, and because of that has the potential to be very relatable, which it is. &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; was about Brian Wilson&#39;s life, same with Cobain for &quot;Nevermind&quot; and the Velvet Underground with &quot;Andy Warhol&quot;. I believe that Kanye has just as much right to talk about his life and its tribulations as much as any other artist.
Anthony hates kanye so much for some reason... this is one of the 22 albums to ever get a XXL rating... light 6? at the least this should be a light 9. 
I disagree, Opinions are personal, in that way no opinion is actually incorrect. You can say a Chef&#39;s opinion on something is mor &quot;Valid&quot; but if that opinion doesn&#39;t fit Joe blows then it doesn&#39;t change anything.

These aren&#39;t Objective facts. It&#39;s not like you change anything because some chef said salt tasted horrible. Everyone in the world isn&#39;t gonna stop eating salt cause they all magically have their taste buds changed.
Age doesn&#39;t determine influence. Albums such as Graduation, while  only being released in 2007 had a deeper impact on the scene then most in the last decade. That to me defines classic. An album can be a classic on release if it&#39;s immediately apparent that it was the Magnum Opus of the artist who produced it.
Umm Dark Fantasy was released in 2010, Cruel Summer was 2012. Perhaps he was still riding on the theme&#39;s a Dark Fantasy, but to say this Album was a rehash of that is incorrect.
wow I&#39;m actually extremely surprised at the rating you gave the album, because myself and many others can honestly say this was Kanye&#39;s greatest work he&#39;s dropped no discussion. I would easily give it a 10/10, I would explain in detail but I&#39;m not going to, too much typing lol :p 
Needledrope ima let you finish but My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is one of the best albums of all time
Personally, I am interested in Kanye as a person lol, he was some pretty gripe secrets that are pretty ambitious through his music. But as always, I respect your opinioin. 
lol I&#39;m feeling that respect 
PREACH
I&#39;m starting to think all y&#39;all YouTube album reviewers are haters this album is one of the greatest pieces of art i have ever heard every track was great and my god runaway as just brilliant this album is a 10 this is the album of the decade easily 
it sounds nothing like cruel summer wtf lol
Btw i meant *pretty sure not just &quot;pretty.&quot;
Aha okay you&#39;re right perhaps i went a bit too far they&#39;re definitely great albums and I&#39;m pretty College Dropout is already considered what we call a modern classic. Main point was Kanye&#39;s first two albums are highly acclaimed so the assertion (to which I agree) that this album is his best yet certainly is saying something.
Those albums are less 10 years old. How do you define classic?
Actually it kind of is; The College Dropout and Late Registration are classics.
I like how he used powerslave to bleep himself out
That isn&#39;t saying much.
1:13 Powerslave. I approve. 
This album is so much better than a 6 though.
What exactly makes these popular music sites so much more &quot;credible&quot;? What do you know about the people who wrote those 10/10 reviews you put so much stock in? 
Popularity has nothing to do with making intelligent observations; I think plenty of celebrities have proven that to us already..
I dont think you understand what i mean about big. I&#39;m talking about a site that artist would go to. Were they would  see what these people think about there music. Not a youtuber with 140k subs. Maybe if he had around 2mil subs then thats a different story.
Not the credibility im talking about. Go to a big name review SITE not youtube and they give this album a 10/10. Go to needledrop&#39;s yeezus review he said that this album was great yet he gives it a 6 -_- 
but with no credibility your opinion really means absolutely nothing.
Dude.....6? I am a reviewer too. U should be slapped for giving this a 6? at least 
Best rap album since BLueprint 1
you don&#39;t know rap music if you think this Is a 6/10
kanye west is why music is fucked
6/10? Wow. I think this is Kanye&#39;s best work ever.
My favs are Kendrick, Ab-Soul, Schoolboy Q, J. Cole, Logic, Lupe, Kanye, Mac Miller, and I&#39;d even say Andre 3K. But to be honest, I don&#39;t really like this new hip-hop era unless I&#39;m listening to it solely for amusement and not something I&#39;d ever take seriously. I really prefer Instrumental (i.e. XXYYXX), R&amp;B/Neo-Soul (The Weeknd, Jhene Aiko, Ryan Leslie, John Legend, Miguel, Erykah Badu, Jill Scott) Indie (Johnny Rain) Alternative (Imogen Heap, Lana Del Rey, Portishead). Just my opinion.
GKMC was also a 10/10 and it&#39;s kinda creepy you asked because GKMC and MBDTF are my only two personal perfect albums, but for different reasons. You don&#39;t always need to have the best lyrics to make a classic album sometimes you just have that feel and I think Kanye has that feel, that magic touch and he produces his own beats so really it&#39;s a beat tape + dope lyrics. GKMC was definitely the most creative approach on a hip hop album so far in the 10&#39;s. I still have to sit with CS longer though.
And this album is awesome in my opinion.
How can people say that this review is WRONG... Its his OWN opinion, it cant be wrong..
Woah perfect?? The production was perfect for sure but not the album for me. What would you give GKMC or Control System if this is a 10/10
Except Yeezus was the greatest metal album ever made...
I like your metal reviews but this one here is totally wrong!. Kanye is a joke and his music sucks.
Naw it was 20/10 , this nigga get extra credit. lol
Completely misplaced accusation, if this were a true statement then nobody could ever have an opinion on anything, we&#39;d all have to just be told what to like.

Sorry, I don&#39;t let anyone tell me what to like, even if I can&#39;t make an album as good as MBDTF, that doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t develop my own opinion of it.
mbdtf was easily 9-10. the album is one of the best sounding albums ive ever listened to.
Well that&#39;s incredibly nice of you. I appreciate the constructive feedback.
I guess I&#39;m the only one that agrees that MBTF wasn&#39;t all that 10/10. It is very forgettable.
In what sense?
I can&#39;t tell if this is sarcastic or not.
album of the decade.
Agreed it got kind of boring to me at the second half
Great way to put it. Ima quote that now.
10/10 it was perfect to me and almost nothing is perfect to me
Thank you. I appreciate the compliment a lot. Very nice of you to say. :) 
dude, you write really fucking well and brought up some fantastic points. thanks for sharing your thoughts with us! i feel privileged to have read what you wrote

lyrics felt slopped together, as if they were done last minute. there were some brilliant moments, but a lot of halfassed lines as well
Yup, he makes money from these reviews and does it full time.
*In your opinion. &#39;Have a straw&#39;.
Great rhymes, Great production, but I don&#39;t like drama. I don&#39;t like Great rhymes and production if its longer than 5 minutes. Give me a break if the musics good let it play.
is it just me or does Anthony look like a moving painting in this video?
6 out of ten?!?!?! Are you serious!?!?!? It was at least an 8.5
So, he still is completely wrong 
You could not be more wrong.
there is no need to complain and watch the review, if you know album is good or best, go buy the album. 
This guy lost all his credibility with this one. I&#39;ll never watch any of his reviews again. wow, he&#39;s waaaay off.
Your reviews suck . U act act as if u can make anything better
This album is a 10/10... 5 mics in the source... the source is credible af and i definately agree. This album is a pure mastepiece... sorry not sorry.
Oh no, the review channel has a different opinion than mine, it must be the worst channel ever! -you
only 6/10  Oo  ?
i unsubscribed. it&#39;s a 6? you would probably review &quot;illmatic&quot; a light 7 and call it a day. you suck.
This a beautiful album. It hits everyones genres. He is a genius
Worst reviewchannel honestly 
This guy called absoul one dimensional so I don&#39;t trust his opinion anymore
i think needledrop gives albums a rating based on how high he can count that day
I&#39;m pretty sure his opinion is a little more valid than yours, considering it is his job to review music.
Simply not true.
6/10!? FUCKING RIDICULOUS. A FUCKING 6? THIS SHIT IS DEFINITELY A 3/10 AT THE MOST
I think we are all granting too much importance to the evaluation here. In fact, what Fantano is able to to -- not liking Kanye&#39;s record, not quite being calibrated for its content and, yet, granting credence to its aesthetic prowess -- is actually quite special. If anything, Fantano fails to realize the universality of Kanye&#39;s contradictions and paradoxes but, ultimately, he&#39;s just out to give HIS opinion which no one can contest: it&#39;s his. 
Review Born sinner
Damn dude you gave this album the same rating as Yeezus? That hurts my head.
This shit is a 10/10
I have seen how his music has changed. But with all the good will in the world, that song contains direct, literal references to a daughter and a restraining order he&#39;s never had. They&#39;re as literal as the woman he marries in &#39;Gold Digger&#39;.
No, All of the Lights is definitely about him. Those slapping his girl things are simply metaphors, not literal. It makes more sense that way if you see how his music has changed.
exactly. he actually did lose credibility for this.
mac miller&#39;s album: he just says that entire review A LOT of problems with it. says theres good beats although and somehow gives it a strong 6. i respect needledrop still but this one he was just tryna to be anti status quo and it shows big time
like i fully agree with his gripe about not caring, but to give it a 6 just cus of that is just bs to me
thats EXACTLY how i feel... like i just think he makes a lot of points of how amazing this album is. and then he just tosses a 6 saying he just doesnt care about the content. like wtf you can take marks off and make that a flaw but you cant just discount it all
if it has to be explained; you clearly missed the joke and explaining the thing won&#39;t make it funny.
What is your point in saying this?
9.
dude stop reviewing this album is a 7 or 8
I think the disagreement comes when he spends most of the review saying how good and exciting it is, only to slap a low score on it because he essentially &#39;doesn&#39;t care about Kanye&#39;s personal life&#39;.

It feels like he has given it a low score just to be anti consensus, despite saying that its got great sounds, good features and is bold &amp; ambitious.

If you don&#39;t like the hooks, fair enough, if you don&#39;t care about him personally fair enough, but you can&#39;t disregard EVERYTHING else because of that
this guy gave it a 6/10 lmao wtf 
This album by Kanye isn&#39;t actually all about himself. For example, &#39;All Of The Lights&#39; doesn&#39;t describe himself, as he&#39;s never &#39;slapped his girl&#39; or got a restraining order. For me, this album is Kanye portraying different characters in a similar way to his first 3 albums, only not in the worlds described in these albums, but in the world of the rich and famous where he feels disillusioned from society (as is shown by the sample of Gil Scott-Heron). And for me, it&#39;s a 9.5/10 effort.
Kanye West=garbage
LOLOL Damn
My dick is microscopic, we all agree on that. 
shut the fuck up bitch
it seems like the needledrop only enjoys extremely experimental or independent albums
This album got the same score as Lulu. How do I take you seriously?
Too true mate, and I definitely think that Radiohead&#39;s best stuff came out after OK Computer.
What I consider to be their best three (Kid A, In Rainbows and Amnesiac) were all after it.
That being said though, you have to get up pretty early in the morning to top Let Down.
and the effect is bewitching, otherworldly, alien, etc. etc. In my perspective it serves the purpose of turning babble and murmur and indecipherable singing into a beautiful instrument of sound and emotion, comparable to the other instruments that accompany it on the track.  I&#39;ve always thought of York&#39;s voice as a pure instrument rather than a conventional transmitter of meaning. ya know 
Haha! SINCE I&#39;M OBVIOUSLY TALKING TO A RADIOHEAD-HEAD, I might as well indulge you. You may or may not already know this but the penultimate track on Amnesiac, &quot;Like Spinning Plates&quot; was a song in which Thom York first sang and recorded his lyrics to the song straight (that is, forward), then played it over and over to himself in reverse; learned to sing-articulate in reverse and then recorded THAT just to reverse it.... er, uh, to play the song straight again! 
Also: totally agree with you about Amnesiac... Some  treat it as if it is the B-side of Kid A when it is most definitely an album that can exist on its own. I don&#39;t like it as much as Kid A, per se, but I am fascinated by much of what&#39;s on it: especially Pyramid Song, You and Whose Army?, Spinning Plates (which is a marvel of vocal and recording experimentation), and Life in a Glass House.
...just as you said before: there&#39;s no one way to talk about art. I guess I just prefer Fantano&#39;s track by track, ears-heavily-involved critiques to their history and genre lessons. Sometimes I wish they&#39;d spare us the discographic grand-explanation of the single album they&#39;re reviewing and, well, focus on THAT album. Some of their reviews are golden though: Rob Mitchum clued me in on the meta- levels of Kid A in his review of the deluxe edition. Thankful for that review I must say 
Yeezus personally, made the stock of this album rise..every album isn&#39;t a winner but Yeezus came off as lazy..he didn&#39;t produce the music and the lyrics were...
I look at Pitchfork as an impressive phenomenon of criticism somehow becoming hip and popular. They&#39;re smart. And, yeah, I usually agree with their lists. The only issue that I have with them is that they don&#39;t do what Fantano usually does so well: talk about music in away that is specific and didactic. Personally, I think their staff is mainly comprised of nincompoop writers who need to lay off on synesthetic and metaphorical terms to describe sounds. Then again...  
Oh don&#39;t get me wrong mate, I indulge in those hierarchies all of the time. I like reviews a lot. For example Pitchfork seem to have pretty similar tastes as mine (Although they did give &#39;Just Like the Fambly Cat&#39; a pretty low score but forgive and forget :P), I just mean we have to take them with a pinch of salt. Amnesiac is always rated a lot lower than other Radiohead albums for example but I still think it&#39;s one of their best. 
They&#39;re not a definite rubber stamp, but I still love reviews :)
But you&#39;re right the objective hierarchies are silly even though so many of us indulge them (the rolling stones lists or the pitch fork lists and ratings, etc.). Silly or not though: those hierarchies exist and seem to hail us with their &quot;importance&quot;
see but you just so happen to be talking with a dude who also considers that particular Radiohead album THE BEST FUCKING THING EVER! and probably speaks to our education -- the way this world and the way we live in it has shaped our heads... Kid A was and still is a divisive album: some just don&#39;t get it. And once upon a time: I hated it. Today I think it&#39;s one of the most important pieces of art I&#39;ve ever grown with. 
I think you&#39;re right there. Every different LP has a distinct feel, and can affect you in vastly different ways. I mean look at Sigur Ros. Valtari is like being in bath of cotton wool, but Kveikur feels like being in a war. Music is too varied, too plentiful, too subjective for there to be ever an objective hierarchy .For example, my favourite album, and one that I consider to be one of the best LP&#39;s ever made, is Kid A. But I&#39;m sure many would disagree. It&#39;s what makes discussing music great.
as for the criterion of &quot;catchiness&quot;... I think you&#39;re right to disqualify that one. Some music is not honed for hooks. Some songs and albums are not meant to be catchy. I like to think of music the same way that I look at anything that has purpose and design: chairs -- so many different types --- some are comfy -- some will have you sitting upright to work at a desk job. Ya know
Totally does. And its an admirable position to take. I was just checking out the comments on his review of Yeezus and it&#39;s ridiculous how many people are willing to make fun of him and say completely unrelated and mean things about him because of a difference of opinion. I don&#39;t hate his opinion. Rather: I&#39;d like to engage it more thoroughly. Perhaps retool and recalibrate either his or my head. or anyone&#39;s who is willing to have a discussion, ya know
I think so yeah.
But then I would think, and this is just my point of view, that there is no default way to consider art. 
For example, my mate just set up a review channel and we were discussing what the albums should be judged on. My friend suggested cachiness as a point, whereas I was vehemently against that. 
I like reviews, but I think they are ultimately very subjective as everyone has separate tastes and judgement criteria which defines your opinion of an album. I hope that made sense :)
I think my pet peeve with Fantano&#39;s criticism comes down to what he states in his preface. Basically he takes the position that &quot;ignoring the context&quot; is impossible with MBDTF because that&#39;s what Kanye likes to rap about. I expect a critic--good ones at least (and, actually, for the most part, I consider Fantano a great music critic)--to care more about and emphasize not what a piece of art is about but how it goes about whatever it&#39;s about... Know what I mean?
I agree: there is, in deed, no need to get mad at anyone for their subjective preferences. However, is there no room for dialectical discussion--for argument and counter-argument? I think there is. Below I provided my reasoning, my interpretation of the critical acclaim of the album, suggesting what it might be based on. These points slipped Fantano&#39;s review and I&#39;m actually quite interested to see how he or anyone with an opinion (contrary or not) might address them.
This review is his opinion though isn&#39;t it? There&#39;s no need to get mad at anyone for their music preference, all reviews are ultimately subjective and his review doesn&#39;t affect the quality of the album. I mean I don&#39;t know how good it is, I generally avoid rap/hip-hop all together (but that&#39;s just me) and I&#39;m not really interested in this LP so I can&#39;t comment on the quality, but you guys shouldn&#39;t get mad. Get interested in what he says and consider why he may dislike it, even if you don&#39;t :)
this is an easy 8
This album is one of the most complete hip-hop albums of recent times.
Haha so many p4k fanboys in the comments.
I never understood the &quot;dirty laundry&quot; complaint about Runaway. It&#39;s by far one of his most universally appealing songs. 
Jesus christ people, just because he has a different opinion than you doesn&#39;t mean that his other reviews aren&#39;t credible anymore. Disagreements are good; if we all agreed with each other on everything then there would be no point in reviews at all.
...because of the cogent sampling of those artists on MBDTF

Also: &quot;An artist like Death Grips is never going to reach the mainstream in their current form. An artist like Kanye West has the exposure and artistic clout to take influence from the underground, put it out there, and have a lot of people pay attention.&quot;--from Ryan Leas of the Village Voice. Leas is talking about Yeezus [which you should totally review, Fantano!] but, hell!, to grant one point to the guy (Kanye), he introduced me to Mike Oldfield and got me to explore more Aphex Twin
I don&#39;t know. I wouldn&#39;t be interested in the Kanye West story if wasn&#39;t graced by such intelligent music. I don&#39;t think that he&#39;s a likeable guy at all from what I hear and what I read but what is incontestable is that he is aware of it and able to essentialize it musically. For this reason, I try to ignore the author so as not to conflate my feelings about him with his work. I don&#39;t really care for the personality of Lars von Trier but, fuck!, Melnacholia and Dogville are masterpieces!
(cont&#39;d) This is a concept album. It&#39;s progressive rap not just because of the long songs but because the songs are too long, too indulgent and, well, what do you know!, that&#39;s the concept: over-indulgence. Think about the red herring ending to album opener &quot;Dark Fantasy&quot; -- it&#39;s a song that makes you question the rhetorical, &quot;can we get much higher?&quot; Because it epitomizes Kanye&#39;s problem: he doesn&#39;t know when to shut up, when to sit down; he can&#39;t get any higher, he&#39;s always drunk on himself.
(cont&#39;d) &quot;All of the Lights&quot; takes light as its kaleidoscopic motif and runs with it until Bon Iver ushers in the darkness on &quot;Monster&quot;: &quot;I shoot the lights out!&quot; On another track there&#39;s this contradictory couplet: &quot;praises be to the most high Allah / praises be to the most fly prada.&quot; It is not exactly paradoxical to praise the immaterial and the eternal and then to follow that up by praising fashion material, but it is essentially contradictory and stuff like this runs all throughout MBDTF
The question still remains: why do the professional critics love this album so much? Look to the countless publications and you will see that they are more than impressed with the nature of contradiction and paradox that runs through the album, how the music inanely and yet cleverly puts Kanye on a Pedestal (through the rhetorical appropriaton of Mike Oldfield--&quot;can we get much higher&quot;--on album opener, &quot;Dark Fantasy&quot;) just to knock him off (Cudi&#39;s &quot;down, down, down&quot; on the subsequent track)..
(cont&#39;d) I thought about using the word &#39;solipsistically&#39; instead of &#39;subjectively,&#39; but, to Fantano&#39;s credit, I would be dead wrong because he is relatable and he welcomes the opinions of others. 
I should also show you that Daft Punk sampled from

The reason why this album is acclaimed by so many professional critics has a lot do with the a key requirement of the job of music(and of all types of)critics: calibration of the senses and the head towards the critical assessment of craft. It is arguable that the critical consensus is that this is West&#39;s masterpiece, but why? Are they listening to (and/or listening for) the same things as Mr. Fantano? No: Fantano has the luxury of indulging music subjectively.
trollin hard? 
true! kanye is great producer but as an MC, he`s lacking on many fronts, and he`s flow is just too lazy for me
Daft Punk was no &quot;featured&quot; in his video, it was 2 dudes wearing Daft Punk helmets, pretending to be them. That said, Daft Punk gave him the &quot;ok&quot; to do that, so it&#39;s not like he ripped them off in the video, or for the sample, as they were cool with it.
the amount of Kanye dick riding in these comments is horrendous 
right? should&#39;ve been a 4/10! 
such an overrated album
yeezus please dude
....who&#39;s probably done more than your entire family
I bet you he&#39;ll give it a 7-8. 
I promise you The Needle Drop will hate YEEZUS, just watch, he HATES any hyped album, but gives Big Krit 9/10.....THE FUCK!??!?!
in all honesty i put yeezus between graduation and 808s but college dropout is my fave.
perfect! exactly my thoughts
As long as you don&#39;t talk about Kanye that&#39;s fine.
Kayne sucks
I have to disagree with you.  Kanye West is a genius.  I argue that what Kanye is doing has never been seen before.  Really can you think of a Kanye West equivalent?  Someone who has changed rap from that of a total lyrical perspective and infused it with a passion for the musical aspect.  To many, rap is about the lyrics, the flow, the bars and that is an important part.  But the musicality adds another dimension a song that is just so important.  
The only reason he gave it a 6/10 is because he doesn&#39;t like Kanye west aas a person. I would have probably done the same thing. His music is good but my gosh sometimes you just get tired of all the dick riding. This 6/10 was definitely needed at the time. Especially when people are saying it&#39;s one PDF the best albums of all time. Yes music is good but he&#39;s no genius. What he does plenty of rappers before him already did.
okay loser 
hahahaha LMfAO
I don&#39;t neither. But when people talk about Kanye it&#39;s either they don&#39;t like his music because they don&#39;t like him.or they something else absurd like that.
jesus charlie now ur gettin racist too 
Anthony, i have much respect for your opinion as a music critic - it&#39;s always clearly well thought out and articulated - and i tend to agree with most of what i hear you say in your reviews, but i disagree with some of your critiques here strongly enough to write a comment about it, namely your view that one must be invested in kanye&#39;s personal life to get the most out of this album; MBDTW displays tons of relatable emotion via a portrait of a 21st century rockstar, ESPECIALLY on &quot;blame game&quot;!
lol
damn that&#39;s lame, you don&#39;t say that in real life do you?
damn that&#39;s lame, you don&#39;t say that in real life do you?
damn that&#39;s lame, you don&#39;t say that in real life do you?
damn that&#39;s lame, you don&#39;t say that in real life do you..
damn that&#39;s lame, you don&#39;t say that in real life do you..
damn that&#39;s lame, you don&#39;t say that in real life do you..
damn that&#39;s lame, you don&#39;t say that in real life do you..
damn that&#39;s lame, you don&#39;t say that in real life do you..
butthurt much?
What&#39;s the problem there? Macklemore&#39;s album was good. True, he could&#39;ve given this album a better rating but it&#39;s better than saying that the album was shit. 
this album is  CLASSIC, you rated it way too low
album deserves at least 8.5
I agree. I usually don&#39;t like saying ignorant, oblique things like that, but it&#39;s true for the most part; people who don&#39;t like Kanye West&#39;s music just don&#39;t understand it.
Are you saying macklemores album was not good? because if you listen to it you will appreciate it as a rap album. thrift shop is easily the worst song on the album. but i do like MBDTF more.
You&#39;re a hater and probably don&#39;t understand his music so all you have is childish remarks like, &quot;kanye sucks ass. go lick ur sisters ass&quot; *sighs* try to educate yourself when you talk about your disliking of an artist. Like the lovely Anthony F. At least I can actually listen to him give his reasoning for disliking an album or artist.
Wrong. Try again.
Overrated album. Like being trapped in an elevator with the most overbearing egotist for 70 whole minutes.
id give it a strong 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000.1
ite u siced it dis is a 10
i used to say that all the time in 6th grade 
tru chaynes
I get that everyone has their own opinions. But if you review music, and this album is considered a 6/10, I cannot take your other music reviews seriously.
Best rap album in many years, you&#39;re mistaken big guy.
IT&#39;S HIS FUCKING OPINION. Jesus christ some people on the internet are so ignorant. Just because you have an opinion on something doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a FACT. 
How the hell can this dude give this piece of masterpiece a 6. This is 10 out of 10. Kanyes best work to date until we hear Yeezus
Kanye East:P
I think you&#39;ve made a mistake in assuming all of the songs are about himself. All of the lights, for instance, is him portraying a character - he hasn&#39;t actually &#39;slapped his girl&#39; in reality, nor does he have a restraining order meaning he can&#39;t see his daughter. Similarly, he hasn&#39;t married a pornstar like &#39;hell of a life&#39; implies. He&#39;s portraying characters in similar positions to himself, but that means he can portray them better, to the extent you think it&#39;s himself he&#39;s talking about.
Ooh he meant 6/5 stars makes sense now
Anthony says he doesnt want to hear about Kanyes personally life but the albums called My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy... What was he expecting?
that&#39;s your opinion he speaks of his life in a general way so listeners can also relate its not all about him 
bro fuck of you speak loads of shit. you gave watch the throne a 5. STOP!! making album reviews please. you annoy me 
Game changer
ohh ok my fault, lol
I&#39;ll be sure to try those guys out sometime.
I was basically citing Fantano&#39;s opinion, he loves the music but he gives the album a 6/10 just because of Kanye&#39;s personality and some hooks he didn&#39;t like.
dont degrade the album just because you dont like his personality. you actually dont make sense because this album IS kanye&#39;s personality..
This album is amazing!!!!!

But I hate Kanye&#39;s personality 6/10
wow your right... this video really hits that spot ;) Oh Btw you can use this to get this in mp3 --&gt; bit.ly/1a3BT5O?=oirqi
I wouldn&#39;t consider PublicEnemy and GrandmasterFlash as part ofthe peak period of the golden age. In my opinion, their music precedes it. Also, I wouldn&#39;t consider gorillaz to be &quot;great&quot; or really even part of the rap genre. 
If you&#39;re serious about learning about the genre, start with A Tribe Called Quest. Wu-tang, Mos Def, Common, The Roots, Outkast, Nas, Biggie, The Fugees, Little Brother, Redman, Gangstarr, AZ, and MF DOOM are also all essential listenings. You&#39;re bound to like some of them.
Not a single one of those albums you named is flawless. Not a single one of those albums you named is even the corresponding artist&#39;s best work 
LOLOLOL
this album is an overblown piece of shit 
the album cover lmfaooooo
I just think he has something against Kanye. He talked about how he didn&#39;t like Kanye talking about his life on this album, but Good Kidd M.a.a.d is Kendrick talking about his life as well and he rated that album very high. Plus the album title has MY in it. If you didn&#39;t want to hear him talking about his life you should have not listened. 
...into One Artistic Album. *
After 2 and a half years of the release of MDBTF Anthony Fantano should know by now that this was one of his worst ratings. This is not only a Good Rap Album this is also a Great &#39;MUSIC&#39; Album that mixtures several genres into One Artistic We&#39;re talking about one of the Best Album&#39;s Ever Made! and if Fantano is smart enough he should review it one more time!
Watch for parallel review of Random Access Memories
TheNeedleDrop
Gives MBDTF a 6 
Gives Macklemore a 7
i guess kanye is just kinda &#39;okay&#39; at everything with some great songs and he seems to display some talent but then he disappoints  me with some sloppy song released for cash rather than the love for music. but uh yeah good review my friend.
good review
Someone is cranky
Fuck you you piece of shit. You rate albums horribly.
best album ever created
You can&#39;t review an album based on your personal feelings on a certain artist.
FISH STICKS!!!
lmaoooo
Because Youtube&#39;s programmers apparently dun goof&#39;d.
Your rating system is terrible. You&#39;re losing credibility.
You must be listening to this album in 2013, And thinking &quot;Wow compared to the album releases lately this has got to be a masterpiece.. on that note 10!&quot;
this album deserved a 9 at least
A$AP Rocky gets a 7 though.... WOW
I think it&#39;s grown on him
&gt;Great Production
&gt;Great rapping
&gt;Ambitious
&gt;honest and introspective

I don&#39;t like Kanye so I&#39;ll give it a light 6, that&#39;ll make sure everyone knows I&#39;m edgy and cool
True... i think Dark Fantasy is the album of all time. i&#39;m tired of other rappers rapping about pussy, money and weed. i love gorgeous, blame game and lost in the world puts me in my own world. These songs Speak to my heart. 

thank you Mr WEST 
6??? really ??? since this album came out i have yet to listen to something as dope as this album!!

imo this album deserves a light 9

it wouldn&#39;t even exist if kanye wasn&#39;t brave/narcissistic enough to explore his own flaws and craziness the way he does. you aren&#39;t supposed to able to relate on a real life level. the baroque aesthetic makes perfect sense in context of the subject matter

i guess if you didnt connect emotionally, the low score makes sense - but runaway and blame game are deeply emotional. i related to kanye in the sense he felt lost in the world. he&#39;s sounds vulnerable
Fuck Kayne ! Nas better
6/10 ? Because of personality ? Wow. Cray.
6 out of 10 my ass
I think your opinion was misdirected by the hype of 2010, please review this again and give it the right score (10)
definitely not a fucking 6

I HIGHLY disagree
MBDTF is in the top 3 albums to drop since 2000
Fuck off. 
This album is at least an 8.
You can&#39;t troll me. 
Ice Ice Baby &gt;&gt; MBDTF
The only one of those that was better than mbdtf is illmatic.
hell no!! 
Illmatic. Ready to Die. Reasonable Doubt. Black Album. It Was Written. Gods Son. You&#39;re stupid. 
I think he references it because other people love it and it was a milestone in production value of hip-hop albums, not because he personally loves it more then what he rated it as being. It&#39;s a 7-8 for me, but I just get tired of Kanye after a while.
As much as he references this album you&#39;d think the review score would be higher.
Whaaat I&#39;m sure the review was more positive than a 6
stick 2 gaming
Death Grips Money Store Album, MadVilliany, Good Kid Maad City, Danny Brown&#39;s album, Ab-Soul&#39;s album All the Roots album lol Underground shit
This album was a landmark in rap production wise this is easily an 8 only because you can argue some features were out of place
Or maybe I have a different opinion and you can&#39;t accept that.
This album was a 9 or 10
Yeah Kanye&#39;s head has gotten way too big.I think he feels like he&#39;s the best, and he has no competition.Which is not true by the way.Kanye&#39;s extremely talented but definitely not the best
It&#39;s ok i replied to the wrong person, thought you were the one who was saying it was the best.
then you cant get into real hip hop 
Stick to gaming.
What.... 9 at least
I can name atleast ten better albums than this.
That album was a solid 9
HA! haha that was a good one @2Chuckz
kanye is anything but deep. Anyway lloyd banks is the most underratted raper out their he puts out tape after tape and their great 
Do Ace Hood -Body Bag 2
I can&#39;t get into it, not gonna lie.
i thought you were making a Kanye reference . turns out you just have a shit opinion. i joke i joke... calm down
listen to illmatic 
&quot;best hip-hop album ever&quot; is a pretty bold statement
you clearly haven&#39;t devoted too much time into the genre then
My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is DEFINITELY better than Get Rich or Die Tryin&#39;, which was heavily overrated upon its release due to its popularity. It&#39;s also better than ANYTHING Lloyd Banks (essentially 50 Cent with a different voice) has put out. As for Eminem&#39;s album, the ORIGINAL Blueprint, and Illmatic, it&#39;s hard to compare, since those albums rely greatly on lyricism (with the Blueprint relying on some good production as well.), whereas MBDTF relies mostly on production with punchlines
Dawg, review late registration and college dropout, his two greatest albums ever
You do everyone gets one i just disagree
Not like I have an opinion or anything...
It is not better than illmatic any of the blueprints, get rich or die tryin, anything llyod banks hs every done and the marshall mathers lp and that just a few that came too mind 
Fav song: Gorgeous
Least fav song: Monster
He&#39;s onto something
*Illmatic
Opinions, my friend.
If you think that you really need to expand your horizons!!!! LoL
7/10
Kanye = average rapper great production and his does not have a complex rhyming style!!
Like KRS One said Kanye West is like the hip hop Elton John!!! Critics of rate hip hop albums and give more credit to production than lyrics because most of Kanye&#39;s albums are better produced and average lyricism!!!
this review just proves that this guy has no idea what he is talking about.
I still don&#39;t think this is Kanye&#39;s best piece of work, it was more of an 8/10 to be honest.
Holy shit overrated or what?
citizenship revoked
Everybody know&#39;s Lil B&#39;s last album was the best Hip Hop album ever.
i agree with u, production n kanyes rapping was great, but theres way to much drama on this album, it almost seems like hes bitching and complaing about his social life a certain pionts, i agree it dose sound great for a mainstream hip hop album and it takes a different approach for normal mainstream stuff. but i think he could of picked better song topics, i understand tlking ur socical stauts and stuff like tht, bit not for 13 tracks, 6/10 i agree, nothing compares to college dropout
your point is opinions are opinions, and you also know very well that i didn&#39;t miss it. i just tried to explain that statements like that are mostly unnecessary and overambitious anyways, and often - esp in this case - lead to very exclusive opinions. you seem to be quite indie-heavy, so i don&#39;t blame that view. but whatever.
6/10
i like this whole album, except that i hate the hook of so appalled. it sucks balllllls.
Again, you missed the point, and make it seem that my opinion is WRONG, and it&#39;s NOT. Also, I know my music pretty damn well, especially for someone my age.
i didn&#39;t exactly try to compare lady gaga to kanye but to compare the way people are interpreting their work and try to draw overambitious conclusions about the history of music without knowing too much about it. MBDTF might be the one album to live up to kanye&#39;s potential and might be the best of these hiphop-pop hybrids going on in mainstream the last years. but to take that as reason to crown it the best there ever was is very shortsighted to the rich history of hiphop. it&#39;s not even close.
I don&#39;t like that you&#39;re comparing Lady Gaga to Kanye, but I appreciate you being cool about it.
i know and i&#39;m sorry, but sometimes even opinions are ridiculous. for example when someone says that the jonas brothers are better than the beatles, or when someone says &#39;born this way&#39; is the best pop album ever, or when someone says that &#39;my beautiful dark twisted fantasy&#39; is the best hiphop album ever. but i was probably out of line, enjoy whatever you like.
Hip-Hop needs to take a page out of this album. Let&#39;s face it 80% of mainstream hip-hop is stupid simple raps engulfed in fake plastic gold chain wearing gun toting women degrading hoe-slapping MARKET-MUSIC&quot;let&#39;s rap about drugs guns and money &quot;(Because that&#39;s not a played out re-occurring theme in hip--hop) GARBAGE!, an so are the stupid brainless lazy wannabe &quot;gangstas&quot; who listen to it. Then an album like Forever,or Illimatic or Black Album or Black Star comes out an makes hip hop shine! 
Thankyou best hip-hop album ever!.
Yea, I know right? Someone having their own opinion, talk about out of line!
what a ridiculous statement.
what are opinions
It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t listen, it&#39;s that I can&#39;t get into the so-called classics. Hip-Hop&#39;s the only genre where I can&#39;t enjoy the most-celebrated, Golden Age stuff (like Public Enemy, Grandmaster Flash, etc.) so I tend to prefer some of the modern greats. (i.e Kanye, Gorillaz, early Eminem)
i think it&#39;s the best too.do you maybe know some other albums with similar production like MBDTF?
The best EVER? Wow, sounds like you don&#39;t listen to too much hip hop. I respect your opinion though. When it comes to my opinion, this album is nowhere near the best. Maybe best during that year, but not of all time.
I do respect your opinion but 6 is ridiculous for this album
Album was good. Lotta msgs in it though
trap god 2 when it drops
lolol

me 2

Please do his graduation album.
i feel like main streem kanye is one of the bigger stars this album particularly isn&#39;t his best work but i cant say its his worst i respect and strongly agree with your opinion 1-10 id give it a 6 also 

nah you just dont listen to alot of hip hop.
grduation!!!!!!!!!!
fair enough haha
Yea, EVER, but like I said, that&#39;s just me. :)
Hey, man, to each their own. right?
Holy EFFFF. LIGHT 6?! Damn this dude is somethin&#39; else. Insightful, but very, VERY  courageous
EVER? You gotta be kidding.
You know I think you just review popular awesome albums then give it a low score so that people rage view your videos.
couldnt agree more bud :)
please review Nas and Jr.Gong&#39;s Distant Relatives its a bit old  but its a bit classic 

How did you end up choosing Powerslave to be your censor? xD
this is where kanye peaked 
Outkast&#39;s Speakerboxxx / The Love Below is much better than this
rated 1 of the best albums of all time
Kanye shows complexity that few mainstream rappers can attest to. Also, as you pointed it, the production is brilliant. It expertly samples everything from Aphex Twin to King Crimson without a single hitch. And Kanye always gets the most of out his collaborators. For me, this is an easy 9/10, though I respect your opinion.
I absolutely adore this album: aside from nicki minaj&#39;s part on monster, it is exactly what the album implies it is: dark, beautiful and twisted, and it has so much in it that makes it intriguing musically as well as lyrically. You should review iowa by slipknot next, I think that would be very interesting
I think the calm and beautiful beats combined with the hardcore rap was amazing. Now, it&#39;s violent rhymes over violent beats. What happened to Stoupe?
It does get pretty comical how overly violent it is. The cool thing with stoupe is that he took that violent style and made their albums sound like they were in a war. Without him they&#39;re an ok group.
It&#39;s definitely not up to Violent by Design&#39;s level. It&#39;s okay.
It&#39;s pretty bad.
I&#39;ll check it out.
Pete Rock and Dj Premier&#39;s sampling &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
Look at Violence begets Violence for what happens when stoupe isn&#39;t producing....
i disagree but i see your point.
Stoupe is one of the best producers. Without him the album wouldn&#39;t have been the same. 
People overrated this album&#39;s lyrics so much. The lyrics are honestly not that great. The production is magnificent though. Jedi Mind Tricks - Violent By Design still has better production.
Everyone whose arguing so vicious honestly needs to stop..their is no need to get mad over music its all the same its meant to be enjoyed so just enjoy the shit...damn
I called him a dick-rider because he goes to almost every single videos and post his biased rubbish with no proof or points, not because he liked the album.
I liked the album and was actually quite surprised by its great production and features. It is indeed a great &quot;ear-candy&quot; album, but as a rap album, I just can&#39;t see myself rating it above 7.5.
Lyrics aren&#39;t really that impressive (excluding Gorgeous), and contains too much singing and autotune by Kanye.
Thank you for being respectful btw.
I give it a 8.5 it was a good bounce-back album after two terrible albums in graduation and 808s and the controversy in 2009. College dropout is the only other album that competes with MBDTF
Ff
I was watching the Broncos getting crushed against the Chargers and I was like &quot;man fuck this we are terrible&quot; . I knew Kanye had release his new album so I decided to go get it. The rest is history.
You are the best reviewer on the internet, in my opinion. I certainly think you missed the mark quite a bit here, however. Especially based on the general positive tone of your review.  A light to decent 8 sounds about right on your scale for how you are explaining the album.  
oh GROW DOWN ALREADY!
Anthony ima let you Finish but Kanye had one of the best Albums
I don&#39;t really listen to the drama in the music.  I love the beats, the lyricism is amazing and to be honest this was my first Rap album and I loved every minute of it only know the Fishsticks joke and the VMA thing.  Still one of my favorite albums 
Bald fuck this album is a masterpiece
Penitentiary chances
The devil dances and eventually answers

those rhymes were unbelievable. straight up.
Aren&#39;t you ignorant brotha, what do you listen to? Future #likeshit. 
i gives review a strong to decent 0
SORRY BUT KANYE HAD ONE OF THE GREATEST ALBUMS OF ALL TIME
And you said that crack head Danny Brown is good. LOL WOW YOU NEED A MOTHA FUCKIN DOCTOR OR SOMETHING CRACKA!!!
Your a DUMBASS THIS ALBUM WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST ALBUMS OF ALL TIME!!!
Lulu gets an 8...
Things fall apart is definitely a masterpiece but it wasn&#39;t in the last 10 years so I didn&#39;t include it. But yeah The Roots early shit is super jazz. Idk for me MBDTF is great but it has a few things keeping it from being a masterpiece. For example....it has nicki fucking minaj on it
Lyricism + music = what makes an album great. This albums has got both of them.
Graduation is kanye&#39;s worst. 808 keeps getting better with time.
How i got over and Undun are awesome (undun is way better, actually), but they cant compare to MBDTF. Maybe Things Fall Apart.
Best fucking album of the 2010s so far
That doesn&#39;t make sense. So, if Anthony loves an album, he gives it a 6/10 rating? WTF is that?
Getting good reviews from the critics doesn&#39;t make it the best rap album, especially because the critics look at the album as the whole package instead of as a rap album (lyrical content.) There are many more albums that aren&#39;t commercial and had better lyricism than this. Like that Jacob guy said, people just ride Kanye&#39;s dick too hard these days.
meh the beats are weak.
This is an incredible album.
i don&#39;t think he watched Kanye&#39;s short film.
My eyes nearly fell out when I saw you gave this album a 6, its not my favorite Kanye album but it&#39;s at least a 8.5!
It&#39;s totally fine to have an opinion, just don&#39;t come at someone calling him &quot;hipster fag&quot; just because his opinion differs from yours.
I liked F&amp;L a lot myself, and also liked Doctor&#39;s Advocate, but Wouldn&#39;t Get Far isn&#39;t even the best song in the album. And Runaway as the best rap song of the decade? I liked the song but it contains more singing and instrumental than rapping.
But you&#39;re entitled to your opinion so you can like whatever you want.
This it&#39;s blasphemy
You obviously haven&#39;t heard Madvillainy. Or any Aesop Rock album. Or The Roots last 2 albums. Because all of those are better than My beautiful dark twisted fantasy. Sure this albums really good but the production is wayyyy over the top and it&#39;s definitely not a &quot;masterpiece&quot;. It&#39;s just the cool thing to ride Kanye&#39;s jock these days
graduation shits on this 808s is fucking horrible
Giving this a 6 actually makes no sense to me at all
You said so many good things about this album, such as the rhymes, sampling, production. It seemed as though you were describing MBDTF as a near-perfect album......and yet, you gave the album a 6/10? Complete, utter bullshit.
Best reviewed hip hop album since stankonia which was released in 2000... It is the best in 10 years
I&#39;d say college dropout is his best. Last call is gr8 though the wire is his best song ever. It&#39;s like jig gas blueprint vs reasonable doubt. No one can agree
This is Kanye&#39;s best work hands down. This is one of the best produced albums of the decade. This is easily a top 10 album of the decade.
I think to say this album is the best of it&#39;s decade is fair. It&#39;s a roller coaster, it&#39;s like a movie. It starts off exciting and up tempo then slows down and is emotional towards the end. Like, Dark Fantasy and Power and All of the Lights etc give me a massive buzz, they get me excited. Then songs like Blame Game and Runaway just connect with me and pull at the heart strings. Plus the overall lyricism is superb, and the production is just fucking mind blowingly good. 9/10. 
His greatest album ever
That 69GUNOT nigga mad as fuck tho
Hm well I can respect that.
For me personally this album was much better than I expected it to be, but I felt like it was way too overrated by the critics.
Don&#39;t get me wrong, the production and some lyricism was great, but saying it is the &quot;Best album of its decade&quot; is just ridiculous.
Give it a 9 too. It was great all over but he ruined it when he added Rihanna into the mix.
couldn&#39;t agree more.
what&#39;s the point in living without growth? art is no different. some prefer kanyes earlier albums, personally i like his later stuff more, perhaps because i already was listening to 9th wonder, hi tek, and j dilla who were doing soul beats longer and better, but also because kanyes talent and willingness to experiment has gotten much stronger since the college dropout. can you think of another mainstream artists in this cookie cutter corp. landscape that has as much musical freedom that ye has?
I used to. I still do, somewhat. Jedi Mind Tricks is still one of my favorites, along with The Roots, but I don&#39;t call them underground.

This album is like no other of Kanye&#39;s. I&#39;ve never heard a rap album so poetic, grandiose and autobiographical.
You clearly don&#39;t listen to underground rap then.
But for Kanye&#39;s best work I&#39;d pick College Dropout over this but that&#39;s debatable.
At least the best rap album I&#39;ve heard in 5 years, and easily Kanye&#39;s best album.
-________-
I give this album a 9....one of the best on the past 5 years
if you say &quot;I don&#39;t like the drama&quot; when referring to this album, you missed the point. not everything in MBDTF actually occurred. like when he talks about his daughter in &quot;All of the Lights&quot;. It&#39;s a story, just like 2pac &quot;Shorty Wanna Be a Thug&quot;. The story is so generic it&#39;s obviously true somewhere, but the rest of the time, it&#39;s just a story. 
I&#39;d give this album a 7 or a 7.5.
But &quot;Best album of its decade&quot;??? Lmao come on guys that&#39;s dick-riding.
You think either 808&#39;s or graduation is better the MBDTF. Your opinion doesn&#39;t matter. Sorry.
i would gave this review a 0.1,man fantano this album is a perfect ten wtf is wrong with you man
In my opinion, samples should be the clay, and you (the producer/artist,musician whatever) are the sculptor.  But many people and producers disuse samples and really they just become &#39;sample organizers&#39;, which is what I don&#39;t like about sampling.  But using samples to create something totally new and creative or to help you express yourself and vision is how they should be used... if any of that makes sense.
I wasn&#39;t going to listen to this since he disliked it but everyone&#39;s persistence convinced me.  Damn.  Sorry Fantano, you have great taste in music but you missed the ball on this one.  MBDTF is amazing.
lol good one. can you tell another?
i hate sampling. from a musicians perspective, i think its lazy and uninspired for people to take other peoples original content and reuse it for themselves. 
6? You full of shit man
maybe 2000-2010 decade. GKMC was the new decade&#39;s album
Every reviewer misses the ball now and again. It&#39;s unfortunate that it was to this L
No other musician besides kanye can make a kanye album. You&#39;re too disconnected with the art of making music itself. Your opinion really means nothing to an artist. Maybe a blogger, but not an artist. 
 DTF= LIGHT 6???? Have you lost your mind? U crossed the line.  
im guessing you are very new to hip hop 
are you crazy!!!!!!!!!! MBDTF is the sgt peppers of hip hop in terms of innovation. The only modern day classic
you my friend are on drugs its not even a top 3 kanye album
Meek Mill- Dreams And Nightmare review it 
what constitutes a decade though, 2000-09 or 2001-10?
kanye west is some shit
its mostly not about pussy. theres  3 bragging songs. and the rest has deeper meaning i wouldn&#39;t go as far as to call it the best album of the decade but i will say it has the best production of the decade. but still a really good album. kanye was really on top with lyricism as well.
It hurts to see so many people agree this is one of the best albums of the decade. It&#39;s the rap equivalent of arena rock. &quot;She want a swallowship&quot; and Chris Rock talking about a girls pussy for half a song is not the best of a decade.
6/10? This dude has got to be bigges hipster on the earth.This album not only changed the game it will be remembered for an entire lifetime. Of course lyrically Kanye dropped off but to do what?Focus more on the musical direction man.This album was more focused on satisfying the theatrical aspect instead of the point we already know(Kanye is a great rapper, not the best but pretty darn good). I&#39;m baffled at this review But its his opinion so whatever. BTW Kanye got a 95 Metacritic score average
This was more ambitious, but I think Graduation was a better album overall.
Why am I not surprised that yoiu gave this awesome album such a low rating? You obviously don&#39;t understand the hard work and dedication that is put into making future classics such a sMy beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.  Please do hip-hop fans a HUGE favour and quit reviewing albums like this because you have no idea WTF you&#39;re talking about and simply rely on big words to get your point across.. Very admirable.  
ur absolutely horrible at reviewing cds. im throwing up because of how sick this is. how is this cd a 6? made everyones top cds of the year and is the one of the best hip hop albums of the decade. stop reviewing hip hop, ur biased 
I fuckin hate kanye. He is as bad of an MC as 2chainz,nicki minaj,&amp; drake. But he is a good producer. This was a good album. Not great, but it was good.
I listen to your reviews,for the most part, but KANYE!!!! Is the truth. This is one of the greatest cd&#39;s ever!!!
thumbs up if you listened to powerslave after this review
nah this album is meh for the most part.
Well that&#39;s like your opinion man..... derp
In my opinion, I think it&#39;s supposed to counter the flow of the main rhythm in the song. The hip hop beat drives the song, but for one moment the Schizoid Man sample throws it off precisely to give it a &quot;schizoid&quot; feel. I kind of like it. 
The 21st Century Schizoid Man drum fill bit sounds off, and it makes it sound really amateur. Not in the good way. Bothers the shit out of me. :(
6 is actually pretty good on this guy&#39;s scale. It&#39;s fucking music and even he acknowledges that ratings are pointless, it&#39;s however you interpret it and personal taste. 
Then you&#39;re using completely different rating scale than he is...
You Should review stann smith 2nd @ race america
In a 1-10 scaling decent is 6... which is what Needledrop gave this. 7 is good and 8 is great.
Fantastic logic there, but the comparison may be misconstrued as &quot;if one puts forth much effort, we should commend them greatly, regardless of the results.&quot; The association of the two is a bit ambiguous.
cause you&#39;re dumb.
I understand what you&#39;re saying, but the comparison doesn&#39;t really help at all... 
this review was disappointing...
top three album of the decade?! LOL you havent listened to too many albums have you
a 6?
a 6?
Nope.
this album is art, not 2 chainz
oh damm got em!
You couldn&#39;t be more right here excellent point!
This guy had it totally wrong on this review. He is still the best reviewer I&#39;ve seen. Can&#39;t be right all the time. 
amazing amazing
that mona lisa analogy was literally perfect to this
album is HIGHLY overrated. it didn&#39;t deserve many of the accolades it got, it&#39;s stunning how many people love this album where i just can&#39;t hear it. easily like a 6.5, 6.7/10. easily. 
Haha Powerslave censorship
Wat is this? U stupid
That&#39;s what I feel too. This album showed us Kanye&#39;s full potential and it deserves the acclaim it got. It&#39;s a shame it wasn&#39;t even nominated for Album of the Year. Anyway, I would include this, Funeral, and Is This It as my favourite albums of that decade.
Wow. This is perhaps the best description of Kanye and his material I have ever seen--and that analogy is spot on. I was agreeing with the review till I read your comment... you really do have some excellent points.
or at least best production of its decade
best album of its decade
He keeps lookin at da album cover ;) lol
Thank you so much for seeing this overrated egomaniac as he is.Pitchfork, Sound Opinions etc everyone kissing this guys ass.He really is NOT that good.
I&#39;ve seen Mos Def live, funny thing is the two artist you&#39;ve named have worked with West heavily... Have you actually heard MBDTF?
Do Cruel Summer.
nas is far better at rapping in every way
The lyrics on this album are awful, the &quot;singing&quot; (autotune) kanye does is annoying. I&#39;m not jumping on the bandwagon on this one.
Hey man since you&#39;re such a music lover, do you play any instruments? Grow some hair and get out of your house you egg faced troll. FUCK YOU NEEDLE DROP. get a life
This is the best album of the last three years. And I&#39;m not talking just about rap, but every genre. 6/10? That&#39;s just madness.
I think this is Kanye&#39;s best album. I think the personalty that you are speaking of with him is one of the great things about this album. The fact that is he so straightforward about his shortcomings and how he reflects on his own life is one of the big themes about this album. I definitely agree that some of the hooks are a little corny but a pretty spot on review. This album in my opinion is the best since Outkast&#39;s Stankonia and Eminems Marhsall Mathers LP in 2000
fuck you, hipster
love that awkward walk in the beginning of the video, check my shit out 
Also, 7 is pretty good for this guy, think of it as a positive. He&#39;s pretty cynical.
I just checked it out and I give it a strong 7. Very impressed
I gave my opinion on his review, not the album. I wasnt being rude, I was being sincere... 
Right, but the point is, you were attacking with your opinion. I probably wouldn&#39;t have commented if you had said that you enjoyed the album. But you didn&#39;t say that, you called him out, denouncing his opinion. But he never denounced yours. Basically, you could have been nicer. 
Isnt a arguement basically a difference in opinion? he&#39;ll give his opinion, I&#39;ll give mine. You have to expect people to put forward there own views, its Youtube for god sake. Just look at it logically, do you think Take Care is as good as MBDTF? The man clearly isnt consistant in his reviews...
Yeah, and he said that he also enjoyed it. His opinions are not your Opinions.
-_- He gave Drake Take Care the same score....
NO, no more Kanye!!!
6 isn&#39;t a bad score.
Even though this album is a classic and is going to pave the way for rappers to come in the industry..I like this review its funny as hell..But fantano secretly admire it
The reason people claim this to be a classic is because no hip-hop artist would ever make an album like this. The same with the chronic and illmatic no one had heard anything like that before. The verses by kanye are great I personally think gorgeous is the best he has ever rapped and the best i have heard someone rap in a long time. The hooks are smart e.g. the hell of a life hook is genius, takes a brave man to take iron man and transform it into a confession like hook. Truly brilliant album. 
Why have you not commented since you made yourself look like an idiot. Kanye produced most of blueprint. How do you feel?
He didn&#39;t produce one song on that album.
The verses aren&#39;t that good? Are you fucking serious? Hmm, lets see: Gorgeous, Hell of a Life, Power, Dark Fantasy, all of those songs have great verses from Kanye. The hooks aren&#39;t good? Lost in the World, Dark Fantasy, All of the Lights. Bro... stop.
one thing I dont understand is tht his favorite thing to talk about is himself its his album not a good point
Yo, this album is a classic, its one of the best albums ever. Its production is beyond superb, it has highs, it has lows, it has everything you want. The sampling is insane, the features are insane, Kanye&#39;s verses are insane, everything. Just stop please.
Holy shit, I really don&#39;t get you at all.
That&#39;s actually some good rap music!
Because people are still butthurt about the Taylor incident
How this album was not nominated for a grammy atleast...is mind boggling
lol and Kanye produced most of it 
actual lyricism??????? did you not hear so appalled, gorgeous, dark fantasy, devil in a new dress? they were genius full of clutter lyrics
Shouts to Bink and Just Blaze as well on Blueprint. Best album of that decade 
6/10 is actually pretty decent for a needledrop review. He gave Nas a 4 lol. 
I like your reviews and agree with 90% of them but this one puzzles me, I think this was one of the best and most genuine rap albums of the last decade, and definitely Kanye&#39;s best work. Don&#39;t understand the criticism, solid 9/10.
No. &quot;Rolling Papers&quot; is a pop rap album. There are songs like &quot;So Appalled&quot; and &quot;Gorgeous&quot; with great lyrical content on Kanye&#39;s album. It had great production, sampling, orchestration, and emotional poetry contained in it. But of course your ignorant ass is going to deny everything i just said and still underate it.
9/10 nuff said
A 6? You fucking kidding me?
It&#39;s not a hip-hop album at all, it still does not sound bad, only because you don&#39;t like it (you just keep saying that, pretending its a fact) and it just does not focus on double entendres, amazing multisyllable rhymes or worldplay, because it&#39;s not the purpose of this album for Kanye to show off his rhetorical skills. You are acting like your taste is the level bar of quality in music. Get used to the fact, that artists are not slaves who are obliged to make music that matches your taste.

I think it&#39;s so amazingly clear what the matter is. You wanted a Hip-Hop album, which you did not get. End of story. All you can say is BS like acting like the fact that you don&#39;t like it, makes it a bad album. I just explained to you the appeal of it, the subject matter, the purpose of the simple lyricism, etc. All you do is keep saying &quot;NOOOO, THATS A BAD ALBUM!!!&quot;. Art is not defined by whether you like something or not. 
As it comes to lyricism I don&#39;t even know what you&#39;re expecting. Kanye is trying to express pure, rough, unprocessed emotion on that album, that&#39;s the particular character of that record. He does not want you to stay thinking about his wordplay and he is not trying to be socially conscious. He&#39;s creating an athmosphere you can relate to the first time you listen to the song. And he&#39;s doing great, staying inventive at the same time - you can tell its artful, even without liking it.
Did you ever think about the subject matter of that album and why it was the way it was? We all know that kanye can&#39;t sing, but he wanted to express something only expressable for him through singing. He didn&#39;t just correct his voice too, but mixed it in a way, that actually added to the athmosphere of the album. Nobody is forcing you to enjoy it. But if you were able to empathize with other people, you would get why it is appealling to them and most of all, why Kanye is doing it.
This is a fucking brilliant album
You are wrong and you are also an idiot. Your opinion is not valid. 
please review No Idols- Domo Genesis
people need to humble themselves and realise that this guy is a critic, which means he professionally critiques songs for a living. as others have said just because you don&#39;t agree with his review you should&#39;nt be ignorant and talk out of your ass. it&#39;s his opinion and I for one enjoy this album and i agree with certain points made in this review. anthony gives you insight and valid reasons, that&#39;s why i dig his reviews.
PLEASE DO 808s AND HEARTBREAK!!! please
that&#39;s because he&#39;s a critic.
He hates on just about every album. Fuck this dude
@LiNaK37 All hipsters love old music because they think it is the &quot;glory days of musc&quot;. Name one current mainstream artist Anthony has given a good review to. If death grips released this same album he would of had an orgasm.
@LiNaK37 All hipsters love old music. Name one current mainstream artist that Anthony gave a good review to. If death grips released this same album he would have an orgasm.
@jonizzzzzzzzzzz Name one mainstream artist who Anthony gave a good review to.
@NB180 pretty sure this album is from from 2010
This album is from 2010.
But that&#39;s not true.
I used to watch Anthony&#39;s review, but then I started to see a trend. If a artist is even a little mainstream he automatically hates the album. Just because something is mainstream does not mean it is automatically bad. He does not get that and that is why I am no longer subbed to him. He is a hipster.
Guess who produced most of blueprint?
Review Domo Genesis new mixtape- “No Idols”
This guy is a great reviewer 

but hes too much of a hipster

if death grips released an album like this he would have gave it a 10 easily smh
Hell of a Life has a corny hook? I disagree whole-heartedly. It&#39;s full of swagger and honesty, which are Kanye&#39;s defining traits lyrically. 
6? your review was decent but this album is def about a 9
Dude, a Light 6? Are you fucking kidding? 
Just off of that comment I can tell you havent listened to the entire album, the album has amazing production whether Power or Devil in a New Dress, and songs like Gorgeous and Dark Fantasy have lyricism and AUTOTUNE? Theres only one song on the album that has autotune... Are you sure were talking about the same album?
As for a better album. Listen to the Blueprint by Jay Z. Great production, ACTUAL lyricism, great content (none of that all of the lights crap), and best of all NO AUTOTUNE
Terrible hooks, horrible featuring artists, really good but highly over rated production, below average lyricism. Like I said, even some critics reviewed this as a pop album. Any other rapper would have been highly criticized for releasing this album
Lets face it. Its an average album with really good but over rated production and production is why every Kanye album is worshiped as a masterpiece. Lyrically, this album is below average with some terrible featuring artists and the autotune and hooks are horrible. If any other rapper released this, they would get condemned for such pop oriented material
If you give it anything higher than 6/10 then you don&#39;t know shit about music, bro. Period.
ohh.... thats what i thought the joke was saying... but by the way he laughed i figured that it had a deeper meaning.... iwas right and i was wrong lol
he saying with so many erkle on you team it not only holds you down and makes you go slower (winds low) but it makes you feel like the windslows who had to deal with steve erkle everyday (winslow) lol it also mean you gets no bitches  
so how does wins low fit it in with that
Family Matters joke. Steve Urkel?
i dont get the winslow erkel joke.... anybody are to explain...
There isnt a artist alive who could have created an album of this magnitude every song whether Runaway or Blame Game paints a picture. you cant name a album from this century that can top it, its so well thought out, everyone was on this album from jeff bhasker to RZA from Elton John to Chris Rock. Kanye West suprised everyone with his lyricism and the quality of the production simply put its an album that comes along once in a life time
You know, i usually agree with this guy, but i mean come on? No other artist is doing this type of shit. He has Chris Rock do a stand up at the end of a song (AND ITS ACTUALLY FUNNY AS HELL TOO)!! Come on, Rick Ross comes in on the softest beat ever produced. after a guitar solo. Its like rap meets French art. 
thank god your opinion doesnt stop him from making music, id be at a serious loss.
Earl !!!!!!
Going back on this review, Anthony definitely fucked up with his emphasis on context. You don&#39;t need to know jack shit about Kanye to get into this, I think the little references like the South Park thing yeah you need to look it up. But really? The context isn&#39;t necessary to pick up on the songs, Kanye is relateable too, when he talks about love, deceit or expressing an emotion THAT&#39;S the shit you focus on. I&#39;m not thinking about Taylor Swift through the listen Runaway, I&#39;m feeling the music.
@ACEGOLDSLUGGER It&#39;s really not that great...
he gave the money store by death grips a 10 not long ago
6? I&#39;m sorry but the mans clearly lost his mind... It&#39;s by far the best rap album of the 21st Century... 6? Unbeliveable...
Being innovative becuz they have too much structure that it takes away from imagination.. Ability and structure are to diff things.. that&#39;s why most artist get high.. To deviate from their structualized barriers
Hiphop is the culture if the remix.. Rap was started by rapping ova break beats in songs as the DJ would soon it back.. That has always been it&#39;s roots so when you see someone like Kanye sampling ..it&#39;s just him staying true to hiphop.  I hate when oil say sampling g isn&#39;t art.. Why don&#39;t you go and try to remake what Kanye created and tell me if it&#39;s art or not.. Yes Mozart .. Was a genius in his own right but even if music skool they taught us that classically trained musicians struggle being
@2paczfan I guess not,he&#39;s a tough cookie to crack lol.Ge would find problems with mother Teresa if you asked him to lol.
9 but I&#39;m a big kanye fan.
Smart man, smart man, I really think you need to be talented and actually know what your doing and not need to rely on other people and computers all the time.  When you get to the professional level and are making millions of dollars a year you need the talent and knowlege prove you should be there.
I&#39;m just curious, will there be any 10/10 album from Anthony?
I listen to lots of different types of music, especially video game music. I have heard of The Roots and I have no problem with them.  I have a problem with people who can only make songs using parts taken from other people&#39;s music, and people who have to use production to make up for them being a horrible musician (autotune ect).
You do realize that pitchfork, one of the more &quot;hipster&quot; music review websites gave this album a 10? 

Also take into account that it&#39;s just Anthony&#39;s opinion, it&#39;s not like he&#39;s saying that you can or can&#39;t like it, he&#39;s just giving his take on it.
Okay. If you like living in a bubble where you just listen to one type of music and stay ignorant for the rest of your life. Bring no damage to me. And you have obvioulsy not heard about The Roots. And so much music now a days are made on the computer, even rock to some degree. So no, you get over yourself and stop being such a bitch ass punk.
What is there to know? Its people who have no musical talent and are lazy, so they take clips from other people&#39;s songs and talk rhythmically over them. Get over yourself. You listen to the least musical music of all time next to dubstep.
You are obviously one of the biggest idiots. Seriously, I hate these kind of suckers who doesn&#39;t know a damn thing about hiphop or rap and run his mouth like a little mouse. 
REVIEW IMPRINT AFTER BY TORO Y MOI
Haha, why does he always get hate for not agreeing with everyone. I thought this album was incredible and definitely the best of 2011, but why are you disliking a video with his opinion if you already like the music. Just sad that he didnt validate your tastes? Stop whining, it&#39;s his review, take it or leave it.
6/10 -_-   
A hipster if i ever met one...
I loved it 9.5/10 Imo I am a fan of ur reviews but how the fuck is that album a six?
Its worth enjoying if someone likes it. Its completely wrong to say that the person is a good musician or a musical genius since they know nothing about music and nothing original is created separate from the samples. Someone who&#39;s dependent computers and other people&#39;s music as a means of creating a song is simply the lowest form of an artist. His lyrics are fucking gay too. I just realized that I&#39;m talking to Likety, who&#39;s videos I cry laughing at. So this conversation is upsetting me
Maybe you should stop being so fucking neutered by the shitty society of today. Someone who knows nothing about music theory and makes 90% of his songs by stealing other people&#39;s work and cutting it up doesn&#39;t deserve to even be considered a musician. Someone like Bach made all his music from his own head, and fucking Kanye West needs to use his fucking computers and other people&#39;s music to make even 3 minutes of music.
9/10
Oh really? Some asshole pressing buttons on a computer who knows nothing about music theory is a genius? Pockets on Shrek rockets on deck? Yeah a real fucking lyrical genius. Producers and rappers are the lowest musical artists. If someone has to take someone else&#39;s music to make a song, then they are talentless shits.
why haven&#39;t u reviewd eminem&#39;s recovery? i think that album deserves a good review it shows change in his music, and it contains idk everything!!!!!!!!

lol sorry dude this was on the best albums of all time. anyway do you even include producing in these reviews?
6....................out of 5?
i would blown away at the beats. especially on So Appalled, yet it is true, the hook is kind lame, and featuring RZA? WOW REALLY? oh he only gets 2 lines..
Here&#39;s the deal: Power, All of the Lights and Monster are great tracks, for the gym in particular. The rest, the majority of which are unfortunately a lot longer, are not. Blame Game is just bad and the autotune on that Bon Iver feature is sickening. Not bad, but nowhere near great
In my opinion, this is his best work since college dropout.
The most overrated album ever.
This album is amazing bro you&#39;re trippin
stick to your indie rock crap...this album is obviously too deep for you
Idk my friend listens to mostly Heavy Metal and Speed Metal and he loves this album. It changed his whole view on rap from the guitar solo&#39;s to the piano solo&#39;s from the heavy influence from Bon Iver. I really like it. Just take a chance and re-listen two it.
It fucking sucks, anyway. It&#39;s shit.
It&#39;s not about &quot;dirty laundry&quot;, it&#39;s about social context.
Yall remember that this is just HIS opinion right? This is just why HE isnt digging it all that much
Danny Brown brought me back to this.
I couldn&#39;t agree more with you on this album, highly overrated
Being annoyed by Kanye singing about &quot;himself&quot; is like being annoyed by Taylor Swift talking about her love life.
I love the comments on this channel.  Everyone gets so butthurt when their favorite album doesn&#39;t get a good review on Needledrop.  Go cry about it. 
You&#39;re probably new to his reviews.
2:20
Yeah if this were a recent review, he would&#39;ve given this an 8 from the way he talked about it
THIS RAP ALBUM TALKS TO MUCH ABOUT THE RAPPER! i mean yeh all rappers talk in this superlative tone and most of it is bullshit, but once Kanye goes into his own REAL life its like nails on a chalkboard. I mean, who wants real actual substantive music now-a-days? -___-
hahahahaha 0:18 

ikr. its weird, he compliments every album and then gives it a low score
I wish I had two thumbs, so I could give ur comment TWO THUMBS UP!
I wish I had a thousand thumbs, so I could give this review a THOUSAND THUMBS DOWN!
kayne&#39;s groopies lol
Honestly this is why your opinion doesnt mean shit cause majority of people here loved the album and if you listen to every lyric word for word you would give Kanye the money personally.I mean the song Gorgeous alone was lyrically phenomenal Lost in The World was pure art and beauty So Appalled was Amazing Devil in a New Dress...come on man you gotta be tone deaf or something
Some great tracks on here, Power, Runaway, All of the lights
It should of got a 5/10 get past the production work and the albums pretty mediocre.
but the thing is thats what every rapper does they rap about their life and what the listener does is pick out things they can relate to its not really for the artists themselves. unless its drake.
I dunno man, I reckon more of a 9.3, but it&#39;s your opinion.
surely, if you pointed out only 2 flaws (which I think were pretty bogus), then you should at least give it a 8/10? 
Relax people he was probably just having a bad day? I&#39;m sorry Needle Drop for all the hateful comments but i just gotta say I completely disagree with your score and that is my opinion.
Yo Anthony Imma let you finish but Kanye had one of the best rap albums of all time!!!!!!!!!!

Not necessarily, you can like certain aspects of an album, yet not find it enjoyable as a whole. Personally I found it to be an excellent album imo.
lol my bad, I am usually careless and rush my youtube comments. Forgive me.
90% of the review he talked about what he liked about the album, I think he enjoyed it.
He bases his rating on how much he personally enjoys it.
well yea i know that but i dont see it as such a hot line like.. its cool but it leaves me like.. is there another meaning to it?..
Oh yeah, I did. I was so angry at his, &quot;your are&quot;, thing that I missed that.
how the fuck can anyone hate kanye? 
i dont get the erkel line /: 
So your two cons for this album:

- The choruses are too generic. 

- You don&#39;t care about Kanye&#39;s life. 

Therefore, it his hard for to give it a great rating because of those so called &quot;flaws&quot;.

I think your are being to hard on this album.


I agree with him.. He&#39;s not sugar coating anything
Graduation is the superior album
The album was blunt and has the best sounds out there. I admit the lyrics get way too raw and it takes away from the flawless beats, but it still makes up for it with some memorable songs. No doubt that the time some songs have is superfluous and could end sooner; however this is more than just hip hop. It mixes elements of just about every sound the mind can think of. It deserves an 8.5 or 9. 
kanye west sucks ass deal with it his productions was good but everything else was shit
Best album of 2010.
not really
i NEVER listen to rap....NEVER...but his album is ridiculously shocking, and progressive in all the right places...Mr. West knocked it out of the park imo
8/10 for me. I loved the production and instrumentation. Some beautiful stuff on there. All of the Lights, Monster and Hell of a Life I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of though.
Kanyes rapping and subject matter kind of bring it down, even with the featured rappers, there&#39;s nothing that you could call a classic rap verse. Production is crazy though. Thats why id give it 8/10
He has said soo many times that his scores don&#39;t matter

Did you even watch the fucking review?
Thank you for giving this album the score that it deserves

666 likes
this album and graduation are my top 2 kanye albums. And i would give it a 9 
i loved the hell of a life hook
Soo clearly all the subtleties of this album just went right over your head... 
i don&#39;t like the album. but how you can give a fucking poorly produced death grips mixtape a 8 and this, excelently big budget album a six is stupid. the songs are good. album reviews are dumb. its based on taste so why would you give a shit what he thinnks
Gotta love how angry the Kanye dickriders are after watching this review. You&#39;re all so caught up in the score he gave it when the entire review was more than fair and he hit a lot of key points. Kanye&#39;s childish narcissism is almost unbearable at times and although the production (as always) is great on this album, there are parts that are immensely self-indulgent. Many tracks stretch on for way longer than they should. 
tl;dr, The album is good but far from perfect. 
Look up his review of Ghostface Killah&#39;s album Apollo (yes Ghostface Killah is a well known member of the Wu Tang Clan so he does count as a mainstream artist). Also look up his Cee Lo Green album review.
is that Kate Smith or Patsy Cline on your T-shirt?
if this is a 8 or 9 that must mean that The College Dropout and Late Registration are a 13. This album doesn&#39;t compare to his early albums.
This is the only album where I do not agree with your review. I would of given it a strong 7 or light 8. 
you really dont like stuff mainstream at all 
SO.........this is basicly almost has god has Wasting Light???wtf???
lol @ old video
kanye&#39;s best album 
You said they&#39;re biased towards less popular music. I disagreed and said that that they&#39;re biased against artists who are associated with manufactured pop music.
You said Kanye doesn&#39;t have respect for music because he once collaberated with Katy Perry. But then if it&#39;s critics having a bias because of that then that&#39;s exactly what I said with my first comment. Why an argument if you suddenly agree with me?
Are you kidding about corporations? Take the sex pistols as one example. It was all a plan from Malcolm Mclaren to make money out of shock appeal. Or The Beatles who were punks but later molded into their matching hairdo pop image.
Not once have I said that it affects his music. I said that it may cause some critics to be slightly biased against him. I do realise this, but bands like The Sex Pistols and Nirvana very much came about through their own volition. The corporations had much less input and were marginally more subtle about it.
So how exactly does that affect Kanye&#39;s own music? If he didn&#39;t work with people like Katy Perry then he&#39;s albums would deserve a higher score? You do realize 99% of all popular bands had corporations molding them at one point (sex pistols, nirvana, kiss, the beatles).
My point is that he works with people like Katy Perry and therefore supports manufactured music.
He&#39;s one of the biggest pop stars, what do you expect? He&#39;s an ass but not enough to want to shut down websites like napster and megaupload like everyone else with his fame.
As if he hasn&#39;t made enough from it already.
He has enough respect to give it away for free though. 
Maybe some people feel a little more keen to give Kanye bad scores because he doesn&#39;t have much respect for music as an art form (collaborating with Katy Perry etc.)
Needle Drop would&#39;ve given the album a higher score, but then he realized it wasn&#39;t an underground indie release that no one has heard of.
Please do... I will spam 4chan and 9gag...
if there isnt a anthony fantano meme alredy i think im going to start one lol
In my opinion, this album is one of the best hip hop albums of all time and with so appalled being on of my favorites
TWISTA HAD THIS SHIT ON IN THE SAUCE!
Kanye&#39;s fifth studio album is easily his most ambitious effort yet. The production is extremely stunning. To be honest, this album sounds like a really huge undertaking with all of it&#39;s extra instrumentation, studio tricks, and samples.

Let&#39;s give it a 6/10
WTF?
I really think that the score in this was bias. 
I feel like you give albums that receive a considerable amount of attention some pretty low scores. 
Like really, J. Cole&#39;s debut album score is 6/10? c&#39;mon
I think that Kanye&#39;s album is more like a 7-light 8.
This is my favorite comment.
        &#39;re                             is      
You have shit taste Anthony. 
fuck the hook for so appalled the verses was fire
i say 10
ur grass looks soft
This is my favorite album. Of any artist.
Kanye West could have down without Swizz Beats on So Appalled. The beat was so good !!
You Are A Fucking Idiot. 
Exactly and this album was extremely original unlike yourself johnnyvulture3! you are the third johnnyvulture you are so lame.
You take yourself seriously?
Rap Album of the year 2010-2012 Grammy Winner, enough said.
kanye west never had a bad album
@justforthelulzzz you are clown if you think graduation is his best -.-
DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMN 2:21

IMHO easily one of the best albums of the decade (yes, even though it just started) and I´m not even into hip hop that much
my mum is 50 and she loves this album. that &#39;cirque du soleil pussy&#39; bit is so awkward.
Best part of the album is Chris Rock&#39;s part at the end of Blame Game.
What he meant to say was, &quot;I give this album a strong 8 to a light 9.&quot;
i fucking hate hipsters.
Damn, you gonna give it a 6... that shit cray.
@arsenalmanz No I do. I am very well read on rap and Kanye himself and I definitely understand it. It&#39;s just not for me, that&#39;s all.
10/10 absolute classic.  Hooks are infectious and lyrics are sincere.  The greatest combo of genuine and catchy to hit the music world in the 2000&#39;s.
Yeeeee
i thought this was Anthony&#39;s channel and the reviews he makes are HIS opinion......
Yenno, throughout all of kanye&#39;s cds he never portrayed the asshole? Was he the asshole in college dropout, graduation? late registration? 808&#39;s? NO. It wasnt until this album he was using alotta fashion designers names and models names.. Why? cause he was presenting the album like a &#39;HIGH END NIGGA FASHIONISTA SHIT&quot;. Everyone was doing it, Pusha T, Rozay, the cd to me gave me the &#39;above the heavens&#39; feel and he pulled it off soo well...
@luv2dance1212 probably cus you dont fully understand the album
YOU ARE SOOOO WRONG 
One of the best albums for YEARS!! I kind of agree with some of your points but still. This is so far from a 6/10
@batmanden1 Doesn&#39;t make it the worst review ever. His review = his opinion. You are basically saying that his opinions are wrong, which they aren&#39;t, since opinions are subjective.
Without a doubt, the worst review ever. MBDTF is one of the greatest hip hop albums in a long long time.
I hate once Kanye matures a lot more, and this album shows it, it gets looked over and doesnt get a good rating or nominated for Album of the Year which he wouldve won hands down
This album is overrated, he&#39;s right. College Dropout was better.
Seeing as, even amongst music snobs the whole &#39;Is Kanye good?&#39; question is definitely &#39;a thing&#39;.  It would have been nice to maybe have two scores, one based purely on the production, and the one you gave in this review.

I feel that kanye is kind of like an idiot savant, the man is a genius producer...but when he opens his mouth all I hear is &#39;Huuuurrr Durrrr&#39;.
Yeah gotta be one of the few review I really disagree with you Fantano. But it&#39;s okay because OPINIONS.
I&#39;m sorry, but Powerslave by Iron Maiden is not bullshit. 1:12
How did Skrillex get more than this masterpiece!!!????
Ugh thank you, Needle Drop. This album was good but I would never give it higher than a 7. Overrated.
Kanye&#39;s a decent rapper lyrically, although his voice and delivery are pretty infuriating. The standout thing is his production, Blame Game and All Of The Lights have some of the best beats in genre history.
Text will never make sense, without it&#39;s context.
@ssurgeon00 Done, look in his channel
I always felt the Kanye&#39;s flow and lyricism is one of his weaker points.  Not that it&#39;s so terrible, but Kanye&#39;s appeal comes mostly from his beats and his production work.  He knows how to make a song catchy and energetic.
I really agree with your review actually.  I&#39;ve never been a fan of Kanye, but I heard this was good so I gave it a try. I really couldn&#39;t get into most of it, maybe two or three racks only.  His singing made me cringe sometimes, and the sample of King Crimson made me sad.  I love the rest of Power, but hate that sample. 
i just lost all the respect i had for your reviews

nevee been into kanye, never will be. but props fir making it big, that is respectable.
I just came back here because of the grammys lol.
@linkhero55 I have no doubt it was a great album. I&#39;ve just never been a big fan of Kanye so me ignoring this album wasn&#39;t the hardest thing to do. Everytime I tried listening to the album I founf myself phazing out. I think this album was more for his fans than anything else. Kanye for Kanye lovers. My opinion.
@TheLonesomeChef you don&#39;t need to be interested in Kanye&#39;s life.. he talks alot about himself but fuck it, thats the subject matter for most albums. The important thing is that he keeps it interesting by talking about subjects the listener can relate to, and if you listen to tracks like &quot;Lost in the World&quot; you can tell Kanye succeeds immensely in that field. This albums consistent and while I also dont love ALL the tracks on it, its still a masterpiece, serves more than a 6.
this is one of kanyes better albums , 8/10
chris webby - there goes the neigborhood
@xChillKidx fantanodrone
You praised it a shit ton and hardly ragged on it, yet, it gets a 6?.. Eh..
I agree about having to care about Kanyes personal/social life to enjoy this album. I couldn&#39;t care less about Kanye so never really gave this album a chance.
@princeada1 im not taking 808s into consideration, which is definitely his worst, graduation is the worst after that though
@linkhero55 Wattttt...lol you must be one of those &quot;i loved 808 n heartbreak&quot; niggas
@princeada1 Graduation is his worst album
I love you fantano. but you need to re-listen to this.
when your this hot everybody&#39;s a critic 
This album was the definition of decent...nothing near college dropout or Graduation
i thought it was dope
this album was garbage, overproduced, pretentious garbage.
@mrDopeBear totally agreed, an absolute masterpiece.
i thought this album was absolute shit!
Is it just me or for every nice comment he makes about something he has 10 negative ones to follow. I think it is significantly easy to review or critique something when you havent actually done it because as a critic you are an outsider. What is meant by this is an outsider in any given situation has no real  comprehension of what it is that he is an outsider of.  I think until critics produce their own work and have it received by an audience they shouldnt be so quick to put down artists work.
There&#39;s no set scale to score music on, this is his opinion. Fuck.
lol @ powerslave
you said you loved it, except the hooks, yet you give it a 6?! smh... at least an 8!
Favorites Songs: All of them except Devil in a new dress
MBDTF: 6/10
Skrillex: 7/10 
?????????????
lol
Am I the only one who doesn&#39;t think this album is good in the slightest? Everyones like &quot;oh my god its lyricism, its beautiful music its this its that&quot; I think it has Ok beats, and the same stupid arrogant huge ego&#39;d Kanye that has been around for years. He fucking sucks
FUCK YOUUUUUUU
6/10 hahahahhah just stop bro
hate it. tried too hard.
@mrDopeBear Far from it. I can think of many albums in the past year that shatter this album. Kanye can&#39;t rap. He just can&#39;t. He can produce all day, but he can&#39;t rap.
@thecookiejarmonster1 It&#39;s an OPINION. Calm down. Everyone is entitled to one. I love the album - Anthony doesn&#39;t. Move on.
@thecookiejarmonster1 So he doesn&#39;t go with the popular opinion. To me, that bumps him up a peg; he&#39;s not a sheeple. Just because he has a different opinion than you does not discredit his opinion.
Youve lost all credibility as a album reviewer in my eyes. Highly respected reviewers unanimously gave this album above great ratings. You criticize this album for its &quot;corny hooks&quot;. This album deserves at the very least a 9.
@mrDopeBear Did you forget about the Marshall Mather LP and the Eminem Show along with The Cool and Food and Liquor, Sickology 101, KOD. I mean seriously it a good, if tedious LP but I can name a dozen LPs of the back of my head better tha this. An ambitous but unfortunately flawed LP in my personal opinion.
Hey Fantano, what is your idea of a chorus that isn&#39;t corny? u always criticize albums for weak, cliched choruses (which u are pretty much always right about), but what are your ideas of songs with good choruses? just wondering
0/10

the person who mixes his tracks has more talent than Kanye West
i am o shocked  and appalled that this guy just gave this album a 6?!
Kanye West as a whole gets a 10/10. This album is right there behind him.
@mrDopeBear hell no 
That whole album was the the soundtrack to 2010.
@Bri4nF yeah w.e. stop making such a big deal. 
so many dislikes because you dont agree. i dont agree but i respect anothers opinion and wont dislike because it differs from mine. 
I think it&#39;s the best album of the whole past decade. But that&#39;s just me. 
@StupidVideosDotComCo So what I fucking missed a letter pussy..
@Jonathansernel1 Aphex Twin dumbass
@Elementer117 Both great albums, but yeah MBDTF is better then them. not overrated at all
Blame Game is the best song expecially with the aphex twins sample. 
Aphex twins are awesome! 
Yoo, music is expression of oneself. Of course hes gonna rap about his life. not brainlessly rap about punchlines like lil wayne
How can you give skrillex 7/10 and Kanye 6/10?
Are you absolutely mad!?
Curve ball for you!!!!!!!!! Young Chris The Revival Mixtape this is an artist you probably never listened to before. CHECK IT OUT!!!!!! MUSIC NERD
YEEZY TAUGHT ME
@asare324 then you haven&#39;t seen his other hip hop album reviews... lol
@Mendozaii Totally agree, dude. The reviewer seems to say &quot;great production, great lyrics, don&#39;t like the guy, 6/10&quot;. The same goes for his review of Watch the Throne. Do people not realize that half the time rappers are in some way talking about how great they are? If anyone can brag about being awesome it&#39;s Kanye, because he made this album.
clearly he isn&#39;t a big hip hop fan 
If you haven&#39;t seen it already, you definitely need to see Kanye&#39;s short film Runaway.
Best Hip-Hop album of the decade, 10/10.
im sorry but I dont value his reviews as highly, i know we all have opinions. 
10/10
@Mendozaii 

Fish dicks, bruv. Fish dicks.
@iStussyKid24 it came out last year, why would it win a grammy
I didn&#39;t like this album, nor Watch The Throne.
Ya know who&#39;s the strongest tool in Kanye&#39;s Toolbox? Kanye.
I would go into why your wrong....but i&#39;ll just sum it up and say fuck you....
Yeezy taught you well
You&#39;re full of shit, bro. 
First prepare then record otherwise shut the fuck up !!!
It&#39;s called an opinion guys! 
You really don&#39;t understand Kanye West. Saying that the music being artful would offend people is just ignorant. Art and aesthetics and culture is what Kanye is about. He says he&#39;s trying to deliver art in it&#39;s purest form. Watch Voyr Kanye West if you want to learn something.
@Mendozaii Watch the throne was two wack rappers and Kanye slacking on production.  This album was better than that and I think a 6 was generous.
@iStussyKid24 Rolling stone knows nothing about hip hop.  They gave talib kweli a 2 for eardrum which blows this album out of the water on every level except production MAYBE.
Kanye is a wack rapper but a dope producer.  His rhyming ability is minimal and his wordplay is sophomoric.
I think his points can be on for the review,he just doesn&#39;t always give the best score for more ego driven albums but why are you guys always ratings bitches ?
This the the best and most objective review I have heard for this album.. appreciate it.  I personally thought you were spot on giving credit to the amazing production but taking points away for the lack of content outside of &quot;me, me me.&quot;  good job
@iStussyKid24 
How can this be a 10/10 to you guys? Sure, it is your opinion, but the opposite opinion is also an opinion. Everything that &quot;breaking barriers&quot; doesn&#39;t have to be good, but then again, I just don&#39;t feel this album to be that groundbreaking. For me there are better and more innovative hiphop records out there. I agree with the review.
this is the highest rated rap album of the decade and i think of all time... i dont understand how you could give it a 6/10
@sbkite exactly. I find it hilarious how many people are bitching about this review, if they were actually listening to the lyrics they&#39;d realize it&#39;s incredibly average. Kanye still relies too heavily on guests, which might&#39;ve been ok if there was more Wu and no Rick Ross. somehow he managed to take some amazing production and make it incredibly boring to listen to.

unfortunately kanye is too vain to realize he should stick to producing
Why is everyone freaking out about Anthony giving this 6/10. Its just an opinion, just because this album has become some sort of a sacred cow amongsts music nerds doesn&#39;t mean that everyone has to believe its perfect.
@iStussyKid24 1. The Grammys are a joke and shouldn&#39;t be taken seriously. Bon Iver as &quot;best new artist&quot;? I wasn&#39;t aware that 2007 didn&#39;t exist.
2. Rolling Stone is a joke as well. They gave a Jonas Brothers album a 4/5. Try a magazine like Maximum Rock n&#39; Roll or read credible blogs. 
3. This is his opinion and he reasonably articulates why he feels it deserves a 6 so I wouldn&#39;t really consider this a &quot;horrible review&quot;.
Sounds like you really love the musical production and lyricism, but he should step off himself. Lol @yeezy fans though. To me the album sounds pretentious, but I have to hear it myself. Won&#39;t see me copping this tho, I&#39;ll just borrow it from somebody.
@shredr18 lol.  i agree
THIS album is no doubt the best album of this decade i honestly listen to this album more than anything else in music. Nothing can beat this TAKE CARE, WATCH THE THRONE, COLE WORLD none of those other albums can beat it.
He gave it 6/10 because he&#39;s a hipster, he has to go against the common idea.
fucking shitty review. eat shit fuck.
I think it&#39;s interesting how you gave this a six and then later put it on your year-end best of list.  I think it&#39;s cool that you can show evolution musically in that way.  Has your opinion changed of this album since?
I love how Anthony is put on such a high pedalstal that when he says &quot;I like this album, but it has some problems for me... It doesn&#39;t exactly fit my taste&quot; about an album you like you go completely apeshit. BTW It&#39;s well known the grammy&#39;s don&#39;t make descisions that a community like this would agree with... so why do you care? If their opinion is as bullshit as you say it is, why is it so relevant to you?
This album is a piece of shit, and you guys should cry.
10/10 should mean albums you never get tired of, this album got boring theres nothing i can really feel. This album is about a strong 7 on this because its all about survivability. Illmatic is a 10/10 because its almost timeless, you can listen to it all the time. MBDTF you cant really listen to all the time which means it is not a classic album to me
@iStussyKid24 he didnt get nominated smh
This album got completely snubbed!! FUCK Rihanna MBDTF FOR ALBUM OF THE YEAR!
7 grammy nominations...... I&#39;m just saying. 
wtf is wrong with the grammys
Opinion or not, you really knew better than to give the album a 6. 6? I think that the biggest Kanye hater would give the album an 8. I give it a 9. 
U would have s big ego too if u were as successful as kanye
you think asap rocky was better than this? wtf fantano 
Jesus, there we go again. Another &quot;mainstream&quot; album you give a low score to...you&#39;re ridiculous for giving that rating.
Ya idk man i like ur reviews cuz u hav a lot of good points and u think about things i wudnt hav caught but u rate some of these albums way too harshly.I mean like if u wer to review illmatic im guessing a decent 9.  :/
I don&#39;t think this album deserve a rating of 6/10. Kanye best album to date is getting a low score of 6/10. The production and lyrics is fantastic, especially if you compare it to other rappers albums. You also gave Watch the throne 6/10. You don&#39;t like Kanye because of his giant ego. Focus more on the music it&#39;s a true masterpiece. Let&#39;s see how many grammy Kanye will get for this album.
7.5/10 for me
This is a 10 no doubt about it... He is breaking barriers in hip hop. It&#39;s most likely going to be nominated for album of the year next week for the Grammys. Rolling Stone rarely gives 5 and this album got a 5. You definitely know music, but this is a horrible review.
I only heard three songs off this album and I already know it&#39;s a masterpiece. Despite what kanye&#39;s social life is like, this is great music regardless.
Nope. Not a classic. Kanyes rapping, subpar. The guest gimmicks (ex. All of the Lights) ambitious yet Disney w/ massive spectacle yet no real substance. Overly narcissistic. Me Me Me ME ME !

This album is a &quot;C&quot; 

An &quot;A&quot; Kanye would be Late Registration.  
i thought the album was almost perfect dont know why everyone says its overrated

i give this album 8.5/10 imo it is overrated tho by most people...people calling a masterpiece i don&#39;t know why 
I honestly Thought Kanye Did A Great Job 
You are one of the rare people that share my opinions on music, the sheer fact you said you don&#39;t take Lil&#39; Wayne seriously is enough in my book.
I would love to hear a review of J*DaVeY, Muhsinah, SA-RA Creative Partners, Georgia Anne Muldrow ... I could go on and on, but those four are the main ones on my brain right now, and I&#39;m interested to hear your opinion of any one of their music.
A HIP HOP CLASSIC....
Kanyw lost it... 
In 2010 I would have given this album a 10/10. But after blasting it continuously in my car, I don&#39;t think I can listen to this album again for a long time.
So you really think that Lulu is just as good as this album?
one word for this album .. masterpiece!!
you like to say sonic alot...

Do you buy the music you review?
@SavageLE2B Good for it, watch me care.
We need some Black Milk reviews SON!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@theknite2211 i think kanye said he&#39;ll choke a south park writer with a fish stick lol
@Imatreethatgrowshear lol 60% is a good score??? lol you must have been a person content with &#39;c&#39;s at school (im joking dont get angry)
umm i just went from bongripper to this, what in the fuck is wrong with you man, good to some drunken jr high church step abortion of a so called musician.
Damn dude i love your videos and all but i both respect and disagree with your review on this album. For me, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is a straight up, no doubt 10/10, A flawless work of art which grabed me, and basically put me on a rolercoaster ride for 68 minutes and 42 seconds. Probably the most well done, produced hip hop album i have ever heard next to only a few others. Classic album and it should win over Adele for album of the year at the 2012 Grammys in my opinion. 
what did he say about the south park fish dicks
haha youre such a nerd. i love it hahaha
I really think it&#39;s just an overhyped album. Yeah, sure, a few songs are awesome (Gorgeous, Monster, So Appalled, Runaway), but Graduation owns this, by far.
Damn a 6? Id at least giv it a 8
@whateverthehellz right, if it&#39;s not your style then it&#39;s not your style, totally understandable. I just think that a record like this doesn&#39;t come around very often. As cheesy as it is, it at least deserves a second listen. Whatever, though, seems you already have enough music to keep you busy when you&#39;re not listening to Yeezy, so like i said, understandable
@whateverthehellz lol I loved MBDTF but this post is great- because you really just named a lot of great shit and the dude assumed you were an idiot. Though, i don&#39;t see why Kanye&#39;s music (this album especially) isn&#39;t as interesting as Pete Rock or El-P. I find them equally innovative- and a quality that I believe Kanye shares with them is that his music is difficult to replicate. You can be popular and still make good music.. you know this though, of course...
@ccage0829 This is a man of wisdom. What is wrong with music lovers these days ccage0829?
What the f*ck how dare you benighted bastards disrespect kanye&#39;s album this album is the only masterpiece in hip hop we have right now
this and house of balloons are two reviews that he just lost me on
Review 
Recovery  8.0/10
Thank Me Later  7.5/10
Pink Friday  6.0/10
The Book of David (DJ Quik)  8.5/10
Finally Famous (Big Sean)  6.5/10
The R.E.D. Album  8.5/10
My opinions
@whateverthehellz Kanye west is arguably the best producer in the business today, and his lyrics may be braggadocious at times but he still finds time to talk about social issues plaguing the african american community. Please list me some of your favorite hiphop artist i&#39;m curious to see what you like. 
The 10/10 rating everyone gives this album is a perfect example of how sheepish people can be when it comes to reviewing albums. Once it got that perfect score on Pitchfork I feel as though a lot of people had to go along with stating how great the album was for fear of that person possibly losing credit in the music world. 

To be honest, yeah, I thought it was good, but not a 10/10. A 7.5 or 8, which is remarkable and a great score. It&#39;s just not at the point of perfection.
2:19 DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM
College Dropout &gt; MBDTF
9/10 for me, probably one of the most heartfelt and honest &quot;mainstream&quot; albums out there
LOL loving the powerslave censor xD
This is one of the greatest albums ever your nuts. For rating this album so low. 
This album mixed all of his former albums.
Every time I scroll down to read the comments I regret it.
u rated this a 6? wtf this is a easy 9 
Wow so he rated this great album the same as odd futures mellowhype ??? Im speechless .....
DAAAAAAMNNNN!!!  thumbs up if fuukuie brought you here
REVIEW WATCH THE THRONE!!!!!
..5/10 ...the title itself..the features..etc...it&#39;s just so..PRETENTIOUS. Like..PURELY. 
i give it 10/10 it was the best reviwed album of 2010, i think its amazing
I would give MBDTF a 8.5/10. Production is great so are the rhymes. People seem to hate Kanye rapping about his life and relationships but is that worse than rapping about commercial bs ( P****y, guns, money).  I thought this album was great addition to hip hop and it shows that there are still some artist out there that care about the art of music.
@Eziokilla9595 lol amen
@DarkAngelEU I didn&#39;t think it was revolutionary. It just had amazing production with shitty lyrics and flows.
@Eziokilla9595 are you calling this album revolutionary? Or are you calling the people who call this album revolutionary dumdums?
@DarkAngelEU hey I don&#39;t mean to sound rude but if you hate someone, somethin or their music then just stray away from it. That&#39;s what I do when it comes to waka flocka, kardashian show and jersey shore lol
@DarkAngelEU why do you judge the persons music solely based on their personality outside of the studio?? Thats just stupid! Just becuz your cocky it doesnt mean your music or whatever that person does suck. And if you hate kanye then why did you bother to look up his album review?
@Eziokilla9595 what were some of the flaws??
Pitchfork tools so mad. 
@DarkAngelEU What angers me is that people are so ignorant about something revolutionary, that they can&#39;t see the obvious flaws. It was O.K., but to be honest, it&#39;s WAY too overrated.
@Eziokilla9595 I would even give it less, but I have to say that&#39;s probably because I HATE Kanye (and any other egotripper) from the bottom of my heart. They need to light the fuck up and realize the world doesn&#39;t revolve around them and it won&#39;t stop turning once they die or whatever. Tried to listen to this album with an open mind, but still I just don&#39;t give a f*ck bout Kanye, so I guess I never will.
@Renzythegreat91 I just saw a lot of flaws in it that people are too arrogant to see. The Needle Drop was spot on.
@Eziokilla9595 umm I really don&#39;t care what you think of the album. I thought it was perfect and obviously it&#39;s not overrated if most of the people who actually listened to the album thought it was fantastic.
@Renzythegreat91 MBDTF will go down in history as one of the most overrated albums ever. It&#39;s flawed. Every song is just self-indulgent tripe which is an excuse for emotion. Kanye&#39;s rapping was subpar at best. And a nine minute song with three minutes of vocoder? Horrible! The review was spot on. It&#39;s nothing more than a 6 out of 10.
@Eziokilla9595 That 4 should be a 9 but whatever.
gooood review... a little biased though, but w.e i cant hate him for being a hipster
@lildeezyeattle1 What the heck!? 808&#39;s a 4 out of 10? Are you out of your mind!? 
College Dropout: 9/10 classic album
Late Registration: 9.3/10 incredible
Graduation: 9.5/10 it blew me away
808&#39;s and Heartbreaks: 8.8/10 dope as hell
MBDTF: 10/10 perfect hip hop album
This guys review wasn&#39;t that good
@Eziokilla9595 Id give MBDTF prob a 7.5/10 aside from that id agree
you speak the truth whereas the pitchforkers seem to be paid by Mr.West...idiots
this was legit, a perfect album... 
@Thepatoexperience2 THANK YOU
It&#39;s kind of funny how people will say an album is amazing, and this dude is the only dude to oppose that. 
monster was the best fucking thing on this album.
@bilalmotley and I would simply reply that Sgt. Pepper is not even the best Beatles album. 

All of you who are upset that not everyone thinks this album is that amazing need to calm down. We all know damn well that if pitchfork gave this album a 4.8, or say a 3.6, or any other sub par score you all wouldn&#39;t care.
He&#39;s fucked up social life makes this album HUGE! 9/10!
i only hate when Anthony reviews a popular album because soon enough, a bunch of douchebags who know nothing about music start being, well, douchebags.
boring

Great review 
lost in the world and hell of a life are the best songs i have herd in a long time
i looooovVEEEEEED this album man this was probably his best....like the whole feel you got from this album was sooo fresh nice songs 9.5/10
Thank you for this review. Finally someone has the balls and the sense to acknowledge this album&#39;s self-inflated, melodramatic nature. There are good beats and verses on this record, but as a whole its attitude is Kanye at his worst: arrogant, narrow-minded, and narcissistic. For that reason I found the album to be his most alienating.
I thought Runaway was very creative, i don&#39;t think it was about him, I thought he was relating to his fans who have been in a situation like that. I thought that was a masterpiece. I gave it a 8/10. The first five songs was pure beautiful music, after that it really went mainstream, then I loved the Blame Game and Runaway.
@goocherdagooser the problem is Kanye doesn&#39;t put out garbage
NO ONE CARES 
seriously this guy thinks he&#39;s crazy deep or something. he&#39;s really not. if the album is hyped or mainstream he gives it low scores.  tyler the creator and kanye got really low scores but big krit got one of the best scores? the fuck?
YOU ANNOY ME AT SOME LEVEL BUT STILL I CANNOT GROW SOLID HATRED TOWARDS YOU FOR I AGREE WITH SOME OF YOUR VIEWS. FUCK YOOOOOU
REVIEW THE PRESETS&#39;  &#39;APOCALYPSO&#39;
@jfriz123 thats right everyone is always like &quot;old stuff was way better&quot; no matter how good or bad the new album is its annoying as hell!
Kanye has always had &quot;2yrs ago syndrome&quot; ... they don&#39;t like his current albums. But once 2 years go by, and you look back at it, its a fuckin classic. I remember when &quot;Graduation&quot; first came out. I went to buy it, and I remember not being too thrilled about it, but still enjoying. Everyone else was declaring the worst shit he&#39;s ever put out. Go back and listen to it now. Shit is ridiculous how good it is. All his albums have this effect.

Kanye fanboys. They will like whatever he puts out, even if it&#39;s garbage.
I love this album. I give it a 9. It&#39;s so majestic and epic.
R u slow????? A 6 MBDTF deserves a 6 out of 4 stars if that iz wat u meant
6???? Are you fucking deaf??!!!
stop looking to the left!!!!
lol. Just came from your Black Milk review where you rag on him for comparing his album to Thriller. &quot;Probably exaggerated for comedic effect but he&#39;d like you to think that.&quot;

And now you start this review by calling yourself the internet&#39;s busiest music nerd? looooooooooooooooooooool
@JiMMyJaM08061991 yeah i think it&#39;s awesome as well, but I respect his opinion 
@alex93metallica ppl are pissed cos this album is so gooooooood.
id say 8, because the quality of the songs overshadows all the bullshit.  but not all the flaws.
he does this shit for shock value and youtube views.  he&#39;s not an honest critic. he gave Big Krits album a near perfect score and kanye&#39;s a 6. the fuck?
People complaining about the rating did not watch the video or listen to the review.
@Cartuch01415 Haha Thumbs up for not taking his opinion lightly
Sometimes this guys a little too critical lol.
@firetruckracer wow well if you make it about how &quot;far&quot; an album makes, then that doesn&#39;t mean that the artist is amazing. True, no one else &quot;owns&quot; the way Kanye West does in the mainstream, but that doesn&#39;t mean that he owns period. As for albums of the past decade in the arena of hip-hop alone.... well, you have CunninLynguists - Oneirology AND A Piece of Strange, Jedi Mind Tricks - Violent by Design, Blackalicious - Blazing Arrow, Blue Scholars - Bayani, Eyedea, Atmosphere, The Roots... etc.
this guy sucks ass at reviewing this is clearly not a 6..this dude needs to be shat on immediately
Wow. Light 6? I can understand your gripes but I don&#39;t think that it pushes the album that far down. Personally when I was listening to runaway I didn&#39;t feel as though it was about his media relationship but rather a love relationship that he lost by being a douchebag and he eventually realizes that he is just that and she should just leave. Maybe I&#39;m just superimposing an event in my life though.
@Cartuch01415 easily a 9 but hey its his oppinion. 
9/10 easily
@firetruckracer ...and? Other people&#39;s reviews shouldn&#39;t change other peoples liking of this album should it? Hype is an odd thing, and no doubt a lot of people want to rate this album high because of its edginess, and as a mainstream release is definitely against the grain of normal popular releases.
It&#39;s not a bad album no doubt about it - it just isn&#39;t the best thing since sliced bread. I can think of a handful of albums which I think are better than it in Hip Hop alone, let alone all genres.
@firetruckracer yes but it is still solely subjective, as well as the fact that he did appreciate this album, there were just certain issues which detracted from what made it so good. 

Not to mention, if you barely listen to Hip Hop and Rap, can you put it compare it to other releases of other artists in the genre, and especially other artists who produce timeless music and more and don&#39;t even get a mention.
@firetruckracer strangely enough, he actually says this is his opinion, and explains his reasons as such....

You don&#39;t go through life ignoring everyone whose opinion differs slightly from your own do you? Because that&#39;s rather immature...
OK.. Look the album was great.. the problem is new fans are on this thing where they beileve that they know as much as old fans... thats just not true. Now on this album is great. The problem is people want it to be the BEST ALBUM EVER. Its not. Still great but its not...Now when people compare it to late registration..they forget its a GREAT album easy 9 to 10..so for MBDTF in my opinion is an 8 By a Hip-Hop Stand point... The drama is for the fans... and if you&#39;re not a fan you like the music.
@Cartuch01415 He is not obliged to like it very much.
Are u kidding me this album is a master peace  
@CaseyOBrienMusic Rolling Stone would say anything especially if they are good friends with Kanye, I admit the album was good but not enough I have a alot to say but it wnt fit :(
yea, pete rock and rza helping out with this ablum is probably a MAJOR reason why the production sounds fucking amazing.
6/10? Are you fucking kidding me?
@homer422 kanye west is easily better than all those producers minus maybe premo an dill, plus RZA an pete rock helped out the album.
kanye west graduation album or go teabag a bear trap

@homer422 I&#39;m sorry I misinterpreted. And I agree with you Kanye is good, but not the best. His older stuff is better, in my opinion. 
@homer422 How can you say the lyrics were bad? Kanye improved from CollegeDropout, especially in Power and Gorgeous. Sure it&#39;s not as complex as Illmatic, but still it was dope. The guests are a question of taste, except for Rick Ross, he was kinda unnecessary. 
It&#39;s also important to say that MBDTF is NOT just a rap-album. In some songs, the lyrics aren&#39;t as necessary, as the atmosphere or the storyline, so it&#39;s more than just one genre, but underlined with the presence of hip hop.
@homer422 Lol you know what you&#39;re saying is plain stupid, because MBDTF is produced with Pete, Tip, RZA and Prem....
MBDTF sure deserves a 10, it&#39;s great produced, well organised and great written. You don&#39;t have to suck a pitchfork or the rolling stone mag to say that. If you don&#39;t like it, then don&#39;t like it but don&#39;t name producers which you think deserve it more than Yeezy.
7/10. production on the album is amazing but some of the lyrics aren&#39;t that great
@MrBlackfish011 I&#39;m glad someone agrees
@homer422 
Primo and Q-Tip both produced for the album... unfortunately their beats didn&#39;t fit the theme of the album... the important thing about this album isn&#39;t just the production and the rapping, it&#39;s the cohesiveness of the album and the deeper meaning of the songs to the connections and the way the album flows from track to track.
Nice flashing Iron Maiden&#39;s &quot;Powerslave&quot; over your mouth at like 1:14   :)
don&#39;t forget to review goblin by tyler, the creator
5-10-11
10 straight up
@homer422 You realize Pete Rock, DJ Premier, and RZA all produced on this album? Do your research before you criticize. 
meh. kanye&#39;s racist.
@Raw1DaBest Gorgeous

how the fuck is this a 10? it&#39;s so average! guess it&#39;s my opinion but still, so many of these songs get on my nerves and i like hip hop
this album is a ten. 
if people are saying that Kanye should get respect for trying to equivocate genres into a singular artistic artifice, rendering matters of race inconsequential, then I get that. But he seems like the guy more excited about SAYING &quot;meta-meta-meta&quot; than actually achieving a great artistic statement. What, this album is a comment on the obsessiveness of Americans&#39; peering into others&#39; lives? This isn&#39;t Infinite Jest, people. Okay chord changes, sub par lyrics, exciting the 1st runthru, and﻿ a bore.
&quot;I give it a 10&quot; (cuz pfork told me to think it&#39;s good)
i know you generally don&#39;t do mainstream, but can you review Born this way when it comes out?
damn, this is an overrated album. pitchfork 10/10 lol. if kayne west or a hip hop artist didnt write this album it&#39;d be just another album, but since it&#39;s a hip hop artist doing it it&#39;s sooo original, right?. lol.
review GIVE THE DRUMMER SOME by TRAVIS BARKER
No, what do you want, the cd was about everything he was rapping about. Take you head out of your butt for a minute and listen and enjoy. That&#39;s how I&#39;m feeling about this review.
2:20
Now that I&#39;ve allowed this album to sink in post-hype, I think you hit the nail on the head.  I&#39;m not a huge hip-hop fan, but even I have heard far superior rapping than Kanye&#39;s, and I also agree that his massive self-absorption doesn&#39;t make for very interesting lyrical material.

The production IS phenomenal in spots, but in just as many other spots I think this beast reeks of over production (most of the hooks, especially &quot;All of the Lights&quot; despite its catchiness).
I understand the points you made in this review. I personally just cant really relate to it. I also dislike all of the features. I think Kanye got outshined in some of the songs lyrically. I will still give it a 8/10 just because it is a HUGE stepping stone in hip hop on a musical and creative stand point
btw you fucked up on this review.  i think you just wanted to act like youre too cool for kanye these days because its not 2004 anymore and all the other white people know who he is now. like just imagine if in 7 years big krit is as famous as kanye, i bet he&#39;ll release an acclaimed album that you &quot;dont care&quot; about.... dont be a pussy. its not weak to admit something is awesome, and you dont lose cool points for liking something that other people like
this album is definitely not a 10, as others gave it. its also not a 6, as you gave it. id give it an 8.  i feel like its definitely better than 808s, better than graduation.... but i get confused thinking about whether its better than late registration or college dropout. its such a different type of music. but i think it deserves to be in the triad of kanye along with his first two albums.
love the powerslave censor bar :P
hip hop does not need 8 and 9 minute songs that are either 5 minutes of cello music, or an interlude that has nothing to do with the song....also please never auto tune anything ever again....thank you
Absolutely agree with this review
Im with the reviewer, a very average RAP album...a great POP album. Even he says that he loved lines like the erkle rhyme but you listen to any great rapper (Big L, Big Pun, Biggie, Celph Titled, Lowkey, Vinne Paz, R.A. The Rugged Man etc etc) and you hear lines like that all the time on every song...Kanye is lyrically nothing special, but he does make good pop beats. 
such a fucking good album. wtf
Maybe if yu had a bleeped up social life yu could understand or maybe yu do and dont wanna hear someone elses. 
@ExistenceAmusement look it on his videos I think he will it explain it betta because I won&#39;t have enough room to type it all lol
@ExistenceAmusement comes along with puberty..
@huamanJR whats a grower?
@Tupocalypse i couldnt agree more
I just think you don&#39;t really like rap music. 
haha Budos Band censer

This is a example of a grower
@realunited12321 pitchfork puppet...
A 6??? Wow just wow
I didn&#39;t like this album at first. And then I continued listening to it an now it is my favorite of 2010
college droupout&#39;s without a doubt his best work.  he&#39;s had a couple good songs at least on all his other albums.  I&#39;d say this one&#39;s second best though.  I&#39;d probly give it a 7 or 8
Finally someone has the balls to actually REVIEW the album, rather than give in to the undeserved hype that Kanye&#39;s been getting for the past decade.
hey!, fuck you buddy fuck you
i think kanyes album is good. just like everything he does. i just dont really care. as far as modern rap goes its pretty hard to deny he is the most creative and artistically credible one by fucking miles.

YOU SHOULD REVIEW ERA VULGARIS BY QUEENS OF THE STONE AGE!!!!!!!!!!!!
Absolutely love the album, just hate the bullshit at the end of a few songs.
@slicvicX007 wait, a black guy having sex with a white girl is considered racist now? LOL wow. People find all sorts of ridiculous reasons to hate Kanye when he&#39;s just made a masterpiece of an album (as well as his other 4 which were ALL classics). 

This is at the very least an 8/10 album (if you overly concentrate on minor flaws) and 10/10 is you rate the sonic experience and overall ambition it displays.
i wholeheartedly agree with your rating! i wasnt mad on this album either, and couldnt quite work out why so many other reviews pissed their pants over it. 

i also agreed with your sleigh bells review, i hated that album.  
YOUR A FUCKING JOKE! YOU JUST DISRESPECTED KANYE THE MOTHERFUCKING GENIUS OF HIP HOP!!!!
GIVE IT A FUCKING 10 URGHGH Fucking douche....
@GreatestOfAllTime5 I feel the same exact way
He&#39;s a jerk and I&#39;m not going to waste my time with him, regardless of how &quot;worthwhile&quot; his album is. I can&#39;t get around the social stupidity enough to enjoy his craft. Sorry, KanYe, you bring this on yourself.
this album was dope and one of the best albums of 2010 but i wouldn&#39;t say its the best album that ever came out. ye did his thing on it especially production wise.
@norrinp WTF ARE YOU THINKING...THE MAN IS PUSHING HIP HOP PAST ALL THAT BORING ASS GANGSTA SHIT AND MAKING IT MORE ABOUT ART THAN JUST SAYING BULLSHIT...I SAY B.O.B. IS ALSO
THIS ALBUM IS A FUCKIN CLASSIC AND SHOULD BE ALBUM OF THE YEAR AT THE GRAMMYS...I HOPE HE DOESNT GET SHITTED LIKE HIP HOP/ BLACK ARTISTS ALWAYS DO
i stabbin any hipster blogger with a pitchfork
you suck 10 all the way bitch
808 and this album are his worst projects. evrything else had a thumbs up!!
@123456789ORF Winslow is the last name of the family Urkel disturbs in Family Matters 
I think 6 is very very low for an album like this. The dense production, excellent rapping on kanye&#39;s part and guest verses would at least get it an 8-8.5 in my book. I still think that Late Registration is sonically and lyrically his best work, but The College Dropout is my favorite album of mine by Kanye West.
@randomstough You take pitchfork seriously.......
since pitchfork gave this album 10/10, I&#39;m gonna pay attention to them instead of this bullshit....
@twiztidlestat 

lmao
Lupe just released a club track where he spits bullshit rhymes about himself. His whole new Lasers album seems to be full of radio music.

Wu Tang forever, but you&#39;re sounding pretentious.

Immortal Technique has a terrible flow and delivery and is overly preachy, but to each his own.

I just hate when somebody classifies something as &quot;real hip hop&quot; cuz I&#39;d much rather listen to enjoyable music then force myself to listen to mediocrity just cuz it isn&#39;t mainstream. 
..Talking about &quot;All of The Lights&quot; had a corny hook?! WTH?? ...LMAO... aahhh, go sit down some where. 
I personally feel that the album wasn&#39;t very lyrically (I am a huge Kanye fan). Some of the phrase doesn&#39;t follow up which left confusion
All opinions people......Everyone has one 
Can someone please explain what that means... &quot; Too many urkels on your team that&#39;s why your winslow?
but i syill respect your opinion on giving it a 6

its kinda funny how you dissed blame game and runaway the best songs on the album
@SamHain1031666 While I agree he still could, he won&#39;t because now he&#39;s more into selling than making good music. Remember when good music sold?
@SamHain1031666 I&#39;m just saying that overall his best work is behind him, you could pick almost any verse at random from his early work and it was genius, now you have to sit through a lot of crap before you get to something that makes you remember who he was. Also, many real hip hop fans see lil wayne as an enemy, and it seems like em kinda sold out by teaming up with him. It&#39;s sad really
BEST ALBUM EVERRRRRRRRRRRRRR
you missed the point. the somewhat cliché hooks were done on purpose by Kanye. 
@SamHain1031666 
Yeah, Both albums sucked. Besides On fire and There you go (last track) recovery was horrible
@SamHain1031666 
The way people go nuts about it, I expected it to be amazing, but Ive learned that this album is meant for people who AREN&#39;T real hip hop fans. The video maker proves it, he knows shit about hip hop 
@awesometimes121 Himself.
@therager21 
Lupe fiasco,Immortal technique,Wu tang, etc, Ya know, REAL hip hop, Not hip pop
@PrestonDowMusic I did like it?
@grizzlyadms34 who cares what pitchfork (or really any other magazine) says, if you like it, it works for you.
College Dropout will always be Kanye&#39;s best album hands down
Didn&#39;t pitchfork name this the best album of 2010? Hmm..
Wow. If your impressed by this crap....If you heard REAL HIP HOP, You&#39;d blow your head off
sorry but LOL, no hate (yes, a little) but how does you not being interested in his personal life make this a 6 when you have noted that the lyrics/rapping and beats are great? And the thing about the hooks is, to quote So Appalled, ridiculous. Other than that, glad to see someone recognizing that Kanye has become a really good rapper, great even. He may not be the technically best, but he&#39;s always interesting and surprising to listen to.
I think this album has a direct correlation with how self-conscious you are as a person. You are very right about that whether you love or hate Kanye doesn&#39;t necessarily matter here, but I think that the more you care about what others think, the more you will be captivated by this album much like the P4K hooligans lol
You have to care about his personal life...that is what has made Kanye a spectacle of the media. This album is a development, explanation, and outreach to the population to understand his &quot;dark, twisted fantasy&quot; of a life.
You came at it like you expected some legendary Nas circa Illmatic verses when the details should have when aesthetically.
A 6 on this is absurd.
CHKOUTLYRICALSLIDESHOW!!!
@YupperDoodelz 

Gorgeous. Its the second track (i think)
POWERSLAVE!!!
review Flockaveli!
Yo I think 6 is a bit odd, I havent listened to the whole album but the album flows quite well. Dark Fantasy definitely my favorite having the best producer (THE RZA) putting some of his beats there. 
The sample on Devils... another jewel and yeah Power and monster are great. 
@RyML1fe 
Hello opinion! I found it utter shite.
this album is overrated
not half, the whole album is artful. 
my 2 cents (bought the album, love kanye, w/e) = production is great, decent ideas, kanye seriously is lacking in lyrical content, its almost pathetic, album is extra pretentious and all he rapped about was sex and relationships.... pitchfork are on drugs to give it a 10, id give it an 8-8.5 MAX
kanye sucked when he mad 808s
@feavmexico9  MBDTF most certainly is the album of the year. 
@DOOMshishkabob &quot;your just conforming to your own non-conformity&quot; pardon me but what the fuck.
@lancebramsay if thats not album of the year then what is?
Hardly album of 2010. Good album, yes. Album of the year, no.
The albums is awesome. I&#39;m the type that likes the personal kinds of rap, such as the kind of stuff Eminem puts out. I like how Kanye keeps it all abstract instead of spitting out straight up what happened or what he felt. The biggest fail on this album for me was mutilating 21st Century Schizoid Man. In The Court of the Crimson King is one of those albums you just don&#39;t mess with.
powerslave is awesome hahaha

10/10 enough said. This album genius work of art. I feel like you just focused on all of the superficial things. This album is just amazing from start to finish and it is so unique and full of emotion. Kanye&#39;s messed up life is something even the most average person can relate too and that&#39;s what makes good music great. It gives you this feeling that this music means something so much more than a bunch of songs.
Atleast a high 7 from the way you were talking about it in the video dude come on.
@VansOffDehWall Kanye West is my favorite rapper/musician w.e and i thought that album was horse shit. Sure it may have high production quality but it sounded TERRIBLE
Ok, I&#39;ma let chu finish, but that &quot;DAAAMMMMMMMNNN&quot; at 2:21 was the best exclamation of all time. Definitely gonna be used as a .gif.
@VansOffDehWall i think College Dropout was the best by FAR!
@FreshMrTaylor24 And that means he can&#39;t review the guy&#39;s album? LOL. I don&#39;t have a tenth of the money Justin Beiber does, but I can wholeheartedly say that his music sucks.
I personally loved this album. My only gripe is that some of the songs like Runaway and Blame Game, could&#39;ve been cut down a few minutes. I don&#39;t think you need to know every detail of Kanye&#39;s life to enjoy this album though.
a great album i,m not a fan of kanye west but gotta give the guy his due 
6?!??!?!?!WTF!??!?!?! 
take off those glasses you fool.
I can&#39;t believe &quot;Hell of a Life&quot; was the first hook you mentioned to be corny.. I love what he did with the Iron Man flow, maybe you didn&#39;t catch that on first listen but that track is a total homage to the &#39;rock life&#39; and pays tribute to Sabbath beautifully 
@DOOMshishkabob great comment
imo 7.5/10
In the track Gorgeous , Kid cudi&#39;s hook Gave me a Booner. 
My beautiful dark twisted Failure. Seriously.
This album is sick, but not his best. College dropout and late regristration were better
Dude this album is a perfect 10/10, barely better than Recovery because Kanye is a rapper/producer that makes &quot;his own music&quot;, the flow, beat and everything! 
I give Eminem credit for his revovery, but Kanye is way much better.
You have to listen to the whole album from beginning to start to understand.
He changed hip hop and this album is number 1 of 2010.
@VansOffDehWall I agree with absolutely everything you said there, but don&#39;t forget about The College Dropout, that&#39;s probably his second best.
One More Reason to love needledrop
@iamyourgranddaddy So Appalled is pretty great...
your so close minded when it comes to music. very literal bro
It&#39;s missing the Teddy bear on the front cover....
you&#39;re completely off base.  sorry dude.
what ppl need to understand is that it all comes down to opinion. n while i like this album, i wouldnt rate it as great. but i would call it appealing. i like listening to it but as a hip hop album its above average, not phenomenal. probably the best produced album of this decade to be honest, i love the deeper meaning of the album as well, very artistic, but apart from a few very witty lines and few impressive verse by ye himself, i&#39;m not impressed by the lyrical sumbstance on any level
a 6....r u serious.....listen to it again, should sound like a 10 after the first few seconds
@VansOffDehWall  i agree...it wasnt his best but it had some great tracks,he used antares auto tune very well,better then t pain in my opinion, he just went all out on this album. and if u noticed he hasnt used most of the good friday tracks (christian dior denim flow,good friday,lord lord lord and chain heavy etc.),,,so im expecting a good friday album..,.haha
@TissueRejection XD
@MarvinDahGreat Well you bought it from target so its gonna be the explicit version. I got the explicit version from best buy!
fuck pitchfork
This LP shows kanye&#39;s Musical growth from college dropout. From a humble artsist wanting more to a confident(sumtimes egotistical) Goliath with the skills to back it up with the ability to know how flawed he is. The album works in that way. in the beginning he basically boasts and by the end hes spilling his guts. His most complete work since Late registration and to me can be seen as a new start
Fav tracks
dark fantasy, gorgeous, all of the lights, so appalled, hell of a life, lost in the world
@bball4life2123 Ok, that&#39;s fair. I would just have to disagree that his foundation isn&#39;t reasonable. Even though the big reviewers are more widely respected, I actually value Anthony&#39;s opinion more because I do feel he gives good analysis of music and I like that he as one person is able to review such a wide variety of music. But I do understand what you&#39;re saying, that&#39;s just my own opinion about his reviews.
@dannyspiterijr no not at all, but there opinions matter more than what someone on youtube thinks.  Anthony didn&#39;t give reasonable foundation for why the album is a 6, if anything he contradicted himself in the interview leaving you to believe hes was going to give the album a good score. I&#39;ve saw Anthony&#39;s other reviews, he defiantly knows about music more than the average person, but reviewing an album 6 days before the final product is even out is not a good review 
@bball4life2123 What? So you&#39;re saying that big magazines and blogs automatically dictate what everybody else has to think? Anthony states that his reviews are based in his opinion, and since he gave reasonable foundation for those opinions, I really don&#39;t see this as a bad review.
I think this review is pretty much a nail on the head, production is interesting compared to most mainstream, but my gripes are the same with it although they might have served more damage for me. Kanye cannot sing, it is completely egotistical, very corny in a lot of spots, repetitive and generic melodies that drag out through a lot of the extremely long and tiring songs. I would give this a score around 2 just because I am confident I will never have to listen to this record more than once
Uh, I just wanna say...

MF DOOM!!! The MOTHERFUCKIN SUPERVILLAIN!!!
2:21
DAAAAAAAAMN!
@jelloman17 im probably stupid idiot but 808&#39;s is my fav album from him :D
@youngripper12 a 6 out of 10 is a good review when rolling stone, pitch fork, XXL, every other big magazine and blog gave it at least a 9 out of 10...yea this review sure is on point alright (sarcasm) 
This is worse then the fucking yahoo review.

Congrats.
@jelloman17 his best album to dated late registration
Late Registration is my  favorite :D
but they&#39;re all good
(i pretend 808&#39;s never happened)
yeah and you probably listened to the leaked version atleast after you made this video... listen to the itunes &quot;finished&quot; version there are noticeable differences  
This is Kanye West&#39;s best album so far and definitely &quot;In my opinion&quot; the best album of 2010. But its funny to me how alot of people hate on Kanye for speaking his mind but yet almost all of you do the same thing on the internet weather its youtube comments or whatever. He&#39;s just speakin his mind and yall are mad about that shit? Hell Biggie Smalls(no disrespect you Biggie R.I.P.) sold crack cocaine to hundreds of people but nobody said shit about that.
I agree 99.9% Ive been listening to it like 3 times a day since it came out, either its the illuminati or its his most amazing album since college dropout
You&#39;re pretty truthful about the album and your review is I guess, YOUR review. Excellent review but I can only agree with you to an extent. This is one of his best albums so far. Even Rolling Stone has rated it as the best album so far this year.
HELP ! Why won&#39;t my album play explicit only clean ? And I think most of these tracks are wayy tooo long 
I dont know why everyones hating your review was absolutely on point and far. and this is coming from the biggest kanye fan out there. good review man.
wtf is that pic when he says utter bullshit? Freemasons? Lol
@DoctorMisterMusic lol i know right! i was thinking the same thing...
I really love MBDTF, haven&#39;t been able to put it down since i bought it lol. But your are right about the excessiveness (word?) i mean the ending of runaway and blame game where unneccessary and a bit much. I really liked your review though I feel you may have underrated the album.
@moonunitenar thats a rerelease bro
@realballer2008 lol
Most rappers favourite things that they like to rap about ARE themselves. Have you not been paying attention to the mainstream music scene in the past how many years? The thing is that how he makes it compelling for other people to give a crap is outstanding. This is his most compelling album to come out since College Dropout.
@bilalmotley The College Dropout &gt; MBDTF.
How can the best hip hop album ever made and only album ever to get a perfect pitchfork and rolling stones score only get a 6?
I&#39;m late but hate it. 3/10 is being generous.
@bilalmotley Im not really sure how this would be the most musical. Wouldn&#39;t an album with actual musicianship on it qualify as more musical say like a Roots album or even old Gym Class Heroes?
3/10
@bilalmotley no shit. kids say the darnedest things they say
how about 10/10
6/10 dude r u serious???? wow
kanye west is overrated
I really love the album and would have given at least more than a 6, but I have to agree with lot of points you made. And on the song, Blame Game....I really love Chris Rock. Big fan. I really am. And I found that little skit thing after the song hilarious...for first 3 times. Now it&#39;s just kinda annoying. As funny as it is...an 8 minute song because of that skit? I don&#39;t like that...Kinda overstayed its welcome a little.
@brandonatorx Well, the album is called &quot;my BEAUTIFUL dark TWISTED FANTASY&quot;. It kind of matches up with the name, huh?
@bilalmotley...WOAH, woah, woah...best hip hop album in last 10-15 years? 

Its a very musical album, brilliant perhaps, but be careful what you say. 
I&#39;m a producer myself and I can say that the music itself is beautiful, really, epic, but come ON. People are getting waaaay too hyped. I get the feeling you started listening to hip hop about 10 years ago...which is perhaps why your standards are year-2000 based. Be easy. 
@vJpRIzM Kanye is from Chicago...
Ok, this album truly is way better than a six. Even Rolling Stone gave it a 5/5. I like how you started the review and when you talked about production. But the fact that the album bores you at some parts doesn&#39;t mean it deserves such a low score.
i have to say this is one of the most well thought out and put together review on this album i&#39;ve ever seen so far. it was so detailed, i didnt mind that you gave it so a low score. you had some good reasons for why you disliked some of the songs and stuff, but its your opinion. i thought the hooks were dope, but thats just me. i give the album a 8/10. dope, but not as good as his previous albums (minus 808&#39;s &amp; Heartbreaks).
this review - 0/10 erry youtuber seem to hate on his new album.it was actually good
A light 6....what? I think u shud sit in a dark room and listen to it again.
oh and if it should be &quot;just about the music&quot; then ...dont put that shitty racist stuff on your albums Kanye. No wonder i NOW hate you (i didnt b4. not i do).       Quote: Leave your hate at the door.     -- exactly. cut that shit out Kanye
Review why his album cover is a black guy fucking a white girl. .... if it was a white guy fucking a black girl everyone would flip out. Stop being racist against whites Kanye (and other people). Stop racism all around, against blacks AND whites.
6....wat?
@MsPrincessofPower yes, 808s had great lyrics LOL
If you rate this a 6 i dont need to listen to any more of your reviews- Even if he rants about personal stuff it is a solid album and all that personal stuff had to come out. I used to never like Kanye but this album brought his skills to light. This album is an the eastcoast chronic of 2010
@jabiggie ahahah
of course hes gonna rap about his fucked up social life. its a giant elephant sitting on the couch if he doesnt.
&quot;All of the Lights&quot;- AWESOME PRODUCTION VALUE! The hook and the beat and music is beautiful! But then Kanye comes and messes it up with this lyrics about nothing and everything all at once. He should have just bragged and not tried to make up some silly story! 


I think that the people that really love this album are those who only listen to the music and NOT the words of songs. THERE IS NO WAY THE SONGS ON THIS ALBUM COMPARE TO HIS OTHERS! His BEST album was GRADUATION. His second best (to me) was 808s. The words are like poetry on that album and I think he did a good job on trying to come up with something new and different!  There are like three songs on this album where I love the beat- but hate the chorus or the rapping parts. 
This album was very different from any other album. A classic!
o way that is a 6 i&#39;d say 8/9
Respecting your opinion, but you really only have two relatively small gripes about the album (the hooks and how Kanye and his drama bores you). I don&#39;t see how that warrants a 6.
hey you should review a classic album like (ILLMATIC by Nas)
@homer422 its a good album fuck off. 
I would give it 8 out of 10. it was still great but i wish the songs from Good Friday stayed out of the album. he could have made better songs in those slots. 
This might hip hop, but OFWGKTA is more hip hop. Review &#39;EARL&#39; by Earl Sweatshirt to see what I mean.
Very confusing review mainly because if hip-hop is not about a story telling/ expression of what the artist is going through or a view that he&#39;s trying to paint. Then its just rappin&quot;... It&#39;s like people forget the great quote &quot;HIP-Hop is not something you do. You Live it&quot;!
@ManBag101 eminem recovery is the BEST 
wow you cant review no albums..done watching this
For me that album deserves 10/10 he put his all into this album. 

Im one of those people who loves to hear a person creativly express emotions they feel in their music, and Kanye dose an amazing job with opening up in this album. Even though I don&#39;t agree with everything the man dose I think it&#39;s important at least for him to honest with himself and his fans. That in conjunction with the sheer creativity of the album makes me give it a very high rating. (mind you I avoid the Ross and Niki parts because they kinda suck.)
Easily, his best work....the musicality is off the charts....
my favorite album of 2010
when does he make a reference to the fishsticks joke? like the verse and song.
@rockstarbabyeah EXACTLY!
I think the drama is part of what makes a great artist, someone that allows you into the scope of their life and portrays it in a way so you get the full picture....I mean, it&#39;s HIS life, what do you want him to talk about??
@homer422  Kanye co produced like 12 of the tracks except Devil in a new dress. Pete Rock worked with kanye and likes Kanye&#39;s work.
@IHateYouJesusChrist Wait he&#39;s trolls on /mu??? 0/10 i was about to rage!!!
CHECK OUT MY REVIEW OF KANYES NEW ALBUM ON MY CHANNEL!!!!!!!!!
@2nose919 It&#39;s called sarcasm, dude. I can&#39;t believe you got so riled up from my little comment
Do Nicki Minaj Pink Friday.
Way better than a six. Try 11/10. Dislike.
Review &quot;the show goes on&quot; by lupe fiasco
6/10!!!!?!?!?!?
CHECK OUT MY REVIEW OF &#39;MY BEAUTIFUL DARK TWISTED FANTASY&#39; ON MY CHANNEL
i would give it 7,5/10 
it would be perfect without rihana and nicki minaj shit
6/10 really? C&#39;mon son
Review &quot;Pink Friday&quot; nikki minaj&#39;s album
Kanye&#39;s best album is definitely Late Registration
Just wanted to ask, do you read other sites&#39; reviews before you do your own? Like do you check out Rolling Stone, Spin, and Paste before or after you do a review? Or would you feel like you&#39;re spoiling yourself with other people&#39;s perceptions? 
@nnamdi368 nah college dropout
@momsbluedress actually i am the guy points  out stupid excuses to give this album a low rating due to personal and igsignificant points
@2nose919 Your idea that Rolling Stone gives a perfect score to anything that has a pulse is wrong, seeing that they have not given one to an animal.  I give you the fact that this is his opinion and your opinion, but majority of people and critics alike are giving it universal acclaim. Give credit where credit is due. I highly doubt that you could make it as a popular musical artist so it&#39;s easy to sit back in your chair on your computer and judge others when you can&#39;t even do what your judging
@WookiePUBE Make Rolling Stone and Pitchfork irrelevant and it still has universal acclaim.  I&#39;m not sure whether your a Kanye Hater or some die-hard rock fan that just hates hip hop, or both.  Either or, you have a futile point that leaves you in the minority of opinions.  Give the man what he&#39;s do, whether you like him or not.  Your ignorance to his music is laughable
You&#39;re right, couldn&#39;t stand the King Crimson sample.
Devil in a new dress is fuckin amazing production
The Production is Lush and Beautiful but its quite clear that Kanye west is a bad Poet! I mean &quot;that nigga dead&quot;? &quot;Saprophagous&quot;? &quot;sent a picture of my dick&quot;? *i shudder* ...Rap =  Performance poetry + Backing music....stop neglecting the lyrics!!! i feel in the hands of someone like lupe fiasco this would have been a masterpiece!
@MsPrincessofPower 
I agree. It really frustrated me that rap is supposed to be performign poetry over a beat but yet rappers only bother with the music part and slack off on the poetry part. So he has way too many bad lines  on this album!!! 
This is very WELL SAID! The production value and music is great on the album, but the hooks and content suck.  I think Graduation and 808s were  his best two albums. He has got some definite hits and misses on here.
@YABOYKANYE Not much to ruin there to begin with...
@IHateYouJesusChrist You lead a sad sad life when you are bothered this deeply by a single guy wearing (possibly) fake glasses and a buzzcut. You need to get laid more or get a hug or something.
@Sergeezie You&#39;re not very familiar with pointing out the pros and cons of the subject in question are you? 
@sayazfar He said it&#39;s too hard to just focus on the music when Kanye just keeps bringing all the drama he&#39;s known for in the media focus of his music. The reviewer finds that detrimental.
@MateoHDmusic Created what? Alternative what? HAHAHAHAHA! You don&#39;t listen to much do you?
@gman4eva9 HAHAHA! Because he feels different from the general consensus?
i think ur brain is not the best tool in ur toolbox
@TheLimit21 in what ways does this album has anything to do with him? i must know
I CAN&#39;T BELIEVE YOU COULD EVER AWARD THIS LESS THAN HEAVY 8
It&#39;s got over 6 perfect scores from critics so I say your musical critic skills are very low
6 is harsh, I&#39;d say 9. Then again, I actually have intrest in Kanye&#39;s personal life. Shid, I&#39;m honestly wanna say 10.
&quot;reupholstering&quot; a &quot;pussy&quot;? That&#39;s not, artful per se. MBDTF isn&#39;t always on a higher level of thinking, but it isn&#39;t blisteringly stupid. And, it&#39;s a step in the right direction.

The rest of my reply.
@2nose919
@2nose919 Here&#39;s hoping it didn&#39;t taste too bad. But I have to disagree, Runaway IS artful. It isn&#39;t some retread of something we&#39;ve heard before, most especially in mainstream hip hop. The vocoder solo, where else has that been done? Surely a 9 minute song is a lot to digest, but Kanye puts it on this album, complete with 3 minutes of vocoder solo and bam. Take it or don&#39;t. That&#39;s art, that&#39;s something new and creative. Yeah, Kanye is still sophomoric in some bits of the album, something about
this is not a vinyl version of the album, hanging in the background?
do a review for nicki minaj pink friday&#39;s album! she&#39;s gooooood 
I agree with this review, gratz for taking a risk with such a low rating.
@gman4eva9 : Rolling Stone aren&#39;t real critics btw.
I love the album and think it&#39;s his best yet. I think you did a good job of explaining your thoughts, but your review sounded (to me) higher than a 6/10.
No offense dude, but I think you should really give up on hip-hop reviews.

You&#39;ve just given MBDTF and Big Boi&#39;s The Son Of Chico Dusty both 6&#39;s.  And they&#39;re arguably the best hip-hop album releases of 2010.  

I&#39;m just saying....stick to what you want to review.  You might go off on unfamiliar grounds
6 out of 10 ?! hmm... I think you need to revisit.  At least an 8!
Really great review, you said exactly what you thought and didn&#39;t bother with the hype of this being the new Kanye album, which has already yielded a 5 on Rolling Stone, 10 on Pitchfork and 9 on Spin. Seeing you give this a light 6 was, pretty cool. But, I&#39;m thinking it deserves an 8.5 to 9. The beats and samples are second to none, Power is the greatest song to come out of the hip hop game in years, and songs like Runaway are so artful they have to be appreciated. That vocoder solo? Ambitious,
Don&#39;t listen to the commenters who are putting down this review--it&#39;s a good one. You&#39;re entitled to your opinion, and I agree with you; you&#39;re really able to see through hype.
mate your a knob 
that is all
Haha Great review not bassist , 10/10 
I got Pink Friday...[:
@WookiePUBE Well REAL critics (Rolling Stone, etc.) seem to disagree with you since it has over 6 perfect reviews...you can crawl in a corner now
dunno if this has been asked before, so you said forget the context and focus on the music, but then why did you point out that the album needs the listener to be in the know about kanye&#39;s story to enjoy the album. i may have worded it very wrongly but you get the gist.
Anthony, (10/10) I thought this album was brilliant, yes there were some songs in there (So Appalled, Devil in a New Dress) that made the album drag on a little but overall I thought it was certainly an upgrade to 808&#39;s &amp; heartbreaks.

I dare you to review Ke$ha&#39;s new EP &quot;Cannibal&quot; just for fun. Please! I really wanna know your view on it :)
@xHenri As though the Pitchfork review could somehow be correct?  So someone thinks the album isn&#39;t that great and then sees P4k gave it a 10.0....&quot;oh, man, I guess I got it wrong!&quot;
@sagg1205 Whoa!!! HOw is he a gay fish!!! I don&#39;t get why people call him a gay fish every time he says he likes fish sticks!  I love fish sticks too, but I&#39;m not a gay fish!!!  I don&#39;t get it!!! 
that was a pretty awesome review.
its a 6 kanye fans are mad as fuck
@IHateYouJesusChrist shut the fuck up seriously. yeah its a much better album than a light 6 (id say light 9 if i used his scale) but come on. your an ass.
its a masterpieceeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!
Knaye can&#39;t rap and should stick to production. 
I like your score...like a lot.
You said that Kanye can&#39;t sing, but even Kanye himself says he can&#39;t sing, thats why he uses autotune as a way to be able to express himself...but you also said you didn&#39;t care for the drama/his life so you would miss that
First you praise the album then you say its one of the most artistic albums in mainstream hiphop then u give a rating that average or bland . n only because the hooks were corny and you werent interested on his personal life?! hmm you must not really enjoy hiphop but just because some songs were too long i still dont think this album deserved such a low rating this is a 8 in my opinion and im not a heavy rap fan.This album  is art...Im very curious what type of crap you give a 10 rating .
I bet this guy is eating his words after seeing the P4k review
Ive never been the biggest kanye fan but i have to say im really digging this album. I feel like each song serves a purpose to the album as a whole. I understand why the critics like this album, but i dont know why they like it this much. too me its a solid 8 or so, but not the perfect 100/greatest thing to happen to rap ever album that it has been viewed at

even though i dont agree with you 100% anthony its still a great review, keep reviewing many genres of music.
I&#39;m suprised you didn&#39;t mention that he used Aphex Twin&#39;s Avril 14th too...

It sorta annoyed me he did that.
I think the emotional aspect of this album was necessary because of everything he is going through.  He has to take this step in his life before he can go on to making albums like graduation again which was probably his best work ever!
Review Nicki Minaj&#39;s new album! PINK FIRDAY!
I bought the Cd from Best Buy and the cover art has a ballerina on it , so either way you don&#39;t get what you want. 
lol it looks like p4k gave this a 10/10
kanye proves again that he&#39;s one of the best artists in mainstream music. i love that he added pop, classical &amp; rock into his music and he stepped his lyrical game up this album. I love that every track kanye gives you the full package and doesn&#39;t disappoint. personally i think this is kanye&#39;s 2nd best album so far. this album is a ambitious orchestrated masterpiece. my favorite songs are Power, Devil In A New Dress &amp; Lost In The World.
I absolutely love this album, best rap i have heard since Illmatic.  We rarely disagree my man. 
late registration is kanye&#39;s best rap album
@JayRocFly : Basically, Das Racist are a joke fest band, they&#39;re doing what they&#39;re doing good.
Kanye on the other hand tries to be experimental and fails at it.
I was getting ready to buy the album today, but I decided to visit Kanye&#39;s myspace first and listen to it. I still might buy it, but...I don&#39;t know...I had a weird experience with this album. There were several things I could appreciate in this album and things I could appreciate in individual songs, but, as I listened to each song, it all seemed to be going pretty nice and sounding good until something would jump out that would just feel unnecessary and blemish the song/album a little.
Check out this quote about the album from the Globe and Mail. Pretty much nails it for me:
&quot;When you peer inside the giant sparkling machinery of this album, all you find is a little homunculus, working the levers and fuming over the world’s failure to love him more.&quot;
lol did anyone notice that it was kinda illuminati sign when he was gonna sware
@JayRocFly 

honestly i found das racist&#39;s lp more enjoyable (and i hate them). kanye&#39;s verses are terrible. FUCKING HORRIBLE. a few of the beats/tunes on the lp are nice, there rest junk; repetitive, bland, poppy trash. opinion. 
HEY EVERYONE I HAVE KANYE&#39;S ALBUM UP ON MY CHANEL IF EVERYONE WANTS TO GIVE IT A LISTEN! AND IT&#39;S PRETTY GOOD IN MY OPINION AND IT&#39;S WHAT EVERYONE INCLUDING MYSELF THOUGHT IT WOULD BE..&quot;CONTROVERSIAL&quot;..BUT EPIC! GIVE IT A TRY ON MY CHANEL!
&lt;----------

Yo Anthony Imma let you finish but Kanye West had one of the best albums of all time. But seriously this album is amazing and it&#39;s easily one of the best albums of the year. I respect your difference in opinion though I always have.
@AmadeusExcello how do you get those, and how can i get &#39;em?
anydecentmusic@com/review/2316/My-Beautiful-Dark-Twisted-Fantasy.aspx
9 music reviewers rate this album 10/10... omg...
Anthony I respect your opinion but you had tons of praise for it considering you only gave it a 6. If it&#39;s about &quot;selling out&quot; or giving mainstream music high scores, it&#39;s alright man, who gives a crap about the hipsters:
pitchfork gave this a ten wtf?!?!
review girls new EP... i know you were looking forward to its release
man. kanye will never have another Late Registration again
@theneedledrop 
this shit dumb i swear Youtube should review shit before letting users post video, this is a prime example.
From a hip hop point of view I think College Dropout was by far his best album but I love this album because production wise and even sometimes lyrically Kanye is one of the best right now.
i&#39;m still surprised that he sampled King Crimson and Aphex Twin. that alone made me like this album
how u heard it and it aint drop yet?
The best tool in Kayne&#39;s Tool box is being a ass holey genius 
I havent listened to the whole album yet, but power and runaway are fricking amazing. If the rest albums as good as those songs, then this is possible the greatest album of all time
mehh......
Fave Kanye album is SUCH A HARD ONE TO CHOOSE! ...but I wouldn&#39;t put Graduation on there. 808s was a great change of pace but I&#39;d say this is my fav Kanye album to date. I absolutely loved this. I don&#39;t care much about his social life either but I found the best way to get around those lyrics is to try to think of it as a fictional persona and see how creatively he can tell that story..just a suggestion =). Question though - your thoughts on him sampling/interpolating Iron Man on Hell of a Life?
@runescape9087 but u also gotta support kanye when it really comes out, he put hard work into it
buy it ;)
Wow I didnt really expect that u really need to go back a LISTEN.......................... TO THE ALBUM and nxt review should b Pink Friday or Hunger for More 2
I take kanyes way of viewing his weaknesses and mistakes as very inspiring. 
Awesome review. Kanye&#39;s my favorite rapper, so I enjoyed this a lot, but I can definitely see where you&#39;re coming from. However, you&#39;re kinda in a league of your own, meaning that there are very few people who took the time to listen to this whole album if they didn&#39;t care about Kanye at all. But that&#39;s still a valid reason to dislike it. I&#39;d give the album an 8.75/10, and College Dropout&#39;s my favorite Kanye album. 
Lovin how people are requesting reviews for Rihanna, Lady Gaga, Lil&#39; Wayne. Can&#39;t wait till Anthony gets back to reviewing indies, I can already see their comments &quot;WhY yOu ReViEwInG all dese wierd bandz?!!!1?&quot;
For new music to review (something that&#39;s come out recently), I&#39;d suggest Atmosphere&#39;s &quot;To All My Friends, Blood Makes The Blade Holy: the Atmosphere ep&#39;s&quot; and/or Tech N9ne&#39;s &quot;Seepage EP&quot;, though I don&#39;t know if you listen to either artist in the first place.
And I&#39;d also suggest &quot;Wake Up!&quot; by John Legend &amp; The Roots.
@chestveeg I think we&#39;re at the point where Grammys don&#39;t mean shit 
I don&#39;t get what you&#39;re criticism is, you can&#39;t relate to what he&#39;s saying? I really don&#39;t get it.  Pinkerton is Weezers best album because it is so personal and all about Rivers, whether or not you can relate to it doesn&#39;t matter it just hits hard.  This is Kanyes best album hands down. 
of the independent persuasion?
@lovesstospooch , i forget which song (all of the lights or dark fantasy maybe?) but it&#39;s the line where he says, &#39;wanna murder a south park writer&#39;.
kanye is a douche
@ExitWoundColt45 You don&#39;t understand the concept of an opinion? LOLOLOLOL
@ALMOSTlikeRODNEY you must be fuckign stupid this album is insane and i wasent even a kanye west fan liek that 
love you reviews!
have you ever reviewed wild beasts?
@ExitWoundColt45 why do you care what the score is? what does it matter? 
@ALMOSTlikeRODNEY my glitches are for the lulz, brah.
@JimmyFredricks kanye
@kingcanti i kno, right?
@matthewdnielsen it ended up on the cutting room floor. apologies. the original version of this review was over 9 mins. O__o
kanye is an idiot. i dont understand why people bother. 
daughters t-shirt ftw
i don&#39;t care about kanye&#39;s social life. but this work, it&#39;s not bad at all with some pretty good productions: &quot;stepped up&quot; like you said. 
he tryed to do something new and complexier (i don&#39;t know if you get my english.france, sorry!)

but anthony, what i don&#39;t understand is: how could you give an 8 to &quot;sit down, man&quot; one of das racist&#39;s mixtape, which is most of the time just bad (2 or 3 decent tunes, the rest is trash) and just a light 6 for this artistic and interessant effort?

peace.
How did you not mention Justin Vernons appearance on this album?!
you were just asked to review lady gag gag and chemical blow mance... i think it&#39;s time to cut out the mainstream

Still waiting on that Girl Talk review.
Kanye should stop apologizing for saying the things we&#39;re thinking (well, maybe he should have attacked Taylor Swift in a more careful way). Anyways, I&#39;ve only heard a song or two but I think it&#39;s pretty good. Can&#39;t say much else due to the fact I&#39;ve heard so little.
I subscribed to this channel because I want this guys opinion. Please keep giving me your opinion, Mr. Fantano.
Thank You
Review My Chemical Romance :D
A 6 tho? RU serious?
review Menomena- Mines plz.
@needledropdamagedone 21st century
Powerslave FTW :)
@theneedledrop Nah you are not small time, just under-rated. If Kanye gets mad dnt worry I got your back son! LOL
 I totally agree with you with the fact that is hard to love Kanye as a person, i personally dislike him, but its hard to deny that he is the most exciting figure in hip hop at the moment. Every records he puts out always sounds fresh, innovative and most importantly, reflects a hunger and a sense of urgency; as if he as releasing his first and last album and wanted to get his message out there. And this is his best release yet. Even Jay z sounded fresh on this album.

First time we disagree!
fav kanye album is the college dropout
@theneedledrop Awesome!
too much features
wtf you can&#39;t review an album before it is released.... fuck!

this album is a 10
&quot;i get bored, what do you want me to do?&quot; &lt;3
wtf you can&#39;t review an album before it is released.... fuck!
whats the King Crimson sample?
Of course context should be considered. Kanye has become entirely self-referential. Context can&#39;t be ignored when that&#39;s what the art is about. That makes him interesting conceptually, groundbreaking even in some ways. But like you, I don&#39;t particularly relate to Kanye personally, so I lose interest very quickly.

Now please ignore viewers and review what you damn well please. In any group of people, even tasteful people like your viewers, consensus always forms around the absolute worst.
@SaneLunacy @sanelunacy I think you guys are getting too hung up over the production value, and forgetting what actually made me disinterested in the album: Kanye&#39;s Personal life. I don&#39;t hate that Kanye raps about himself and his various gaffes...I just don&#39;t care is all.
@SaneLunacy Not sure if I agree with you here. If Kanye was on Stones Throw, I&#39;m pretty sure his personal details would still be boring as hell. And don&#39;t act like I haven&#39;t given any major label albums great scores this year. :-P You just might be lying to urself right there. 
@cann3dheat i wasn&#39;t in love with &#39;em. what can I do? *shrugs*
@Creamy360 are they? i haven&#39;t seen it...but then again i haven&#39;t been there in a couple days.
@Bangaz22 No, the album got a 6 because I don&#39;t find the subject matter that interesting. That&#39;s my subjective point of view. I said at the end of the review, if one is interested in the small details of Kanye&#39;s social life, the album will be much more thrilling. There&#39;s extremely impressive production here, and not all the hooks are bad. I liked the LP, for sure, but I wasn&#39;t in love with it. The album just wasn&#39;t to die for  to me. But if you&#39;re digging it, dig on, man. :-)
@sorrycaps patsy cline :-)
@VanillaExtractz well no reason to be sad, dude. just a difference of opinion. make the world turn.
@SloppySailor i see what you did there. 
@AmorBravo I did like that track. It was one of my favs, and I listed it in the DBOX. However, a lot of stuff ended up on the cutting room floor for this review. The original version was 9 minutes. O__o
@iamnotchemistry honestly, a LOT of stuff ended up on the cutting room floor here. the original review was 9 freaking minutes...O___o I&#39;m lucky i got it to 7, hah.
does youtube have an auto-tune plugin?
@homer422 Need a tissue, bro?
@MrZombiejfk I&#39;ll try. :-)
@cyclone927 I don&#39;t think Kanye will care about some small time dude like me. :-P
@TheJacobdude74b Well, I don&#39;t feel like you need to know Kanye. I think you just have to be interested in knowing him. I, personally, don&#39;t feel that interested. But for those who are, this&#39;ll be an amazing album, for sure. :-)
@Crim122 I actually liked the Strong Arm Steady album. I didn&#39;t get a chance to review it when it came out, though. :-( Maybe I&#39;ll get a chance before 2011 rolls in.
@notsert123 i will. :-)
@joepulliam1 for you it is. for me it&#39;s not. it&#39;s all just a matter of perspective. :-)
@andy92811 I did? I thought I was trying to describe how I felt about the record. Better luck next time. :-P
@Silenceless In a lot of ways it really is better than How I Got Over. My issue is that I&#39;m really not interested in Kanye&#39;s personal details. Not interested enough to sit through some of the song lengths he&#39;s put in front of me here. This album sounds way more epic than HIGO, for sure, but it&#39;s no deeper than a kiddie pool, for me.
@Silenceless no, i did like the big boi album. i liked this album, too. i just wasn&#39;t in love with it. anything above a 5 is a like. a 5 is on the fence, and anything below is a dislike. woot woot. :-)
@mfindians18 i may do a track review from it next week, fo sho.
@JonPasqual ALLLL TIIIIIME
@Thirdboy5 well, for you it&#39;s an 8/10. :-) the 6/10 is my own personal feelings on the record. it doesn&#39;t mean you should feel that way. it&#39;s just my opinion. 
@Writtenjustice that&#39;s cool. guess you have a 1 in 10 chance. :-)
@nicellisbrown next week.
@famousashtray video game / 10
@scarletrobin new album this week.
@mariano26788 nope, patsy cline. :-)
DO Rorcal-Heliogabalus you wil like
Review Deathspell Omega - Paracletus NOW!
Blame Game is a metaphor for the music industry, w2g champ.
I want you to review: Dead_Letter_Circus-This_Is_The_Warning_(2010)  you should love this album as much as I do. Great Aussie Rock...
You should review the new Underoath album, its called Ø (Disambiguation). Obviously you don&#39;t usually review albums from that scene, but you like trying new things! (happy exclamation point, not angry) 

@MrZombiejfk you just requested an amazing album.
J. Cole - Friday night lights please!
Please, dont review anything by Florence + The Machine. Her voice is way too overdramatic. It&#39;s like Sarah McLachlan plus harps. 
@metalmania7778 then have cal chuchesta interrupt him, to say &quot;Imma let you finish but YoureWrongImRight&#39;s review of Mumford and Sons - Sigh No More was the best review in a long time!&quot;
Please anything but Girl Talk
good album
I hate to be that mosquito that keeps you up at, but I&#39;m going to keep buzzing in your ear. Please review &quot;Gypsy &amp; The Cat - Gilgamesh&quot; ... one of the catchiest albums of this year!
New Girl Talk? Please?
GIRL TALK !!!!!
REVIEW -GIRLS -  Broken Dreams Club, caaaman!
why is everyone on this album? i think its total garbage.
Album is an easy 9/10. Really loved it, but can see my enjoyment fluctuating if I get burnt out from listening to it too much.
give the album 4/5 
I&#39;d have to say that the song POWER is easily a 9. Agree w/ u on &#39;So Appalled&#39; hook, dat shit was ridiculous. The beats man..the beats!!! &lt;3 them. So generally I agree with you here but I&#39;d give this album a generous 7 because of the music (lol I won&#39;t listen to Runaway any time soon). Thanks 4 puttin my comment on the vid =] You should review the Robyn album (which she released 2 albums leading up to this one; tracks from these 2 albums are on this 3rd release). What&#39;s the deal with this Robyn?
Maybe Kanye needs to stop singing about Kanye, but that&#39;s just my opinion about it. Thanks for the review Anthony :-) Please review Games&#39; debut LP &quot;That We Can Play&quot;, I sent you a song from the album. 
review the new girls album
@surrounded surfin is an old song bro :( don&#39;t think he does old stuff
I think this should be at least an 8/10, if just for Monster, All of the Lights, and Runaway which are my favorite
Late Registration, is his best . of all time. OF ALL TIME!
Did Madlib make any beats for this album? I read somewhere that he said he was making some beats for this.
you should review death to false metal by weezer
Great review. REVIEW, &quot;SURFIN&quot; by, Memory Cassette. One of the greatest songs i&#39;ve heard in a while.
Mechine dream by little dragon.... Heard that??
Review Opus Eponymous by Ghost!
For being a &quot;nerd&quot; he is built like a brick shit house. (thats what gramma used to say) And he is pretty bad ass. And just to take a guess i bet he is tripod if yeah get my drift.
also Anthony didn&#39;t like the Big Boi ALbum.... go figure.
Anthony usually gets it wrong with hip-hop.  MBDTF is so much better than How I Got Over.
You should review the new My Chemical Romance album. I&#39;d love to see what do you have to say about it.
Good, honest review. Context matters.

Also, Patsy Cline tee FTW.
kanye west is an idiot and his music is horrible.
shit sucked
@IdisagreewithMe hip hop lol
the fudge???? did u bootlegged the cd or something cuz the album doesnt come till Nov. 22
Yeah I&#39;d give it about a 6.  I really wanted more just rapping and clever lyrics.  I got sick of a lot of the choruses.
Love your reviews usually, but, opinion aside, you got this one wrong.
@noruegazero Yes I l&#39;d like to hear this as well. Also No Joy Ghost Blonde

And whatever else is up in iTunes Indie Spotlight heh heh? Come to think of it, what does Cal Cuchesta think about iTunes Indie Spotlight?

 
@TRlPZ lmbo smh
Please, review the new Decemberists single “Down by the Water”
What did you think of kanye&#39;s previous albums?
New Cage The Elephant track comes our tomorrow called Shake Me Down. Just making sure everyone who is awesome knows. And keep being awesome Anthony, you&#39;re the only source I go to for musc, &#39;cause your just that awesome. Been hooked ever since you reviewed Congratulations!
I enjoyed MBDTF alot, &quot;Dark Fantasy&quot; being my favorite track, I just which the album had less features but thats me. I still think College Dropout was Kanyes best album...College Dropout is a fuckin classic in my book.....Kanye is gonna be mad at this review, Anthony watch out! LOL
Could you review Pyramid of the Sun, by Maserati?
Please review the new Gorillaz track &quot;Doncamatic feat. Daley&quot;!!!!!!!
well of course you should respect or like an artist to like the album. because an album should be an extention of personality sure ppl u hate  can make music that sings to you ehemm but to liek an album the artist doing it must be adored and alla stone roses kanye wants to be adored, the album come out on monday in scotland so i dont get it till then i would but it weather this review wasa 10 or a 1 but as i thought theres good parts and bad parts. still its a hip hop event , review new DRE
love you steve brule delivery 
very good review :] 
wow a 6, i thought it was really impressive for mainstream hip hop i give it an 8/10
Kanye did some awesome tracks back then, but in this LP I only liked Runaway, and the drum pattern of All of the Light, and that&#39;s it.
Girl Talk, All Day, do it. Go ahead, do it.
You should of done the intro in auto-tune
Could you review avenged sevenfolds album plz
You&#39;re not gonna even comment on the Bon Iver track &quot;Lost in the World&quot;...aw.
Light to decent 6?

I&#39;m so appalled. 

Man this shit is fuckin riculous, fuckin ridicolous 
To me this review was like Ye wrote a term paper and it was excellent. But he missed a few commas and the teacher didn&#39;t like the particular subject he wrote about so he got a D.
Das Racist is runnin&#39; rap
@tittiesman1231 but a person piquing your interest as an individual has nothing to do with the quality of music. I think Nas can be a very boring individual but he still makes great music. I just don&#39;t understand how you get a basically stellar review and receive a 6. I mean, listen to the review. He basically docked him 4 points for a few bad hooks. 
Happy to see that im not the only one who has problems with the hooks
Dont review the new Girl Talk!
Yeah, a couple songs just ruined this album for me like &quot;all of the lights&quot; and &quot;Monster&quot; otherwise it was quite the album.
The new Solefald album &quot;Norrøn Livskunst&quot; is out and it is a phenomenal piece of blackened avant-garde folk metal.  You should seriously track it down because you owe it to your ears.  If not I suppose a review of Agalloch&#39;s &quot;Marrow of the Spirit&quot; would be acceptable as well.
fuck that no talent splib
I&#39;m looking forward to check out this, and the cover art is cool as hell.

Also, who&#39;s on your shirt?

Review: Deathspell Omega - Paracletus! :D :D :D
yeah I agree Anthony, Kanye doesn&#39;t pique or peak my interest. 
i sort of feel that the only reason that he went into this category of music is just because of how much of sampling is becoming popular and all these &quot;artsy&quot; songs are just sort of an entrance to this whole realm of music and that kanye thought he could pull something out of the blue when people have been doing this for years and have still been struggling, i bet if he does something else like this then he could definitely do better and make a great album, this time around, its aright 6/10 frvr
only a 6? Fail. This is album of the year no doubt. 
/mu/ is hyping the hell out of this album
Is it out???? :)
new Girl Talk please
wow this seems to be the most controversial review yet... I thnk every body needs to take it down a noch it&#39;s just opinion yall
personally I love the album.  It is up their as my favorites of the year if not the favorite.  Kanye is really taking some ballsy moves with the album that I can really appreciate.  How many of his mainstream fans are going to enjoy the 3 minute closer of Runaway?
Marroowwwwwwwww.
...Of the Spirit.
@Caligula138 AGREED x1000
well......im surprised by the 6 but I think this album is far from his best work I&#39;d give itan 8 just cause it&#39;s WAY better then Graduation &amp; 808&#39;s, but I was a little disapointed in some of the songs but overall it&#39;s pretty good. But as you always say it just opinion. (REVIEW-u know already what I&#39;m gonna ask 4 Marnie stern LP, or Kno-death is silent or mount kimbie crooks &amp; lovers)
Bah... I give two shits about Kanye...  All the people askin you to review this are corny.
@Bangaz22 i agree there seems to be double standard here cause it&#39;s mainstream rap. But i digress.

Hey, I know it&#39;s kinda unrelated but could you review Jatoma&#39;s new LP? 

Thanks  x
I truly dislike him as a person. But he tries to push boundaries in his music so I can&#39;t fault him. New girl talk album review?????????
A six? Wow. You bascially gave it a awesome review and rated it a six? I really don&#39;t know about this man. I&#39;ve seen you say for far more bad things about albums you have given 7&#39;s or 8&#39;s to.
Usually agree with you on reviews, but Big Boi &amp; Kanye at a 6 this year? Hmm...
I&#39;m still holding out for a AHEMdecentqualityleakHERM of this album... so I can&#39;t give my opinion just yet.
I hate to be so boring and poppy but i dig this shit
One of the best albums of the year. I was blown away.
idk, i understand your opinion but the review seemed a little too positive for a light-decent 6.
Finally someone has the guts to give this guy a score below incredable or jawdropping. Good job Ant.! 
@SaneLunacy But he said the production is stunning.
@ignoranttwat 
Second.
@SaneLunacy I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll agree with this comment.
6 out of 10? Really?! smh.
thanks for not throwing roses at his feet like everyone else. he hasnt won me over yet either no matter how much i hear him.
@SaneLunacy

 ya think? His shirt yesterday was 3 cats howling at the moon.
you shoud come back to this album after youve listened to it for a while... then rereview it and your opinion willprobably be diffrent
*West
Kanye west sampling King Crimson. I didn&#39;t see that coming. First comment, BTW. Haven&#39;t watched the video yet either.
