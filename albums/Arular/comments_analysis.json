It was no offensive caricature. I guess it was so accurate because it was the first time I was not seeing an Imperialistic overview of my culture. There is a bigger degree of understanding when it&#39;s between citizens of two countries that have been very explored by Europe and North America throughout History.<br><br>And it&#39;s funny because I was a kid at the time and I already felt it! I did not know what Imperialism was in theory, but I knew for my experience. So, I got to listen to her music and got in touch with this kind of discourse.
