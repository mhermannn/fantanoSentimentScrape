But she the one most people are stealing from if that makes sense. There also was that homophobic female rapper that came out in 95 who had a experimental 3rd album. She reminds me of Left Eye vocal wise. And &quot;R Kelly in[side] his teens.&quot; Her word play is second to none. She has no reason to really go in though. Macho is hard af though. Fire fire is overrated.",2

ABSOLUTELY ahead of her time. Being from Brasil, it was the first time I could see someone from out of Latin America express anything about my country with such accuracy. It was no offensive caricature. I guess it was so accurate because it was the first time I was not seeing an Imperialistic overview of my culture. There is a bigger degree of understanding when it&#39;s between citizens of two countries that have been very explored by Europe and North America throughout History.<br><br>And it&#39;s funny because I was a kid at the time and I already felt it! I did not know what Imperialism was in theory, but I knew for my experience. So, I got to listen to her music and got in touch with this kind of discourse. Arular started that third-world revolutionary empowerment in my early teenage years.  Thanks M.I.A. &lt;3",5
