RIP to all the innocents who died
A Genius
I bongo with my lingo
I genuinely think this is a 10
This album sounds like two computers having an intense dance battle in the middle of a Sri Lankan slum.
she was born in sri lanka, not london
U.R.A.Q.T is such a fun bop
We love classic week YEAH
She is one of the last true musical artists in my opinion
Today this video have became 2 years old.
This album has aged phenomenally. So fresh, so eclectic, so diverse. Fire Fire, Galang, Sunshowers really stick out to me. In my opinion it‚Äôs one of the greatest debut albums ever and it‚Äôs Maya‚Äôs best album
Thank you Anthony for recommending me this album, it&#39;s all that I&#39;ve been listening to all this week, fucking amazing
so she&#39;s lost her based card now huh
She was like 17 years ahead of the curve, now in 2022 most music sounds like this
This has got to be a huge influence on Death Grips. The album is so bumpy and just‚Ä¶LOUD in the best way. Such an under appreciated artist.
I love M.I.A. to death but Lords of Acid, Consolidated, Peaches, or Kelis could have done these beats. But she the one most people are stealing from if that makes sense. There also was that homophobic female rapper that came out in 95 who had a experimental 3rd album. She reminds me of Left Eye vocal wise. And &quot;R Kelly in[side] his teens.&quot; Her word play is second to none. She has no reason to really go in though. Macho is hard af though. Fire fire is overrated.
Two most iconic artists of the 2000s -- MF DOOM and M.I.A.
Review kala
All of her albums are absolutely brilliant
Her music is fantastic. (And I think Rap in general Crap due to non-musicality of it. You can only mumble &quot;bitches&quot;, &quot;fuck&quot;, and &quot;nigga&quot; so many times before it&#39;s just so much garbage. But apparently, the masses are clueless on this.)  Anyway, Great music, MIA!  Thank you for music and for bucking the trashy trends!!!
this album is so fucking good
Arular was an excellent album. Her single Galang was a good song, so was the video.
Thank you for reviewing this masterpiece!
She‚Äôs PC Music before PC Music became PC Music.
You know it‚Äôs crazy‚Ä¶ I thought paper planes was by this dumb one hit wonder ass artist. But after seeing someone use a different sound under a tiktok. She‚Äôs beginning to be one of my favorite sounding artist of the 2000s
I love M.i.A.
Sounded like he was winding up to give it a 10 there
My favourite MIA for sure, this album is flawless imo I LOVE IT
Modern music ..eh ?
Each and every tune of this timeless masterpiece is a banger that will put you in a trance
It&#39;s pronounced uh-ru-luhr or uh-ru-laar, melon
Why does Anthony hate hidden tracks so much?
MIA is a genius.
It‚Äôs not for me, but I checked it out because of you - appreciate the exposure!
I‚Äôve never really understood her hype. I don‚Äôt hate her, in fact I think some of her music is pretty cool, but the hip hop and electronic community hype her up so much I would‚Äôve thought she had a voice like Sam Cooke, and lyrics like Kendrick.
Her album MAYA still sounds ahead of time. Critics wete not ready for it when it came in 2010. But yes that was her least accessible album ever.
I LOVE YOU M.I.A. üòòüß°üß°üß°üß°üß°üß°üß°
MAYA in Classics Week.
Great great album!!!<br>Great review!!!
People need to be revisiting music and movies that got a little dust on them. They&#39;re still great works of art.
THIS ALBUM IS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS POP MUSIC HAS EVER GIVEN ME.<br>She expresses the urgency of the third world agenda with such excellence that makes me cry of happiness. ABSOLUTELY ahead of her time. Being from Brasil, it was the first time I could see someone from out of Latin America express anything about my country with such accuracy. It was no offensive caricature. I guess it was so accurate because it was the first time I was not seeing an Imperialistic overview of my culture. There is a bigger degree of understanding when it&#39;s between citizens of two countries that have been very explored by Europe and North America throughout History.<br><br>And it&#39;s funny because I was a kid at the time and I already felt it! I did not know what Imperialism was in theory, but I knew for my experience. So, I got to listen to her music and got in touch with this kind of discourse. Arular started that third-world revolutionary empowerment in my early teenage years.  Thanks M.I.A. &lt;3
Damn, now all these indie boys are gonna be jumping on. Haha. Great review  Anthony. -fly pirates xx
Wow, this is amazing.  I&quot;ve been listening to her first album on repeat lately....time to start spinning the second one too! Thanks for the great review.  Mathangi Arulpragasam ROCKS, then and NOW.
Discovered her through the song Galang. Best song in this album.
This has been one of my favourite albums for years now. Regardless of her later work, Arular and Kala are modern day classics. Very few albums are so consistently energetic and entertaining. Just be careful driving to this music.
Can you rate my friend‚Äôs song? It‚Äôs only on soundcloud since she doesn‚Äôt have enough money. It‚Äôs called To be a Bee. Please do this for charity, it would mean so much to her.......
Came here from The Quietus.
You reviewed this?!?!?!?!?!!
She&#39;s one of my heroes!
just listened to the album because of this and maaaan this was so ahead of its time, mind is blown
I like the album more than Kala, which was disappointing. MIA is not the greatest artist of the 00s but she certainly deserves her place.
BA<br>NA<br><b>NAAAAA</b>
This has got me wanting a Kala review.
Piracy funds terrorism is the defining sound of the 2000‚Äôs for me. I love MIA so much still today.
THANK YOU
Thank you for this video. Been listening to her since forever and still do - feels good to hear her being appreciated by someone other than me
WHOLE LOTTA RED REVIEW
M.i.A.
That mid af Swagger Like Us track introduced me to MIA back in 09. Used to jam this a lot. Imo this is her most consistent and best record.
one of the best albums of all time
We all liked Paper Planes when it came out that year. I was in the used cd section on an electronic store this recent 2020. I spied her Kala album and was so tempted to get it. I wanted to bad but I was out of a job. <br>I started listening to it online and it is such a banger. Now I&#39;m wondering why I never tried listening to her too much over all these years
Hi, can you please review Gashi‚Äôs album :1984
Wait this album bangs so hard...
well
Thank you Anthony. First downward spiral from nin and then this. Really cool
the way he says &quot;rio de janeiro&quot; kkkk
Thanks Fantoine it&#39;s my favorite record
M.I.A.: oi garoto üòè<br>fantano: if that&#39;s not political I don&#39;t know what is ü•∫
One of my favorite albums of all time. From beginning to end. The Sanford &amp; Son sample slays me. And 10 Dollars is my go to just feel good jam
CLASSICS WEEK? DO UGK‚ÄôS ‚ÄúRIDIN DIRTY‚Äù
You should do a classic track review just of Paper Planes
I love this album, and the mixtape is just as good (if not a little better). Both her mixtapes are so good and worth a listen
yes
uk rapper, singer, songwritter, multimedia artist, political activIst and anti-vaxxer M.I.A
review marsha4u by princessmarsha6969!
I remember I was bullied for listening to her, for having a too weird of a music taste,  oh how the turntables. I love this review!!
Love M.I.A. and love this album
2005 is considered classic now. Damn time, you mind not sneaking up on me like that?
I wonder if somebody hates you more than I do... is it possible that I&#39;m your biggest hater... I have real morbid fantasies... (and it has nothing to do with M.I.A)
I picked this up on CD a few years back at thrift for $2, and it is still the best $2 I ever spent.
So pleased you looked back at this one - one of my all time favourites and the soundtrack for a generation. Loved the review!
DO YS
Salt and pepper your mangos y&#39;all.
I always get excited when I see one of my favorite albums growing up be reviewed for good classics.
Yo did Anthony reveiw wlr
A Ready to Die, Liquid Sword and Delton 3030 classic review will kill Corona and end the 2020 curse Melon ! I&#39;ve heard this prophecy playing Mbdtf backwards!!
One of my favourite albums!

‚ÄúThis is my jam today‚Äù only the real know
before diplo was doing trendy millenial edm, he debuted with weird shit like this!
Her second album Kala is better. They&#39;re both worth a listen though.
This album was high art
REVIEW WLR

So....a 10? You gotta give a number man.
WLR? Melon
I love classic week &lt;3
Please, sir! Plague Soundscapes from The Locust! It&#39;s a classic that NEEDS to seed those who haven&#39;t heard it.
OMG I&#39;ve been listening this album again since 2005/2006 for a couple weeks now! It ROCKS. Nice to see we&#39;ve been in the same wavelength!
Alls we need is a KALA review and you‚Äôve got all her albums covered on your channel :)
I remember my older sister playing Bucky Done Gun when I was younger, and thought it was an interesting song (along with Paper Planes). I wasn&#39;t old enough to really &quot;follow&quot; music at the time, so that was pretty much it. But then in high school I re-discovered those songs and did a dive into everything else she&#39;s done. She&#39;s an incredibly talented artist, and has definitely had a huge influence on the type of music I listen to today
Anthony please do a review for wizkid&#39;s &#39;made in lagos&#39; album
one of my favorite albums of all time. one of the few that i always find myself coming back to.
One of my favorites, a good one Anthony!
I thot this album was a bit of a dissappointment. It&#39;s an annoying album
where&#39;s the Bach review everybody wants, Anthony?
I haven&#39;t stopped listening to Paper Planes since it came out
WHOLE LOTTA RED
HARD AGREE ON THIS ONE SUPER UNDERRATED
MIA is so underrated thank u for this
Love Love This album! IIRC M.I.A. started out by doing the Jacket Art and design for the band Elastica before making her own music.<br><br>Anthony, You&#39;re So NEW, You&#39;re Retro! -Tricky
This was my shit in college.
REVIEW DEMON DAYS
Diplo never sounded as good as he did here.
Just realized /\/\ /\ Y /\ influenced PC Music probably
I love this album
Kevin from Blues Clues looks a little different here.
Great review and such a great album.
Scott Ackerman did the bit with the silly-billy-bean variations on his name waaaaay before you did, Melon. Comedy Bang Bang is life
Remember when Anthony told Cal to go eat a hot dog - Cal got excited - and then opened the cabinets for 13 hours? <br><br><br>I miss that.
my guy wys
read M.I.A. on the title and i instantly thought that she dropped a new album :/
THANKS FOR THE INFOS AND I KNOW YOU GONNA GIVE WLR A 5 AND I AGREE
WLR ?
Anthony trying to figure out what a &quot;political statement&quot; is for 11 minutes
Dislike cuz no WLR REVIEW
This album is iconic
Shut up about WLR, it‚Äôs classics week and all I‚Äôm waiting for is my NIN - The Downward Spiral review
Is the Mtbmb side b review coming or no ?
Drop the fucking WLR review
Dude, we really need to talk, where is that whole lot of red review, its been 2 weeks since it was released and you still haven&#39;t done anything with it. I&#39;m itching man, I need it, like really need it. Each day that goes on and its not here, the pain in mind, body and soul continues to grow and infect me. Please, for the the love of God, review it before I die from this pain and explode into a infinite amount of bits.
YASSSSSS
When will you review whole lotta red?
And the WLR review is...???
Aye but when are you gonna review ‚ÄúLove Goes‚Äù by Sam Smith. Lyrically it‚Äôs one of their most powerful in my opinion.
Gotta review McCartney III, melon!

For classics week, review:<br><br>Common - Like Water For Chocolate<br><br>Kanye West - The College Dropout<br>Michael Jackson - Off The Wall<br>Nirvana - Nevermind<br>The Beatles - The White Album
I just came in here to say we want WLR review. I have no interest in this video and my watch time isn&#39;t higher than 1 second. Goodbye.
I suggest you listen to √Åsgeir. He&#39;s a wonderful icelandic artist who converts all of his songs into english. If you do see this, listen to his 2020 album bury the moon.
Hurry up and do carti melon
Under talked about album. So good. Listened to it after I heard the Vijay Iyer Trio&#39;s cover of Galang about 2-3 years ago
This is a fucking classic but i think Kala is even better. Truly a couple of revolutionary records. Sadly, M.I.A.&#39;s career has gone downhill from there.
Can you do WLR?
MUSIC TO BE MURDERED BY SIDE B PLZZZZ
Nice man, totally unexpected to see you review this gem now lol, after her 3rd, 4th and 5th releases. Huge M.I.A. fan here since Bucky dropped on mtv back in 05 :)
I ‚ù§Ô∏è Classics week
Where. Is. The. Wholle. Lotta. Red. Review. Anthony.
Pretty good review melon, but you didn&#39;t have drop the n-word on playboi carti just because he released WLR, this isn&#39;t even the right review yet!
Melon can‚Äôt decide if he wants to give WLR a 0 or 10
Can you talk about MF Doom
I&#39;m waiting for you to do a review on constru√ß√£o of chico buarque has a classic album<br>probably the best production I&#39;ve ever heard in my life
WLR
It‚Äôs funny. I came to your channel for a Whole Lotta Red review, and I found this. I‚Äôve strangely been listening to M.I.A and reading up on her, because I wondered why she didn‚Äôt blow, because she was kinda supposed to. Gotta say this was good content. I wasn‚Äôt subbed cause I don‚Äôt always agree but you won me on this one.
Your review of Playboi Carti is M.I.A.
thank you anthony
Review Puscifers new album! :)

I still listen to this record once a month
M.I.A is a genius. She was so ahead of her time it&#39;s crazy, and the fact that many people still know her only as the paper planes one hit wonder girl is insane to me.

lol listen to me you little bald noobie reiview whole lotta erd or gordon ramcsey will come and yell at your face lol he will rekt you in Mario kart wii and you will get hacked by aliesn from jupiters red circle
It is classic indeed. The first time I heard about M.I.A. when the music video &quot;Bucky Done Gun&quot; was shown and group of people said their opinions about it. One woman said how she doesn&#39;t like foreign artists singing in English instead of their own language. This happened in Finland - we have bands like Nightwish, Children of Bodom, and H.I.M. singing in English. I guess she meant 3rd world artists should not sing in English. The worst opinion ever.
LONDON, QUIETEN DOWN I NEED TO MAKE A SOOOUUNNDD
The albums he places in the background during classic reviews are ones he thinks he‚Äôll review for classics weeks 10-20 years from now.
So are you just like not gonna review whole lotta red or something

When melon says &#39;transition&#39; near the start of a video my heart skips a beat
WLR?
In 05 when this album dropped I remember my girlfriend, now wife, bought it and would blast it while driving around.  She heard about it in a college class and I kick myself for not giving the album much attention at the time or for going to see MIA on a club tour that summer.  Will be good to revisit this one and now I&#39;m dying to see what he talks about tomorrow.
WHOLE LOT OF RED.. NOW

wow this album is insane for its time, thanks for introducing me anthony
in my opinion MIA real classic is the verse she gave on FRANCHISE
i disliked this album ngl
Wait a minute, this isn&#39;t Whole Lotta Red, anthony please i stg I need it to form my opinion on WLR please
So excited for her upcoming project
If this video is not a political statement, I don&#39;t know what is.
&quot;...Pull up the people, pull up the poor...&quot;
Love this album,  was just listening to it last week and it&#39;s still awesome.
This isn&#39;t Headstrong by Trapt

WHOLE LOTTA RED REVIEW WHEN?
Hey it&#39;s the paper planes girl!
Yo, any chance you are doing a review of This Binary Universe by BT?  It&#39;s definitely a huge release in the realm of glitch.
First album I‚Äôve ever heard of hers I cut out some the designs from the albums artwork üî•üî•üî•.
While lotta red?
WHERE&#39;S WLR MELONIO
Review wlr
I need a dandelion gum review
Her first three album were amazing and really got me hooked. From then on, I think she lost quality and originality. Such a shame
If it&#39;s classic week, try covering FLOOOOOOOOOOOD!
Amazing album üëè
Anthony you should do Either/Or it&#39;s very special album
I much prefer her second album...
WLR REVIEW NOW.
I&#39;ve been waiting so long lol
WLRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
I still listen to this album frequently. I love it!
Hey great review bud, just wondering, where‚Äôs the you know...... WLR review
I never knew this was considered a classic fantano I now will regard this as a classic also lol
I don&#39;t get how this is more &quot;classic&quot; than Kala.
Next you should review Kala
Anyone else 1st hear &#39;Bucky Don Gon&#39; on IMF (International Music Feed) when it was a channel?
This isn‚Äôt the Whole Lotta Red review Anthony.
Review the College dropout
Let&#39;s agree: Anthony chose M.I.A. for classics week just so he can make travis scott fans shut the f*ck up.
one of my favs
M.I.A. Forever
damn fantano, I been bumpin this shit heavily in 2020. how did you know???
Playboi review now please
Thanks for reviewing the goat&#39;s work for the 12-year old modern rap fans who only know her from Travis Scott&#39;s latest single. They need to know how badly she washes all of their faves.
Weirdly, I just revisited this album for the first time in years last week. I first heard this album because of a &quot;what I&#39;ve been listening to&quot; post by Trent Reznor on the NIN website, and it really captured my attention. I haven&#39;t liked any of her subsequent work as much, but this is still an absolute classic.
REVIEW WHOLE LOTTA REDDDDDD üßõ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü©∏
the MIA documentary Matangi/Maya/M.I.A is great too
This album is a bop
I‚Äôm so happy you have reviewed this. M.I.A is so under appreciated
Wlr
Is he just not gonna review WLR üòÇ?
Thanks for the album, Tony
Antonio el Fantas
Rip DOOM
Thanks for expanding my taste! I never would have listened to this. Sounds dope.
yesssssssssss long overdue
Really glad Tony finally did this one, there was so much embarrassing MIA slander floating around post Franchise. People flaunting their ignorance of her when she&#39;s one of the most influential musical pioneers of the 2000s with 3 classics under her belt.
Thank you Anthony now &quot;Hombre&quot; is stuck in my head and I can&#39;t get it out üôÉ
WHERE . IS . THE . WLR . REWIEW
talk about wlr already
Review A Night At The Opera by Queen
I legit just started revisiting this album and MAYA last week. MIA really is enigmatic for various ways and deserves to be remembered for more than her radio hits.
music to be murdered by side b please
‚ÄòIs this it‚Äô review for classics week
Where is the Eminem review
No eminem review?
Givin MIA fair dues. My guy
Still my favorite album from her üéß üé∂ üî•
Sorry how come is this classic? Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs a decent album, but calling it classic... ugh
When do we get the MTBMB B side?:)
You will just ignore whole lotta red?
Lateralus by Tool please!
The &quot;hidden track&quot; gimmick was NOT GOOD. It ruins far too many endings to albums that were otherwise fine up until that point. It&#39;s not even an aesthetic approach when the rest of the album doesn&#39;t have long pauses throughout.  It&#39;s essentially the equivalent of making 90+ minute albums with like 15+ tracks within genres that don&#39;t normally go above 45 minutes and 10-15 tracks for a singular album.
Stalling that WLR review...
Are we really going to have to wait a week for the Eminem review
Do we not give classics scores?
I feel old to hear this is a classic. I was 21 when this came out and still feel like it!
I&#39;VE BEEN WAITING! A CLASSIC
This album was the kind that defined the sound we&#39;ve heard since then, thanks to her and Diplo. <br><br>Every copycat around tried to get inspired from her sound but no one came close to it, I think about Beyonce who simply has no creativity (don&#39;t ask MacDonald to be a Michelin star level restaurant, obviously). <br><br>Thank you M.I.A for this piece of art.
This isn‚Äôt the WLR review...
No one cares review wlr
Review AmarElo of the Emicida, please!
i hope we get a kala review at some point üò≠
College dropout or late registration for classic week?
wingo wango
Can we expect a Whole Lotta Red Review soon Melon?
was bout to put a WLR comment but i started listening to this album right before i put that comment and this shit&#39;s fire bruh
review jonatan leandoer - Blodhundar &amp; Lullabies lol
So happy you covered this, blasted it all through highschool and never understood why it wasn&#39;t bigger
My friend Louie Greensmith just released his first album Welcome on spotify. It&#39;s a chill kinda psychadelic vibe, pls feel free to give it a listen :)
F i n a l l y
Thought Kala would‚Äôve been reviewed instead of this.
First song I heard was Bucky dun gun when I was in high school. She has always been quite quirky.
you didn&#39;t talk about the lyrics of 10 dollar? coward
Where‚Äôs the WLR review
Why hasn&#39;t he reviewed Eminem&#39;s new album ?
Really curious to hear this album
RoCkStAr MaDe~ RoCkStAr MaDe~
:( i hope Fantano reviews RE by Caf√© Tacvba, a real stone in latin american music from the 90&#39;s, a insipration for almost every mexican band since... :( hopes are high
Who else thought he was gonna review Kala?
what classic means? anyone?
so how long until you do a nana grizol classic review
WE NEED WLR
I remember shouting &quot;ARULAR IS MIA&#39;S BEST ALBUM&quot; during the Q&amp;A session of Fantano&#39;s last show in San Francisco, and now he&#39;s doing a classics review of it. Good Memories.
Review whole lotta red asap
So I take it that wlr will conclude classic week as the most modern hahahhha
My bro simping
My favorite M.I.A. Not only because it‚Äôs how I discovered her music with Bucky Done Gun
I listened to it last year and I didn&#39;t like it that much. Kala had some catchy tunes, this one wasn&#39;t well produced and pretty forgettable. But for real, I&#39;m not a big fan of M.I.A.-Albums either, there are always 2 or 3 really good songs I love and repeat the shit out of, but the rest is nearly unlistenable experimental garbage. The political things aren&#39;t a help.
wlr now
This review could be my Christmas present. Thank you!

For classics week, I think it‚Äôd be pretty neat if you could review Something/Anything? by Todd Rundgren
WHERE WHOLE LOTTA RED
WHERE THE FUCK IS THE WHOLE LOTTA RED REVIEW YOU SLACKING
You reviewed the right one!
My favorites are Bingo and Hombre, and let&#39;s not forget M.I.A. is sexy as f*** in the Galang music video.
DROP WLR
This album was a large part of my childhood and very much helped me in my journey in music. Thanks for reviewing it, Anthony.
WHERE IS WLR REVIEW?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
Wait this isn&#39;t WLR
can eversince be considered for classics week since it‚Äôs 5 years old
Nice review but saying at the end &quot;I&#39;m not going to review Whole Lotta Red because Playboi Carti is clearly gay&quot; is not a reason
Where‚Äôs WLR Vampirethony Darkthano?
I got my first blumpkin to this album. Take that as you will.
bro are u gonna do whole lotta red or not
Where&#39;s the whole lotta red review brah? DROP IT NOW OR I WILL DO IT FOR YOU
Did you sell all your vinyl? Haven‚Äôt seen a vinyl update anytime soon.
you should review Either/Or by Elliott Smith for classics we ek
you know what we waiting on come on
Honestly this makes me so happy to see and I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not the only one who sees this banger of an album as a classic.
/\/\ /\ Y /\, kala, and arular uggh so good
this is such an out of left field classic for ‚Äúclassics week‚Äù but i‚Äôm here for it
I remember hearing Bucky dun gun in a skate video for a local skate park that is no longer around.
I never checked out her stuff.  Thanks melon
WLR
Eminem review when
Yaaaay Anthony uploaded! *starts twerking
Where‚Äôs WLR Anthony
did not expect to see this video on one of my all time fav albums
Whole Lotta Melon
Waiting for The Collage Dropout this week
Fun Fact : Fantano indirectly put WLR on the NOT GOOD list by not even reacting to that
Get some sleep Melon. Please.
MIA is so slept on, maybe not really slept on cuz everyone loves paper planes, but seriously if you listened to the rest of her discog she and her production are batshit insane in the best possible way. goddamn i&#39;m mad because i&#39;ve been an MIA stan for so long and i&#39;m happy more people are gonna give her love but also kinda mad that now if i talk about how i love all MIA people are gonna call me a fantano stan. a stantano if you will
Travis Scott fans hate her but we love our queen ‚ù§Ô∏è
WLR REVIEW
After Bashing Zayn and NAV repeatedly, Fantano proves hes not racist by giving MIA a positive review
Tamil Reppin
This is SO WEIRD.<br>I was literally just listening to that album today
taste
When r u gonna drop it
Why didn‚Äôt Fantano review Eminem‚Äôs new album? Did I miss something?
DROP WHOLE LOTTA RED REVIEW
review White Pony
Proto Grips. I didn&#39;t like this when I first heard it when I was like 15. Bucky Done was on NBA Live 06 and I absolutely hated it. I love it now though, great stuff.
Well we waited 2 years for Whole Lotta Red, so I guess it‚Äôs fair that we should wait 2 more years for the WLR review.
review sonic youth, review me
Whole lotta red
Review WLR now you studious cow
Please review Santigold‚Äôs Santogold album. I still listen to it with the same adoration

Wheres the To Pimp A Butterfly Review Melon You‚Äôre 5 Years Late?
Idk man, reviewing that Wiz Khalifa project the day after this one just to make a Mia Khalifa joke seems pretty juvenile
Do you plan to review Music to be Murdered By B Side?
Do man on the moon
Black on Both Sides classic review next year?
Anthony should review the Avalanches &quot;We will always love you&quot;.  Instant classic
CARTIIIIIII

this album is fire literally starts at 100% and doesn&#39;t slow down till the end
I ASKED FOR THAT!
Got into this album last August, glad to see a classic review for it lol
I though this was a real good album...
Ahhh the album that&#39;s on the bottom right is at the tip of my tongue but I can&#39;t figure it out
Review WLR bruh. Ain‚Äôt no one give a shit about these other albums üòÇ
This is really awesome the last couple of months I have discovered this record and have been amazed by it, it&#39;s really awesome to have more information and context about it.
If you don‚Äôt review ag√¶tis byrjun I stg
WLR?...........
Wait this isn‚Äôt the new review of Tory Lanez Daystar album
Whole Lotta sad rn
A Damn Classic No cap  fr
I‚Äôd love if you did ‚ÄúDemon Days‚Äù by Gorillaz!
This album is great, but I love Kala more
Always giving me more to listen to gotta appreciate that
Very good and representative review for this explosive dynamite of a record!!
I know the classic reviews don‚Äôt do as much numbers as they should, but I really appreciate you still keeping this tradition. Definitely gonna check this album out now
The Fantano Effect<br><br>September: M.I.A.‚Äôs trash, Travis should‚Äôve deleted her verse<br>January: Arular is a classic and we stan M.I.A.
Wlr review wen???
STRAIGHT UP RIPPER THIS ALBUM IS!!!!
Motm1 üòÉ
Here comes the WLR spam.
Well I know what I&#39;m listening to obsessively for the next few days. God, I love this album.
WHERES WLR MELON
Just listened to this for the first time like 2 months ago and loved it
Daydream Nation by Sonic Youth
Holy shit the timing on this is drop is so perfect, I recently just discovered the rest of this album after playing through Midnight Club 3 and banging out to Fire Fire its so good.
Do Talk Talk‚Äôs album ‚ÄúIts My Life‚Äù.
This is not Whole Lotta Red üò¨
Melon man is the goat with stripes. Also Kanye and Kim divorce so hype
Crazy this came out 15 years ago and she still never got big recognition
Review RAP FERRERIA&#39;s New Album BOB&#39;S Son?
No joke, this album was fire.... Ahead of its time..
Patiently waiting for WLR and Anthony Vamptano
anti-vaxx queen
she suck in the travis song...so
Would we even have Hacker by Death Grips if not for songs like 10 dollar?
When you said ‚ÄúM.I.A. stands for ‚ÄòMorbid iphone app,‚Äô‚Äù I didn‚Äôt get it...
I&#39;m so proud of my boy for saying &quot;south asian&quot; instead of middle eastern for the first time.
Best album art of all time
Wholethony Lottatano
We need that All Eyez On Me Classic review Anthony
don‚Äôt put the white boys onto this one üíî
Appreciate the Sri Lanka backstory on thisüôèüèΩ
Still waiting for the Whole lotta red reaction
It&#39;s a New Year&#39;s miracle - The Anthony of old resurfaces and provides a good review. Please don&#39;t go away. I really didn&#39;t enjoy the a**hole that came into their own in 2020.
Do a pink floyd record next
I never knew Steve from Blues Clues was such a big MIA fan
Review I came from nothing 2 by young thug for classic week
Whole Lotta M.I.A.
meu deus o que √© favela funk, √© funk carioca  meu
You know what we&#39;re waiting for, melon....
This is the first time I&#39;m early. Good for me.
When Anthony?<br><br><br>When will you review Side B so I can hear you shit on my favorite rapper once more...? üòÇ
This album is truly revolutionary
i think i&#39;ll die soon
Idk, classics should be more recognizable don&#39;t you think?
I only heard of M.I.A. from her 2016 album A.I.M.!<br><br>Franchise made her a #1 artist!
Bro like where tf is WLR?
Day 1 of asking Fantano to review WLR
Antonio I&#39;m from Brazil please upload the videos earlier i can&#39;t sleep thinking about u melon
Good but no paper planes, 5/10
Cmon bro stop trolling us you know what we want
Please do a classic review of Power, Corruption &amp; Lies by New Order
Now the wait for the MAYA redux review begins.
Liked and subscribed. Amazing review of a classic album
do a devotion classic review
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let that / distract from the fact / that M.I.A. pulls off an amazing balancing act‚Äù nice bar
Three more days, three more chances for Nine Inch Nails ‚ÄúThe Downward Spiral‚Äù to make it into classics week
reiou dei jinerou
I have wanted this review to happen for so, so long
First heard this when I was 14, she&#39;s been my favorite female rapper ever since!üíñ
A moment of silence for everyone who thought this was a new albumüòîüòÖ
‚ÄúBucky Done Gun‚Äù samples Brazilian funk artist Deize Tigrona‚Äôs ‚ÄúInje√ß√£o‚Äù
yes yes this is very good
Lol.
so are you saying M.I.A. is genesis-grips?
Hey, can you review Dying Like The Sun In The West from the band Primal Sinner ? I think they are great, thanks
I remember the first time I heard her albums and was like &quot;what the fuck?&quot; and after a second listen I loved it. I feel like she kinda just fell off the radar but I might go revisit her discography
Fingers crossed that Turn on the Bright Lights finally gets a classic review
Please do a Music to be Murdered by Deluxe review.
But the real classic is Matangi!!!! Just kidding (or not...)
After 2020 had one of their worst releases, I think we need Dookie or Nimrod by Green Day covered this week so we can be reminded how good they were
TNBHD review?
When&#39;s the Silent Alarm review coming?
Icki icki, kawasaki, yakiyaki
hi anthony
Just because your dad went MIA doesn&#39;t mean you need to call it the worst album you&#39;ve ever heard melon
thank you anthony. i bought this cd and kala at the same time and preferred the latter so arular fell out of rotation. Time to give it another listen!
Whole Lotta Reviews coming out that aren&#39;t about Playboi Carti...
Classic albums fantano should review <br>Original pirate material the streets <br>Bad Michael Jackson <br>dark side of the moon pink flooyd <br>Ashes of the wake lamb of it the god

Dr. Dre got so mad that u haven&#39;t reviewed MTBMB side B that he now needs a Dr.

Her style was so worldly and amazing
Did we not get a rating on this one?
For the love of god please do mezzanine by massive attack
Thank you. I always thought there was a sonic connection w/ MIA and Die Antwoord, and now I feel validated.
Pink Floyd top 4. WE NEED A WORST TO BEST, MELON BOY. also Paul McCartney dropped an album. :)<br><br>4. Animals<br>3. The Wall<br>2. DSOTM<br>1. Wish You Were Here
patiently waiting for him to saying <br>‚Äúhey everybody vampthony vamptano here‚Äù

Wow, it&#39;s crazy that Anthony put WLR in classics week while it&#39;s under a month old.
Mwa, a classic indeed
Oh wow it wasn‚Äôt Kala, that‚Äôs okay though.
wLR
Where&#39;s WLR review?
This hits
This M.I.A. Album üíø definitely goes down as a Classic.
Why is everyone asking for a wlr review on classic week bruh
LAMBORGHINI PARKED OUTSIDE ITS PURPLE LIKE LEAN

Marshall Mathers LP Review??
Brockhampton be like uhhh... They found us out
Came just to ask how she‚Äôs relevant? Isn‚Äôt this the lil girl that made that one annoying song like 10 years ago
So sad that she&#39;s now a 5G cable conspiracy theorist and an anti-vaxxer lmao.
I was at the live stream where he picked the rest of the classics for this week I am sad for some that didn&#39;t get through but he played this for us and I can&#39;t be mad this is cool
Melon we need WLR review
do The Mollusk by Ween
What&#39;s really M.I.A is the Sound of Silver classic review
Can we have Classic MKTO classic review melon ?
That‚Äôs a funny way to spell Whole Lotta Red, still a good review however
Anthony if you don&#39;t review whole lotta red than Mario Judah will have to impersonate you and do it himself
is this the one with the gunshot song on it cuz that one is a banger
IM BOUTTA MARIO JUDAH STYLE BULLY YOU INTO DROPPING THE WLR REVIEW
Pitchfork did it for you
Poopthony Pantstano
Don‚Äôt let the memes distract from the quality of the album, fellow melonlovers
Hello and have you thought about doing a live stream on twitch listening to people music on soundcloud and other music platforms and have people donate their own songs on streamlabs and have they songs heard and give advice and your opinion about the songs in the future on twitch
amazing album
review WLR already stop stalling !
Glad to see you reviewing wlr on classic week
Help Anthony I burnt my mouth on bagel bites what do I do
Okay damn is playboi carti recording under a new name now
Love this Album &lt;3
Mfs waiting for the Whole Lotta Red review just for Melon to slap it with a light 4
I&#39;m wondering why u&#39;re not reviewing whole lotta red
MIA was so ahead of her time, it‚Äôs unreal. I remember discovering her by accident on a StrictlyGlobal broadcast around 2008, it‚Äôs amazing to see what kind of influence her works have had since then.
WHOLE LOTTA CRINGE üòúüòúüòúüòú
Do interpols debut album next plz
Ayo where the fuck is the WLR review bruh!?
I&#39;m feeling a light classic/10 on this review.  Next to my head is my comment, click that up and let me know which reviews I should review next.  Anthony Fantano.  rethony viewtano.  forever
Can‚Äôt wait for the classics week review of WLR
m m i i a a mia m m i i a a mia pull up the people pull up the poor
Plastic Beach redux review please, Anthony
You should do Big Country&#39; The crossing because why not?
Gotta check the album out now.
Insert joke about how he didn&#39;t review the M.I.A. album that is actually bolded on RYM instead here.<br><br>Bonus points if you&#39;ve never even listened to M.I.A. before, like me :)
If we know that she‚Äôs in action is she really missing? Can‚Äôt we just go get her from action, wherever that is?
how long until Nav‚Äôs ‚ÄúReckless‚Äù gets a Classics Week review? It‚Äôs been 3 years, Melon.
Paved the way
People really be in the comments asking him to review an album you won‚Äôt care about in 2 months, meanwhile Tony F is out here honoring the legacy of a 15+ years old legendary album
so many comments within the first two minutes holy smokes
YESSSSSS
Very good
Wait this isnt whole lotta red!!!!!
Is that a new shirt?
MELON!!! AUDIOSLAVE!!!
AUDIOSLAVE
I&#39;ve missed you, Anthony
Fun fact: M.I.A actually stands for &quot;Drop Whole Lotta Red Review&quot;
WLR is going to be a classic review one day
Fun Fact: Saying &quot;Fun Fact&quot; gets people to stop and read anything you have to say.
WHOLE LOTTA RED REVIEW NOW!
classic album
Everyone‚Äôs talking about the WLR review while I‚Äôm here waiting for that McCartney 3 review
boards of canada for classics week
this ain‚Äôt the wlr review ü§®
Hi everyone; <b>PRAY FOR DRE</b> here.
WLR
Hello antknee
YOOOO I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE KALA I&#39;M STOKED THAT YOU&#39;RE GIVING THIS ONE ATTENTION
Give us Whole Lotta Red you melon!
Anthony where is the sorry for party rocking review
Mario Judah said if you don‚Äôt drop the WLR review, he‚Äôs going to do it for you
Whole lotta red is already a classic?
Do Selena Quintanilla
Anthony review eating booty
I‚Äôm here so early he delisted right after i clicked
I always look forward to classics week thanks antny
Great review! although i did think the rant about wanting a eurocentric ethnostate was a bit out of place, still loved it!
‚Äú2005 record‚Äù <br>Man, I keep forgetting how old I am, and it‚Äôs things like that remind me.
Still waiting on the WLR review
Wrong MIA album
POV: You didn&#39;t see the whole review and put the &quot;where&#39;s WLR review&quot; comment
never been this early before
Drop that Aethernet review
Very happy to see this
So at the beginning of each year Anthony only reviews classics, am I correct?
i just revisited this album recently... you read my mf mind
This is very unsuspecting
patiently waiting for him to saying <br>‚Äúhey everybody vampthony vamptano here‚Äù
I love classics week
The Whole Lotta Red review is gonna be delayed and delayed like the album. Don‚Äôt keep your hopes up guys. He‚Äôs probably gonna release it this Christmas.
Saying that all you wanna do is take your money to a homeless kid was a little too much
A classic? Sure, to someone with a shit opinion.
<b>(Comment about WLR)</b>
Melons edging me rn by not posting the WLR review and Plastic Beach redux smh.
I‚Äôm predicting that the top Comment will be about wlr
This doesn‚Äôt look like WLR. <br><br>Unsubbed.
This is a surprise. Still listen to this all the time.
Anthony I think you spelt whole lotta red wrong
Weird way of spelling &quot;WLR ALBUM REVIEW&quot;!!!
This is not whole lotta red review
M.I.A. inspired Death Grips for sure
That don‚Äôt say WLR Mr Fantano üò°üò°üò°
oh thank god.
About damn time!!!!! Lol this came out ages ago
waiting for 2030 when MAYA gets the recognition it deserves

This isn&#39;t the classic WLR album review anthony.
This is one of my favorite projects- definitely underrated. Glad Fantano made a vid on it
