feel this way hi everyone my anthony guy tano here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the classic m.i.a record arular yes it's classics week so it's time for a classic review this 2005 record from uk rapper producer singer songwriter multimedia artist political activist mia in my opinion she is one of the most daring artists of the 2000s whether you're talking about the quirky electro pop stylings of cairo cara bonito or even the industrial hip-hop bangers of death grips or cultural melting pot indies such as tune yards even viral e-girl rappers on youtube m.i.a was ahead of all of it while it may be tough to make the case that she's the best artist of the 2000s she certainly wrote some of the most predictive music to come out in the last 15 years even as we transition into 2021 rlr still sounds like a project that could drop a month from now and still sound current in fact i think this record and its follow-up kala sound more relevant now than they ever have because at the time that this dropped nobody was sounding like this and what's even more incredible is that mia lived to actually record and release this project i won't go into too many details here as some of them are quite harrowing and they're all readily available online for anyone who wants to read but much of her youth after being born in london was spent back in sri lanka where her father worked as an activist in a civil war that would end up displacing her family for quite a long time with her mother mia was eventually able to go back to england which put her in a position to go to art school studying fine art and video this put her on a trajectory to become a filmmaker but eventually her talents had her crossover into the music scene and that drew her to a different path that would lead to all of the demo tracking and the release of a 2004 mixtape that would set the stage for this album much of arular does sound like a brick to the face but don't let that distract from the fact that m.i.a stylistically here pulls off an amazing balancing act finding ways to tie together all these unlikely sounds masterfully and methodically to put it as simply as i can this record sounds like an explosive clash of glitchy electro pop populist dance hall booming miami bass uncompromising synth punk uk hip hop and a bit of brazilian favela funk too and of course all of this is attached to her unapologetically opinionated and also political lyricism which occasionally pushes these tracks into the realm of protest music i mean if pull up the people pull up the poor pull up the people pull up the poor is not a statement of protest i don't know it is so there are a lot of sounds and ideas flowing throughout this project some of which are helped along with the production of diplo cavemen or richard x but no matter who takes part in a given song it is painfully clear that it is mia's vision that is guiding all of it because this record is so amazingly consistent absolutely all of it is banging raw charming and intercontinental now back to pull up the people which the first few bars of this track i think sonically are a great mission statement for this lp because god i love how dry and naked every single sound every abrasive percussive hit every base gurgle is it really enhances the bold and in-your-face energy of this project on top of it there's absolutely nowhere for any blemishes on this record to hide but in the case of mia i think this is just a show of rugged strength as on the lyrical side of this track she compares herself to a soldier a fighter her beats are compared to bombs that's certainly the case also for bucky dun gun whose international electro grooves and hand drums sound like a sonic rush that really embodies some of the song's opening lyrics they're coming through the window they're coming through the door they're busting down the big wall and sounding the horn this track sounds like a violent dance dance revolution set in either 1980s miami or rio de janeiro things do tone down a little bit on the emotional side with sun showers but sonically i think this track is as bold as any other here the track is like a glitchy mutant piece of dancehall featuring this strangely chorused vocal on the hook that is essentially an interpolation of sun shower by dr buzzard's original savannah band kind of a deep pull on that one but it sounds so foreign and also so obscure as mia is is pulling it into her own song it sounds original and while the groove and vocals on this track may be easy going mia's lyrics actually dive into themes of violence and conflict whether that be personal systematic or even discriminatory mia also occasionally tossing in these catchy turns of phrase i bongo with my lingo and i beat it like a wing yo from congo to colombo can't stereotype my thing yo mia might not be the greatest rapper of this era from a technical or a wordplace standpoint but there are few out there of this decade in my opinion who used slang in syntax as creatively as she did which allowed her to do so much with so little following this we have the absolutely radical fire fire whose lyrics literally depict gorillas training for war firing at opposition from rooftops now according to interviews this track isn't trying to be overtly political it's more of a take on the music industry failing to cater to more alternative tastes which i would say was certainly the case in the 2000s and so if you don't give us what we want as an audience or as musicians we will make it we will take it we will create our own scene and if that's not a political statement i don't really know it is i mean this track may not be literally about war but the ethos mia is putting forward is certainly reflective of alternative cultures spread across the internet in a self-sustaining way by comparison the track amazon reads as a lot more literal given the strife mia's family has gone through one could most likely read this track as a meditation on getting lost in the haze of war or violence even human trafficking maybe meanwhile on the instrumental side we have this menagerie of sound effects that sound like they're straight out of the jungle backed up with these electro-acoustic bits of percussion it really transports me to the tense amazonian scene that is being set here there's also the deliciously glitchy bingo which is packed with all these revving squelching coarse synthesizers which pair pretty interestingly with quite a bit of steel drum i think it's also important to note this is one of many tracks on this project where mia sports this really effortless amateurish charm it's almost like a punk ethos type of thing while there's certainly a lot of intent behind what mia does and says on this project they're simultaneously an element of i'm gonna give the performance i'm gonna give i'm gonna let the chips fall where they may and overall i think it just gives arular this uh endearing messiness now ombre i think i could describe only as a psychedelic piece of reggaeton with some south asian influences worked in there very subtly the track is also packed with one sexually explicit lyric after another the track is fun eccentric absolutely scandalous and inadvertently it seems like mia created a d onwards sound for them on this song too they should maybe send her a thank you note now since this project is so solid from front to back in my view we do lead into a strong finish from here with the song 10 dollar rhythmically i think the miami bass vibes come back the drum machine rhythms are incredible it's an absolute firecracker of a beat then the following you are a cutie is a hilarious detour about a love triangle where mia is essentially battling it out with this other woman over a guy and dropping some hilarious bars in the process saying how her and the sky are tighter than j.lo and her jeans and uh tighter than r kelly in his teens also the beat on this track is insane it's uh wheezing and kind of hurting and jerking apparently it samples the sanford and sun theme which is a pretty unlikely source but still it does lead to this incredibly unique track then following this we have galang which is essentially the closer before the hidden song on the record yeah i mean back in the day cds we did a lot of hidden tracks at the end of the cd this track essentially was one of the original singles that kind of got mia off the ground so it only makes sense it would make it onto this record it's a little rougher in comparison with other tracks here but it does i think uh embody a lot of the basic sonic and lyrical elements that made mia's music around this time so special plus the lyrics are pretty interesting and focused as well essentially about staying safe in the midst of a lot of different contexts keeping your head down to duck either a shotgun shot or avoiding the feds trying to survive economically too which is sort of an interesting message to leave this record off with because not only does it touch down on a lot of the themes of violence and war and injustice that informed much of mia's work across her career but also uh while i'm sure she did need to keep her head down at multiple points to get to this place where she could release this record and move throughout the rest of her career musically and artistically she has spent quite a bit of time not keeping her head down at all uh really kind of being in people's faces and being bold and being unapologetic and being her marching to the beat of her own drum and sometimes absolutely getting in trouble for it hurting her commercial prospects just so that she could uh just do things on her own terms but ultimately i think uh m.i.a doing things her own way is part of what makes her interesting and special and significant as an artist and i hope that more people pay attention to her work or sort of realize the again the massive amount of influence that she's had over the years with records like this so yeah classic review those are my thoughts on this one uh tran position have you given this album a listen i would hope so it's a classic if you haven't take some time spend some time give it a hear and uh yeah you're the best anthony fantano mia arular classic review forever
