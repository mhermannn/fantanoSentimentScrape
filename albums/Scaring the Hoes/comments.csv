I love the approach, but with that it feels like every song is trying to send the same message as the title.<br><br>Its impressive but its a bit like the hiphop equivalent of getting an album full of TOOL&#39;s weirder cuts. Great listen, but I&#39;d be more impressed to hear some tracks that push the envelope and define a new sound for the genre AND being catchy with the longevity that brings, not a collection of short lived &quot;wow&quot; moments."

@baronvonbeandip,2023-12-11T21:50:58Z,2023-12-11T21:50:58Z,4,That they were doing this on a 404 is commendable. I fuckin hate that thing because my friends are Dilla worshippers with a background in &#39;lofi hip-hop beats to study to&#39; type shit.
@madeleinep.828,2023-12-06T23:33:21Z,2023-12-06T23:33:21Z,3,Never thought a song called Steppa Pig on an album called Scaring the Hoes would become one of my favorite songs of the year

@Maratje2,2023-11-18T23:27:31Z,2023-11-18T23:27:31Z,1,"MY SCORE: Strong 9 to 10.<br><br>Peggy and Danny are a match made in heaven, and Scaring The Hoes shows it. The title alone is already pretty iconic. Perfect for replaying, and has been playing in my car nonstop since it came out. Might’ve had some weird looks from other drivers but that makes me love it more.<br><br>Least favorite: Jack Harlow Combo Meal (Still a banger though)."
