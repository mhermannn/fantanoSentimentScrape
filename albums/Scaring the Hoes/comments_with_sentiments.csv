I love the approach, but with that it feels like every song is trying to send the same message as the title.<br><br>Its impressive but its a bit like the hiphop equivalent of getting an album full of TOOL&#39;s weirder cuts. Great listen, but I&#39;d be more impressed to hear some tracks that push the envelope and define a new sound for the genre AND being catchy with the longevity that brings, not a collection of short lived &quot;wow&quot; moments.",3

The title alone is already pretty iconic. Perfect for replaying, and has been playing in my car nonstop since it came out. Might’ve had some weird looks from other drivers but that makes me love it more.<br><br>Least favorite: Jack Harlow Combo Meal (Still a banger though).",4
