my hos r scared what do i do for everybody that been living it up what u do?
wet meaty hands
Better than charli xcx brat imo
looking back? AOTY
Peggy will be seen as one of the greatest rappers of all time in like 20 years I‚Äôm calling it
Usually I don‚Äôt agree with fantony antano but he‚Äôs 100% on this one
it kinda remidns me of jpegmafia
STH is TPAB for neurodivergent people
<b>omni man crashes through wall</b> where‚Äôs orange juice jones melon
Hearing Anthony say shut yo bitch ass up in the most monotone way possible is amazing
whos watching this in 2046?üò¢
Found this album hard to listen to at first but now I can‚Äôt get enough, such grimey production man, good shit right here!
Shut up did he make this using a 404, i just cant believe that
As soon as I heard red veil I thought it was Earl
Mr fantano ehat the actual fack did you rate this album
L
wtf
HE DOESNT MISS
The best
hot
scaring every pop listener
Am I stupid or did he change his least favorite track of the album from lean beef patty to run the jewels
Fit check is superior and most fanficully one of Ants m≈ì√ß hahhwwt
This album is a 2/10 at best
I love how casually he just drops the 9/10
Crazy production. Great listen. Garbage pale kids and orange juice jones my favs
10 months later and this is a classic
My favorite part of the name is that Danny Brown brought chose Scarin the Hoes after seeing a tik tok joking that their album should be called Scarin the Hoes
Now we know scared the hoes
I loved it at first but i think it&#39;s a high 7 for me in retrospect. I love the approach, but with that it feels like every song is trying to send the same message as the title.<br><br>Its impressive but its a bit like the hiphop equivalent of getting an album full of TOOL&#39;s weirder cuts. Great listen, but I&#39;d be more impressed to hear some tracks that push the envelope and define a new sound for the genre AND being catchy with the longevity that brings, not a collection of short lived &quot;wow&quot; moments.
after 30 years of loving this album I finally got bored of it
I cant be the only one that thinks these songs sound like constant noise and racket as opposed to actual catchy music
Sound like rthey definitely got style from everyone from Master&#39;s of the universe. Rad
God i hope they work together in the future again.
Played this at the pregame and there were only 7 guys there. Crazy how the album really did scare the hoes! 10/10
jpegmafia is a cool artist but horrible person
I‚Äôm tripping on 2cb rn and I swear ur hair follicles are bugging me the fuck out bro.
I just noticed csh in the background
Fantano pulled off that mask like velcro
The album XXX is actually a studio album and not a mixtape
They perfected the art of musical shitpost, Oliver Tree could never
When I try listening to this I really don&#39;t like it too much I&#39;ve only listened to some of it. Is there something. I&#39;m missing I want to know.
That clapping... those were not hands
Most overrated album ever <br><br>It‚Äôs just loud nonsense.
as probably the worlds newest canibus fan seeing the melon mention him was the most exciting moment of the day
So you gave peggy mafia light 9 just cause he&#39;s not fat other wise you would&#39;ve gave him fat 9 , now that&#39;s racist
Kingdom Hearts Key legit one of my all time favorite beats
2/10
best album of the year
That they were doing this on a 404 is commendable. I fuckin hate that thing because my friends are Dilla worshippers with a background in &#39;lofi hip-hop beats to study to&#39; type shit.
Never thought a song called Steppa Pig on an album called Scaring the Hoes would become one of my favorite songs of the year
shuolda been a 10
One of my favorite albums ever.
I saw this thumbnail and thought there was gonna be a Westside Gunn/Minions crossover. Guess dreams don&#39;t always come true
MY SCORE: Strong 9 to 10.<br><br>Peggy and Danny are a match made in heaven, and Scaring The Hoes shows it. The title alone is already pretty iconic. Perfect for replaying, and has been playing in my car nonstop since it came out. Might‚Äôve had some weird looks from other drivers but that makes me love it more.<br><br>Least favorite: Jack Harlow Combo Meal (Still a banger though).
AOTYüî•üî•üî•üî•
Genuinely wondering what made this album not a 10 for melon. The creativity and beats are just electrifying and near perfect imo
its like more progressive xiu xiu and less aggressive death grips. perfect way to describe it
this aulbm is over reted travis scott utopia so much better
This album seriously sounds like Brockhampton but it gives you headache when the track is over
the greatest produced album this decade so far. also its album of the year
Bro that‚Äôs a big W he gave them light 9 without hesitation. That means it could really lead to a strong 10 easily. ü§Ø
It&#39;s not &quot;Triple X&quot; it&#39;s &quot;30&quot;
This album scared me
Shut Yo B,tch Ass Up / Muddy Waters is my fav on this album right now
For me, this is the album of the year.
PARTY‚ÄôS OVER, GRANDPA
This is JPEGMAFIA‚Äôs Watch The Throne.
orange juice jones is fucking beautiful. danny owns that track and the sample chops are gorgeous
Garbage
Gotta come back for the extras! Hermanos and NO! Are bangers
dwadwadsafs YEAAHHHH GOOD A;NHGFNR
am i the only one who doesn&#39;t like this album? üíÄ
Top 1 this year for sure
how is orange juice jones not in fav tracks its so catchy
Uno de los mejores √°lbumes que eh escuhado en mi vida entera, gracias.
We need a young nudy gumbo review STAT
The fact that they made Nintendo Famicom and lamb dish commercials work with the flow of GARBAGE PALE KIDS is incredible to me

Take eelayt to 90 150 nrqwad. Ams move 40503 to marknet dot yo milfahlifaloaf bread squares
If this album was called scaring the fantanhoes it would&#39;ve been a 10/10
I like this album :)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bh3b0684RuU&amp;t=398">6:38</a> <br>weird ADR tbh
It is me, I am hoes. This album was not for me lol
It‚Äôs still album of the year
Album of the year so far IMO.
Ty for putting me onto this Fantano
to be honest a lil dissapointed that you rated &quot;Run the Jewels&quot; track so low - it&#39;s short of course, but production seems almost perfect for me
I loved this album when I first heard it and the more I listen to it the more I hate JPEG&#39;s production. Also, I&#39;m seeing them perform tonight.
I still dont believe he is sitting.
Download the DLC pls man I beg
LUMPY STINKY
Overrated
My kids still ask me to play this for em when we go on trips ‚ù§Ô∏è utter classic
cant believe bro called OJJ undercooked lmaooo
You should&#39;ve put that balaclava on when you reviewed DONDA B I&#39;m disappointed bruh!!!!
Okay at first I was like uh I don‚Äôt like this at all, then continued to listen to the whole album and eventually got the theme and the vibe of this album. Burfict might be one of the best songs this year and Scaring the hoes was great here too.
Really like the record but man the mix is dog shit. Can‚Äôt hear Danny at all on like half these tracks!!
If it was called To Scare a Butterhoe you would&#39;ve given it a 10
if this album was called ‚Äúpimping the butterflies‚Äù it would be a 10
I&#39;m a hoe and someone forced me to listen to this and I enjoyed it.<br>:(
If odd future had more experience on producing this would be the album . Reminded me of the goats
Got this on my pre-order list for vinyl, easily my favourite release so far this year
Muddy Waters was my favorite track on there and he didn‚Äôt even say nothin about it so like what now am I supposed to like it or not???
&quot;Burfict!&#39;s&quot; beat reminds me of OSRSBeatz&#39;s remix of &quot;Dark&quot; from the original Runescape soundtrack
albums so good i pause your review just to listen to it agin
this album is definitely worth recommendation
i last listened to LP by peg, and there was this, 2 of the best in the world of abstract hiphop, album of the year.
Please review Swans &quot;The Beggar&quot; next.
This album is the first that gets better with every listen
disable the normalize volume thing in spotify settings if you&#39;re listening there it&#39;s night &amp; day
I still can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre sitting down in your videos‚Ä¶
Anthony shiesty Fantano is my favorite üòÇ
This album is amazing ( i havent listened to it )
They really dont make albums like these after the  20th century anymore
Just saw Peggy live and he was nuts. If you can see him live you have to!
Everything about JPEGS, I like
STYLE
album truly scared me.
I showed a girl this album and she really gave me a look
Life is but a dream review !!
More like a rare 9
&quot;equally wretched and gorgeous&quot;. yes.
My buddy had me listen to this.... and the &quot;songs&quot; are barely songs. This album made me think I too could make an album with an 808 and a keyboard with the percussion effects on. Then just yell random things over it in a whiny voice
I bet lakeith stanfield cries listening to this record üò¢
ÂØí„ÅÑÂ§ú„ÇÇ„Äú
Pls Do an Onoe Caponoe review
They should join up for good.
This Album is fire üî• üî• period ...
Clapping comes from dirty beaches &quot;untitled&quot;
YEEEEESSSSIIIR
STH is my 10 of the year
This is LITERALLY just The Money Store but more fresh and new!
I love the album by Mr. JPEGMafia (jpeg as we know, is a popular format for images) and Sir Danny Brown. Tho I wish they changed the title from SCARING THE HOES to SCARING THE WOMEN‚Ä¶ I think calling women hoes is not nice especially to the female community‚Ä¶
One of the best work out albums of all time
I need you to do Prof‚Äôs ‚ÄúHorse‚Äù I think it‚Äôs a really fun well done album
Looking back after 5 years, Orange juice Jones was quite a masterpiece
All they needed was Viper on this and it would be a 20/10
Jpegmafia is great but danny brown is leagues ahead in terms of lyrics and flows
He loves these ear worm computer glitchy sounding albums. I knew he would like this when I heard it.
9 BABEEEE
What üòÇ
Light 9 is very fair. Anything below this would be criminal. <br><br>When I listened to it, hearing Danny&#39;s verses always seemed like an appetizer. Stretching your out your ears with his high mid delivery, and then transitioning to the more more chill, but still unhinged Jpegmafia. <br><br>I&#39;m convinced that &quot;woooaaaaaaooww&quot; sound on Steppa Pig is from Terraria<br>Favorites: LBP,  Garbage, Tester, KHK, GLY,  and Jack Harlow Combo Meal. He did justice especially to Garbage pale kids. That beat went hard.
Scaring the Hoes is (at least by me and my people) only used to make fun of each other not having rizz.<br>(We are all music nerds)
I gotta give it another listen.  I love experimental production.  atrocity exhibition like got me excited for music in a way I haven‚Äôt been in a long time.  But on this one?  Idk‚Ä¶ Light 9 is kinda high from my first listens, it was just too inaccessible.  And Jpeg can be a fkin salty sob, while Danny‚Äôs always like a little meth fueled ray of sunshine, I can listen to Danny read the Bible front to back as long as he laughs randomly in the right spots like when the dudes two daughters get him drunk and bang him.  And Danny sounds mad into this project which is great, he didn‚Äôt seem as hungry on Uknowhatimsayin? As he does here, But anywho, let‚Äôs see how I‚Äôm feelin it now that it‚Äôs been out a lil bit
The 404 has made a bit of a comeback lately w producers.   It‚Äôs mad fun to use cuz it‚Äôs a sampler that‚Äôs mad Easy to sequence and get super quick results compared to a computer dAw and you can do some badass fx and sorta play it live in real time or record some of the tweaks.   It‚Äôs an awesome tool, I like it better than an MPC for getting shit done quickly.   But it‚Äôs def limited compared to like Ableton Live or whatever.   Idk!  Try it if u make beats!  Not too much $$$
I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m high but I just listened to them because of your review. Never heard anything like that in my life. It&#39;s like theyre thrusting their dick through all the rules of music. I&#39;m the receiver of that dick.
I recently had my mind blew hearing Atrocity Exhibition for the 1st time and after the introduction giving context to the title of this record and the description of the 1st track I&#39;m sold, I&#39;m gonna listen to this right now lol
The sp404 is limited af i would have never guessed that was used to make this masterpiece but sometimes when your tools are limited it challenges your creativity thus resulting in some dope shit
damn i scared my ho with &quot;scaring the hoes&quot; and only understood the irony upon watching this video thanks needledrop üòÇüòÇ
It‚Äôs <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bh3b0684RuU&amp;t=441">7:21</a>
Should of called it Scary Hoes Scaring Hoes
loud wet meaty hands üíÄüíÄüíÄ
It was awesome that they got Donald Glover to step out of retirement to rap on this album.
Yellow flannel sheisty
All of his previous albums are way more cohesive and atmospheric, this project sadly is quite disappointing. I do like title track, Fentanyl Tester and God Loves You though
This is so hypocritical clearly no one actually gives a fuck about this loosest option anymore‚Ä¶. But he‚Äôs obviously making a living out of it
Definitely my favorite album this year. I know this album is going to age like fine wine
danny‚Äôs verse on God Loved You is the funniest verse on the album
trash overrated
flannel sheisty is crazy
Great album but damn i need a new vibe ive been a hardcore subscriber of fucked up alt rap vibe since i started binging danny and deathgrips in summer 2017<br>Its a sick album im just a bit worn on this kinda shid. 8 i give an 8
At a certain point I also would‚Äôve give it a 9. But hearing it a lot more on repeat changed it to a 10. I think you should do a redux for this one cause it deserves a mf 10 imo
This was my introduction to both of them, I was honestly skeptical about this album cause I‚Äôm mixed on hip hop as a genre but this was the best album I‚Äôve listened to all year, I‚Äôm so happy I got out of my comfort zone and gave it a listen. ^^
Putting this time stamp here for later
Ill download the album after a couple listen I usually head to melons review after
Anthony the song is called &quot;Garbage Pale Kids&quot; not &quot;Garbage Pail Kids&quot; like you put in the description. Please pay more attention next time.
Just noticed the damn mous pointer on the album cover lol
That‚Äôs no ordinary clap. That‚Äôs a very DISTINCT sound
This music feels like future music
I mean, its time we start throwing Peggy goat conversations now, yeah? He literally never misses, its kind of insane how consistently he drops masterful albums.
Kingdom Hearts Key...can&#39;t stop playing it
I knew his white ears was gonna love this album
fantano being forced to talk about redveil is funny to me
haha soyboy
god, this album brings me way back. So glad fantano was able to dig up this old gem! üôå
Got to see redveil open his tour. Kids got something. His feature was good on this album along with the whole thing. Definitely agree with melon on his upcoming
Fuckin album of the year man this shit is amazing
I listened to the album while unloading a truck at work and got so much work done
dude Peggy is literally insane, like his flows yeah, but holy shit the beat production is next level, its so satisfying to listen to ngl
I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs been 30 years, some of those beats have yet to be topped IMO
I love how Anthony made it seem like the closer wasn‚Äôt one of the better songs but he threw it on the fav tracks. Definitely scared me
As a hoe, can confirm - scared/10
Garbage Pale Kids is one of my favorite beats of 2023 so far, and this record was such a blast to listen to. Hadn‚Äôt gotten into JPEG before this but now I absolutely have to. Insanely dope record.
<b>THIS IS THE BEST ALBUM OF 2000&#39;S. IM NOT JOKING</b>
bro u takled abt ike 3 songs in this review and all descriptions were borderline negative or somewhat positive. 9 was a jump scare but i agree lol good album.
Danny talking about Peggy replacing him is so cute
I thought I heard the Peggy&#39;s best work on Hazard Duty Pay but this album blew everything out of the water for me.
this is so cool, I&#39;m a fan now
I had really high hopes for this album before i listened to it and it made me dissociate. so i had to listen again and it was a good reminder that im not a woman or a hoe, whatvea. I hate the name of it anyway, hoe scaring. I dont know, its fuunny because its true, but i still hate how limiting it is for lack of a better word. I mean i dissociated. So i cant be mad. This album is a 9; it&#39;s not perfect but its almost there, which is takes 2nd place of that we can get out of 10! I had Anyway im gona go to sleep.
Frankly, this entire album sounds like every single effect in the library was used and no one bothered to check the audio level. Fair play for making something different, but I&#39;ve never ended up with a headache from an album and its effects.
Typical women-hating Anthony... If this album was called &quot;pleasing the hoes&quot; it would&#39;ve gotten a 1/10 smh my head
Thanks Melon. Your 9/10 makes me feel great that I didn&#39;t like the album. I guess I&#39;m literally better than you.
it was a 10
What does Danny need to do to get a 10 from you Melon, this album is perfect
the best part is you&#39;re getting exactly what you expect with this album and the samples are otherworldly.
An album we don&#39;t deserve üî•üî•
You should check out Ren - Illest of our Time.
AOTY without a doubt
i didnt mind this album until peggy started casting a spell on me and spoke in ole goblin causing goblins to knock me out and take all my gold coins inside a giant sack. 1 point off deserved imo
Ahh yes another banger of a review from Anthony Fantano, love the fact that he actually separated each chapter according to the tracklisting;<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bh3b0684RuU">0:00</a> - Intro<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bh3b0684RuU&amp;t=25">0:25</a> - Background<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bh3b0684RuU&amp;t=82">1:22</a> - JPEGMAFIA<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bh3b0684RuU&amp;t=136">2:16</a> - Whose<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bh3b0684RuU&amp;t=171">2:51</a> - Step a Pig<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bh3b0684RuU&amp;t=323">5:23</a> - Burfict<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bh3b0684RuU&amp;t=428">7:08</a> - The Closer<br><br>EDIT: My opinion is God Loves You has to be my number 1 for the year and we&#39;re in fucking april my guy. Every other artist is going to have to work SO hard to beat the way Peggy &quot;re-contextualised&quot; that gospel sample with that bassline and beat switch up. Kingdom Hearts Key, Fentanyl and God Loves You were my top 3 for the album, but I&#39;ve quite literally had God Loves you on repeat for about a week at least
I&#39;m only 19 seconds in but I&#39;m sorry anthony, I&#39;m going to have to give this review a light 2. You start it off by screaming the hard r 4 times like my favorite tech tuber LinusTechTips and then get upset because you claim that Danny and Peggy &quot;scared your wife into leaving&quot;<br><br>Please get therapy I&#39;m begging you
garbage pale kids sampled a meat commercial from japan from like 1990 it‚Äôs so sick
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bh3b0684RuU&amp;t=320">5:20</a> Just to let melon and anyone else know, the aesthetic of Burfict! is very much &quot;NFL Football&quot;. Vontaze Burfict is a very controversial, but undoubtedly talented and rough af NFL linebacker. Those &quot;insane horn samples&quot; are very reminiscent of the NFL themes on ESPN and Fox Sports, but it especially sounds like NBC&#39;s theme for Sunday Night Football, music that any NFL fan will be very familiar with.
i hope there‚Äôs a volume 2
After scrolling through the comments, I guess I didn‚Äôt realize Peggy Lee was still making music! Definitely not the same as her older hits like ‚ÄúFever,‚Äù but solid bops nonetheless.
We&#39;ll remember Peggie&#39;s run as one of the best, man can&#39;t miss.
I love your honest reviews, it&#39;s put me onto a lot of songs and artists that I wouldn&#39;t have checked out on my own, and would love it if you could order your favourite songs to your least favourite on the albums your review, if not that&#39;s fine, I can&#39;t wait to see what you review next
Gotta say my favorite tracks are ‚ÄúSteppa Pig‚Äù &amp; ‚ÄúOrange Juice Jones‚Äù but the rest of the project is insane the  instrumentals are mind blowing, Danny delivers some insane verses I really enjoyed this project.<br><br>I wouldn‚Äôt mind hearing a Danny Brown album with strictly Jpeg production cause this thing is great.<br><br>Definitely feeling a solid 9.5/10 for this I really like this record.
i like it
whare did my hoes go
A flannel shiesty
I know what he means by Orange Juice Jones being undercooked, but Peggy‚Äôs verse on that one is so nasty üò©
Bro melon w the SCHIESTY????
fuck the hoes, that shit even got me scared. good job peggy, mission accomplished!
love me some sp404 beetsüíéüíú
the plaid baclava was the most effective use of a thumbnail i&#39;ve seen all year,, i was only intersted in his explanation for putting that on. IT NEEDS TO MAKE A COMEBACK.
Awesome review, Anthony. I am so glad you liked this album. You gave it the exact score that I did ü§Øü§Ø. The production is so good, and the rapping is so out of this world. I hope there&#39;s a scaring the hoes 2 üòÖ
I&#39;m a simple man...<br>I see the yellow flannel üíõ<br>I check out the album üíø
yw\es
gta music
I had this thing at like a 3/10 after the first listen, but now that melon has told me what to think, it‚Äôs one of my favorite albums of the year
album is not it and jpeg is my favorite rapper
Please review WILDSIDE by Zestos?
i love you !
Listening to this Album feels like watching a Tarantino movie AND I LOVE IT!!!
I like how the title of the album is Scaring the Hoes so Anthony decided to attract the hoes by covering his face in the thumbnail, good thinking melony
The mask fit anthony really well
Its crazy how fantano explained on point,every epithet nicely positioned for every song.nice one connoisseur
fun fact: The &quot;JPEGMAFIA&quot; are actually just one guy !! <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/ssIfY7OFG5OykQOpn4CQCw"></a>
This is my favorite album since the money store TBH
I‚Äôm from Baltimore and i remember booking Peggy as a headliner before he blew up. He really like that!
Oodles of Applause. Great Review. Great Music
aoty right here
put the shiesty back on
I feel like Danny isn&#39;t mixed properly in this album on a few tracks. Just sounds off in my headphones. Also, still don&#39;t love JPeg&#39;s voice.<br><br>The positives though. The production is so amazing. It sounds like a Friday night (after midnight) DJ set you&#39;d hear on the radio, except weirder and amazing. I half expected someone to come on talking about how he hopes everyone&#39;s having a nice night and gets home safe from the clubs.<br><br>Lean Beef Patty, SCARING THE HOES, Garbage Pale Kids, Burfict!, Shut Yo Bitch Ass Up/Muddy Waters, God Loves You, Jack Harlow Combo Meal, HOE (Heaven On Earth) are all soooo good. There&#39;s something in these songs that&#39;ll get you if you&#39;re into hiphop. First time I heard Burfict! I loved it instantly.
This was like the 100 gecs of rap
amazing album. these two arent rlly underground tho. like give them their roses these bishes famous af
The title track samples an old Dirty Beaches performance called &#39;Untitled&#39; if you&#39;re wondering.
Can&#39;t believe you&#39;ve been doing these reviews for over 50 years. Time flies man
Move your mouse off the album üò°
Steppa pig when the synths kick in I feel my soul leave my body
Amongthany Ustano?
wouldve been a ten if it was called To Scare a Hoe
This album sucked pure unadulterated ass imo
I must be a normie because although I like Danny Brown. This album was pretty bad overall.
the production on this is legendary already. might be the most creative, experimental and rough production I&#39;ve heard from peggy so far.
Whenever hoes are scared, I play them a little cal chuchesta
no thoughts on the mixing too?
jpeg is a tryhard he acts like he doesnt give a fuck only to rap about people talking about him and twitch streamers
uknowwhatiamsaying was better
THIS ALBUM  HELPED  ME KILL MY  PUPPY
peggy&#39;s vocals were too quiet on some songs but that&#39;s the only dislike i had
Still waiting on the Mavi review. You can save it for a classics review tho.
My two sons cannot appreciate it enough but back in the day when this album dropped it was FIRE
I&#39;d never listened to either of them before (though I knew about them) and played this on a whim. Idk if that was a good or bad idea, but it was chaotic, and this is one of the best albums I&#39;ve ever heard.
its a 10 dude. the album is so insane im so mad you didn&#39;t give it a 10. it&#39;s a record you&#39;ll just never hear again.
you are so damn mid
I‚Äôm not a big Danny Brown fan so I‚Äôm kinda mixed about this album. Peggy‚Äôs production and performance is fucking amazing tho. Might need to warm up to Danny a bit and listen again.
Peggy is a damn wizard with these samples. The title track really stood out to me, and I learned it&#39;s mostly sampled from Dirty Beaches &quot;Untitled&quot; Take Away Show. The clapping, the sax, &quot;WORK THAT SHIT,&quot; it was really fun to see
Am I crazy? I deleted this album  off my phone so fast after one listen
Oh damn bro. An album I actually liked BEFORE I saw melon give it a 9/10. Look at me, being an individual
Peggy is cool, but mostly not my taste. This, though. This might be my album of the year, fuck
This is the sickest albums in years. Most annoying producer and rapper mixed into one
You can hear the static when he rips the balaclava off his cranium
This dude is just trolling at this point.
IDK wasn&#39;t feeling this one nearly as much, put that yellow flannel away melon head this is a 7.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bh3b0684RuU&amp;t=3">0:03</a> that static sound ü§§
‚ÄúLOUD WET MEATY CLAWS‚Äù is all I can think now
the mix sounds off in headphones
No 10/10 redux review?
Thanks for reviewing this or I wouldn‚Äôt have heard of it. Never heard jpeg mafia before but I‚Äôm definitely giving his work some listens
I listened to this album with my girlfriend and since then she has left me. Thank you melon now I know my girlfriend was indeed a hoe.
album of the year!!
this collab gives me big Mike &amp; Rich collab
Summrs vocal inflections r on par with danny‚Äôs and sometimes peggy‚Äôs
Maybe I need to make another review.. its been a while
I feel lost when I listen to this album. I can&#39;t think of a time I would put it on. It&#39;s odd and mid.
Lots of Flume and Flyng Lotus references
So fire
the teens of denial vinyl in the background to fit the subject of scaring the hoes
This album is a strong 5. Scaring no one but a mixing engineer.
That switch on Kingdom Hearts Key is unbelievably sick. Easily one of the best albums of the year
This is what it sounds like when a creative writing teacher critiques music
this album has aged like fine wine
Love that he‚Äôs talking about scaring the hoes with car seat headrest sitting in the background
reddit
I get big Danny Brown and JPEGMAFIA vibes from this album.
rank all of his album and eps
Cringeny cringetano
you can&#39;t be broke, and over 30
This album is Fantano bait
Dont forget it‚Äôs only vol1
404 my ass !   sumbuddy dreeming and dreeming while they been done reeming
This is what Danny Brown sounds like to Jpeg Mafia fans
who <br>is<br>still <br>here<br>in <br>1991
I think the 404 thing is a joke, it sounds like it was made with a DAW
Perfect classic rock album, up there with Led Zeppelin if not surpassed
The title of the album is fitting. Ive scared so many hoes off playing Danny Brown and JPEG üòÇ
Saw this on twitter but you should‚Äôve been Hoethany Scaredtano on this occasion. Big miss ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
HE&#39;S WEARIN&#39; DA YELLAH FLANNEL
too pussy to give it a 10/10
JPEGMAFIA&#39;s production is so satisfyingly unhinged while Danny Brown shines because he can truly rap on anything and make it sound good. Legendary combo.
Have to respect that 60s In Like/Our Man Flint style artwork...
I give the album a decent 8. Love the album but I feel like it is slightly top loaded.
Eh all my heroes are cornballs is better but whatevs
Steppa Pig was my favorite by far
Wow, didn&#39;t think he&#39;d give it a high score like that but this is such a great duo and can&#39;t wait for more stuff from them
Is Orange Juice Jones related to Basketball Jones?
This is the first time Run The Jewels got a 9.
Aren&#39;t you scared melon
It‚Äôs interesting that Danny Brown sounded so weird to a lot of people because he sounds a lot like Spanish rappers
Damn two 9/10&#39;s this week
Good album but idk. ???? Could&#39;ve been better
lfg baby
Massive W. I think enough years have passed to call this a classic in the music world.
As someone familiar with the phrase ‚Äòscaring the hoes,‚Äô i found your definition imprecise. I think phrases like these benefit from exemplification, especially since a 35 year old man‚Äôs interpretation is ambiguous. You  reveal a lack of understanding in your attempt to explicate the implications of the term itself rather than appreciate it for its abstract character. This is why an example would benefit proper comprehension; for example, if one is at a party and, upon given access to musical exportation, and chooses to play an experimental hip-hop song of jpeg‚Äôs ilk, then the mood would be killed and the hoes would have been scared. Although you touch on this, you mock the idea subsequently, implying this phrase originates from a place of shallowness. However, I believe that the phrase comes from a place if sincerity; it could be considered rude to expose a group of strangers to a style of art you yourself admits is hard to digest against their will when they intended to enjoy familiar music. One cannot be blamed, then, for shouldering fault coming in the form of the ‚Äòhoe scarer‚Äô label. I find your brief analysis of the phrase, therefore, as ignorant. Regardless, I hope you find my assessment useful and choose to reconsider what I believe was a dismissal of a phrase significant in its specific use that can only be relayed through examples. From, an AP language/composition student.
Wow thanks for the spoilers
as a hoe, I can admit I was HORRIFIED listening to this album. <br>couldn&#39;t even listen to the whole thing üò≠
How do u not like Orange Juice Jones fucking nerd
Crazy it took him this many decades to FINALLY review this all time classic. Album of the year when it dropped for sure!
Scaretheny Hoestano
Fentanyl Tester goes hard ASF I will die on the hill that it‚Äôs the best banger here, and should be the most popular by far.
Now do navy blue‚Äôs new record please
Bro it thought he was gonna it a 10 come ooooonnnnn
omg i cant believe he gave it a 10
Dayumn a 9?!?
This guy should review himself for being lame as heck.
I&#39;ve been playing it 5 times a day since it came out. I literally wake up to Lean Beef Patty playing in my head and I regret nothing.
9/10 would buy new headphones for it again
10000 years ago i used to BOP to this one
ITS YEAT
I&#39;m in the minority but this is mid for me personally, can&#39;t wait for quaranta tho
Meaty hands üòÇ
Never would I ever have thought to see Anthony fantano in a shiesty
This thumbnail is cursed
I&#39;ve listened to Kingdom Hearts Key like 30 times...Idk why but that song is sooooo good
Culture is so stale that all these npcs are trolling their way into liking something. They have to create this false sense of being ‚Äúin on something‚Äù with the little running inside joke in the comments. Cringe society.
In my opinion peggy is one of the best producers out there rn, his beats are so unique, and his specific sample choices is so charming to see, he fucking sampled a random ass chinese commercialüòÇüòÇ
Is that the sunbather on the back?
I&#39;m surprised he never mentioned the random ass sample from BaybeWipe by Ski Mask in God Loves You. Did not see that coming
Masked uppp
Soy Reddit sellout
It sounds like shit on Apple Music
Ima listen to this just cuz I like Danny, but I really don‚Äôt like jpg. This gonna be torture ü•≤
I‚Äôm pretty sure Peggy sidechained the bass to the vocal so the vocals duck the fucking bass on one song.. which I mean.. who does that??
How you give it a 9 and didn‚Äôt mention the mixing 1 time you got paid off that‚Äôs crazy baldie
You need to stop saying Peggy
peggy‚Äôs devon hendryx mixtapes are some of the best mixtapes oat

A light 9 whoa‚Ä¶I need to check this right away
Really wish JPEG would stop making references to recent memes and events, because his lyrics age horribly within a year or so
this album is as good as GKMC
HOW DID JPEGMAFIA CLEAR ESCAFLOWNE SAMPLE?!?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bh3b0684RuU&amp;t=188">3:08</a>  papa peel
Scaring the hoes is Danny having girl fans tell him they can&#39;t go to his shows anymore
&quot;Who are you?@!&quot; This gotta be the best record of 2023
Scaring the hoes is Anthonys whole vibe.
JPEGMAFIA projects always grow on me in 2 or 3 listens. This was the case for all albums and even EPs. But when they hit, they hit. I can&#39;t stop listening to this album now.
Sitting in a restaurant for a work meeting and Peggy &amp; Danny burst in the door whopping people assess and demanding the women to dance and I&#39;m just supposed to sit here and act like an upstanding citizen. That&#39;s what this album felt like. I GODAMM love it. So happy.

if this album was called &quot;pleasing the bros&quot; you would&#39;ve made it your fav album of all time
a 9? FYE!!!!!!!!
It&#39;s not a joke, this Album is weaponized anti hoe repellent

I love peggy guys
He finally revealed his Da Vinci Code with the Dan Brown Mafia
Flannelthony Ninjatano satisfied me in ways I never thought. Scaring the Hoes too üî•.
I love the music. But I feel like the vocals were mixed too low. Maybe that‚Äôs a product of the SP-400.
Danny carried the whole album
damn they really scared them away
Just heard Danny&#39;s gone into rehab &lt;3 Wish him the best
Idk if my AirPods are just not meant for this album, but some of the mixing is too washed out
Cmon its not THAT good
i feel like melon got a matching mask for every flannel
Only real fans are still here in 2023
Respect for the redveil love
Damn
This album is exactly me. <br>I got to &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; in the tracklist, more than halfway through, and was like: &#39;damn, am I gonna bang with this whole album?&#39; And I did, hell yes, I did...well except for &#39;RTJ&#39; and &quot;Jack Harlow Combo Meal.&quot; Don&#39;t vibe that well. I think &#39;RTJ&#39; is too short, shame for a track with such an apt name. Everything else is in heavy rotation here. <br>No hate to Q-Tip but comparing this to the 2019 collab with Tip, I see the difference that having Danny in his production element brings to an album. Can&#39;t wait for Vol. 2. <br>So happy two of my favorite rappers out there now pulled this off. It seems inevitable in retrospect but I&#39;m glad there is no disappointment to be had. They threw down this collab with all the prescience and heft two such accomplished artists could muster.
2 9‚Äôs in 2 days. Are you ok?
I&#39;ve always wanted to get into jpeg. I heard a couple songs before but just never dug deep. I gotta see what this album talkin bout
Lumberjack shiesty
This is dope! Definitely gotta check it out. I been sleep on these guys üòÇ

I played it in front of the hoes. They got scared

i really thought he was just going to give it a 6 and complain about the mix for 20 minutes
Albums like this are the ones you need to listen to multiple times to fully appreciate it
Bruh am I tripping or he had a yellow flannel ski mask? He has to reserve that for an immediate classic review
Anthony Schiestano
Wooooooow. What a score‚Ä¶
Anthony you can‚Äôt just run around in a skeleton costume for 7 minutes and call it a review. Your scaring the hoes!
2 minutes into the video. He‚Äôs gonna give it a 7<br><br>Edit: Nevermind
review notorious dump legends vol 2 by mach hommy &amp; tha god fahim pls
Anthony, you can&#39;t take away 1 point from this album just because it failed to scare you hoe.
those vids of &quot;all fantano ratings on jpegmafia albums&quot; are gonna have to be taken down now lmao
Speaking about oddities, I&#39;m very curious on what your thoughts and opinions will be on Melanie Martinez&#39; new album coming out tomorrow..
Watched Peggy live last night and it was great despite Danny brown not being there. Love this album
I‚Äôm so glad Danny did this project
so how is the bed creaking noise on that drake song in clb corny but not the &quot;clapping&quot; on the self titled track
The first time I listened to this I was taken back by the chaotic nature and sound of this album but after going through a second listen I absolutely fell in love with  the production, themes and overall sound of this project. There was so much personality humor and creativity to ignore and I absolutely adore this album
Hey logic I&#39;m a big fan
hes trending again
Do a suicideboys review
I‚Äôm not scared

You need to do ICECOLDBISHOP
Was I the only one half-expecting a less positive review based on his video about mixing on the Fantano channel the other day?
Jpegmafia has more consistency than kendrick... based on scores
my jaw literally dropped when he gave it a 9 and he looked like he was like &quot;yeah...i did that&quot;
RUN THE JEWELS AS LEAST FAVORITE TRACK IS CRAZY
I listened to this whole album today and musically it&#39;s the wildest thing I&#39;ve ever heard.
AOTY
This is so good bro its easily a 9, cant wait to listen to it
‚ÄúCan‚Äôt fuck with y‚Äôall, y‚Äôall let Jack Harlow sell y‚Äôall chicken‚Äù is such a simple but very deep line
still ass tho lmaoLMAO
can you review Navy Blue‚Äôs new album it‚Äôs by far his best work
JPEGMafia is one of the worst rappers rn. Rambling nonsense doesnt make you artistic. His fandom is just a buch of pretentious losers.
AMAZING ALBUM ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Run the jewels is short but sweet danny goes crazy
You didn‚Äôt give it a 10 cause it scared your wife away
I wonder what Melon uses this mask for
<b>FOREVER</b> üññ
Fentanyl Tester is probably my favorite song on here, it feels like you&#39;re driving through an underground tunnel in mariokart
you look like among us
Personally, this album is Madvilliany level collaboration
This is the type of album Fantano is good at reviewing lol the only type of album
&quot;I&#39;m the black marjorie taylor greene&quot; lmfao
This having a higher rating than her loss and blackstar pretty much sums up this channel and fanbase
Not falling for the psyop that I&#39;m supposed to like jpeg but this album was better in the gym than in the car
It felt like if Death Grips produced Kids See Ghosts
I like the little cursor on the green-screened in album cover lol
Light nine is fair
I can see why people would like it but I don&#39;t.
I knew fantano would reference Danny&#39;s canibus lineüòÇ shit was funny af
Love the praise this project got. One of the most unique and diverse rap albums released in a while
A 9!! Idek who they are but def will listen
Great stuff, glad you enjoyed the album as well
I was waiting on this day.........I was waiting for this review.......this truly is the end of times boys get ready
seriously one of the best produced albums ive heard in a long time. Peggy took it to a new level and i think DB is the perfect rapper to rap over Peggy‚Äôs unique beats
I‚Äôm extremely shocked by his rate
I was so happy hearing you share some love for the SP404 ‚ù§
Why do I feel like scaring the hoes is gonna be a classic in ten years?
I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not the only one that remember the Cannabis bar.
Ok light 9 is crazy to me for this album. I love Peggy, he‚Äôs in my top 3 artists rn but I was not really feeling this album as much as say EP2! or LP. IMHO this album is a light 7 but I‚Äôm pretty confident that my opinion will change with time cause Peggy is ahead of the game and I‚Äôm constantly trying to keep up
Come on guys this review has more views than the album on YouTube, let‚Äôs change that!
Nice reddit bait jpeg
Game changer, the hoes are hiding in Siberia now
Why does the yellow flannel shiesty actually go kinda hard tho?
Always good content!
Melon got da yellow feisty
This album is a W but NO WAY u rate it higher than Metro Boomin album and J.I.D&#39;s The Forever Story or even Denzel Curry one
Melon on trending!
Ngl before I found out what the sample actually was I was REAL convinced those were not the clapping of hands smh.<br><br>Garbage Pale Kids has one of my favorite samples . The chant is from an 80s Japanese commercial advertising a meat product if i remember.
definitely aoty so far
Orange juice Jones is insanely underrated but other than that great review
muddy waters was my fav track fs, when danny comes in it gets so good
Kingdom hearts key is one of the most ethereal sounding songs i‚Äôve evr heard
Fave album of the year fuckin slaps so hard
i fucking love where ya get ya coke from idk why it‚Äôs not more popularüò≠
i love this album
Why has NO ONE talked about how he didn‚Äôt mention the bullshit and stupid ‚Äúmixing‚Äù issues people had with this?
Light 9 feels fair I‚Äôm so glad others are liking this project so much
Fantano thinks he‚Äôs yeat in the beginning
peggy has such an extremely precise talent for coming up with the best track names ever. please lmfao the first time i saw the words steppa pig and jack harlow combo meal strung together i let out an audible giggle
Hyped for the potential that we get Scaring the Hoes Vol 2.....
Great video but you should have kept the Yieshty on the whole time
You guys may crucify me, but genuinely I didn‚Äôt like this album and I find it a 2/10.. Only liked one song.
W
yeah but it&#39;s a 10 though
Every project I find unlistenable bro be like dis a 10 üòÇ but I see bro fighting for abstract art . Hindsight melon a hero
Orange Juice Jones is my favourite song on the album, overhated.
I remember when my husband and I first heard this on our honeymoon to Serbia. He looked me in the eyes, told me he loved me, and spit a great big green orb into my mouth. Which I of course swallowed. <br><br>20 years later and we&#39;re divorced. Great album.
Give them the 10 you monster !
Boofthony packtano
it does make sense that these sounds came out of a 404 but also what the fuck
Lemme buy that gorgeous face hat baldy hoe... jp so uncalled foe but please sire let me buy its for capitalizm
There is a clip on of Danny screaming and there&#39;s a clip of him aggressively clapping at the mic too.
I sadly couldn‚Äôt listen because I‚Äôm a hoe and it would scare me :(
I accidentally listened to this project 5 times in a row üòÖ
would have been a ten if he was called danny white and pngcorporation
Anthony I know it&#39;s just your opinion but you didn&#39;t have to give this album a 0 just because Redveil is on it
the production on this album is face melting magic
I love that Melon loves Peggy &amp; Danny as much as we do. Makes me smile
Orange Juice Jones is one of my favorite tracks here. This is the ballad the album needed. This is one of the best Danny moments. The MJ sample! The Lady Gaga vocal hit! come. The fuck. On.
Anthony with a sheisty look like Human shrek when he put on the knight armor üò≠üò≠üíÄ
Been waiting for this since 2016, back when Melon could give more than 10 minutes of commentary for a literal 9/10
Death Grips but good
will we be getting Pouya‚Äôs gator video
Is anyone else a little uncomfortable with Fantano&#39;s tangent about how bad he wants to lick leanbeefpatty&#39;s abs? Seemed a little off-topic even if the first track is named after her
You only didn‚Äôt give it a 10 because they scared you
Peggy and Danny are just XP farming at this point. Too many great records from both their discographies.
I think the simple production on Orange Juice Jones works really well tbh. Gives you a break from the chaos kinda.
9/10 perfect
tony shiesti
Great to see you wearing your own custom pussy riot mask in honor of Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, the member of the band that was put on the &quot;most wanted criminal&quot; list in Russia with no specific charges attatched to it. The album is great, no complains from my part. 10/10. Can&#39;t wait for the next one. For Vol. 2 you should try using it in the dark with neon lights reflecting the surface of the mask like one&#39;s the movie &quot;Spring Breakers&quot;.
Fantano in the Yellow Flannel Shiesty doe??
Day 1000 of waiting for review of Did you know that theres a tunnel under ocean blvd
Love Danny, and Peggy has been growing on me. But holy shit I can&#39;t quit listening to this one. Orange Juice Jones is my favorite track. Love the production throughout
I&#39;m not a Peggy fan but I gotta respect his consistency as an artist<br>every single beat he has ever made is absolute incoherent headache-inducing garbage üî•
Loud, wet, and meaty. Just the way I like it
Not sure when this album released but literally three days ago unprompted I was like ‚Äúhey what was that funny sounding rapper on that one Kendrick song‚Äù and then listened to Really Doe on repeat for like 2 hours cause it just sounds so goofy. But this album is actually good.
W LP
It‚Äòs a classic for me
This dude, lol. Set me up for a mental head punch. Strong six, low seven, is what I was expecting. Was thinking that Fantano was going to state that while he liked some songs on the project, the mixing overall left him sour. As I kept watching, I noticed that he didnt mentioned anything negative at the time. I kept waiting lol, around six minute mark of the video I was like ok we might have a winner here. Then when I heard that &quot;Feeling a light nine&quot;, I lost it (pause lmao). Was already my (early) album of the year. This has pretty muched introduced me into the world of Peggy (listened to his album, while getting ready for scaring the hoes, already am a fan of Danny), and I have to say, hes brought a freshness to hiphop/rap that my ears needed. From the creative production, to the humorous and witty lyricism, and the energy you hear from his vocals, hes quickly become one of the favorites (as both a producer and rapper).
semetery scares the hoes
Danny Brown has a very Skeletor &quot;Nyah!&quot; voice
Awesome video Anthony. Really hate what you had to say here.
I wish Danny&#39;s voice was louder
My friend Gary said you stole his shirt.
Man! I had mixed feelings about this album 1st time listening. Took me a few times but I love it.
4000 years later, this ancient music is still (as the people in the 2020s said) groovy
We need a Black Kray remix of Kingdom Hearts Key.
I would give it a decent 9
Orange Juice Jones is one of the best though
this is my 10 of the year so far. I love this album
Run the jewels was one of my favorite tracks but they were all my favorite tracks, 10/10
where is ur ocean blvd review...
The album is amazing. It took me a few listens to really get the vibe, admittedly, but it really hit home once I assimilated myself with it
The clapping noise on scaring the hoes is actually a sample &quot;Untitled&quot;-Dirty Beaches
This record is amazing!
But Lil Pump 2 got a 0!? Crazy work ..
Terrible album.  Just a clusterfuck of degenerate drug addicts &quot;trying&quot; to make music.
Somethings up with the mixing in this video üßêüßê
It&#39;s wild how well these two meshed together, now we wait for volume 2...
LET‚ÄôS GOOOOO
Was waiting for this reviewüòç
I want Peggy to drop am album but the samples are all from king gizzard tracks. I can&#39;t conceptualize what that would sound like but damn do I want it.
Can you please review the new Kikuo album „Åç„ÅÜ„Åä„Éü„ÇØÔºó
It‚Äôs not a 9 but I enjoy it
I wish I liked it more. Didn&#39;t grab me like I was expecting.
I love Danny with all my heart and am not as big a fan of Peggy but do like him quite a bit. I really want to love this and I just don‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt put my finger in why. I love the chaotic mess of it and a lot of the rapping and production there‚Äôs just something I‚Äôm not truly feeling about about this. It is a really fun record overall but I‚Äôve been listening to it over and over telling myself I should love it but I just don‚Äôt. Hope they make another one though. Maybe I‚Äôll love that one.
No Anthony, you don&#39;t look fat in that ski mask
Don¬¥t lie Melon, there are no hand claps, sound more like Ms. Sethii
U should check on the song they sampled om garbage pale kids, its hilarious
why why why why its 10 its 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 omg wht didi u expacted bro omg
I was honestly expecting a light 8 at most even though I think it&#39;s a 9 too. So happy for Peggy and Danny.
Melon, you can&#39;t give this album a 1 just because it scared you.
Anthony FatAnus
It&#39;s interesting and innovative but that alone don&#39;t make it good. Fatano bases his love on music on the &quot;edge&quot; factor rather than the actual quality of the music itself. This album is an interesting novelty in their careers but no one will give a shit about it in 10 years.
Those meaty hands were from an ol La Blogotheque Takeaway Show supposedly. lol
Love to see Melon talking good about Redveil even after what happened
Logic punching the air with that rating rn
God loves you smack so hard - especially at the end of the song... please make a sequel (Scaring the melons 2)
In retrospect, this album still sounds like it could be released today and nobody would tell the difference
Loved this new mc ride and Danny brown collab!
ugh fabulous luv this record sm
how is that not a 10
Instant classic.
God damn I didn&#39;t know that it was made all on the SP404. Makes the album even more impressive.
Loud wet meaty hands.

PEGGY JUST DOESNT MISS!!
Check out my new single Make The Call it‚Äôs got the production you craveüòÇ
Peggy‚Äôs sampling on this album is just brilliant honestly, especially on Garbage Pale Kids
This album is the musical equivalent of wanting to blow up corporations and shoot right-wingers in the face relentlessly and, due to the turbulent political and social turmoil in my country (France), it couldn&#39;t have released at a better time than now.<br><br>Also, those beats are among the best beats Peggy ever did and I even got to discover &quot;Gone&quot;, by NSYNC (the song which vocals are sampled in &quot;Steppa Pig&quot;), which is a pretty great song. JPEG &amp; Danny never miss, this was fucking killer.
gyat damn the 9 from left field
BUt tHe MIx!!!! The mix is fine, glad to see this get a 9, much deserved
Peggy proved his producing ability on this record definitely gonna be a highlight of this year
I called a 9 on dis one
This shit was made for melon i feel like
It‚Äôs like they already wrote the soundtrack to the newest Tony Hawk Pro Skater game. Fire.
Great review ! love the insites on the tracks from jpeg &amp; danny and guests.
This album rules, on first listen it&#39;s a lot like a Gorillaz album to me in so far as I wasn&#39;t immediately gripped by every individual track, however the more I get to listen to each of them the farther in love I fall with them as unique pieces.
confirmed, this album scared me
Fantano giving redveil praise????
I love how he didn‚Äôt even mention the mixing, must not have been that big a deal
This album is just incredible
How did I not know redveil had a spot on this hell yeah üí™
the album was immaculate they both my heroes i hope to work w them. n when tf did everyone become an engineer talking ab the mix so deep lmao
Best Peggy album thus far he really does not miss
Anthony you can&#39;t give it a 9 since Danny Brown&#39;s voice it&#39;s annoying
whats your beef with RTJ
I knew it
&quot;SOME OF THE WILDEST HIP HOP YOU&#39;LL EVER HEAR&quot; is the best way to describe this album lmao
one of the most original hip hop records ever!
Contrarily to what the title of this record suggests, my girl has been trying to put me on to Peggy for a while now. She&#39;s always saying things like &quot;Please let me peg you&quot; and &quot;One of these nights I&#39;m going to be pegging you, you know&quot;. This review finally convinced me to let her do it tonight. Thanks Antonio!
Anyone else listening in 1999? This was real music I was born on the wrong generation
yeah, it rules.
I doubt Peggy used an older SP404 to produce this album . I bet he picked up the MK2 which is a surprisingly capable machine, especially with the recent firmware updates. It‚Äôs a dope piece of gear and a lot of fun to produce with , it certainly compliments his style especially on this album üî•
Bro turned into yeat
Damn, I did not expect him to like it this much.
Anyone else thought Danny&#39;s vocals were drowned out a lot and were hard to hear?
Too dark and raunchy the chicken is too wet
I&#39;m apparently a hoe because I thought the album was utter trash
I really thought this was gon be a 10. Tbh it&#39;s way better than kids see ghosts
aoty so far for me, havent felt this bewildered by an album in a while
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt rap circles around them I do figure 8‚Äôs‚Äù is such a simple yet hard bar
Not me watching Melon pull a balaclava off his head thinking &quot;you&#39;re going to mess up your hair doing that&quot; and then remembering &quot;oh yeah never mind&quot;
Woohoo I‚Äôm so glad this is your album of the year üéâ Shoutout to Danny and Peggy
The beats are perfect for Danny. They really compliment his style
EYO he finally complimented redveil
this album is good but its a bit too ear rapey for my taste. anyone on a similar wave?
Anthony fantano can you rate tinder girls favorite songs
REDVEIL GETS HIS FLOWERS ITS VEIL SZN BABY !!
Run the Jules is fun fantano why not give it a 10!!!!!!!!!! So great! Love the review
And Fuck 100gecs too
Felt like the audio on the voices were low and the instrumentals were too overpowering, other than that it‚Äôs a great project.
fantano! i think you should get this album cover tatted on your neck
Had to calculate when he said 2018 was 5 years ago
Coulda said Scarethony Hoetano
DanPEG
#15 on trending
Suddenly Anthony looks like Yeat
Just to clear something up, Peggy has said he used the Sp 404 Mk2 on this album, which is significantly more modern
I&#39;m just now realizing that JPEGMAFIA leaves the cursor in his album covers.
I love you, what an intro lol
day 3 of asking fantano to check kill ebola<br>he is my all time favourite artist, producent and rapper and im really sad that he is unknown, underground and uNdErRAteD because he&#39;s so fucking talented.<br>he makes pretty experimental, kinda industrial, heavy and very dark music and i think fatano and his fans would appreciate his music.<br>i recommend albums Muck, 49 days and Angry AI but all of his stuff is really good.
This replaced &quot;Cheat Codes&quot; as my favorite album to come out this year.
danny brown ruined this album tho. Can barely understand what hes saying
AOTY
Had to turn this album off after a couple minutes, got too scared
I mean yeah, the music is sick, but the album art is sicker
Yeet-thony Fantano!
Anthony would have given this a 10 if it was made by PNGMAFIA and Danny White
LIGHT 9?! LIGHT 9?! Tell me one bad thing u said about it
Maybe we wouldn‚Äôt scare the hoes if SOME OF US didn‚Äôt clap with BIG, WET, MEATY HANDS
its not children singing ,its asian people eating noodles
Cover is Godly.
Amazing album
We get the FLANNEL AND SKI MASK?!?!?!?!?
I can‚Äôt wait for volume 2 next year: Frightening the Wenches
Melon, u should of had the bali on the whole timeü§£
Fantano explaining what scaring the hoes has me sent
At first I assumed that track 4 was simply a reference to the 80‚Äôs trading cards, but the spelling makes it so much funnier. ‚ÄúGarbage Pale Kids.‚Äù Genius.
this is the greatest album ever create
The part when kanye came on.. best album ever
This and the new gecs album makes this easily the biggest year for weirdo music and I‚Äôm here for it
As a hoe, I am very scared
Currents is a 10
Never thought I&#39;d live in a world where an album called Scaring the Hoes would get a 9/10
You could&#39;ve just given this a ten. Come on now Anthony.
It‚Äôs 2023 and we‚Äôre still coming back to this review
A 9? Nice. I agree.
anywhere between 8-10/10 is fair for this one. I love it. Garbage Pale highlight for me. Can&#39;t identify the guitar samples, but I swear I&#39;ve heard it before...
i knew fantano and redveil had beef but that racial slur was simply uncalled for
bro think he yeat
9 let‚Äôs not over do it I like Danny but it‚Äôs a honestly 6 or possibly 7
Holy Toledo great score
I stan the static sound that occurred when Boothony took off his bally
nah that shiesty goes crazy lmao
I am in LOVE with this record. Easily one of their best! I‚Äôve listened to it front to back like 20 times now
First W fantano rating?
It‚Äôs a 10 shut the fuck up you dumb melon.
Hell ya melon
I would have gone to your house and do unspeakable things to you if you gave it less than a 9, good for you fantano maybe next time
Are JPEG&#39;s album covers actually JPEGs? If not he gets a zero on default
Not the yellow flannel shiestyüò≠üò≠
YIN by Lil Darkie is good, you should give it a listen and maybe make a review (THIS DOES NOT EXIST and SWAMP are also good but YIN is my personal favorite)
Glad Anthony spoke about redveil ! Knowing their past it‚Äôs refreshing to hear some good words
Most original production  in a minute
When 10 Redux review Melon
Thank god it&#39;s a 9.
is calling albums older than they are the new fantano comment meta
2 deathmetal recommendations: Angerot - The Profound Recreant, Wretched Fate - Carnal Heresy. Both wear their influences on their sleeves (one Morbid Angel the other Bloodbath) but do them justice.
&lt;3
When is this man gonna give any album a 10 this year
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bh3b0684RuU&amp;t=363">6:03</a> um actually
light 9
ITS NOT A 9
Giving it a 9 because it scared you isn‚Äôt a good flex though
aoty
You can‚Äôt just give it a 0 because it ‚Äúscared no hoes‚Äù melon
Yes. This is the correct rating.
6 at most
Great review Yeat
I... Don&#39;t know how this got the same score as Atrocity Exhibition.
I love Orange Juice Jones :(
I can&#39;t believe he didn&#39;t mention the iphone notification jumpscare
Hold up! Peggy produced this thing on an SP404? That&#39;s fucking outrageous lol
DAYUMN!
Just because you didn&#39;t scared anyone doesn&#39;t mean the album is NOT GOOD, Anthony :/
Light 9 thats better than i thought. Guess the saying ¬´good music scares the hoes¬ª is true. Nice!
Probably the worst ski mask I‚Äôve ever  <br>üëÅÔ∏è üëÑ üëÅÔ∏è in my life.
I&#39;ve never agreed with Melon more. This is an excellent record worthy of a light 9
the best first listen i‚Äôve had in a long time and the most hoeless i‚Äôve ever been, love this album
Patiently waiting for the Lana review
Damn didn&#39;t say anything about the mixing!!! üò¢
Did we really think he wouldn‚Äôt score this less than 11/10?
Man I think I just realized something, this guy is a nerd
you didn‚Äôt use the Bandcamp album cover    0/10 vid
the only album that will beat this album is his next album
Only assholes like this music.  Congrats.
I am a fan of JPEG and Danny Brown. But I did not enjoy anything I heard from this project. But understanding your taste in music I guess I can&#39;t be surprised that you&#39;re hyping this album and that you&#39;re into it.
Damn I even hate you when we have the same opinions. Crazy.
Kinda dissapointed in this review. He didn‚Äôt really go to in depth on anything
Album absolutely slaps. I&#39;ve had the beats from multiple of the songs stuck in my head since listening. It&#39;s frantic, energetic, and incredible.
Hate the name PEGGY.
I remember when my father showed me this Record. It changed my life.
Melon you scared the hoes by overexplaining vernacular
This album is so crazy I love it
I&#39;m surprised I didn&#39;t like this one a lot.<br><br>I couldn&#39;t hear them most of the time, but I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s because of the mixing or my car speakers. I feel like I missed a lotta good raps. <br><br>While I like albums that are sonically adventurous and light on hooks (Earl&#39;s &quot;Some Rap Songs&quot;), I think the non-linearity of the songs here makes it hard for me to remember them as well as something like &quot;Atrocity Exhibition.&quot; <br><br>I do agree that instrumentally, this album is on a high level. I&#39;d earnestly listen to an instrumental version if available. <br><br>(I haven&#39;t tried a solo JPEG Mafia album yet, but I&#39;m very interested after hearing this! Where&#39;s a good place to start?)<br><br>I liked the middle 5 or 6 songs a lot, but I wished I liked the whole thing. <br><br>I&#39;d give it a strong 6. I&#39;m still glad I tried it. I&#39;ll take the songs I like and return to it someday.<br><br>Also Danny Brown could rap over a baby spitting up and sound on-rhythm. That skill is always impressive.
Boo üëª
Am I the only one who hated most of the songs?
I appreciate the Redveil praise. Most wholesome ending
i&#39;ve replayed this album so many times with the constant fear that i&#39;d get sick of it eventually, but like most projects from these two that never happens. album of the year so far
This album was so good Melon had to break out the yellow flannel baclava. Lol
Heaven On Earth is a top 10 for me this year, probably my fav beat on the album. I&#39;m a huge sucker for vocal harmonies, peggy&#39;s got immaculate taste
<b>yall let Jack Harlow review your album</b>
Someone said Burfict is the Family ties for people who don‚Äôt shower
This is definitely and undoubtedly one of the albums of all time
Garbage Pale Kids &amp; Steppa Pig has some of the craziest beats I‚Äôve heard in a long time
ITS NOT A MIX THING!<br><br>The vocal recordings were TRASH especially for DB )‚Äô:<br><br>If they just recorded this properly it would be a forever classic.<br><br>Its not an artistic choice - just shitty recording ü§¨
‚ÄúWhere ya get ya coke from?‚Äù Is like a rake to my brain and I love it
That fit in the beginning be scarin all of the hoes ü•∂ü•∂ü•∂
he really bought this mask for only 5 secondsüò≠
This album has aged so well üíØ
orange juice jones sucks the record is good otherwise
finally now people can like this album
I just noticed that Danny is holding a double barrel, or DB also standing for Danny Brown?
Can‚Äôt really hear their verses tho<br>It‚Äôs buried in the mix
Orange Juice Jones is actually one of my favorites üò©üòÆ‚Äçüí®
it is in fact just clapping I was pissed at first
wrong lyrics os?
jpegmafia is the best music artist of all time undoubtedly
I cannot wait to watch my favourite music critic review this new collaborative album by jpegmafia and danny brown!
<b>sup, future kelan</b> üòé
I was just listening to this yesterday in my car and was wondering what you&#39;d think of it.  Thanks for the review!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bh3b0684RuU&amp;t=168">2:48</a> It&#39;s an actual saxophone. The sample comes from Dirty Beaches - Untitled... as well as the claps and the background vocals.
still can&#39;t believe they sampled the Escaflowne OP on Kingdom Hearts Key
I can‚Äôt get into Danny brown, I don‚Äôt see what everyone else sees. Peggy dope tho
Run the Jewels was finally part of a 9/10
I‚Äôm sure you dress like that and talk extra gangsta!!! in the house when the cameras are off üòÇ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bh3b0684RuU&amp;t=2">0:02</a>
I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised that you like kingdom hearts key. That was my favorite
crazy how i can predict fantano scores, im inside his mind. i always enjoy his reviews tho good work fantano
How dare you talk about OJ Jones like that...
I knew he‚Äôd love this one üòÇ
I‚Äôm glad that fantano mentioned Redveil because I thought he wouldn‚Äôt considering the situation that happened a couple years ago
i&quot;m a hoe, and I&#39;m pretty scared
Common fantano W
Melon ffs stop scaring the hoes. Your balaclava is very scary ü•∫
stop anothy
Melon really became mach hommy for a minute
‚ÄúJack Harlow combo meal has some of the nuttiest jazz rap you will hear on planet earth‚Äù<br>I cannot take it seriously with that song title üíÄ
Anthony with his mask really scared me with that mask of his, I guess that makes me a hoe that‚Äôs been scared. üò≥ üò± üò≥
LETS GO 9!!!!
Yeathony Yeatano jumpscare
W
anthony pulling the balaclava sounded like an unstrapping velcro
This album is a 10/10 if only for the way Danny raps &quot;Netflix and chill on a jailbroken Roku&quot; on Burfict - something about the way he says it is too good.
Loud, wet, meaty hands
YESSSSSSSSSS
I‚Äôve listened to this album 99,999 times since the album dropped 50 years ago, great review!
Yes the album was amazing to listen through a couple times. No I will not be returning.<br><br>It&#39;s well produced and the rapping is excellent, but there&#39;s too much going on for me to want to listen to this on a regular basis. Solid 9/10 though
I could not hear a single word anyone said.
Mr mantano it was actually an sp404 mk2 which is a very diffrent machine from the sp404 and the sp404sx that you actually showed on screen
Really disappointed you didn‚Äôt say scaring the hoes forever
Surprised you didn&#39;t talk more about the mix
Sorry you hated this album Ant Knee... maybe Vol 2 will be a 10
You didn‚Äôt have to spend the whole review holding a sign for gender equality and telling everyone to ‚Äúscare the bros too‚Äù
anthony the hell is that intro bro
I don&#39;t know why, but this album seems like if me and the homies went into the studio and tried out damndest to make a classic

Guys he didn‚Äôt give it a 6 this is monumental
nice yeat cosplay in the intro btw
Fantano and redveil interview please
Danny DEFINITELY came up with the name! If he DIDN&#39;T I&#39;ll commit myself in a mental institute.
Ahhh! You scared me!
ghosts really scared the kids though
THIS IS PEGGY LETS GOOOOO
he wanted a boosie fade and got a flannel ski
Wow Tony&#39;s first 11!
Oh man...<br>Oh man!!!!<br>He&#39;s wearing the shirt!!!
BEST ALBUM IVE HEARD SINCE MR MORALE! üî•üî•üî•üî•üî• SHOUT OUT PEGGY, SHOUT OUT DANNY BROWN, MANE üò§üî•üî•üî•
They should‚Äôve got bladee on this album‚ù§
&quot;We don&#39;t wanna hear that weird shit no more, what the fuck is that? Gimme the aux cord.&quot;<br><br>-My wife to me playing this album
üëé
This album is so good. Redveil did great as well
He really decided to be the one guy that doesn&#39;t complain about the mix at all. I respect it
You talk like it&#39;s a 5 and then light 9? Strange. I think you just like weird music.üòä
Loud, wet, meaty hands.<br><br>Melon has such command of the Kings English.
Can‚Äôt wait till you hear navy blue new project!! You did song of sage post panic so you gotta do ways of knowing. Once again Amazing project sage doesn‚Äôt miss.
A flannel turban is the most fantano thing ever. We need more of it
My ninja, Anthony Fantano
I just saw peggy live last night, this album went crazy. Damn fine work.
Announcing your marriage with Peggy is the only reason you gave this album a 12/10.
Use the Bandcamp album cover you coward!!!
By FAR AOTY....WE NEED A PART 2.....
Does Fantano forget he started redveils career by shitting on him? Feel like he glossed over that like it never happened.
I&#39;m one of the hoes this project scared üò¢ I recognize the talent but it&#39;s just too different for me to get into. Gonna keep coming back to it occasionally though to give it another chance
üòÇüòÇüòÇ scaring the hoes
It&#39;s scary how JPEGMAFIA and Danny Brown have been unstoppable<br>(and if I&#39;m scared I&#39;m a hoe)
Both artists have now gotten their second 9 from schmanthony that‚Äôs crazyyy
heavy 9 / light 10 for me melon
Loud wet meaty hands üò≠üò≠
Record so good it turned fantano into yeat
Why do you hate Killer Mike and El-P?
deserved
AOTY
Very glad they called it Scaring the Hoes Vol 1 because I‚Äôm begging for a Vol 2
&quot;i wasn&#39;t scared&quot; good for you, Anthony
Right on point with this one! I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs been a collab with this type before where the result totally matches/surpasses expectations
this album scares me.
Some of the lyrics were so corny and dated. But white guys like Fantano eat it up..
I absolutely love the cover art for this project. Feels like some 80‚Äôs action movie
Was kinda hoping he was gonna do the whole review in that flannel ski mask
OMG 9/10
Cyraxx diss track by Danny Brown wheeeeeen
Fantano showing us his BDSM mask in the intro smh. In all seriousness, this project is fire
LFG Redveil recognition
Theyre both masters. Havent been as excited for an album in a long time
I love you Antony
Danny Browns vocals are so bad on this album it feels like a joke, what the actual hell was Jpegmafia doing
Holy sheeeeeet light 9 huh...they made Mellon wet wet with this one lol, he&#39;s one how they deffo not scaring lol
They really did scare the hoes.... and meüò∂<br><br>Also redveil really is next up, learn 2 swim was an amazing album
Wait, he made it on an old SP-404 or the MKII?
Peggy making all other producers scared with this one, absolute fire front to back
Well deserved 9. Glad you think Danny got a lot to do on this one, seen a lot of people say it&#39;s a mostly Peggy project.
This and the yves tumor joint are def my favorites this year, 10,000 gecs is up there too. This year really has spawned some great music.
why do you rate everything high what sounds like death grips
That‚Äôs a cute outfit.<br>Did your husband give it to you?
Didn&#39;t watch this cause I wanted to see him in the yellow flannel sheistey speaking. Disappointed fantano
I must be hoes coz this album didnt do it for me
Shoud have been a 10.
Can we talk about the fact that this album actually has a good cover? What is with all the crappy covers in the latest releases of Hip hop?
I actually got punched in the face yesterday in the car for playing this album, some people really don‚Äôt think experimenting with sound counts as music which is dumb as fuck
This might be the only time I think a 9/10 is too low of a score, this the easiest 10 ever
10 Years from now when this album comes out, I&#39;m gonna make a MV of God Loves You
this project was awful
shiesty melon
Skithony Masktano
First Time I&#39;ve ever 100% agreed with a review! Even down to the least favorite track! 0/10, Unsubscribed
Can you please recenze new album bu Jimin &quot;FACE&quot;
Quite harsh to say your least favourite track was by Run the Jewels, has to be racially motivated
Anthony, you can&#39;t give the album a one out of ten just because you didn&#39;t get invited to the booth to scare the hoes!<br>Just because you were one of those doesn&#39;t give you an excuse to behave in this fashion!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bh3b0684RuU&amp;t=370">6:10</a> MELON REDEMPTION
The garbage pale kids sample is actually an old i believe japanese ad from the 80s, not kids chanting but adults chanting
Garbage Pail Kids has one of the nastiest, hardest beats I‚Äôve ever heard in my life.
Bro just give it a ten
9/10 Wow
Finally after one week of so many listens I can finally form my opinion
This hoe was def scared
Never wear that mask againüî•üî•üî•üî•
The quickest 10 i&#39;ve ever seen
What a great album, no fat on it at all. Really not even the biggest fan of Peggy‚Äôs stuff on his own but this is one of the most fun and interesting rap albums I‚Äôve heard in awhiiile. Was disrespected when p4k gave it a 7
Light 9ü§Ø
I really actually liked Run the Jewels actually, but I think a 9 is really fitting. Been listening to this nonstop every morning on my drives to school lately
Blud really explained what scaring the hoes mean üò≠
This will go down as one of the best produced albums of all time
I think the Scaring the Hoes claps might be more adult (like the Venetian Snares Nymphomatriarch claps), in the style of Clapping Music (John Cage). Experimental music references‚Ä¶
Hoes status : üò±
Genuinely dont understand the Orange Juice Jones slander. One of my favorite tracks smh
Arguably the best produced album I will ever hear, and the fact it was all done on a 404 and is still about 10x better than anything any other full time producer has been able to do this year ( besides the alchemist I suppose) is just incredible. I can&#39;t praise Peggy and Danny enough for their incredibly bold genre-defying album which really sets the tone for the albums to come. I love how they embrace their supposed &quot;weirdness&quot; with this concept. Excellent, excellent album. Easily a 9/10
Agree with almost all you said but in no world is Heaven On Earth better than God Loves You.
As soon as I saw this dropped, I knew it was gonna be at least an 8/10 from Fantano without even listening to a track
Orange juice jones my personal fav
I feel like I consistently like the songs on records that get skipped by most people. Orange Juice Jones has been on repeat for me. Same with Should I B on the Yachty album
I knew it was a 9
100 years have passed now and I still haven&#39;t been able to score hoes thru this album!
I clapped in real life when he said it got a 9
It was okay. It didn‚Äôt do a lot for me tbh. Was my least favorite from either of them unfortunately. It didn‚Äôt rlly move me in any way. Was cool. But I had little emotional reaction to it. Especially knowing Danny‚Äôs in rehab and not a good place makes it hard to listen to
Honestly I cannot believe that you wouldn‚Äôt discuss the mixing AT ALL. You talk about it almost every album, but don‚Äôt hear. And the album begs to have the mixing discussed.
Man the beginning was really culturally appropriation tano here
F*ck everyone who was legitimately saying this album was anything less than a 9. I don&#39;t see any other hiphop album surpassing this one for a while. And there&#39;s the first 9 of the year.
Garbage Pale Kid fa lifeeeee‚Ä¶this album is hot fire‚Ä¶every track is killer Burfict‚Ä¶GPK‚Ä¶God loves you ‚Ä¶kingdom‚Ä¶Steppa‚Ä¶title track ri god damn diculous how sick this album is, now work that shit
I will never forgive cannabis for that line. ‚Äú Yeah, you might get a little cash like me. But you ain‚Äôt never ain‚Äôt another n*<b>*</b> ass like me!‚Äù I bet LL Cool J was scared and so were the hoes üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Fun Fact: When Fantano pulls off a flannel shiesty over his bald mellon, enough electricity is created to power a small city for 6 months. Electrical engineers are still trying to figure out how to harness this new found source of power.
&quot;WTF is this&quot; - my wife.<br>&quot;Exactly...&quot; - me
Would‚Äôve given it a 10 is you went scared
Definitely one of the staple releases from the 90s
Poohthony Shiestano
Veteran was ASSS (bait)
404II*
Anthony proving once again that the best way to get a high score is to drop the most mid pretentious room temperature album
Couldn&#39;t believe my ears when I heard part of the Escaflowne opening theme used as the melody on Kingdom Hearts Key. What a time to be alive.
Glad you got one right!
easily Album of the year
I said 9 and we got a 9. Such a brilliant project with amazing Peggy beats. Only bad thing I can say is Danny doesn&#39;t come through as clear and the mixing isnt quite right. Seems more of a Peggy album featuring Danny instead of a collab. Anyways its still fantastic I&#39;ve listened to this none stop since release.
nah that number is way too high
I&#39;m liking the album more after every listen, but my only issue is that they needed to make the vocals a tinge higher cause it&#39;s legitimately hard to hear what they&#39;re saying at points
Bro think he yeat
cmon he must&#39;ve used the sp404mkii there&#39;s no way he used the 404 og
First off: This album is so fucking üî•. It&#39;s a perfect synthesis of both of the guys&#39; talents, so weird, but so full of amazing bangers. I was never THAT big a JPEG fan, but this album may have converted me.<br><br>Also, on the point about the &quot;underground and the mainstream collapsing on top of each other&quot;, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s to the extent where underground artists are as big as mainstream ones, but underground artists, trends, and styles EVENTUALLY bleed into the mainstream, but only aspects of them are actually accepted.<br><br>Als
Light 9, what the hell?
Bro put in a fkn flannel balaclva and didn&#39;t give the album a 10.
If this was called Kids See Hoes you would&#39;ve given it a 10
Orange juice jones really stuck with me after a few listens. kinda reminded me of fancy clown from the madvillainy album if it was part of an early 36 mafia mixtape
I can&#39;t stop thinking about Anthony clapping his loud, wet, meaty hands.
I love it, but think it should have been billed as JPEGMAFIA ft. Danny Brown, like Raekwon and Ghostface used to do back in the day. Danny Brown isn&#39;t really that present.
This album is fantastic, they compliment each other so well! Been waiting for new Danny Brown music since forever one of the best
Melon you can&#39;t scream at women on the street for 7 minutes and call it a review
it&#39;s not good.
9/9 ok melon
How the fuck did you not like orange juice jones ???
Tano finally giving redveil credit
i dont think your allowed to call him Peggy
Love this album!
durring this review I cried, I laughed, I smiled, I screamed, what a great review for a great album<br><br>6/10
waiter: &quot;excellent! the house sirloin, medium-rare, and for your side?&quot;<br>me: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bh3b0684RuU&amp;t=394">6:34</a>
oh my fucking god this shit is too good
Who honestly thought he wouldn‚Äôt like this album
Damn, melon. That ski mask sure doesn‚Äôt make you look fat.
With this collab should i even be surprised with the score
livin on edge this year, been playing this album round the hoes all weekü§ûüèø
Too late, I already gave it a 9/10 and deemed it potential album of the year. Although I think you did too...
before I watch the video, im gonna guess that fantano gives it a light nine (I would give it a strong 9) - ill see if I was right
fantano wearing a flannel shiesty is insane
the cover is so cool
Man got a whole mask for the thumbnail üò≠
Let‚Äôs take a moment to appreciate that this album wouldn‚Äôt exist without Melon. He brought JPEGMAFIA into the limelight!
Equally wretched and gorgeous indeed, I‚Äôve probably listened all the way through this album at least 15 times
Say what you want, but Peggy showed love to Danny that no one else in the industry should......
HYPE! Fantano W! I&#39;m proud that there are exactly zero bitches surrounding me right now because I&#39;m pumping Scaring the Hoes on repeat!
and somehow, peggys average Fantano score rises again<br>man he&#39;s just that good üòé
Where‚Äôs dat Lana Del Rey review
7.5 mixing is the biggest problem
Heaven on Eart is by far my song of the year. The sample chops are fucking just‚Ä¶ wow.
This record is awesome. Not going to lie tho there are time where the instrumentals wash out the lyric. After a few listens you can catch everything, but I think that‚Äôs what holds it back from a 10
Easily my favorite album of the year so far
I thougt hes gonna give the album a 7/10
This album is literally hilarious I couldn‚Äôt stop laughing I love it!
Literally watching this in the psychiatrist waiting room! Thank you for the review.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bh3b0684RuU&amp;t=219">3:39</a> He used the SP-404 MK II not the SX one. MK II isnt as limiting as the SX/OG one but still impressive
Cyrax has been real quiet since this one dropped
ele usou amarelo ae caralhoooo
Your next review that you do, Can you review 6LACKs‚Äô Since I Have A Lover?
Danny now has 2 10/10 albums that Melon gave a 9/10
Hell yeah
Yo this album is large!
i knew he was gonna give it a -|-2|
We are all single until further notice
Sometimes I feel Antony just gives a high score just to be relevant.
Great album review.
WTF????? YOU SCARED US WITH A VIDEO ABOUT MIXING AND THEN GIVE US A 9??
the way you explained the title of the album is fucking hilarious LMAO my man broke it down so far for no reason as if you are 6
Melon not a fan of interludes üíÄ
That‚Äôs all I wanted
Wow I haven&#39;t seen a rating like that since the old days. How generous.
No way this thing was ever getting anything less than a 9
My therapist: <br>Yeatthony Yeattano isn&#39;t real, he can&#39;t hurt you!!!<br>The thumbnail:
This album stands the test of time. Hoes will be scared for decades to come
They not only got a Yellow Flannel Shirt, but a Yellow Flannel Hat.
I don&#39;t know what scared me more, the boo at the beginning or the fact he likes this album.
SOUNDS LIKE MELONS FAV BAND
Garbage Pale Kids is GOATED!!!
Wish he woulda kept on that thing in his head for the whole review, LMAO!
Talk about the mix
im going to be honest, i dont think there will be a better album than this year for the rest of the year.
You didn‚Äôt mention the beautification penultimate track HOE man man man <br>It‚Äôs a 10
The fact that Fantano has a yellow flannel sheisty is hilarious
Bruh so many comments about mixing in this comment section, so many self admited scared hoes üòÇ
We need that hit boy review
not ONE word about the mixing?
You know this album is groundbreaking when you think Melon must be a Hoe because he only gave this a 9 and not a 10
Idk men, I get its creative af, but this is a strong 7 to light 8 not a 9, let&#39;s be real here the mixing ü§ì
I really enjoyed the collaboration between MC Ride and Danny. Very happy to see that DG is online again.
lol 1/10 <br>super spicy take, Anthony!
Ayo Mellon got the yellow plaid shiesty?!?
Me who was anxiously waiting for him to shit on redveil.
GOOOD..... MF..... Damn man, this album was so fun to listen too<a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/LsMfY8P6G-yckNAPjoWA8AI"></a> My jaw was open after listening to the title track, and Garbage Pale Kids on my first listen though. I live for creative and raw sampling, and this project made my month.... hell maybe even my year. Cheers fellas. Thanks for the review Prof. Anthony
YOU FORGOT STEPPA PIG
It triggers me so hard that Peggy‚Äôs and Danny‚Äôs positions on the cover aren‚Äôt symmetrical
I think he‚Äôs done using the 404 because it‚Äôs the end of an artistic challenge for himself to produce like the guys back in the 90s. <br><br>Not because the 404 is horrible to use or anything
I‚Äôve been waiting for this since the album came out üòä
here for the fantano watch party
Hey dad
A 9 FROM MELON WOAH LOVE THIS!!
why the Checkered Ninja cosplay???
Or N3IG4BORS OD series
ive listened to this album front to back over 15 times. so happy to finally have an opinion on it. thanks, melon.
Please review mellow Fatality beyond infinity
The first time I heard the singles Lean Beef Patty and Scaring the Hoes, I really wasn‚Äôt sure what to think of it. Since the album released I have listen to it 14 times all the way through. Love this album!!! Cool to see it get some love, especially from melon
The mixing prevented the album from 10/10
When I listened to it and couldn&#39;t stand the album, I instantly knew melon head was going to give it a 10/10
If scaring the hoes holds up for 3 years I&#39;ll make the bet that it&#39;ll be considered a masterpiece of its time and mayhaps I&#39;ll give it a 10/10 but as I feel now, it&#39;s as strong a 9 can be without being a 10
Lol this is the first review I agree with 100% bro nailed it
I don‚Äôt feel that you‚Äôre familiar enough with the artist to be calling him Peggy. And of course you would give this basic ass album a 9/10. Loser
the underground ??? bro pls this isn‚Äôt 2014
anthony the sample for the title track is Dirty Beaches - &quot;Untitled&quot; - Take Away Show<br>it&#39;s pretty cool, give it a listen :)
Who here 2037?
Finally
Yes it‚Äôs so good. JPEG brings out peak Danny brown and vice versa. Production is so ill and such a fun album
minor spelling mistake on the description, opinion invalid
It‚Äôs a 10 yall. It‚Äôs a 10
Scare us with the Lana review lmaoo
Damn it almost got a 10 but ig it wasn&#39;t schizophrenic enough
The title track and God Loves You are fucking incredible
Burfict is the perfect anthem for settling the west, got that Manifest Destiny type beat
He thought we forgot the Redveil allegations
2/10 trash LP
Wow anthony there‚Äôs was no needs to run around scaring women for 8 minutes
Lean Beef Patty not on fav tracks??? I absolutely love that song! Otherwise I agree for the most part on everything else
meaty fucking slaps
Yeat
This thumbnail scared me a bit lol. But it‚Äôs hard
It&#39;s been 20 years,...and I still can&#39;t get layed
I must be a hoe because you scared me with that ski mask
You would‚Äôve gave it a 10/10 if track 12 was called Anthony Fantano Melon Meal.
Discazo tony
Damn Peggy and Danny have the same amount of 9s than nav has not goods
Love Peggy and Danny, but I feel like this album has gone right over my head. The only tracks that have stood out to me are Kingdom Hearts and Garbage Pale Kids. I‚Äôll wait a week and give it another listen. Kinda disappointed tbh
I&#39;m honestly shocked to hear you say that the closer is a difficult listen<br>to me that track has massive pop appeal and if I had to pick a single track to show a friend who wasn&#39;t into Peggy and Danny that would be the one<br>it&#39;s the kind of banger that I think anyone could get down with
Yeat coming in clouch replacing Fartano and giving it a 10 was a welcoming one <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg"></a><a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg"></a><a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg"></a><a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/xsIfY4OqCd2T29sP54iAsAw"></a><a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/xsIfY4OqCd2T29sP54iAsAw"></a>
I was so sure this was going to go badly because of his recent mixing video and the discussion around this album&#39;s mixing but i am PLEASANTLY surprised :D
ID BET 100 DOLLARS THAT ANTHONY HAD NO IDEA WHAT THE FUCK THEY WERE RAPPING ABOUT UNTIL HE LOOKED UP THE LYRICS. SHITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTHEAD MELONN
how am I suppose to find a gf if I listen to something that scares women?
this album came out 13 years ago and you‚Äôre reviewing it now? ‚Äúinternets busiest music nerd‚Äù my butt‚Ä¶
idk I don‚Äôt get it
AOTY IDK MAYBE THO
If Pulp Fiction was an album...
this is so overhyped and overrated
I think my favorite part of this album is the feel of the mixes, the whole project really feels cohesive in production and mix.
Idk how others felt, but I was so worried this would be a disappointment and that it just wouldn&#39;t quite work for whatever reason. So glad I was wrong, now any hoes not scared by my face can be scared by my music choices
It&#39;s good to know my favorite black music reviewer likes this album
Fuck yes he‚Äôs finally done it and given it it‚Äôs correct score üòçüôèüôè
Fuck pitchfork
I was scared Fantano was gonna give this an 8. This album totally deserved a 9 ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
This is basically Kids See Ghosts for annoying people
this album is so poorly mixed, surprised melon head wore his gold flannel. cant hear WTF either jpeg or danny is saying until the fucking beat stops and lets them speak. tf is this shit
WOOOO WE CAN LIKE THE ALBUM. WE EATING BOYS
this album was all I could think about for months and it still exceeded expectations
Peggy/Danny AND Liturgy released on the same day?? It truly is a great time for fans of annoying music.
YES
Smh was hoping for a Cal review
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bh3b0684RuU&amp;t=160">2:40</a> pause
Hoes: Scared<br>Flannel: Yellow<br>I am: The black Marjorie Taylor Green
JPEG and Danny now have 2 9/10‚Äôs
I forgot how weird Fantano looked before he took the mask off lmao
Tbh Is it just me but this record is not THAT great for fantano to wear the infamous yellow flannel
I LOVE THEM BOTH, BUT THIS ALBUM IS NOT A 9. how is this better than flowerboy and many other 8s?
THIS IS A WIN!
Insanely good album.
Front to back this shit was a banger
üòç 10en outta 10en review it again
He thinks he‚Äôs yeat
Vontaze Burfict lol
As a hoe I can confirm this album is really scary
When the yellow balaclava comes out you know is gonna be good
Rare Fantano W
I&#39;m unsure if the double flannel fits this review since it does the opposite of scaring the hoes
W MELON!
Does anyone else like guessing the score based on the review? Anyway, I was on ot
Best album release of the year so far I think we can all agree
time for the RYM score to increase by a couple points
light 9 is all we wanted to hear
Not the flanneclava üíÄ
I think it&#39;s time to do a redux review on this album, you weren&#39;t scared enough
Anthony, with this you&#39;re definitely scaring the hoes
Straight üî•such a great collab
Disappointed that I wasn‚Äôt actually disappointed as promised
Rare melon W
these 2  have a immaculate discography. for me it goes:<br>veteran &gt; atrocity exhibition &gt; xxx &gt; amhac &gt; lp! &gt; the ghost pop tape &gt; scaring the hoes &gt; ep! &gt; uknowhatimsayin¬ø &gt; the hybrid &gt; ep!2 &gt; old &gt; black ben carson
Album was insane. Peggy and Danny Brown disappointed, 11/10 thanks melon
Whenever I come to the comments I get lost, confused, &amp; entertained all in one ü§£
Knew it would pull this score but damn I was hoping for the 10
record the interview with the boys again
I liked most of LP but I cannot find myself enjoying this album.
bro this album is literally focus-group made just for you.
Scaring the Crows
the melon has been appeased
NOT THE YELLOW FLANNEL SHEISTYüò±üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±
I&#39;ve listened to the album  probably 5 times so far and cannot get enough of it. Also that cover is top tier
Aoty already
If Kanye made this album you would&#39;ve given it a 6üò≠
TBH where ya get ya coke from might be my favorite track
Insane production, incredible beats from Peggy but I can‚Äôt stand the mix on this. I swear I can‚Äôt hear half of what Danny is saying ever, if I could hear him more this album is an easy 9 but feels more like a 7 to me
11/10.
SOOO glad you put this in your best of the decade list. Can&#39;t wait to see what the 2030&#39;s bring.
Love ya Fanny
If Seattle traffic was a music genre. I like it!!
Man this album is fantastic. Imo, almost just as good as each of their best albums (LP and AE).
I thought for sure this was gonna get a surprisingly low score LMFAO
melon, i literally just saw Peggy live for the first time. lovely to see this posted right as i got back home. ü•∞
Light 9 is pretty much a solid 9 which is pretty much a strong 9 which is pretty much a light 10. Congrats Peggy X Danny on the first 10/10 üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
but melon you like in rainbows more.. play dat nude bass pleaze
Great review but it was fucked up when you said that ,,the only thing that is holding their music back, is their skin color&quot;üòî
The deluxe will be scaring the bros, which will feature mostly singing over sample chops from the latest Olivia rodrigo and Taylor swift projects.
Red veil fuckin killed his feature. Can‚Äôt wait for more from him.
I mean- it was alright, but that‚Äôs just my opinion
I waited all this time for you to give it a lousy 9????!!!!!!
Sorry but LP! is closer to a 10 than this is a 9.
ANTHONYYYYYYYY
light 7 at the most for this, what u smoking? plug your nose and you can rap like danny
I have an SP404 MKII<br><br>I haven‚Äôt listened to this album yet and I‚Äôm scared to because I know it‚Äôs gonna blow anything I‚Äôve done out of the water
About time you did redveil justice
Wow! He gonna give Lana a 4 now cuz he alrdy gave a good review and there is non left for poor Lana
This album was a musical experience !<br><br>Love from South Africa üáøüá¶.
I was wondering when Needledrop is going to review this album.<br><br>It‚Äôs easily one of my favorite albums of the year thus far. It‚Äôs the  type of album that you can play on a loop. <br><br>My only issue with the album is the mastering on some of the tracks. It‚Äôs hard to hear what‚Äôs being rapped over the beats.
Saw him in Lawrence. Let‚Äôs just say the album is also very good in live performance.
So this is his album of the year so far
first time i had the exact same score as melon
bro talked about redveil like he forgot how he did him in 2020üò≠
Orange Juice Jones is the most uncleared sample ever lol üòÇ
Peggy needs to produce for more artists. He has a serious argument for best in the game right now.
Day 427 of commenting until Boothony Scaretano reviews Carriage House by Woodward and Parker
So real
guys i think he may have liked it
Fantano is a cornball once again
This album would have got a 10/10 if it had a song named &quot;Jack Harlow Melon Meal&quot;
NEVER GONNA FEEL THE TOUCH OF A WOMAN üî•üî•üî•
Saw it coming honestly saw a 10 since this is what Anthony loves to hear.
This guy probably rides a scooter.
A ton of people are gonna suddenly feel vindicated for spending 60 bucks on the vinyl version now
REDVEIL LOVE, W
I never really listened to Danny Brown or jpegmafia, outside a few tracks but this album really surprised me.
wooo woo woo! been really enjoying this record!
I feel like Lean Beef Patty is a taster for how crazy this album couldve ended up
Just because this album isn&#39;t called Scaring the Melons is doesn&#39;t mean that you need to give it a light 1 and laugh about how distorted the album is. Unsubscribed.
Missed ur opportunity to say ‚Äú scaring the hoes forever ‚Äúüòì
REVIEW LEARN 2 SWIM BY REDVEIL !!
Anything with Danny Brown is trash. The sound of my cat walking around his litter box sounds better than anything that ever came out of Danny&#39;s vocal chords. ü§ó
Anthony is about to enact vigilante justice on Uncle Ben&#39;s killer
Melon finally giving red veil his props
the fact that he listed like 11 songs as his fav in description is something else
This comment is to all of those who said Scaring The Hoes was gonna be a 7. PEGGY AND DANNY DONT MISS üî•üî•
imo, a 10! great album
This Album feels like the soundtrack to a YouTube Poop, and I love it.
Having not heard the album prior to watching this review, pausing after every track list mention to go listen to the song then come back made for a pleasant listening experience.
Fantano you are trolling at this point üòÇ
Still a banger to this day! Who&#39;s listening in 2033?!?!
period! hate to sound corny but literally a once in a lifetime album for me. Cannot stop playing it
yellow flannel mask is hard
quit edging that peggy 10
this album sucked
Administrative melon
This took so long, i thought you was too scared to rate the hoes
If the album was called To Pimp A Hoe Fantano would give it a 10
thanks for giving this album retrospective review, deserving of the CLASSIC/10
I was literally chattering my teeth going into this album I was so scared uwu
ngl I was a bit unsure based off the singles but this shit is fantastic
I had no idea this project was coming and when I red &quot;Danny Brown &amp; JPEGMAFIA&quot; under the album cover in Apple Music, my first though was &quot;this shit is going to scare the hoes lol&quot;, just before clicking on it and to read the title of the album. Very fitting title I must admit
The Best gospel album hands down
HOES: Hateful Oligarchy Ends Soon.  We‚Äôre with you Danny and Peggy. Keep asking questions
This album is death grips with comedy
I really like this album, o dont think that is a 9
Nobody cares about this review Lana
Can you review 6LACK&#39;s new album?
Going through a really rough breakup right now. 2 and a half years together. I‚Äôve been really lost and dissociated lately. I can‚Äôt enjoy anything anymore. This album, however, actually made me happy. I‚Äôm going to remember this album for a long time. It‚Äôs the only thing that has made me feel something in the past month. I was anticipating this dropping, and I‚Äôm so glad that it came out when it did. A milestone in my life, for sure.
back to back 9s for peggy
correction....None of these nigas make beats on the sp-404...They just use it as a thru filter to degrade the bitrate
based
9 is a lil generous let‚Äôs be real
He wrote garbage pail kids instead of garbage pale kids in the description. MELON MISTAKE
This the one that made me unsub üî•üî•üî•
I loved orange juice jones. Though its one of the calmer tracks production wise, its extremely flow heavy from both parties and is probably my fav delivery wise. I appreciate  how comfortable they sound compared to the other tracks.
Okay isn&#39;t track 4 garbage pale kids, the afghan Whigs crazy (from the 10/10 1965 album)?
Melon in da shiesty üî•üî•
Yeezus is better, next.
Fantano is now tw√Øzz rich
THIS ALBUM IS SO GOOD
Anthony scared these 2 rappers are nearly perfect at hoes
I can‚Äôt believe mc ride and danny brown made an album together
W
Burfict beat gives me super metroid vibes
this is like the ‚Äúwatch the throne‚Äù of penis music<br>that 9/10 was well deserved
I can‚Äôt believe melon said ‚ÄúKingdom Hearts‚Äù thank you Peggy
LET&#39;S ARGUE:<br>Kingdom Hearts Key, Garbage Pale Kids and Burfict! are absolutely the top 3 tracks on this album
Ngl fantano could kidnap me in that ski mask and I wouldn&#39;t resist
.man when I got to kingdom hearts key I raised my hands like my aunty Sunday mornin at church after clubbing the night before
This album sent a greasy chill down my spine, and frequently electrocuted me to death.
Facts.
If this shit gets a better score than say a Drake album Anthony has completely lost all credibility to me LMAOOOO
I know this shit is a few years old but it aged so well it feels like it dropped a few days ago.
melons hairline looks like a failed chemistry experiment
I‚Äôm putting this in .5x speed so I can savor the moment.
Issa 10 tho
Yeat Fantano
as a certified &#39;hoe-repellent&#39;, yes this music will make the hoes ran away
This is just a curiousity question, but to anyone who self identifies as a hoe, did this album scare you?
rare w melon man
I fucking love ‚ÄúRun the Jewels‚Äù it‚Äôs a fun little bite sized song with a simple concept: there is a beat with a beat switch halfway through, Peggy raps on one half and Danny the second: perfect.
He had a flannel shiesty üòÇ
&quot;Those are some loud, wet, meaty hands.&quot; - Melon, 2023
Holy shit he didn&#39;t mention the mixing
damn Orange Juice Jones was my favorite one üò≠ great review tho ü§ù (unsubscribed)
This album is like Her Loss for music nerds
Not only he wearing the yellow flannel shirt, he wearing the yellow flannel balaclava, i already know this gonna be good
I saw a comment on another video saying this is the TPAB for neurodivergent people and ill stand by that for my description
Melon juice Tony
I saw the thumbnail and it reminded me of 2012 when Isis was still popping on here having GMC ads before the videos.
PEGGY IS STRONGER PEGGY IS SMARTER PEGGY IS BETTER PEGGY. IS. BETTER !!!
Yoooo he acknowledged Redveil let‚Äôs gooo
Boy really came thru
LOUD. WET. MEATY HANDS - Fantano, 2023.
I like Peggy, I like Danny Brown. This is a good album for me.
This album disappointed me. 10/10 üî•
I&#39;m glad they finally acknowledged Redveil with respect.
dur sound like deaf grip light 9
Ayeeeeeeeee, yessss
9 BABY LETS GOOOO
Damnnn a light 9! Yay
Anthony doing his best poo Sheisty impression in the thumbnail
This is the highlight of the year for sure.
Bro looked so dipped i hadda listen to him talk rq
Classic album
Hoes been really quiet since this one dropped
I cannot wait till JPEGMAFIA di–µs
ur telling me if Run the Jewels was a 3 minute song then this would be a 10???
CODEINEINMYCERIO
LETS GOOOOO LIGHT 9
Garbage Pail Kids samples old Japanese  commercial.
9 :O
personally, as a hoe, I was indeed scared but it was good
YESSSS
What does Peggy have to do to get a 10 üò≠
Good job melon, you didn&#39;t fuck this one.
I‚Äôm so glad Danny did this project. Literally reminds me of the old days. He seems really happy making this whole project. Great to see him do something like this.
My favourite part was when Melon called Kelis and told her, &#39;This is bigger than all of us now&#39;.
There it is
Man I was bracing myself for a 7. Bravo
melon wearing a shiesty made my year lmao
love the takes on the album. puts into words my thoughts &quot;im in shambles&quot; listening to it. its just too hard. and ive gotta say. this year is peggys year. three albums and this is the first one. fuck, we are eating good
Yaaasssss üéâ
do new greedo!
Lane beef patty is good too
I was expecting a decent 8 but a light 9 puts me through the mfin ROOF
he said over Twitter that it was actually the mk2 and not the original
Why the hate for the track &quot;rtj?&quot; Anyway I am ready for the review for call me if you get lost: the estate sale. Any word on the next danny album though?
Same flow on every song, L album
If it was called the haunting of the melons you would&#39;ve given it a 10
Light 9??! Let‚Äôs gooo! Happy to see it didn‚Äôt disappoint
This album I think is a 9/10 in the same way saturation I is. Weird as fuck, doesn‚Äôt really tell a story and isn‚Äôt super deep, but sounds so insanely good
Thanks dylanthony I give this also a 9/11
ScareThony Hoestano
Burfict! is so good and isn‚Äôt talked about enough
Indeed, Melon, this is the best album of the 2020s
boo
orange juice jones is amazing, anthony is wrong
Thanks for the dap at the NYU event Anthony. I was crushed by the room being full.
Hey you were unfair unfair to Chance the Rapper. He was awesome and you owe him an apology
This is already the second 9 for both of them. Just quality
This is up there with Her Loss. One of the best collaborations in the past decade, just phenomenal.
I love Orange Juice Jones tho :(
Where the liturgy 10 at
Truly the first strand type album

since the new fall out boy album got a 3 and scaring the hoes got a 9, that means this album is 3 times better ü§ì
Surprised it wasn&#39;t a 10
Real
If it‚Äôs not Lana idc
Hoes successfully scared
I really liked how this album had no swearing, no ass shaking and no reference to drug use. Just good wholesome christian fun
Never thought I‚Äôd see the day Melon praises Redveil lmao
cant believe this album just hit 100 years old
He praised Redveil let&#39;s go
One of the best albums of the industrial revolution
I don&#39;t know what Anthony is happier for: This album, or the fact that apparently flannel balaclavas exist.
ITS A TEN YOU WRINKLY BALD PUSSY
Omfg omfg I would‚Äôve been so angry if he gave this album the wrong fannel
Ringthony Lightflectiontano here
I remember listening to this back in the 70s while smoking reefer with some cool cats
I love jpegmafia and all my heroes are cornballs is one of my favorite albums ever but I really thought this was a 7 at best, it doesn‚Äôt hit or have the level of emotion that I I feel like his previous albums did, but then again I do prefer his more melodic music
What 9? Really? I listen again
Run The Jewels was one of my favorites
Absolute killer album! Easy 10
Anthony, I understand why you didn‚Äôt give this album a 10/10 you didn‚Äôt want to scare ALL of the hoes
Flannel sheisty is crazy
anthony, if you liked the jazz rap on this you need to listen to cities aviv bro
This album made me gay and now I‚Äôm a millionair√©
Haven‚Äôt watched a Anthony fantano the internets bussyiest music nerd video in 2 years, what I miss?
Anthony loves Drake so much he dressed up like the dark lane demo tapes
Garbage Pale Kids is something to be hold
I‚Äôd give this album a 3. The mixing sucks, the vocals sound out of tune, samples are lame and the lyrics are stupid and they don‚Äôt make sense
Lil Pump 2 &gt;
Scarin the hoes was way better than kids see ghost imo but I‚Äôll be fine with a 9/10
Review Memento Mori by Depeche Mode
glad to see u arent beefing w redveil anymore
I hope he was using a 404 mk2 because a sx with this type of shit would drive anyone insane. <br><br>Can&#39;t get those horns out of my head.
Meh
Bro is sucking the whole shaft of jpegmafia
Bruhhhh how you gonna give Mids See Ghosts a 10 but not this?? This album&#39;s miles better
The production on this feels like a 36 minute flex from JPEG, insane fucking beats
You‚Äôre on cocaine Anthony
finally being nice to redveil
If the album had a Death Grips feature it‚Äôd be a 10
W, aoty so far, even as a fan of both did not expect it to be THIS good
Does Peggy ever miss? Serious question.
I wish Danny well in Rehab, I hate hearing that he thinks it‚Äôll change his music in a negative way.
Boo
Imma go out of my way and say this is light 9.
Garbage PALE kids and God loves you are so my fuckin type
l o u d  w e t  m e a t y  h a n d s
How has that shirt held up so well over these years? Drycleany Boraxtano? Great album by two of the coolest dudes in the business. P.S. Good luck to you Danny on your rehab trek. Takes a strong person to get up and get to it.
WE WANT A REDUX ANTHONY!!! THIS IS A 10 ANTHONY!!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bh3b0684RuU&amp;t=287">4:47</a> bruh? <br>we lettin this slide?
redveil with the Fantano comeback of the year
I prefer the Bandcamp album cover
I think it should be the perfect time to start a Scaring Hoes campaign. Scare any hoe with any track.
I fucking love Peggy and Danny, but this is not a 9 üòÇ
Burfict and Where Did Ya Get Your Coke From were my faves. Least favorite was Orange Juice Jones but it was still decent. 9/10 indeed
Screaming ‚ÄúPeggy where you been at‚Äù for 8 minutes is not a review, Anthony.
I certainly wish I was on the shit your smoking that you gave this such a high score
HOES STATUS = SCARED
Let&#39;s gooooo legendary album so glad I got to see Peggy live right before he dropped LP! he performed hazard duty pay before he cleared the sample
Pegthony Browntano
DAMN! Peggy has double 9/10s now
redveil w
Please review T-Pain‚Äôs latest album, Fantano.
orange juice jones is so damn good...
Wait, was the instrumental refrain on Garbage Pale Kids not a distorted chord organ?
You think I would really like this album, but everytime I try to bump any songs on here my teeth start chattering and my legs start trembling. Something about this album is bone chilling to me
Finally my score matches word Anthony‚Äôs
Not even an 11 smh
Not sure if I predicted this project, but last year had a summer playlist for drinking games with some friends and had a playlist called ‚Äúsongs that scare the hoes‚Äù which‚Äô had Danny and Peggy on it (ain‚Äôt it funny, baby I‚Äôm bleeding). Love this album though. Those horns on Burfict just hit different than any beat on a track I‚Äôve seen since maybe metros album or sumn
No mention of the mixing? Huge elephant in the room whether you like it or not, you gotta mention it
Damn I thought he would address how he shit on redveil‚Äôs music once he talked about kingdom hearts key
this guy so white
So close to a 10! I‚Äôll take a 9 üéâ
Personally I&#39;d give it a 9/10 but agree to disagree Melon
disagree , didn&#39;t like the sound AT ALL . Zero tracks have any semblance of stability , all sounds are chaotic .
I&#39;m sure if this was called &quot;Scaring The Melons&quot; it would be a 11/10
This shit is bananas
Anthony, you can‚Äôt just change the title to ‚ÄúGarbage Pail Kids‚Äù because you‚Äôre pale
I&#39;m surprised you didn&#39;t talk about Garbage Patch Kids and The Ghost of Ranking Dread similarities
I appreciate the inclussion of the flannel pattern Ski mask. It&#39;s really got some scaring the hoes vibe
Ooooohhhhhh ‚ù§üòÇüòÇ<br>That Fantano dropped let&#39;s gooo
Switched up on redveil real quick. üòÖ
‚ÄúScare the hoes, or live long enough to see yourself become the scarred‚Äù -melon
Exactly what I think about this album, couldn&#39;t agree more, I absolutely hate Orange Juice Jones with a passion, except maybe peggy&#39;s part. I think I might be able to give this album a 6 maybe 7/10
You twizz bro?
As someone that‚Äôs not the most familiar with JPEGMAFIA, the cultural context that you gave at the beginning of the review actually helped me to understand the context of what you talk about in the review a lot more!
looking very Halal in this Tony
this album, being 56 years old, still sounds ahead of its time.
15 years later and I still can&#39;t get gf cuz&#39; this album
Anthony looks like an illigal miner from South Africa üòÇüòÇüòÇ
bro if run the jewels was longer this woulda been a 10 üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
FINALLY
Hi, Anthony!
Not a criticism, but it&#39;s funny that Fantano was getting hate for calling Redveil an Earl clone and now he&#39;s praising Redveil saying he sounds almost like Tyler, the Creator.
i had no idea about the 404, that is absolutely nuts
Danny Brown and Peggy are a chaotic match made in heaven. I couldn&#39;t stop listening to this album ever since it came out. Definitely the best album this year so far.<br><br>Edit: also, if anyone knows, where do they sample the distorted riff in Garbage Pail Kids from? Or was that an original synth riff?
I never really listened to their music but my first listen to this album made me respect them much more. Enjoyed front to back
Burfict! had no business of going so stupidly hard with a goofy medieval beat, 100% playing it while on a daily exercise from now on, It‚Äôs such an addicting track<br><br>also I was surprised that you gave Redveil a pretty good compliment despite the beef you had 2 years ago and the fact that you skipped KHK on your first reaction, although his verse reminded me less of Tyler and more like Denzel imo
Best fantano review in a min
Get you a ho that&#39;s not scared of this music.
Classic
I farted
Mellon would have given this a 10/10 if the album was called ‚Äúkids see hoes‚Äù
I fucking knew it would be a 9/10
Holy fuck he complimented redveil
Melon&#39;s &quot;Masked like Hommy&quot;. Love this album been playing it every day since it came out.
Flannel: Yellow<br>Album: 9<br>Hoes: Scared
No melon it‚Äôs called scaring the hoes because the hoes get scared and uncomfortable when you play it
Wearing a mask to indicate a 9/11 score is a little over the top. Subscribed
I like Orange Juice Jones. Kind of sounds like a mixtape track but I like how it showcases Danny‚Äôs style and inflection.
Niceeeeee
Can you have a mask on for every rewiev pls?
What a thumbnail
The beat on God Loves You made me believe in god üôè
This review is way too short album deserves more praise
Melon, you just can&#39;t give this album a 11/10 because you scare the hoes too.
Yeah, really loved the collab. I think both Peggy and Danny work really well together. I will admit there are some imperfections but overall, really good. Definitely worth the listen.
Peggy is the only 2 times I felt disappointed fantano gave an 8 and a 9
fantano in the shiesty
Amazing album but Jesus Anthony you didn&#39;t have to scream in A panicked terror the entire video. The album isn&#39;t THAT SCARY
Anthony and Yeat have opened the door for white people to wear the shiesty. Thank you both ‚ù§Ô∏è
Now this album will give you hoes, Anthony. Classic reverse psychology review.
JPEGMAFIA has to be a top 10 producer of all time.
i‚Äôm sorry, but orange juice jones is so fucking hard.
GIVE IT A 10 YOU COWARD YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO
Was surprised to hear you bring up and then also compliment redveil knowing what happened between yall.<br><br>But yeah this album does indeed scare hoes
GOD LOVES YOU
Where my mom&#39;s at?
great album, but why are they trying to scare minecraft tools???????
I thought we were getting a 10....
you can&#39;t give this album a 9/10 because you were scared
Now people can form their opinion
Yo Melon, cool review and all, but where did you get that hat/mask at?
This was my top album of 2023 but I was scared you would review it poorly and make me hate the album, thanks for letting me keep my opinion Boothany! :)
I bet he gave it a light 9 instead of a 9 because Danny Brown posted that meme and it hurt his feelings. That&#39;s some cold melon.
love love love this album. danny and peggy continue to outdo themselves everytime. i can‚Äôt thank you enough for putting me onto these guys way back when, fantano. changed my life fr
melon is scaring the honeydews
no mention of orange juice jones? loved danny&#39;s delivery over this incredible MJ sample.
Fantano is not a hoe
Yeah, the sample on the scaring the hoes title track is clapping and the sample also includes the sax.
I don&#39;t think this album is that scary tho it seems very appealing.
Peggy has really been killing it
Super surprised
Took him longer to upload cause he was waiting for his flannel ski mask to come in the mail
Hurry up with the Lana record
Definitely a fantano type album, well deserved ratingüëèüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩ

Jokes aside, HOE (heaven on earth) is hilariously good. I don‚Äôt think I can ever listen to the hoes like I did before‚Ä¶
Came here to bitch about you not giving it a 9 or 10, but you did actually give it a 9. Very disappointed Fanthony Antano
What would‚Äôve been scarier is if he painted his face in red flannel
BRUH.
Orange Juice Jones is amazing for the beat alone, it‚Äôs heavenly.
daddu
redveil
Shiesty fantano
Dope asf yes I‚Äôm here for it the flannel balaclava/ski mask less go ngl Needle u scaring us with tht thumbnail presence juss went up by 100+ the aura emanating of it.
Anthony, you can‚Äôt remove a point just because Danny won‚Äôt dress up as Moses and ‚Äúsplit your red sea‚Äù
Burfict song of the mfn year üò§‚õΩ‚õΩüî•üî•üî•üî•
Huge L
Holy shit, forgot veteran was only five years ago, feels like Peggy has put out so much amazing stuff in so little time
scaring the fantano
holy fk intro was so scary mr.fantano, please do not do that again!
AAHH YESSIRRR
Mid album, mid music nerd
haven‚Äôt had a first listen of an album that blew me away as much as this did in a good minute, peggy never fails to disappoint
Anthony with the flannel shiesty is probably the scariest thing I&#39;ve ever seen
what
&quot;If only the mixing was good&quot; - ü§ì
i actually liked orange juice jones
Fit hard
Loud wet meaty hands
yellow flannel
Who&#39;s gonna tell Anthony who the guest is on Kingdom Hearts Key?
Anthony I know you always rate them 7/10 but you can&#39;t bring this album&#39;s score down just because there&#39;s a track titled Run The Jewels on it
I have absolutely no idea what danny said on that album, 9/10
HE LIKED THE SONG WITH REDVEIL YAY!!!!!
L it‚Äôs a 10
as soon as this album dropped, I&#39;ve been waiting for this
10 years later and I still get chills from this album
This album was IGHT
Orange juice jones IS A MASTERPIECE
Love the album but can Fantano just retire? He is annoying af.
Yup. Best album of the year so far. Glad to hear your thoughts on this one!<br><br>Now where&#39;s the Lana review?
They went wild as fuck on this project!
NOW Fanthony wants to give Redveil some props
SIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
This album sound like a limewire mp3-filled 16gb iPod that got thrown in the washing machine
Ur so cringe
Not gonna lie I feel like this is the closest I‚Äôve ever been to giving a record a 10 but didn‚Äôt
its honestly terrible
Short and sweet, just like the album. Welp, better go listen again üòà
Damn Peggy... another 9
I&#39;ve listened to this album at least 3 times a day since its come out. Peggy has yet to miss.
Bitch just give them a 10 üôÑ
Heaven on Earth gotta be my favorite song this year so far
Anthony just because you relate to scaring the hoes doesn&#39;t mean you can give this album a 9/10 you have to review it properly
The yellow flannel is the +8, and the ski mask is the +1
to think peggy still has 2 more albums this year and danny finally releasing quaranta. no unscared hoe left behind
I appreciated how you finally introduced yourself as &quot;isuckthany cocktano&quot; in this one
orange juice jones deserved better
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bh3b0684RuU&amp;t=187">3:07</a> whoa, is this the first time he hasn‚Äôt used genius????
Straight up ear rape. Awful awful awful music. üòÇ yall kidding yourselves.
LETS GOOOOOO
this one genuinely surprised me. ive only recently started liking jpeg and im usually more into dannys features but sonically and bar for bar this one was bumping for me .just a exhilarating listen
omg
This is the Kid A for all the kids that grew up on RYM
This shit is so good, it&#39;s awesome Peggy made all the beats on this just on the SP-404 MK2
Yes! Finally a review of this awesome album
loud wet meaty hands
FIRST
unreal, but well deserved
you can&#39;t give it a light 9 if it doesn&#39;t line up with my opinion Anthony.
Finally a 9 this year! Not a big surprise that it came from Danny and JPEG, but I&#39;m glad that 2023 finally has one after such an unusually fast start that 2022 had and the comparative slow start this year. I&#39;m pretty sure that it&#39;ll all balance out in the end, though.
Melon didn&#39;t give this album a 10 because he didn&#39;t want to admit he got scared by Danny and Peggy
I&#39;m only liking the video cuz I don&#39;t want to get robbed by the Plaid Melon.
wow I can‚Äôt believe you spent 8 minutes looking up Danny brown rule 34
Burfect will sound insane in a live setting
That love for redveil is awesome! Looking forward to him and Peggy‚Äôs other single coming out soon
üòÆ
some of peggys wildest production and he did it all on that lil thingamabob (i‚Äôm not a musician)
Ah fuck yeahhhhh i knew this mf would love this
All Fantano ratings on JPEGMAFIA&#39;S albums:<br><br>Veteran - Decent 8, later he called it a masterpiece <br><br>All My Heroes Are Cornballs - Light 8 <br><br>LP! - Light 9<br><br>Scaring The Hoes - Light 9<br><br>Is it too soon or we can agree that Peggy is the GOAT?
This album gave me a headache
This album absolutely <i>slaps</i>
wyhy is this so short
This is a 7 max
I think that if they had worked more on the album and had put nuances of atrocity exhibition, it would be the first 11/10 on the channel, anyway, thanks couple
COMMON MELON W
LET&#39;S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
redux it and give it a 10
Incredible review
why is yeat reviewing this???
Honestly, I was expecting a 7, just due to the mixing.
Nein nein nein!
The sampling on this record is absolutely off the charts. Peggy and Danny Brown have so much musical chemistry with each ither
I‚Äôd put good money, there‚Äôs not a better rap album this year. I agree with rating, it just needed a few tweaks from a 10<br><br>I think Peggy is a 10/10 artist, but will never make a 10 album b/c of how much experimenting he does with his music. There‚Äôs always 1-4 songs on his album I PERSONALLY don‚Äôt vibe with (I‚Äôm sure others do). However, there‚Äôs songs imma play routinely until I die, life changing music.
God Loves You had me floating
Perhaps the most overrated record of the year. For an album that name drops Run The Jewels, Danny and Peggy have basically no chemistry. No hand offs, no interplay. It&#39;s a Peggy album that happens to have some Danny verses.
REHAB DANNY ABOUT TO COME OUT TO THIS SHIT AND FEEL THE BEST NATURAL HIGH
this was a 10/10 for because iv&#39;e been waiting for this collab since years , it didn&#39;t disappoint me at all , i was eagerly waiting on your thoughts nice review
That album was worth the 31 minutes of my life
This shit is watch the throne for broke dudes who are too scared to talk to the goth girl cashier at GameStop
I‚Äôve been listening to this album like crazy since release<br>Definitely my AOTY I don‚Äôt think anything else this year will top the insane amount of love I have for this project
This LP pushed sound further the second it dropped. It‚Äôs playfulness is what all music should feel like. Thank you Peggy haha
The hoes left.
Thank you for finally reviewing this, and the high score &lt;3
One of my favorite albums this year
am I the only one who thinks this album is complete and absolute trash???
One of the best collab albums ever
Hey Anthony, my mom wanted to thank you for dropping me off at school today.
So true Fantany but you didn&#39;t have to go so into detail about Danny Brown pegging the mafia in this review.
This album was amazingggggggggggggggggg
Nobody cared who I was until I put on the mask.
Boothony Scaretano really made sure that even his balaclava was plaid. Unreal dedication.
So Glad I can finally know what My opinion is.
Well Anthony I have to concur, if the Kingdom Hearts protagonist was a bi nigga from Atlanta it really would be the best game of all time
I feel a little spooked by this review, scarethani hoetano ü•∫
the samples choices and production are out of the world on this one , definitely deserved a 9/10 , the mix grew on me after few listens
Now where&#39;s part 2 at?
Yeahyeyeahyeyayeahyeahhhh
Anthony you can‚Äôt just give this album a 9 just because it still scared less hoes than you.
DAMN PEGGY! and Danny of course
at least it got a 9 üòÖ
Can&#39;t believe this man didn&#39;t close out this video saying &quot;Scaring the hoes forever&quot;.
Your review is awesome, but not as good as mine! <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/ygF1XpGUMMjk8gSDrI2wCx"></a>
Might be Album of the year so far till we get the  death grips project.
Instant Hip Hop Classic
FIEST 9 OF 2023
If this album was called ‚ÄúScaring The Hoes‚Äù you would‚Äôve given it a light 9
Sorry Anthony ed sheeran said ur career isn‚Äôt valid so I will not be tuning in. Unsubscribed
Damn 9/10? Im so surpruised /s /s /s /surprised :D
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bh3b0684RuU&amp;t=350">5:50</a>
Anthony would‚Äôve given a ten if it didn‚Äôt feature redveil
The only thing that will scare the hoes is the smell of hiphop fans
Here before the top comment spoils the score
Fr missed hearing Danny.<br>Peggy Production continues to get better and better.<br>Both went nuts. <br>Amazing album.<br>Damn right you got the yellow flannel on for this shit..
I‚Äôm right there with ya on this one.  This project is dope as fuck.
You can&#39;t leave off a point because of the redveil feature, Melon..
Deserved a 10 TBH
This one is so infectious and fun to listen to
Honestly I didn&#39;t expect to love pretty much every song because Peggy albums have always had a skip here or there for me but here we are
Imagine not putting orange juice Jones in the best tracks üíÄ
Melon actually said something good about Redveil??? This makes me wish we got a Learn 2 Swim review even more
Melon you can&#39;t just take a point off for having a redveil feature
The flipping fact that he even used the very bane 404 and not the new mk2 just absolutely shows me this dude is just amazingly dangerous, adventurous, and gives me so much fucking hope I can do shit on mine and become someone. This review definitely inspired me to try even harder, thanks melon boyo. üòäüëçüèΩ
As long as Peggy keeps dropping niche wrestling references he‚Äôs easily in my top 5 rn
I disagree
Admit it bruh you only gave this a good score bc you want people to think you like redveil now.
Love the respect for redveil melon
Danny Brown y JPEGmafia: los espantaviejas.
9 WOOOW GREAAT
Wow, i&#39;m surprised he included Lil Xan&#39;s Total Xanarchy as an example of a perfect album.
The Redveil song getting the favorite tracks treatment o7 godspeed
This album is unlistenable and danny brown is a goat.
glad he gave redveil credit
I&#39;ve been waiting for this!!! WOOO
Like 9/10 doctors recommend a certain toothpaste, this albums scares the same amount of hoes.
This album definitely scared the hoes and Fantano!üòÇüî•
One of the worst albums ever.
Peggy is 4/4 in the loved list (to my knowledge.) Two eights and two nines is wild.
Anthony dressing like he&#39;s trying to camouflage himself in my moms scrapbooks
Crazy how this literally would‚Äòve been a 10 if Danny‚Äòs vocals were mixed better
can we just get some respect as well for how sick that album cover is. looks vintage and classy but modern at the same time. hilarious as well and fits the music
oh wow i didn&#39;t know it was classics week already! thanks ant knee! this is one of the albums of the 1980s and im glad youre acknowledging it again you snuffy bear :3
Scaring the Melons
Anthony this is an incredibly racist and homophobic review, so uncalled for
If this was called ‚ÄòSlurring With Bros‚Äô you would‚Äôve gave it a 10
i absolutely love the part when melons vocals were mixed poorly
AOTY
UGLY better
how do you give this a 9 (it‚Äôs an obvious 10) wtf how dare you have your own opinion blocked and reported nice ass tho
‚ÄúGimme dat aUX ChoRd‚Äù- Daniel Brownington
Scarethony Hoetano
You motherfuckers were scared.
Bro turned into Yeat for the first few seconds
YELLOW FLANNEL SHIESTY FOR THIS ONE!
THIS IS THE BEST REVIEW EVER MADE
I love this duo, it&#39;s as if  fantano and Login did musical magic
i like hoes tho
A light 9!? Anthony wasn&#39;t Scared of the Hoes!
Because of its controversial mix, I was really scared that Fantano would give this album a 6-7/10. üòì
No memes<br><br>Goddamn this project is nuts. Always got me second guessing. Peggy&#39;s production is I N S A N E, along with him and danny being at the top of their game.<br><br>Happy seeing the yellow flannel :)
Why did you give it a 3 just because of the NAV feature on there
Anthony you cant act scared while brutally screaming for your life and call it a review
This is one of the greatest albums I have heard in my personal and humble opinion. Every song was a pleasantly-horrid surprise
Damn we were close ‚Ä¶.
whole album gave me a jumpscare, love it when danny doesn&#39;t say a thing at all, it&#39;s like he&#39;s hunting me down
I love that Melon saw the podcast. This means that he has at least heard of Cyraxx, lmfaooo
Love this record so much. Lean Beef Patty had me worried about the album sounding like a Peggy album with slight Danny features, but the title track and the rest of the album have so much great synergy between the two with some of the craziest instrumentals I‚Äôve heard from Peggy. It‚Äôs so good the only issue I have is that I need more
I honestly thought this project was underwhelming except for a few tracks. Wish i liked it but i ended up giving it a 5.8/10 sadly.
best album so far
Are you scared Anthony?
We were on the verge of greatness<br>We were this close ü§è
Hoes officially scared üò±üò±
Fentanyl Tester makes me feel like 17 different emotions
YESSSSSSSSS FINALLY
Damn, you got to make the pleasing the melon joke before I did üò©
He gave it a 9
Anthony you didn‚Äôt have to scare away all the hoes at the beginning just so you could rant about the importance of modest clothing choices for several minutes
Great review anthony, except the part where you went into a schizophrenic episode for 50 minutes straight, you need to work on your editing skills
The mix is bad yes but a 6?
Man really did an introduction going into the etymological origins of the phrase ‚Äúscaring the hoes‚Äù
ayo is that yeat
You would&#39;ve albumed this rate 10/10 if it was named to scare a hoe
WOWOWOWOW. love this
anthony, what is your opinion on the take that the title &quot;scaring the hoes&quot; is a bit misogynistic
üëç
Melon, you can‚Äôt just not give this album a 10 because you are the hoes they are scaring
Jesus Christ i thought i was gonna get robbed but it was just melon under there
melon got the shiesty on üò≠üò≠üò≠
Anthony, you can‚Äôt give SCARING THE HOES a 9 just because you like it!
Idk man you didn‚Äôt have to eat your flannel and yell about how the mixing was bad, that was just harsh!
Woah Melon&#39;s Yellow Flannel and his score certainly scared the hoes if this banger of an album didn&#39;t already üî•üíØ
Cool
Hoe scaring thumbnail
Bro, where&#39;s the UMO review at?! Cmon man, you can&#39;t skip it. Reuben&#39;s best imho. Love you, Tony!
Nice video Melon, but I don&#39;t know why you called this video of you robbing a store in a ski mask an &#39;album review&#39;
This is the good ending
Melon I know you‚Äôre scared but you need to finish the review
i loved the part where melon screamed at the screen in an unrecognizable ancient forgotten language
Banger album
if Melon wasn&#39;t scared he&#39;d give it a 10
Honestly this got the exact score I was expecting lfg
The yellow shiesty is something I don‚Äôt want. I need
Fantano i understand you didn‚Äôt like  the album but calling Danny brown and peggy beta male cucks was a little too far
Nice review Anthony! Love your passion about the music. Now can I see my wife and children finally?
Give It a fucking 10 GODAMMIT!!!!
Fantano Yellow Flannel Ski Mask is something that I want to purchase
A 9 plus a bonus point for having the hoes officially scared = 10
Just give it a 10
This man put a whole ass rap group as his least favourite track
Poohthony Sheistano here
Yellow Baclava Fantano, YB Melon
it&#39;s ok melon we know you don&#39;t need to play any music to scare the hoes
Good review Anthony, but I don‚Äôt think calling Danny Brown a silly little Billy was a bit out of pocket
yes lets get it
You‚Äôre clearly scared of giving this a light 10
So kind of Yeat to shout out his fellow rappers
bro wants to be yeat so bad
What a short video for such a score, melon was in a rush to let us know the good news
hoes were scared, me included
I don‚Äôt feel safe with that thumbnail melon. Not cool!!!
SCARING THOSE MF HOEEEESSSSSS. HOES BE STEADY TREMBLING RN BRUH. HOES IS STRAIGHT STARTLED üòÆüòÆüòÆüò¢
WE DONT WANT THAT SHIT!
Fair
Pale*
AOTY Danny and Peggy killed it. Exceeded expectations
Anny without his spectacles makes me feel certain things that are unholy frfr üò≥
Nice video Melon. I really like it when you do retro reviews and thanks for giving attention to one of my favorite 70s albums.
Melons are scary to the hoes
Anthony we all know if the album was called Scaring The Bros you would give it a 10
We knew this was gonna happen
This is yeat?
Leanthony Beeftano
Yessirrrr!
hi
first
This has to be one of the best produced albums I‚Äôve listened to in a long time. This definitely exceeded the hype for this collab project imo
Melon sheisty will haunt my nightmares
Black AOC = 9/10
oküëç
It&#39;s me, I&#39;m the hoes üò®
Shocked, really didn‚Äôt think Melon would he interested in a JPEGMAFIA x Danny Brown project
Mhm, a rating indeed fit for this album
AOTY so far
I&#39;m scared
Admit it Anthony, you gave it a 9 because you got scared
I can&#39;t take care of my garden bc my hoes have been scared away
They scared
LETS GOOOOOOOO
is this the first 9 of the year? if so it is definitely deserving. thank you melon for turning me onto these guys years back. i really appreciate it :)
whens scaring the bros
I&#39;ve probably listened to the album like 10 times already since it&#39;s release.
This is like Kids See Ghosts but for people who don‚Äôt go outside at all
You would‚Äôve given it a 10 if it was called Lil Pump 3
Melon, you would‚Äôve given this a 10 if it didn‚Äôt scare you
You have pleased the hoe (me)
bro think he yeat
First
a wise man once said: &quot;the best song wasnt the single&quot;
Wow Anthony you didn&#39;t have to give it a 0 just because they scared your wife
this album scared my girlfriend, so I dumped her for being a hoe
Holy shit that high? I was expecting an 8 ngl
the yellow flannel and a shiesty is a first
Dank
Finally
Fantano is absolutely scaring me with that fucking flannel mask Jesus Christ are you okay
After his divorce, Fantano can relate a lot with this album
GOATs
Yellow flannel sheisty is crazy üíÄ
This might be the one time where me and anthony have had the same rating on an album before his video came out
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bh3b0684RuU&amp;t=443">7:23</a> for the score

melon, i do appreciate you bringing extra flannel for the first 11/10 album. really sets this review apart.

Of course you give an album called Scaring the hoes a 9
you wouldve given this a 10 if it was called To Pimp a Scaring the Hoes
