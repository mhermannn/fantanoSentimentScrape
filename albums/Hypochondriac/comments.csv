Half of his fans are just hipsters or hate on any rapper that is white. Bad lyrics? Have you heard some of the stuff you reviewed and never touched on that? Cringe and bad review. Missing the entire point of so much.

@evanderschwartz8150,2024-02-22T20:30:27Z,2024-02-22T20:30:27Z,0,"I’m not trying to be rude or jump the ‘bandwagon’… but I really don’t think you could be more wrong about this album. I will agree, sure, the complexity of the lyrics isn’t like “there”…. But this isn’t like an Eminem album/song where there’s context, subliminal context, on top of hidden context. Where, like, I’m gonna have to listen to the album/song a good couple times to fully get/understand its FULL meaning. But this album has really smooth flow, interesting and complex beats merged together, plus I think it paints, somewhat, of a picture as to what young/insecure people go through when they start to get popular, as well perhaps what overcritical/depressed people feel when they go through something. But I think EVEN that, looking that deep/critical at the album takes away from it. More so, I think it’s an enjoyable listen, and something that you can just vibe too and feel something. But I definitely think you got this wrong, and I mean… didn’t you literally get famous because some of your videos got famous on FB? I mean, I feel like your whole fame was built off of quirky and corky beats… like nothing serious… so I’m confused as to your overall stance on this, and how you sit at this ‘table’ I guess…"

It still breaks my heart that this complete impostor has such a big platform, so the chance is extremely high that he turned many people off with his reviews, for example making them not even want to listen to masterworks like Hypochondriac, and therefore robbing them of what might have been one of their most beloved discoveries in music. <br><br>If there was a God, Fantano would not have internet connection."

I think if you can ignore some of the strange lyrics, I think the beats/production and vocal production I think it makes for a satisfying and enjoyable listen....sonically which I think is the main thing whne it comes to finding music you like.<br><br>CBD being his favourite track is typical. the closest thing to a 4 piece band with a lead, not very adventurous, vocal.

@astod1453,2023-12-09T14:37:41Z,2023-12-09T14:37:41Z,2,"long rant ahead: <br><br>the thing that gets me about this album is it&#39;s a magnifying glass on how fame and mental illness are so similar in the way they manifest, or even appear as, selfishness / &quot;egotistic&quot;. Because when struggling with trauma and mental health you are always hyper-critical and hyper-analytical of yourself, your body, your image, and your brain, you have to be that way with fame too- put them both together and one just heightens the other and it becomes something messy and complicated, kind of like how Brakence alluded to this album as Frankenstein&#39;s monster. <br><br>I think this album is a perfect example of hypochondriasis (health ocd/obsessions/compulsions) and trauma and how it impacts quite literally every aspect of your life including your ability to find success and just be a person. You&#39;re almost always masking, always pretending, always putting on a show.  As someone who personally struggles with ocd &amp; trauma myself, Hypochondriac is a perfect amalgamation of what it feels like trying to be a person, while being at war with yourself and your body- and adding success to that just exasperates all of it. So Fantano may see that as &quot;egotistical&quot; but that&#39;s kinda the whole point, you almost HAVE to be so painfully self-aware, and even sometimes selfish, because it is critical to your survival both with mental health and success in life. Plus the hypervigilance, obsessions, and overactive mind state of dealing with ocd &amp; trauma are exactly the production of this album.  9/10 for me."
@tokuyou3811,2023-12-05T05:19:17Z,2023-12-05T05:19:17Z,0,"damn there&#39;s a lot of people that don&#39;t like this review. you only review something wrong if you don&#39;t consume it at all. but fantano definitely listened to the album. whether or not we heard the same thing is apparent, but that&#39;s the point of watching a review from a different perspective.<br><br>i don&#39;t fully agree with the review, but if this is what he took from the album then so be it. go watch another reviewer that aligns more with your views if you prefer that."

It makes the song more appealing to be centered around an imperfect narrator. Also, i interperet &#39;venus flytrap&#39; completely differently: it&#39;s not about an infatuation, but rather about someone who is obsessed with him and wont let him go.<br><br>this is like my favorite album. 10/10"

@spapeztheoctopus3249,2023-10-14T21:29:14Z,2023-10-14T21:29:14Z,0,"Such a wierd thing thing to get hung up on tbh, like, paying zero attention to lyrics I think this album at least deserves like a 7 or an 8 and even if I hate the lyrics of an album they are not gonna make me think its 2-3 points worse unless they make it clear that the artist is a massive piece of shit which, even with very uncharitable interpretations of the lyrics, Brakence isn&#39;t (maybe a bit annoying to hang out with but like some irl villain)"
@omarlockett-oz1jr,2023-10-08T12:18:08Z,2023-10-08T12:18:08Z,0,I kinda agree with Fantano. Dont get me wrong its a good album but the whole album is somewhat forgettable. I like brakence but damn all these breaks before releasing songs is so fucking LAME. Like Jon Bellion does the same thing and i think thats what leads to the projects feeling forgettable. I get tired of listening to the same songs over and over again that i force myself to forget them as an artist lol 😂
@fnotcool,2023-10-08T00:25:24Z,2023-10-08T00:25:24Z,2,not understanding the personality issues being expressed thru this album that center around a juxtaposed or horseshoe&#39;d self esteem is wild. <br>also track three is about sexual coercion. <br><br><br><br>listen to the whole album again.
@olisharm6406,2023-10-06T22:34:07Z,2023-10-06T22:34:07Z,0,"honestly the obnoxiously self absorbed lyrics are, in my opinion, obviously there to critique himself. he pokes fun at his own characteristics and sarcastically brags about it all throughout the album. brakence is obviously not like this, i think this is just his way of expressing his experience with a toxic ego"

@virsus1,2023-10-04T20:37:22Z,2023-10-04T20:37:22Z,2,this fool calls himself a music critic?😂
@RandomMaxBlog,2023-09-30T09:57:10Z,2023-09-30T09:57:10Z,0,5g not good lyrics?? 🤔
@RandomMaxBlog,2023-09-30T08:41:24Z,2023-09-30T08:41:24Z,0,I disagree
