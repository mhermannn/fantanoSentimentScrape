I will agree, sure, the complexity of the lyrics isn’t like “there”…. But this isn’t like an Eminem album/song where there’s context, subliminal context, on top of hidden context. Where, like, I’m gonna have to listen to the album/song a good couple times to fully get/understand its FULL meaning. But this album has really smooth flow, interesting and complex beats merged together, plus I think it paints, somewhat, of a picture as to what young/insecure people go through when they start to get popular, as well perhaps what overcritical/depressed people feel when they go through something. But I think EVEN that, looking that deep/critical at the album takes away from it. More so, I think it’s an enjoyable listen, and something that you can just vibe too and feel something. But I definitely think you got this wrong, and I mean… didn’t you literally get famous because some of your videos got famous on FB? I mean, I feel like your whole fame was built off of quirky and corky beats… like nothing serious… so I’m confused as to your overall stance on this, and how you sit at this ‘table’ I guess…",

Because when struggling with trauma and mental health you are always hyper-critical and hyper-analytical of yourself, your body, your image, and your brain, you have to be that way with fame too- put them both together and one just heightens the other and it becomes something messy and complicated, kind of like how Brakence alluded to this album as Frankenstein&#39;s monster. <br><br>I think this album is a perfect example of hypochondriasis (health ocd/obsessions/compulsions) and trauma and how it impacts quite literally every aspect of your life including your ability to find success and just be a person. You&#39;re almost always masking, always pretending, always putting on a show.  As someone who personally struggles with ocd &amp; trauma myself, Hypochondriac is a perfect amalgamation of what it feels like trying to be a person, while being at war with yourself and your body- and adding success to that just exasperates all of it. So Fantano may see that as &quot;egotistical&quot; but that&#39;s kinda the whole point, you almost HAVE to be so painfully self-aware, and even sometimes selfish, because it is critical to your survival both with mental health and success in life. Plus the hypervigilance, obsessions, and overactive mind state of dealing with ocd &amp; trauma are exactly the production of this album.  9/10 for me.",
