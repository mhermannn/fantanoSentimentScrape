<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iirPux8sPGA&amp;t=155">2:35</a> I interpret this as being inspired by hip-hop
at least he said brakence right
Not to get too angry over a review, but can I say something? As someone who listens to BTS, brakence, and many other rap artists, we have been too lenient about melon misunderstanding almost everything
bro still carrying that L to this day and im not talking about brakence
anthony you&#39;re so on point i&#39;ve always cringed at his lyrics
this has to be most ive ever seen someone understand this album.
If any of you in the comments unironically think that Brakences lyrics are good and if you above 20y old I suggest you reconsider your life choices. Everything from production etc. is really good but his lyricism is horrendous, Argyle and Teeth are the worst offenders.
you literally have never missed harder lmao its been like almost two years and im still upset
L take
Still one of melons worst reviews to date
Melon barely touched on how musically genius this album actually is, horrible take imo
Coming back to this, just to say, this is your absolute worst take
this is unironically the worst take ive ever seen on theneedledrop channel and he game i didnt mean to haunt you a lower score then scrapyard (i love both albums btw)
Fantano&#39;s getting old and possibly out of touch with this cringe zoomer screeching
I love Brakence sound but I agree the lyrics are bad. Punk2 was better in that regard. The run through to prozac is one of my favorite things ever.
Melon, no!
man ily but i absolutely don&#39;t agree with this at all.
I supplement my life with this album
L
I think your looking past his emotions and what he struggles with and clearly telling his fan base, like juice with drugs and the weekend with sex. Idk i think he did great with this album.
how did he not even comment at all about the gorgeous titular track &#39;hypochondriac&#39;
anthony fantony calling cbd chorus &quot;one of the better pop hooks ive heard this year&quot; gotta be one of the most retarded takes ive ever heard. of all the hooks bro could have chosen from this album, he chooses one of the most mid ones.
this was the day i lost respect for you
5? cmon man
This one hurts
the comments on this are so funny, all the brakence fanboys going through the five stages of grief because he made a mid album
hopefully brakences grows on him
how does one miss the whole entire point of every song on a whole entire album lol this needs to be revisited.
You had already lost the credibility and trust I had in your opinions, but I was still hoping you’d say something positive about something that is by the masses considered one of the best albums ever made, all hope of any credibility for your opinions on music is completely gone out the window with this video, your opinion is trash and your taste is pretentious
Hes gonna revisit this album 5 years from now and admit he was way too hard on it &amp; renounce his nit-picky lyrical critiques like he did with most of Lana’s early discography….
Tasteless … seriously
How did you somehow manage to misread literally every song on this album
He needs to revisit this
This album review is what made me understand that Anthony is a pretentious hipster that likes to make negative comments about artists that he doesn’t understand
Rereview melon
yes it just an opinion but how someone can be this wrong every time?
Introvert is one of the greatest songs I’ve ever heard
i hate this guy
Proof this guy just always talks confidently and why people always agreed with him. Half of his fans are just hipsters or hate on any rapper that is white. Bad lyrics? Have you heard some of the stuff you reviewed and never touched on that? Cringe and bad review. Missing the entire point of so much.
Dont let this man ever have an opinnion again
I’m not trying to be rude or jump the ‘bandwagon’… but I really don’t think you could be more wrong about this album. I will agree, sure, the complexity of the lyrics isn’t like “there”…. But this isn’t like an Eminem album/song where there’s context, subliminal context, on top of hidden context. Where, like, I’m gonna have to listen to the album/song a good couple times to fully get/understand its FULL meaning. But this album has really smooth flow, interesting and complex beats merged together, plus I think it paints, somewhat, of a picture as to what young/insecure people go through when they start to get popular, as well perhaps what overcritical/depressed people feel when they go through something. But I think EVEN that, looking that deep/critical at the album takes away from it. More so, I think it’s an enjoyable listen, and something that you can just vibe too and feel something. But I definitely think you got this wrong, and I mean… didn’t you literally get famous because some of your videos got famous on FB? I mean, I feel like your whole fame was built off of quirky and corky beats… like nothing serious… so I’m confused as to your overall stance on this, and how you sit at this ‘table’ I guess…
Yikes bro, this album is a masterpiece and you missed all the nuance. Normally a fan but this take is a bad one.
A 5 is crazy this record deserved at least an 8 yeah a lot of the lyrics were cringy the kid is 20 years old come-on
After giving the absolutely stupidest albums ever a 10 and bashing some of the greatest albums ever, I’m finally at peace because this video is the absolute final evidence that this guy has NO IDEA what he’s talking about. It still breaks my heart that this complete impostor has such a big platform, so the chance is extremely high that he turned many people off with his reviews, for example making them not even want to listen to masterworks like Hypochondriac, and therefore robbing them of what might have been one of their most beloved discoveries in music. <br><br>If there was a God, Fantano would not have internet connection.
I agree with fantano to a degree. I think if you can ignore some of the strange lyrics, I think the beats/production and vocal production I think it makes for a satisfying and enjoyable listen....sonically which I think is the main thing whne it comes to finding music you like.<br><br>CBD being his favourite track is typical. the closest thing to a 4 piece band with a lead, not very adventurous, vocal. Fantano bread and butter aka &quot;boring&quot; <br>Decent 6 from me. From more of a face value perspective I&#39;d say light 7
I cant lie this is exactly how i felt when i first listened to the album. I think the production and vocals were good enough to make up for the lyrics for me more than melon tho
bruh
so much disgagreeing but the editing of this review was so funny man easily one of my favourite
came here after brakence&#39;s jab at fantano in a la carte and jesus christ i havent been this frustrated with this man&#39;s opinion in a very very long time
yeah the review for intellectual greed gave away he didn&#39;t care much about the review and already made his mind up. melon you seem to have missed &quot;I wantED&quot; it is past tense my dude. he criticizes his old self for thinking that way and describes how this mindset will only bring you pain. wtf is blud yappin about
respectfully ur wrong.
After a year, Anthony, you really gotta listen back to this one. And actually listen this time
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iirPux8sPGA&amp;t=396">6:36</a> its a reference to Bladee and his song Nike Just Do It
this review is basically “i can’t think of anything outside my little box and im not empathetic so these lyrics are bad”
I think he needs to stop listening to albums for the first time live. So many old timers in chat influence the vote, and inevitably that influences his view of it.
light 5 is crazy
it&#39;s crazy how out of touch this guy is. very glad to have read the comments for this video.
I had the opposite problem. I like the sound of the production, but it doesn’t vary enough from song to song to keep me interested. I love sonic cohesion, but this album feels too same-y. By the 4th or 5th song I had to tune out because I didn’t feel like I was hearing anything new enough to keep me listening
This dudes hilarious misunderstanding of this album while calling himself a music nerd is pretty sad to see. Then again there hasn&#39;t been a single take from Anthony fantano that was good
You missed the entire narrative/theme of the album completely.
Bro i hates this mans reviews. I feel like you always misses the point. This is obviously a album or self reflection, yes some of the lyrics are snobby but thats the point.
i know im a lil late here, but ive never seen lyrics go this far over Tony Tano&#39;s head
This has almost 200k views and barely over 4k likes, and that&#39;s for a reason, know that
It&#39;s the fact that he doesn&#39;t understand brakence for me
You do not understand this album at all. He is playing a character. He&#39;s not egotistical, you just clearly do not understand this at all..
idk why people are tearing this man apart for this. the music is sick as fuck but the lyrics are cringe and brakence&#39;s ego is clearly massive and it&#39;s a turnoff so i get why he rated it the way he did, and I don&#39;t get why people think he misunderstood the songs...
long rant ahead: <br><br>the thing that gets me about this album is it&#39;s a magnifying glass on how fame and mental illness are so similar in the way they manifest, or even appear as, selfishness / &quot;egotistic&quot;. Because when struggling with trauma and mental health you are always hyper-critical and hyper-analytical of yourself, your body, your image, and your brain, you have to be that way with fame too- put them both together and one just heightens the other and it becomes something messy and complicated, kind of like how Brakence alluded to this album as Frankenstein&#39;s monster. <br><br>I think this album is a perfect example of hypochondriasis (health ocd/obsessions/compulsions) and trauma and how it impacts quite literally every aspect of your life including your ability to find success and just be a person. You&#39;re almost always masking, always pretending, always putting on a show.  As someone who personally struggles with ocd &amp; trauma myself, Hypochondriac is a perfect amalgamation of what it feels like trying to be a person, while being at war with yourself and your body- and adding success to that just exasperates all of it. So Fantano may see that as &quot;egotistical&quot; but that&#39;s kinda the whole point, you almost HAVE to be so painfully self-aware, and even sometimes selfish, because it is critical to your survival both with mental health and success in life. Plus the hypervigilance, obsessions, and overactive mind state of dealing with ocd &amp; trauma are exactly the production of this album.  9/10 for me.
damn there&#39;s a lot of people that don&#39;t like this review. you only review something wrong if you don&#39;t consume it at all. but fantano definitely listened to the album. whether or not we heard the same thing is apparent, but that&#39;s the point of watching a review from a different perspective.<br><br>i don&#39;t fully agree with the review, but if this is what he took from the album then so be it. go watch another reviewer that aligns more with your views if you prefer that.
The lyrics on this album infuriate me. Everything about it is so good but the lyrics make it seem lame as fuck.
Fuck dude. Been a fan since 2014 and this is your first BAD take. I can’t get enough of this record. Yes, he has an ego but dude addresses it. Also, the lyrics to Deepfake are so deep that you kinda look passed the sadboii parts. But I still got mad respect for you doggy. This just wasn’t your best take.
I think you misunderstood a bit of this album. For example, on Venus Fly Trap, it’s not about him being obsessed, it’s about an abusive relationship.
Caffeine and Teeth are the only ones that don&#39;t hit for me. Everything else hits so hard
yeah no, man this review is just not it
‘He’s not exploring these emotions from a very healthy place’ <br><br>My brother in Christ, since when was good art made from “healthy emotions”
how did this man give this a 5 because of cringe lyrics after giving hobo johnson an 8
Every time I see this dude he just has the weirdest takes on music, how does he have such a big following, genuinely don&#39;t get it?!
coming back to this 10 months later and i have to say that, as some wise commenter once said &quot;ranking this album this low should be grounds for public execution&quot;
Fanny, bro, he’s like 20 in 2023. Are you reviewing him or his music?
redux
Yikes
L fantano.
i don&#39;t even understand how you thought some of these lyrics were bad tf
he jus didnt see the vision. das ok
calling Deepfake an &quot;earsore&quot; might be his worst take of all time lol
I would argue that Brakence&#39;s lyrics are part of what makes this record great- it&#39;s not just blatant narcissism, but a reflection on his struggles with a personality flaw. It makes the song more appealing to be centered around an imperfect narrator. Also, i interperet &#39;venus flytrap&#39; completely differently: it&#39;s not about an infatuation, but rather about someone who is obsessed with him and wont let him go.<br><br>this is like my favorite album. 10/10
A man in his 30s, (maybe 40s), calling lyrics from a 20 year old&#39;s album &quot;cringe&quot; is probably just a sign you&#39;re getting old Melon. Especially when there&#39;s this many comments disagreeing with you. I think you need to revisit this with different goggles.
happy to look at all the brakence enjoyers make mental gymnastics to defend the utterly shit lyrics on the album :)
LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
Simply put. This is a bad take and contradicting at every corner. 8.5/ 10
lmfao i love it. Everytime something like this gets reviewed its &quot;man I like your takes quite often, but you are wrong on this&quot; bahahaha greatest music reviewer until he shits on your awful taste huh?
lmao this review got yall kids mad af huh? hahaha valorant music. lmao tik tok music
nah
Such a wierd thing thing to get hung up on tbh, like, paying zero attention to lyrics I think this album at least deserves like a 7 or an 8 and even if I hate the lyrics of an album they are not gonna make me think its 2-3 points worse unless they make it clear that the artist is a massive piece of shit which, even with very uncharitable interpretations of the lyrics, Brakence isn&#39;t (maybe a bit annoying to hang out with but like some irl villain)
I kinda agree with Fantano. Dont get me wrong its a good album but the whole album is somewhat forgettable. I like brakence but damn all these breaks before releasing songs is so fucking LAME. Like Jon Bellion does the same thing and i think thats what leads to the projects feeling forgettable. I get tired of listening to the same songs over and over again that i force myself to forget them as an artist lol 😂
not understanding the personality issues being expressed thru this album that center around a juxtaposed or horseshoe&#39;d self esteem is wild. <br>also track three is about sexual coercion. <br><br><br><br>listen to the whole album again.
honestly the obnoxiously self absorbed lyrics are, in my opinion, obviously there to critique himself. he pokes fun at his own characteristics and sarcastically brags about it all throughout the album. brakence is obviously not like this, i think this is just his way of expressing his experience with a toxic ego
Hmm, this review seems weirdly personal.
this fool calls himself a music critic?😂
5g not good lyrics?? 🤔
I disagree
Melon trash
This is a 10/10 and it’s not even close to a 9
I dunno man…. You’ve always had pretty good takes but this one’s just off. It’s your channel so it’s your opinion but like as someone who claims to be a music nerd I just don’t get it. The entire album is an ego dissection of a young music star. It’s like an ego death in music form. All the songs transition into the next and have some insane energy I dunno just my take
going in knowing this is a strong 9 album and seeing the fucking 5/10 and wanting to murder this old guy
bro gave guts an 8 and this a 5 💀💀
youre actually an npc
BRAKENCE SLAYS
How can someone that spends their entire time judging music not understand a single thing this album is talking about. Did he not even attempt to read into what the lyrics mean?
Why are you still making videos? Tryna keep up with rent, huh?😭
Bro completely missed the point
too much talk about lyrics, not enough talk about the insane instrumentals
this is my favorite album of 2022, i have never disagreed with this man so much
fantano biggest L this album did things to me
Huge Brakence fan and as one I can agree that while the production is a 10 some of the lyrics are a solid 4 to 5 1/2 for me i still adore this album though
Fantano truly shows his weakness with this review. He is literally creating his own interpretation of the album and then critiquing it based on that. Bro did a straw man fallacy on a music review.
I think you completely misunderstood the point behind the project and the words within the songs. Its definitely about ego and such, but its so much deeper than you are making it out to be. Which is okay, but if you really listen, his telling a very consistent storyline, which is why the transitions are so seemless. Every track runs into the next and it reads off almost like a story without a conclusion. Its very deep and vulnerable and I feel like you aren&#39;t giving him the credit of being an artist, a male one for that matter, being as truthful and real about how he feels as he did. You have to remember that Brakence started making music at 14 and started blowing up at 16-17. He was a kid when it all started, of course his gonna have an ego about it. Thats one huge thing his tryna portray. Personally, i think he has every right to feel like his on top of the world. But it is your opinion and i respect that, i just think you completely misunderstood each track or at least didn&#39;t analyze them well.
This album is almost, if not completely influenced by Randy’s experience using psychedelics as a coping mechanism for his underlying depression, obsession, and anxiety; as well as his inability  to accept himself despite knowing that he is so unique. The music theory and the story that is told throughout the album has many layers. One of which is the experience of a “trip” leading to a point of ego death, acceptance, and finally a major shift in his life. Anyone who has regularly dabbled in these spiritually significant experiences will know exactly what I’m referring to. The production quality and devotion to his craft produced what I firmly believe is one of the most well put together and cohesive albums of 2022 and 2023. Strong 9. I’ve never disagreed with melon more than I do on this, I think he just does not understand the depth of this project. It took 3 years to make… there is a reason for that.
After listening to this album I decided I never wanted to hear brakence ever again. Voice is annoying lyrics are stupid. Fantano is 100% right and honestly should have critiqued harder.
Holy fuck I’m super into this album rn. On repeat over and over. It’s not even slightly getting old. It’s almost like everytime I hear, it gets more and more refreshing
Anthony Fantano SLANDERS Brakence, says he “hates it when white boys get sturdy to white boys”
Yeah Anthony… when I finally meet you in person this is my L for you. I can’t stop listening to this album. Love you tho ❤
bruh
how do you not see the irony in what he’s saying tho??? like i’m so dumbfounded at how people take things so literally lmaoooo do you not get the point of art?? he’s saying these things almost as a way to prove to himself that he’s good enough because he doesn’t feel like he is. how is that lost on so many people?
I think an incredibly overlooked detail here is that Anthony isn’t the age of the artist. This album does an INCREDIBLE job, more so than any other album I’ve ever heard, at reflecting the current culture of our age. IMPORTANT: I AM NOT REFERRING TO TECHNOLOGY ADDICTION. The influence that modern rap has had on social groups in young people cannot be overstated. The narcissism that rap music and culture carries so iconically has been infused into young people everywhere in a similar way that other decades had with popular music for those generations of people. The blatant themes of false confidence facades are very good at painting the picture of growing up in today’s age and how people have idolized rappers to the point of idealization of narcissism. You physically are cringing at the ego trip themes but you’re a massive rap fan? The second thing that this album puts a spotlight on is the unbelievable suicide rate of his age group. I don’t understand how you can just think that it’s not okay to make an album with negative energy and self loathing especially with the honesty that blatantly comes through in the energy and passion that this album comes with. The punk rock influence is unbelievably in your face and the teen rebellion energy is like being 13 years old again and your mom yelling and waving hello to you in front of the whole school. I do think multiple lines in this song are blundered lyrically. However, I think it also adds to the clarity in his confidence and narcissism being truly hollow appearing publicly obvious to everyone except himself. This album was fresh and hearing hyper pop infused with hard rock and punk elements was akin to me hearing skrillex’s aggressive and in your face dubstep for the first time when I was 12. This album is in my top 10 of the decade so far.
you can always judge a persona’s musical intelligence by how important they think lyrics are on songs that are clearly not lyrically-focused
This album needs a re-review
The Lyrics sound cringe coming from you especially because you’re clearly embarrassed by them. But It sounds passionate &amp; emotional when Breakence sings them.. have to disagree with the rating <b>I just recently discovered Breakence btw</b>
when did he use the wombo combo??
THE ENTIRE POINTOF THE ALBUM IS ITS SELFISH ART. ITS A REOCCURING THEME AND YET YOUR COMPLAINING ABOUT IT BEING EGOTISTICAL?
You close read the lyrics like they&#39;re an autobiographical memoir instead of part of a narrative concept album. Pop Lyricism color idealic, &#39;hyper-real&quot; images onto a more sonically focused piece of artwork. Thematically, hypochondriac is giving Joan Didion. And Didion is kinda cringe in fictional narrative engagement of individual and social dynamics where self-aware and self-destructive tendencies proliferate. In short, it&#39;s toxic but socially self-aware and reflexive. Languaging of hypocrisy is not equivocal with reifying it, but a necessary narrative step in its correction.<br>Not everyone has to have a Disney approach to story telling, and the ick-inducing supposition otherwise is kinda problematic. <br>Iz a genre bending good time.<br>🤙🤙
damn he got them dislikes boy
this review still boils my blood. What an ass take
it&#39;s really clear how many bars went over fantanos head
Anthony has never been so far off on a rating lmao
I feel like being emotionally indulgent is kind of the point of art in general. I don&#39;t think that giving him a 5 for doing so is very fair in my opinion. Considering he&#39;s producing and mixing better than honestly like 90% of all the songs going fucking platinum these days, he deserves at least an 8.
this is my favorite album of all time - 10/10
knk skinny emo king olmadığın için anlamamışın albümü
Terrible fucking take jesus christ.
I’ve never been less surprised at a comment section lol. I went to listen to one of his songs and totally get why people would attach to it. Same reason teenagers/early 20 something’s attached to shitty emo back in the day. God is it cringe if you don’t connect to it though. Just listen to the Promise Ring.
A 4 is crazy, ngl Fantano
Melon have a sense of where you are. This review has me gone rn
I see a lot of comments disagreeing with melon but honestly I agree. I know he&#39;s young but the immaturity in the songwriting really takes me out of the album, and mixed with imo some annoying vocal performances just doesng do it for me. Some decent pop beats with mild hyperpop production and emo vocals
I agree with him halfway, i looove this albums melodys, but hes right abt some of those dumb sounding lyrics
Wow you didn’t even show the right lyrics. L opinion, L reasoning, L video. Brakence supremacy. Bloom to death.
Criticizing this album (which is called HYPOCHONDRIAC by the way) because the lyrics were “too self indulgent” is like criticizing GKMC for having too many lyrics about gang culture. I feel like this one went over the melon 😂
I like how in most other genres being egotistical is seen as normal and even impressing thing depending on how it’s presented, but then when it’s in this style of music it’s seen as a big downside… like huh <br><br>This album is amazing in my opinion, especially considering the egotistical stuff here is criticized as well by himself
Anthony plays Elden Ring??&gt;?
true as fuck
This comment section is kind of cringe. Even if you liked the album more than Melon, you simply can&#39;t comprehend that he might have a different opinion about it? And 5/10 isn&#39;t even that low considering he&#39;s always super critical. And no it&#39;s clearly not Aphex Twin or Death Grips ya&#39;ll expected a 9???
This album is fine. Compelling production and sophomoric lyrics. It&#39;s not the first album to embrace such a formula.
Coming back his take on Venus fly trap was pretty bad. He cringes at the chorus lyrics showing “I take it better when she don’t even ask me” and looking at the song  as a whole it’s clear it’s about brakence being in a toxic relationship and the partner possibly touching him without consent? Him saying “I take it better when she don’t even ask” shows how when she does something without his consent, he stays silent, which could be seen as him “taking it better” because he doesn’t say no, but instead doesn’t say anything
Mr. potato head, I’ve never seen anyone misunderstand an album more than this. Please listen to it again for me even if you need to pull up genius. Thank you for your time please don’t ever listen if you don’t get it.
Clearly u dont understand the album at all and this video really shows that lmao
L take
Fantano rips on him when he says things bad for being emo and when he says things good he’s a narc?
Silly stupid guy
Bruh lmao a 5? How? This album is at LEAST a 7. “tHe LyRiCs ArE bAD” yeah, Anthony? Well, you’re bald.
fantano&#39;s so out of touch sometimes :/
sad melon L take
Anthony for someone who claims to be a music nerd, idk how you&#39;re so incredibly obtuse when it comes to understanding certain things in an artistic sense. This isn&#39;t even my favorite Brakence album but jesus christ does the point fly right over your head. What a pretentious review. You very clearly live in a particular bubble.
This is such a good reminder that Fantano makes mistakes &lt;3
This not it
The start of hypochondriac is more of a poke at ego centric artists who think they are above everyone when they are literally just a fucking person who has a different job than most people. (From what I know lol)
The lyrics are very intentional and are geared to a specific audience that will be able to relate to them. They&#39;re good, but only if you come from a similar place of understanding or have a great deal of ability to empathize with the character depicted.
Dang this review is just nuts. Dude really just raw-dogged brakence for like 8 whole minutes on his lyrics. Personally I like his lyrics. And I can see why some people may not. However this review feels really personally biased in that he’s genuinely laughing at brakence’s lyrics and mocking its vibe because the reviewer thinks he is “above” it.<br>Theres wayyyy more to this album than the couple of bars that werent A+. Lets talk about the S-tier qualities in his art as well?
great review imo, still like the album
The lyrics fit the theme of the album imo think you harped on it a lil too much 🤷‍♀️
The ego pop bars are mostly doubles and triples about popping LSD and experiencing ego death
L
Agree although 5/10 is a bit harsh, insane production and vocals but some of his lyrics are definitely corny and out of place
10/10 I love this album :)
Bro did NOT get it
i’ve been listening to Brakence since 2016 and you obviously have no fucking clue what you’re talking about when it comes to him lmaoo
I think he forgot to listen to the songs and just read the lyrics
i fucking loved it , but hypocondriac should have been megalomania xD THATS MY VIBE THO
interesting that when he finally reviews brakence he misinterprets the lyrics at every turn and allows that to pull it down to a 5/10 smh
Extremely common fat steaming Fantano L
Cannot believe you just called deepfake an ear sore. You were complaining about the lyrics the entire time. Maybe you’re the cry baby here. Maybe you should man up and acknowledge that the genius production completely trumps any lyrics (which are mostly good by the way, once again you are just being a baby about it)
The main word I&#39;d use to describe this album would probably be &quot;Interesting&quot;, From a musical standpoint atleast. The fusion of Midwest Emo and Hip Hop with Glitchy production is honestly fascinating, And I would be quite interested to hear more similar stuff, But at the same time I don&#39;t really want to listen to much, If any, Of the album again, Mainly just because of the vocals, I&#39;m not quite sure what it is about them, But I find them anywhere from annoying to unbearable throughout most of the album. There were a few tracks or parts of tracks where I like how it sounds, The last minute or so of &quot;Caffeine&quot; for example, Or the &quot;Album Refrain&quot; I guess you&#39;d call it (&quot;Hypochondriac, I think of you, blood pressure spikes I&#39;ll have a heart attack&quot;), But if there&#39;s only ~3 songs where the vocals do not annoy me enough to want to turn it off, On a 13 track album, That&#39;s not exactly a good sign. I&#39;d also probably give it a light five, Although I&#39;m interested to see what he does in the future, He definitely seems talented so it&#39;s quite possible he could put out something I love in the future.
Wait is that how Brakence is pronounced? I&#39;ve been putting more emphasis on the &#39;-ence&#39; part.
Fantano really isn’t getting this album at all. I appreciate constructive criticism but overall this is an L for fantano
how is it 2023 and ppl still bashing someone for an opinion (that they willingly and knowingly decided to listen to) 😭bro doesn’t like an album as much as you so what☠️
wow massive L what the f ck
L OPINION
Fantanos biggest L of all time
i love the math rock sections on this album a ton ngl. and his vocals are super good
This is a 10/10 album to me
Hearing you shit on argyle made me so pissed…have some respect. Takes balls to do that
May not have it lyrically all the time. But he got something going and I’m addicted
A lot of your takes objectively don&#39;t make sense here, especially your critique of emotional release.
I honestly don’t know how you can’t just realize he produced all the music and made the beats… <br><br>He’s battling the ego “glitch sound” and wants to continue his career and evolve into a bigger artist but the glitch sound is taking over. It’s a progression throughout the project. Reason the last song is mostly that natural tone.
Brakence is the goat. Stop it
you&#39;re wrong
Gotta emphasize the L in meLon for this take
Its crazy how Fantano and Fantano meatriders write this off about an album that&#39;s just about some kid bragging, one song is directly about suicide and another about sexual assault. No clue why y&#39;all choose to ignore different interpretations of lyrics here.
This album is objectively great musically and this guy is focused on his personality?
yeah, you need a MRI scan becuase u gotta be braindead for such a stupid take
I already know im going to disagree with this take
no
one of the worst videos ive ever watched. havent cringed this hard since 2012<br><br>worst take ever 💀
bro how is caffeine least fav track 😭
Album of the year hated it
Melon man literally is so out of touch
I mean everyone’s entitled to their opinions, for me this is probably the best album I’ve ever heard. I think regardless of how healthy it is to talk about yourself in the way brakence did  doesn’t really matter when it comes to the overall product he made. The only song on the album I tend to skip is preparation just bc I don’t like the hook that much but I still tolerate it most of the time. I also think the final song of the album is beautiful and I’m surprised he didn’t even mention it.
idc man &quot;and baby you can love me but i&#39;m not fazed / i&#39;m straight flushed with poker on my face&quot; is an absolute bar
it would be better without any lyrics
damn. you ripped into this dude. while i can agree that some of the lyricism is sometimes a loss for me, the album as a whole deserves more than a five. for the intricacy of the production alone the album scores so much higher. im a big fan of midwest emo primarily because of the beautiful guitar riffs. midwest emo has kinda died out and the musicality has evolved into math rock, but this album felt like new age midwest emo. taking sounds and feelings reminiscent of that genre and airing them out in a new way. i was pleased with it and think you kinda let some of the weaker lyrics on it have a little too much sway in the final rating. but i suppose its as you said. different strokes for different folks.
wow.. 3.4k likes and 4.7k dislikes. Thats crazy, why would anyone leave that many dislikes?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>You should leave more this album is a masterpiece. L re-view. Brakence&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
Holyyy L broo
disrespectful by giving it only a 5, personally the album was a masterpiece with maybe one or two songs that are misses.
Totally disagree with moth of his criticism of the lyrics, but when he said &quot;where we just experiencing this angry emo boy simulation the entire time?&quot; my energy drink came out my nose
I guess we all have bad music taste that’s crazy
This album is an 11 you can’t change my mind
What&#39;s frustrating is that you portray yourself as someone that takes seriously how they consume music, yet you did not give any evidence that you actually listened to this album. To a trained ear, the words on this album, no matter how objectively immature (written by a 21 year old btw) fall by the wayside. If all you hear when you listen to this is lyrics, you are really not listening.
dang you guys like his reviews? i thought he was supposed to be a relatively accurate reviewer
It’s really bad
This the funniest shit I’ve ever seen. You misinterpreted legit all the songs on the LP and the point of the LP itself<br><br>I’m 2 months late to this video and hadn’t ever really watched your stuff in general, but this is clearly the most unbiased shit going and a pretty strong argument from continuing to not watching your stuff<br><br>It’s cool to not like this type of music OG, but don’t treat this like you’re some unbiased reviewer when you clearly ain’t 😭
This album is really good dummy
L
You have never been a scary teen with superrpowers before?
Have to say I agree with most of the comments here... giving it a 5 isn&#39;t a big deal to me, but your takeaways from the album show just how disconnected you are from this mindset and art style. We agree, the production is dope, the vocal performance is amazing, though the transitions can be a bit jarring, but the lyrical content.... This is prob the biggest Fantano L I&#39;ve seen. The whole album is about struggling with self awareness, going from extremes of self hatred to extremes of ego. It&#39;s not supposed to be self aware. That&#39;s why it&#39;s gold. You have lines where both extremes, ego and self hate, are exaggerated. It&#39;s supposed to be like that. As someone that traditionally listens to a lot of metal, this is the first of this genre that I&#39;ve really been able to connect with, because it&#39;s extreme for the sake of being extreme. <br><br>A 21 year old&#39;s deepest fears, delusions of grandiose, and bitter afterthoughts aren&#39;t supposed to sound normal and logical to someone more mature reading them off a screen. Music is about context. Imagine if you took this kind of logical interpretation to the lyrics of a band like Knocked Loose or even Morbid Angel... no shit it doesn&#39;t work lol - they aren&#39;t trying to be empathic or logical, they&#39;re trying to express themselves. It&#39;s called having feelings, not thinkings.
dude I literally love this style of music but it&#39;s always made by the most lame people on the entire globe. every time introvert plays I physically cringe, but I can&#39;t ever skip it. &quot;when you replay this song,&quot; jesus christ shut the fuck up please
Totally missed the ball on this one melon…wow
No
Clicked on this just to comment and say who cares what this jamoch thinks
I was interested in the production on this album, but I couldn&#39;t finish listening to a song.
this is the biggest misunderstanding of an album that is an amazing representation of being young and mentally ill. <br><br>the recognition of having an ego but also saying that it’s bad is a normal mindset to have. there are plenty of things that we as humans do while recognizing it isn’t healthy. trying to pretend that brakence is any different is where the flaws in this review come out.
L
I completely disagree, this album was amazing. I wish you wouldn&#39;t try singing anything it sounds awful.
I mean did he really rated mansion musik and this masterpiece the same
Common melon L
when you were reacting to venus fly trap your chat made me cringe
With respect, I think you may have missed the point on this one. @theneedledrop
Don&#39;t really get how Fantano can think Hobo Johnson &quot;The fall of Hobo Johnson&quot; a 8/10 (I also think so). Even though it has some really cringeworthy parts he can truly understand what the album means. This album has a similar layout but I guess his brain shrunk while reviewing this because I really don&#39;t think it should be so difficult to understand what this album is about.
The ego shit is intentional. Even the corny bars slap. This album bangs. <br><br>If you&#39;re cringing at the lyrics, it just wasn&#39;t written for you, and that&#39;s ok. The shit connects with young people
L
Mannnn, melon this one really went over your head
This is a Fantano L
coming back to this review after 2 months, he&#39;s still so damn wrong WOW, did he actually listen to this tape man
Another L
This album felt like watching a skinny kid going all out and performing a never-ending combo stack on his opponent.<br><br>I freaking love this album man
The fact that you just rated it below even a 7 is BAFFLING. If you knew anything about A&amp;R especially in the underground music scene, you&#39;d know this guy carries the hyper pop genre on his back. Was an extremely experimental album and even still did more numbers than any other release in the past 6 months in that genre.
this album is like a strong 9/10 😭
coming back to this makes me realize how awful this take really was
there is 4.4k dislikes on this video
Brakence is king can’t change my mind
Mans made an album about how the success he experienced during the pandemic gave him an ego trip and how he handled it, and fantano said, well, he is narcissistic and egotistical
Review lekkerboy by sticky fingers. 8/10
you read way too far into lyrics. the lyrics are quite literally only 20 percent of the music
Wasn’t the entire point of this album for brakence to point out that his ego is getting out of hand and he’s finding ways to handle it through more toxic habits like internet addiction and hopeless romanticism?
bro literally didn’t understand this album at all?????????? lmao what
I&#39;ve learned to never trust Anthony&#39;s opinions. This review was just another reason why
worst take on this whole channel. jus sayin
L take melon
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iirPux8sPGA&amp;t=150">2:30</a> I disagree with melon I’m almost positive this was self aware, just as this whole album is
Damn bro u missed hard
I’m 38 years old. I hard disagree. I feel like he’s doing his best to get out that shitty post adolescence we all face and also acknowledge it the best he can. This is a Hard 9 for me.
I love this dude&#39;s vocals so much. They&#39;re so unique and nice to listen to. The production was also crazy good. I got a lot of goosebumps from this album.<br><br>I also really don&#39;t care about lyrics that much, although I did cringe a few times from them. But hey, the kid&#39;s 20, he has a lot of room to mature, and I&#39;m sure he will
worst take of all time
meh this review aint it chief.
deepfake and hypochondriac are actually some of my favorite songs in a while, venus fly trap cbd were really good singles, and I love the alternative vibe on intellectual greed and stung. I really dont like the autotune on his voice on 5g and a small part on bugging!, its actually really grating and idk why he did it when his voice is already pretty good. The production and flow of the songs is so good and I love how the songs evolve and change as you listen, especially on deepfake.
Take it easy fantano this is a post modern king dude
Take it easy dude he’s only 21 or soemthing
ANOTHER HORRIBLE RATING OF A GOOD ALBUM STOP COOKING 🔥🔥🔥🔥
the comments say everything. I get some of F&#39;s crtiscisms but its boomer (milennial) brain. The kid has got it. just enjoy the ride
This is really passionate art and you can tell he put a lot of time into every single detail ❤
If the rating he gave isnt infuriating enough, the fact he thinks Caffeine is the worst song is like a cherry-on-top of frustration
Btw you click ctrl alt delete specifically to check the temperature and state of the computer. Low key that’s a fire line.
I downloaded the &quot;return youtube dislikes&quot; extension just now, specifically for this video.<br><br>You missed the entire point.
I agree with your views on ego and mental health
Its a great album, but I get being well into adulthood, where emotional issues are dwarfed by overwhelming responsibility, its hard to relate with a 20yo raised in the internet maze. It feels confused because the generation is confused.
Damn this might be the biggest L Fantano has ever taken
without a doubt the best album of the year
I don’t agree with him as far as production goes, but songwriting yeah, those bars are kinda embarrassing lol
Damn, just glossing over the best song in 5g
I expected Fantano to give it a light 7 tbh.
Anthony is objectively wrong on his opinion of caffeine. That song is exactly what it promises in the title. It&#39;s super upbeat and exhilarating and features some sick rhyming patterns. I&#39;ll admit that maybe some of the lyrics in this album can be a bit corny but god is it a vibe start to finish!
Brakence is at his best when he steps off the ego and lets the song be itself, just completely consumed in the vibe and concept. That or he self-deprecates without it being a backhanded brag.<br>Wonder why I love 5g? Well, mostly it’s production, vocals, and composition is fantastic, but also because he realistically self-deprecates and actually talks about other things but himself.
Bad, not fierce, lacking sickening opinions. Brakence &gt; Melon
Go to talk to your fuckin buddy Andrew Callaghan again. Went completely over his head, fantano has been a turd for a long time. What ppl are saying about Venus fly trap is very true, to say that&#39;s a romance song is wild. It&#39;s about sexual assault.  Whole album slaps. I just think dudes like him don&#39;t have any empathy abt queer folk. I hope brakence is ok that shit is very sad
Sometimes music needs to be listened to before looking at the lyrics I always just listen first
I love this album
Im still salty
bad take
I have so much of an issue with how much you want to comment about his emotions. Whether they are healthy? Since when does music have to have healthy emotions? He’s not doing this for the fame. He literally says that. He is just releasing all these emotions. Try actually being mentally ill and then understand why he is so woe is me. You have done a brilliant job of shitting on a young adult for being a young adult. You acknowledge the production is amazing and then are mad he’s not singing about the stuff that you relate to lmao. This is one of the best albums I’ve ever heard. Be so fr.
You’re being a dad Melon and its adorable. Just don’t get the belt please ):
This review is a shame, A new Choker album should be coming soon, hopefully he likes it more than this :/
5/10???? Even if the lyrics were as bad as he was talking about this still wouldn&#39;t be a 5/10. The vocals, melodies, song transitions and the uniqueness make it at least an 8/10 how tf do you review so many albums and still have no idea what you&#39;re talking about
Ltano
Not everything emotional is cringe, melon.
I mean, he&#39;s young, and like you said the production is really good. It seems you are looking for a more developed mind and self-image out of brakence, but to me it seems he just kinda writes what he thinks? It&#39;s just expression for him, and also probably isnt all meant to be analyzed. Like maybe he is just looking for something that sounds good and fits his production, and you are frustrated with his persona that he portrays through his music. I think a lot of people resonate with his probably unhealthy outlook revealed through this music. Just because you do not relate to his mindset in this album, doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t real for him.
To everyone rippin Anthony open, he has to listen to music and then review it, the repeat the cycle for an entirely different album he has to have an efficient way of going through music, he cant analyze everything to the degree we can when we have time to listen on repeat. He has to listen to get shit done. Then move on to the next video hes gonna make, which is editing, having actually listened to the music, analyzing the lyrics on SOME level, and then moving on. The depth at which he goes into it depends on what seems appropriate for the video. Brakence is better in my opinion than most glitch artists, but Aldn is heat too, although sometimes his music sounds like COIN almost, another good group. But we have to be fair to Fantano. Whos also done an extreme amount of work to be where he is, to question why someones ego would pop when Brakence SURELY knows like many of us internet fame can fizzle QUICK. To be so self aware but somehow miss how fleeting fame can be is to be self aware enough to realize HAVING that ego is not what youre used to because you hadent gotten recognized on this level yet, but as Fantano said, he doesnt CHANGE that seemingly. However, a comment youll just have to find yourself here, states an explanation for the album and it seems spot on. For US to analyze thatis different, we dont have a reason we just wanted to. Fantano has other shit to do lol I doubt he dislikes brakence or his personality, having never met him, but Fantano having also done crazy work to get here, isnt out of place to ask why his ego would pop when his fame easily could just as quickly as it came. I dont think Fantano is unfair or anything like that, i think he has other things to do, other videos to make, so more albums to listen to, some of which align more with how he may see things so he can explain better and more in depth and it seems like he put far more time into analyzing one album over another when one simply conveys itself more to him as the listener. Music is subjective and while id say Anthony maybe missed the point of the album, its also new, and glitch hop probably isnt the genre of music he regularly would enjoy. Give the guy a break lol
Brakence only has one song i dont like as much as the others on the album and its Preparation, the chorus is TOO repetitive. Otherwise, i heard Argyle a while ago, saw CBD same day it was uploaded, saw Venus Fly Trap same day it was uploaded, but before that stuff, i listen to Punk2 which i found by ACCIDENT i stumbled upon Overcast, the youtube channel by clicking something i didnt mean to and found him. A lot of people dont like his voice breaking that ive shown. Not his falsetto but that emo voice thing. I like brakences voice it sounds like his voice is really breaking because he has a husky voice as you stated, whereas say Glaive, in my personal favorite song by him three wheels, ESPECIALLY in the beginning lines, his voice &quot;breaking&quot; isnt, its very easy to tell hes TRYING to make his voice do that and his singing in that portion specifically is also very....deliberate feeling. Robotic sadness. Its clearly meant to be emotional, but its done with a formula so feels less real. MANY artists have this issue, but Brakence it comes off normal it never feels forced. IVe actually been practicing to BRakence music to sing better because how he handles his lower voice register, i couldnt use vibrato or it was the ONLY time i could, but i have a much better handle on it now. I can also go into head voice and falsetto MUCH easier from a regular singing voice because his editing and effects. Since i love doing harsh vocals, being able to control my voice to go from a regular tone to a head voice makes it MUCH easier to scream as well. Brakence just happens to had been a huge help, and that just happened to almost rhyme.
really crazy to see him just fully not get it
weak review big L
big L from you
I disagree with you melon
6.38 is a drain reference mr melon u melon.
W review
5 is WILD
the biggest L of 2022 was this opinion.
I always took his &quot;egotistical&quot; lyrics as sarcastic or non-serious. hmm. strange
When I first got into brakence my first thought was &quot;this sounds like if Juice and Post were ghost writers for EDEN&quot;. However with this album i really feel like he&#39;s really coming into himself and I very little of it reminds me of something I&#39;ve heard before. Yes there are some weaker bars that have that same old Juice and Post quality, but not nearly as much as before and his delivery almost completely sells it.<br><br>I should mention I love Juice and Post. I just think that their weaker bars have a lot of common with breakence&#39;s weaker bars with the weird, seemingly irrelevant references out of left field and some bars feeling self-contradictory.
Idk man. It’s all opinion and shit but Brakence scratch’s something in my brain that feels so good. Best album of the year for me
Damn the amount of people mad at Anthony for this one... I do agree he missed the mark a bit but that&#39;s my opinion, that&#39;s his opinion, opinions forever.
Hold up. Come on now, that Elden Ring bar was cold af... That game really is Satan themselves.
How many times do we have to teach you this lesson old man?
i hate taking lyrics out of context. I think every lyric from any emo song would sound kinda cringe if it was melon that was reading it like that
idc if it’s rated a 5, for me it’s a 10.
This is fantanos 2020s MBDTF review
music is objective, why do we need critics? Decide for yourself if the album is good. No amount of analyzation can determine the appeal of art.
lyrics are a tad corny but i still like it if yk what i mean (like, im at an age where its kinda tiring thinking about what hes singing about to some extent lol), but i do know brackence can WRITE write as well. really its the sound hes made in this album that sells it for me. a lot of emo songs are like that anyway lmao but its the sound we&#39;re after<br><br>its really nice, blends a few of my fave genres ive been repeating (a bit of midwest emo with math rock riffs and the overprocedsing of digicore and/or hyperpop). its not new but hes rlt coherent here (maybe it helps that he made each track transition well with each other). his voice is also good here too and it rlt helps his songs
lcd soundsystem sweater looking good on you my man
I love this album. I can&#39;t believe I have been sleeping on brakence this long. I like the lyrics too. But maybe bc I am more his age than you? Like maybe it&#39;s this teen angst thing I am still into- sometimes ironically, sometimes pathetically honest.
L take
Wow. I disagree with your reviews sometimes, but I can at least understand and sympathize with why you dislike what I like, or like what I don&#39;t. But this really, REALLY ain&#39;t it. You absolutely did not give this album a fair chance and your analysis of the lyrics could not have been more biased, let alone false. The entire album to me is a story about his falsified ego and overconfidence falling apart before our eyes, catalyzed by internet-induced anxiety and depression. <br><br>While you think that&#39;s egotistical and cringe writing, it&#39;s an undeniably huge part of the experience for a lot of teenagers/young adults in this day and age. I get that&#39;s a lens you&#39;re not equipped with, but it genuinely feels like you put no effort into trying to understand why people vibe with this album the way they do. Obviously I don&#39;t want you to change your opinion, if you don&#39;t vibe with it then that&#39;s fine. But I think it&#39;s important to understand why the lyrics are written and constructed the way they are before blanketing them all as ramblings of an egotistical narcissist.
this one just made me really really sad as this album was the most impactful album i&#39;ve ever experienced.. never disagreed with fantano so hard. the last 3 songs (deepfake, introvert, hypochondriac) have been the hardest hitting songs i&#39;ve honestly ever heard. can&#39;t believe how many insulting words were thrown around in this review :(
Pretty hilarious how he pretty much focuses his entire critique on brakence “ego”(clearly missing the whole point of his ego trip throughout the album(must have skipped deepfake)) when he’s like the most egotistical music critic out there.<br><br>Bro just looked at this album from the perspective that Brakence needs to earn his place in the music industry before expressing and diving into his narcissism and egotism in an extraordinarily personal and open way. Brakence is not allowed to touch on his selfishness and his own experience in his lyrics until he’s earned his place.<br><br>Which is just a projection of his ego 😭<br><br>Never heard of a review with such bias before. Not looking at this project with a clear mind that’s clear of opinions. <br><br>Baldie clearly didn’t like brakences ego from previous works and allowed that to cloud his judgment rather than staying open-minded to the project so he could understand the theme of his ego and narcissism and his purpose of incorporating them into this album.
ok what about sam gellaitrys new album
Wow. Disagree.
fantano&#39;s straight up wrong on this one
the narcissism in the lyrics is the point tho right? its a kid making music, got some fame and hes coping with the overwhelming sense of narcissism, i dont see why this is negative
I love this album but I can definitely see where he is coming from on this review so I respect the take!
A light 5 is INSANE. one of the top records dropped this year easily
HE SAID IT RIGHT!!
wait this was barely an album review tho?? this was just a lyrics review...
This is one of the only reviews I really don’t agree with that bugs me. This album is fantasticccc
Holy shit Fantano... How old are you man.?  I think you&#39;re an amazing critic, but I think there&#39;s a little more than &quot;critique&quot; going on here, Anthony... Brakence, I believe is TRULY our generation&#39;s Cobain. You&#39;re fans agree it looks like from these comments. Yeah I think you missed the message on this album. But it&#39;s because Brakence isn&#39;t even 21. You just don&#39;t get it, because youre old,  and it&#39;ll happen to this generation too. This album however, is a fucking MASTERPIECE. And I think your fans agree
I love you man, You&#39;re an awesome critic but you have horrible taste. That&#39;s why you weren&#39;t a musician since you&#39;re clearly passionate AF. I however respect tf out of you, Fantano. Music needs a Devil&#39;s Advocate.
I still remember One of fantanos viewers on his stream said &quot;this guy cant sing for shit&quot; something like that
I think melon focuses too much on lyrical content in this review. It&#39;s obvious to any listener that lyrical content is not brakence&#39;s strongest quality. Anyone with an appreciation for electronic music, however, should agree that the production on this album is innovating an incredibly well fleshed out and unique style that is not adequately recreated by anyone else out there right now. brakence&#39;s production and vocal performances carry this record to an easy eight for me, with the lyrical content keeping it from going much higher.
I think you&#39;re a bit of a silly billy for this one Anthony
Bad take bro 😤
Art is subjective but lmfao this is a 10/10
Cringe take
Melon stop being unrelatable
i love how everyone agrees on this being an L take
Good honest review. The dislike ratio make me feel like in todays world(and going forward) the &quot;stans&quot; from twitter and soundcloud will always come over to Youtube and get mad at anyone critiquing their idol. Toxic and immature parasocial relationships are becoming horrible for....everything(music, art, politics, podcasts, social media etc) and are seemingly getting worse each day. What future are we even in for?
I think this record looks a lot different if you consider for even one second that brakence actually is the greatest
i do love the way he transitions from each song especially with buggin&#39; and caffeine all tho being an acquired taste its satisfying to hear i think
Anthony I&#39;ve always been a huge fan of you but this is your worst opinion. It&#39;s absolutely 100% extremely completely wrong.
rare anthony L
Fr do you every think you’re more critical of lyrics based on the genre of music? I know for a fact there’s been far more braggadocios lyrics in hip hop for instance that you will see no issue with, but here it’s viewed differently
Ngl this album easy 8 at least, new sounds to pop which is pretty cool
👍
Unpopular take but I definitely agree with melon, yet, he is still a teen, he will write like a teen. This is just an expression of his young and naive view through his troubled perception of the world
Melon how do you even screw up the Elden Ring bar. It’s like you put your best foot forward to hate. The dude said “fighting for my will like the ring is Elden.” In the game you are doing the bidding of the “greater will” when killing anything or completing any tasks. Essentially your actions aren’t your own throughout the game. At points you can go against the greater will but there is still an extended period of time where you are under the influence. Don’t comment on shit that you have 0 knowledge of as if it’s fact.
Yo this is a concept album, the first few tracks paint the image of the ego facade which hides serious mental illness, this album is designed to be a glimpse into how his mind has been operating
don&#39;t agree branthony, but i was a little bummed when i realized the nike line was about the brand and not the goddess
L
I am just mad that my prediction for this video was a strong 5... instead you gave it a light 5....
huge L take
Nah, this ain&#39;t it. Venus Fly Trap is song of the year and you can&#39;t change my mind.
finally someone agrees with me
The aphex comment got me some of these beats got me going like damn he taking the aphex direction when I heard em I think you the one who off melon
brakence could record an album just singing the alphabet and id still bump that shit
bro this album should at least be an 8
I’d say 7
I totally agree about the lyrics being a little cringe, but omfg I cannot disagree more about which tracks stand out. CBD is unironically one of the worst song I have heard this year. Meanwhile, 5g is arguably one of the better tracks this album has. idk, I just felt like this review definitely missed the actual enjoyment of the songs. Sure CBD might be technically impressive, but it just feels awful to listen to. idk tho i dont know anything
He’s literally not even 21 why we’re you expecting him to stretch the dictionary like a philosopher? Lyrics are corny sometimes but he’s basically a kid. Album is 10/10 L take
I haven&#39;t even listened to the album, but those lyrics he talked about are BRUTALLY bad. I mean like, brutally bad. I may pass on this one if that&#39;s the lyrics being given here.
&quot;i found that me, god, and the devil are all one in the same&quot; the most woke bar ive ever heard buy yall aint ready for that
Can you review Herbert soon?
Fantano’s ego is not eradicated
I connected with deepfake&#39;s vocals like crazy, but I guess everything has to be self-deprecating or an objective analysis of society for fantano to like it.
Damn Anthony throwing some serious shade..what did Brakence ever do to you??
This is the kinda shit mac was talking about when he said good news is all they want to hear. &quot;The music and genre mixing is amazing but he&#39;s toxic&quot;. Classic  out of touch old man. Its okay to not be okay, music like this makes the people in my generation not feel alone. @theneedledrop your the only one with no self awareness
Ive been watching breakence since hypnagogia and constantly use his music to cry to. I get a bit of extictinatal dread auite often and i get a place to vent it. I think he has alot going on internally and it makes since that most of his projects are eclectic. I digress good noises ,gay, and ill keep listening for a long while
W album L Fantano
how i took is that he was telling a story of an him getting over a breakup in a toxic relationship cuz in bugging he was basically just explaining that he got in said relationship and now he&#39;s sad cuz he broke up and he&#39;s trying to figure out how to get over them and if they are also hurt from the breakup (i use they/them pronouns because he says girl and man a lot so idk if it&#39;s a girl or guy). in caffeine he&#39;s just trying to get over it by being angry and cocky acting like nothing&#39;s wrong and venus fly trap is is him realizing the relationship was toxic. teeth is about how he&#39;s coping with everything using drugs and doing whatever he can to get over them. intellectual green seems like it&#39;s him finding out absolutely everything his ex did and getting hurt even more and that&#39;s when the voice that was telling him to listen to her in venus fly trap finally fully got his attention and is going to start basically manipulating him cuz thats when her voice stops having the parenthesis around them in the lyrics (if he has any control over that). 5g (my favorite song on the album) sounds like it&#39;s about how he was taken over by the voice and became numb to the point that he lost all motivation. preparation is him going crazy and how he doesn&#39;t care anymore. cbd (another amazing track) is about how he&#39;s using cbd and about how he still doesn&#39;t care about his ex anymore or something. stung is him thinking he&#39;s better off dead. Argyle is him trying to say he&#39;s entirely over his ex even though it doesn&#39;t seem like he really is then it ends with him repeating that he just wants to be dead, giving into the voice from before i think. deepfake is him kinda realizing how bad he&#39;s gotten saying stuff like &quot;I can&#39;t help but picture my life ending in a month&quot; &quot;Now I&#39;m hardly copin&#39;, I don&#39;t know how much more I can take&quot; &quot;&#39;Cause my whole personality&#39;s fake&quot; like he doesn&#39;t recognize himself anymore and wants to not have to deal with this version of himself because then he says &quot;And I want someone else in my place That feels so much better, I&#39;ll settle for now An endeavor to die or create&quot; which probably means the only thing keeping him back from dying is the fact that he likes making music. Introvert is kinda like his final farewell and when he was &quot;eradicated&quot; is when it he actually committed sewer side because after that it seems like he&#39;s basically saying &quot;i did it bitch, you happy?&quot; and the last song is just him saying he had used up all of his love in that relationship and he regretted it.<br><br>im could just be looking too far into it because i like looking into this kinda stuff in albums after quadeca&#39;s last 2 albums but it makes it more interesting to look at this album this way.
Mid lyrics here and there CAN ruin an album, however with the story being told and the insane production, its gonna have to be a 8/10
Should have been a 2/10. Vocals are hella annoying
Tony brings up excellent points, and yet this album grabbed me fully. It is a beautiful mess, and I think the self-loathing and egotism expressed is a genuine artistic statement. It&#39;s kinda cringe, but also beautiful and relatable to me. <br>Also Tony, you liked Hobo Johnson so you got no room to talk about overwrought lyrics ruining a project
I appreciate the fact that melon would review smaller artists like Brakence but I find it very disingenuous when the only critique for the most part is<br><br>&quot;Glitches aren&#39;t for me, why he so sad, me no like sad music&quot;<br><br>This is probably my favorite project to come out before the year ends, 9/10
Anthony wrong
bro is insanely stupid you cant hit the snobbery and also become kinda famous like ma boy did there, you clearly didnt understand the album, this album is about the duality from brakence and randy and thats the reason why he hits the ego trip so hard and later become soft, he talks about his ego poping because all of the facade of the gigantical ego from brakence deflates from argyle to the last song, thats why he says that his ego deflates on deepfake or the message of brakence has been eliminated, because he got rid of that ego on the last part, i mean come on even the album makes the ilution of two beings coexisting in one picture, a dwarf (brakence) and randy and thats why the picture is so blurry bro, like the line from both is barely existing. you have to be too short minded to not understand not only that but the level of production and the sound design
I agree with Fantano
The &quot;just do it, nike&quot; bar is totally a tongue-in-cheek bladee reference
this is your worst take of all time. 10/10 project. faded
Terrible take
Isn&#39;t a lot of great emo really cheesy? That&#39;s how I excuse it. I like this album.
The fact you didn’t give this a 10 is simply disappointing. This album was a work of art. Don’t think you can do him like that 🙄
Can the people in the comments chill, he gave it a five not a 1
completely and utterly disagree
Holy shit u couldn&#39;t be more wrong. I used to hold ur opinion in high regard but not anymore. This is so wrong.
Preach Fant, preach
L take, 9/10 album
Feel like argyle describes depression pretty well actually he doesn&#39;t wanna push that person away but he&#39;s so stuck in his own world that he can&#39;t help it and the lyrics portray him dramatically pushing everyone around him away perfectly. It&#39;s a very desperate point in the album and I think the lyrics even push the audience away idk it does have some cringe lyrics in the mix but good song melon just missed the point
Homie is criticizing a 20 year olds lyrics
fat L for Fantano, this wasn’t it cheif 😕
Mans stamped the boomer pass with this one
i feel like the focus on his goofy lyrics really undersells the production on this album its the best ive heard all year
Venus flytrap is my new favorite jam currently.
So I don’t feel the same as Anthony but I can not help but just feel like hypochondriac just “exists”. I think the production is awesome a lot of the time, and there are only a couple lyrics (like the elden ring reference) that I kinda don’t vibe with, but I just can’t say much that’s negative about it, and yet it just does not connect with me. I’m gonna be on my 5th and 6th listen today, but so far it seems like music I would jam to but only, ONLY if my friend put it on
On teeth it is not &quot;fighting for my life like the ring is elden,&quot; it&#39;s &quot;fighting for my will&quot;, which makes it a much better double entendre because in Elden Ring you fight for a deity called The Greater Will.
dang u off on this one
I don&#39;t understand why so many comments think Anthony is too hard here. I am the biggest emo fanboi and even I hate how selfish and borderline abusive a lot of the lyrics in the genre are. And while brakence obviously isn&#39;t straight up emo his lyrics have exactly that feel to it.<br>Yes, the record has some absolute bangers and interesting ideas. But they&#39;re not that completely groundbreaking that the lyrics can just be ignored or chalked up to him being young.
This is such an unbelievably stupid take lol. If you want me to expand, the comment section did it for me(:
I&#39;ve been a brakence fan for years now since dropout, following all his new releases. You are completely right about this album, I love a lot of the songs but the lyrics sometimes are downright cringe to the point where I mute the song for the bad lyrics. Caffeine is my favorite on the album, but the &quot;I came to vibe, bet he just wanted to dap me up&quot; line I can not listen to.
Sorry but L take
brakence so mid, perfect score for him
This man is always so trash
L
I try to hear this guy out on all his reviews but he has a lot of L’s in my opinion
How y&#39;all gonna be mad your artist has terrible lyrics 😂
the only point I can really agree with here is that some of the lyrics are goofy. the elden ring and nike lines especially
This how u know hes becoming old and out of touch
Album of the year 🎉
W
what
I don’t believe he actually enjoys listening to music. This album just tickles a part of my brain, i could tune out all the lyrics and have a great time.
Hard to watch Fantano complain about some cringe lyrics when Fantano is the lord of cringe himself
This was a terrible take, Hypochondriac is the AOTY for me
L take from a source who usually has good ones... damn. album 100% 8-9/10
L take, big yikes
You realize this album is literally about him fighting with his ego over the hype and fame he got at a young age, then transitions to him killing it with acid/psychs and realizing &quot;my whole personalities fake&quot;. It&#39;s over the top at the start of the record for a reason, it&#39;s telling a story of what punk2 did to his ego and then how he coped with it nearing the end. For someone who prides themselves on accurate reviews it&#39;s really disheartening that you didn&#39;t understand this and focused ONLY on the lyrics.
caffeine goes hard af
this is the shit sounds like the music they play on lite rock stations at the dentist
i think when you treat the lyrics on its own without any melodic elements, it can sound kind of cheesy. However, somehow the melodic elements brakence added for the lyrics makes it work quite well throughout the album, so I don&#39;t have a problem with the lyrics
yeah bro just trys to upset people for attention. let the man express himself
deepfake song of the year
Boooooo
Honestly I personally think Brakence actually IS more groundbreaking than Owl City. (AS A HUGE OWL CITY FAN I MIGHT ADD)
really showing your age on this one
This man just made me go back and dislike all his other videos now bc clearly he has no taste especially to do dissect on artists that are once in a generation talent, dudes out of his mind lol
Brakence is only 21 …. Only getting better which is rare for an artist. 9/10 album is 🔥. Dude has earned a right to be cocky and is a pioneer in music
Shut up
He&#39;s not only one with the ego poking out on this one
I feel like the majority of people defending the album lyrically are (and I say this respectfully) either in high school or maybe undergrad in college<br><br>I say that because I would have loved this album as a teenager but as a young adult I think it’s just fine. Not bad at all, but fine
His ego is really cringe I get what he’s doing but it’s just so cringe.
I can appreciate the album and understand every point he brought up.
Sorry fantano ur wrong on this one 😭
I think this album is a perfect representation of being young and mentally ill while getting fame on the internet. I wouldn&#39;t expect Fantano to be able to relate to these feelings or understand that this is exactly how someone would process them in the moment. It&#39;s amazing and a totally unique sound and performance level for this genre. Strong 9.
Wild that he would say the album seems like a commentary on egoism instead of an embrace of it, which is very accurate, but doesn&#39;t take that mentally thru actually absorbing the concept the album is delivering.
Biggest L take from this man
bro has gotta be playing a character bc wtf
L take
I kind of get it. Production wise, this is a fantastic record to listen to. The lyrics suck and the vocal melodies and songwriting at its core is fairly derivative. That’s par for the course for a lot of pop music though. Idk. Cool record, but nothing that stood out to me as being all that worth the hype. But ofc everyone has different tastes. That production really is so good though.
opinions are opinions but some are dogshit
this album is so derivative and boring
Melon L unfortunately
I genuinely think you’re wrong
wtf
L bozo
Weird to rate the album low just because he’s 20 and kinda naïve. I love hearing artists perspectives grow, and this album will be cool to look back on as brakence makes more music the next 5-10 years. He’s a bit of a theatre kid, yes, but the music is good.
L Fantano<br>No constructive criticism<br>Just a stinky L for this<br>Brakence is fucking dope, 9/10
I completely understand and respect your perspective. Especially with it trying to be egotistically aware while full looping back into it. And honestly that&#39;s relatable, I&#39;m always second guessing myself and checking my ego. The music just scratches an itch. Great video.
Yeah one of the worst reviews ive seen from ya melon, the albums stupid good
No Anthony ITS 8
I think from all his music we would understand brakence can be very satirical I think it’s full of jabs of truth while he’s pushing himself to truly see how far he can go while still making it listenable like todays music while adding examples and references to internet,psychedelics, gaming and just todays culture… while gluing all together to run pretty seamlessly… Anthony can have his opinion but I feel like he’s just not seeing the perspective and saying brakence is arrogant is silly he just keeps to himself I think more people should be more arrogant with their art and belief in themselves than towards each other
Damn this review is an L. It’s almost like he didn’t even try to look into what the album was portraying and the emotions he was putting out there. Very proud of brakence and everything he achieved on this album.
Fantano treats the album like he’s reviewing a piece of literature instead of a piece of sound…lyrics matter yes, but for example, if the lyrics are amazing, but the song sounds terrible, it doesn’t matter how good the lyrics are it will still suck overall as a piece of work. Yet if the lyrics are dog shit but the piece sounds otherworldly and heavenly, it does not matter at all…he’s more bothered by an egotistical line than how the line SOUNDS in the song. Kanye for example has some of the most egotistical bars of all time, yet it doesn’t make the song sound bad simply because of the content of the lyrics or the person making them
Lyrics matter so much less than fantano makes them out to, especially on an album like this when the sound is so soothing and beautiful, one might even say ethereal in places
OWL CITY?????
dude you have some personal vendetta against brakence or something. this album is a masterpiece and probably the top record of the genre this year. idk why you are determined to die on this hill but this was an L review
lotta heated comments on this one, just wanted to say gud review melon i respecc ur opinion
comments on this video are a strong 9, video itself is a light to decent 3, v rare fanthany antano L, hypochondriac is top 10 ATLEAST albums of the year imo
Let’s be honest we don’t listen to Brakence for his lyrics. The songs just sound good
Anthony would have given Randy a 10 had he said &quot;so why you wanna link? I&#39;d rather finger <b>bass</b> strings. I suppose low mid 2 light 3 tier list king.&quot;
Such a bad take
Booooo
Hot take, hes right
I disagree
I thought the elden ring lyric was good
5g a banger
Fantano a walking L tbh
I kinda agree being a huge brakence fan since bahvana, this was very accurate.
It was nice and experimental, I like punk2 a bit more but it’s still cool💯
we fucking did it boys!
The lyric at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iirPux8sPGA&amp;t=396">6:36</a> i&#39;m pretty sure is a reference to a bladee song called &quot;nike just do it&quot; which honestly goes kinda hard if you know that. pretty sure brakence is a fan of bladee
Solid review. Totally agree on the corniness of some of the lyrics. His voice and production are the only thing that keep it from 3/10.
first 1 and 0 on nostylist and x. now this????
WTF
Just wrong this time. You can tell there’s a generational gap based off the complaints you have with the lyrical content. The production, cohesiveness and story on this album warrants a 7 at worst.
no way this got the same score as whole lotta red delete yo shit this worst music of this generation
a talented teen is still gonna write like a teen. i think as he grows the lyrics could end up matching up with the production quality
5/10 is just wrong tho isn&#39;t it🤣
Melon didn’t get the lore for the album :(
honestly I&#39;ve never disagreed with you more. I feel like the whole album took an interesting aproach to the standard hyperpop/glitchcore themes and even if some of the lyrics are not the best when taken in isolation they very much don&#39;t lower my enjoyment of any of the tracks as brakence&#39;s energy and talent both with singing and producing gives off the emotion he is trying to show. I also think he does a great job of talking about social media &quot;addiction&quot; in 5g it just hit really close to home there
Cmon melon a 5??
This album was the first time I&#39;ve heard Brakence and I think with the vocal melodies, guitar, and creative production it at least deserves a 7. Been playing it on repeat!
I’ve really been digging this record a lot, and while I agree with melon that some of the lyrics are hella cringe, brakence’s vocals and production are so unbelievably good that for the most part it’s forgiven. 8/10 from me.
Deducting 5 points solely for lyrics that really aren’t that bad is fucking wild imo
THANKS MELON, now I’m craving a Brakence cover of Fireflies by Owl City.
Now I can understand why people get so angry at you for reviews
common L
I have literally no music knowledge but this is the first album since Frank&#39;s Blonde that I have felt   this way   about
He&#39;s sampling this
I must have shit music taste. Fantano rated my AOTY A 5?! 😭 I’m glad the comments have my back at least. I truly think he didn’t look deep enough into this one. For me it’s a light 9. (production and singing 10/10)
This dudes has no ego if you’ve seen him live, just a chill dude trying to get people thinking. You need to know how songs fit into the album as a story. In argyle he contrasts his feelings being sad with trying to get better with those “I’m better” emotions
Bruh
Extremely common Fantano L
It’s not “silly sound effects” first of all and second of all you don’t have to understand or like the genre of hyperpop, but don’t sit here and act like you have a clue as to what the hell is going on then because you are so far off on meanings and interpretations it’s crazy
This man doesn’t even know what these songs are about like look into a song before you speak about it god damn
I just don’t understand how we let people like Kanye west get away with some of the most god awful music ever made become so successful and praised and overplayed but then we shoot down smaller artists with actual thought out lyrics and music who don’t just pull something out of their ass in a day and call art
I like the hoodie 🍈
You’re not even understanding the lyrics correctly??!!
So someone that gains success after working so hard for isnt aloud to be confident about it now?
The comment section filled with butthurt people lol
Bruh in caffeine even I recognized his music isn&#39;t actually snobby but the obvious snobbiest audience rhyme scheme was so good considering it wasn&#39;t even the end rhyme I had to give it to him
Booooo
wow that&#39;s crazy i thought this record was absolutely phenomenal and i was expecting a relatively high score from the melon but ig i was wrong
L button
Idk why so many people are surprised that one man doesn’t agree with their collective tastes. Isn’t this the same fanbase that continually jokes “oh Fantano likes this band, now I can like them”? 😅
unironically ur worst take in a long time
yeah i like the album a good bit more then melon, but the lyrics were definitely the worst part for me too lol. some made me cringe hard. but luckily everything else around the lyrics really does it for me so it doesn&#39;t take away from my experience too much
The lyrics sound like a 21 year old guy wrote them and this review sounds more like a personal review of his personality lol First video I’ve seen of this guy, but he missed the mark big time and didn’t even understand the references in some of the lyrics… hard to critique what you don’t understand lol
love this album ❤️🔥
erm bro youre cringe pls go drink a vegan IPA bestie
If I speak I am in big trouble
LOL BOZO... whatever bro i hate you/ <br><br>- Trevor, with love
And the entire selfish art thing too. I thought that was tacky, but at least I understood what he meant by it in the first place. He&#39;s talking about not selling out (which is &quot;selfish&quot;) rather than &quot;serving a higher purpose&quot; by doing what other people want him to do.
Tbh, this review tracks from someone who thought carrie and lowell was one dimensional
I kind of feel like the whole thing where he disappeared completely and came back with an album about his mental health struggles is definitely caused in part due to people saying his feelings aren&#39;t legitimate, which is kind of the vibe I got from your comment about his ego. If it&#39;s legitimate for kendrick lamar to do nothing new or innovative for an hour while he talks about his personal struggles, then why isn&#39;t it the same for brakence to make an exciting and innovative album about the same topics?
Also, he&#39;s not taking a jab at bubblegum pop wtf? He&#39;s criticizing people who dismissed his music as bubblegum pop but were all over it as soon as it became trendy. You really have to bang your head against this really hard in order to contort the meaning of this album into what you got out of it, but that&#39;s your right i guess.
Man, he really missed the point with a lot of these lyrics. The entire album leading up to him deciding that everything about himself and the way he expresses himself is fake is very clearly built off of lyrics from caffeine, intellectual greed, teeth, and anywhere else where he plays himself up. I wasn&#39;t even a huge fan of his earlier music, but this album really did it for me. Also, I have no idea how you got that he thinks his music is &quot;snobby&quot; in a good way; the lyric is very clearly saying that he&#39;s still getting it done for his listeners in spite of his douchiness, not because of it.
Industry plant. Look at the identical tiktoks about him from freshly spawned accounts
Ur L an FGT
holy this guy dumb
what’s so interesting to me on the “brakence has a big ego” take is that i saw him live on the first night of tour for this album (like three or so weeks ago) and he comes off as so nervous on stage, almost shy, even when performing songs like caffeine. just thought i’d add
Rare Mellon L 😢
Came back to this review after your recent video on the feedback. It really feels like you aren&#39;t picking up on the bitter cheekiness that Brakence is obviously known for; The egoism is a sort of self-deprecating sarcasm and plays into the themes of esotericism and being misunderstood. I don&#39;t understand why other artists (like Dorian Electra) can have fun with lyrics and be cheeky and/or use modern-day references but when Brakence does it it&#39;s immature? I thought the Elden ring line was well implemented in the song and fun.
Gigantic L tbh
Yeah, lyrics are cringe.
This is such an L
Fantano being a psychoanalyst for 10 minutes instead of talking about the actual music.
this felt less like an album review and more like a psychological evaluation of brakence bro
I agree
Intellectual Greed sounds like an anime OP in the best way
AYEEE interview Brakence Anthony
BABE WAKE UP, FANTANO IS WRONG
i’m actually surprised so many people like this. his vocals and lyrics are unbearable for me.
No dislikes? Truely a perfect review Anthony thank you.
but… you gave lil pump a 7
#1 album
This is the new Worlds review.
Lyrics are fucking embarrassing
listening to the album to see if I agree with the score<br><br>edit: so I just finished the album, I liked 10 out of the 13 tracks, but out of those 10 tracks I liked, 2 of them felt way too long, and so I&#39;ll count those 2 as 1 point towards my personal score for the album, so I&#39;d say the album is a light 8 out of 10, so a pretty damn good album for someone who seems like a less experienced/newer artist, I&#39;d say a light 5 out of 10 isn&#39;t quite fair to the album, if he had given it a decent 6 I can see that being justified, but a light 5 is pretty low, and this is coming from someone who just listened to him for the first time, so no bias towards the artist, just going off of the enjoyment of the music
Is Brakence&#39;s lyrics super weak sometimes... Yes but a light 5 my brother in Christ it&#39;s at least a 7 smhmyhead
I personally love this album a lot- it’s probably my favorite this year, or at least top 3. I do recognize that some of the lyrics come off weird or corny, I thought that on first listen- but I love the songs and album as a whole and the off lyrics don’t bother me all that much.
Dude really compared this to owl city?
I gotta admit, I&#39;m with melon here. Some of the lyrics are just rough to listen to. I want to give him the benefit of the doubt on some of these, but even still it does come across as if it&#39;s just some kid writing bars for half of his songs then occasionally having some really good lyrics.
if anything u rated it too high. the shitter deserves it
this take just comes off as insecure for no reason
this album is a 1/10 from me I cannot stand his vocals
massive W from fantano breakence needs to be hated on this album is trash
this music really sucks lol
“i can’t hit the griddy 😔” -brakence
Biggest disagreement I&#39;ve run into with Fantano yet, and a big one at that. Mostly tend to agree with him but this album was really really good imo. I think the instrumentation is super good and teeth WENT NUTS. I don&#39;t listen to this for the lyrics, and some are corny, but this shit has some crazy cool instrumentals.
W
This is a Fantano W. Brakence&#39;s singing and production are undeniably impressive, but the lyrics are just too hard to look past.
Hey Melon, if you&#39;re tired of listening to egotistical music that sounds whiny and uninteresting, you should check out my music - more specifically, my album :)
ur bald lol
I think the whole theme of the album is missed. The album is about internet addiction. It&#39;s not about ego, or woe is me. Intellectual greed he doesn&#39;t sing about the things he wanted from his music. It&#39;s talking about the consequences of it, and using the internet as a way to get that. Like just read the chorus. Melon 0/10
dawg I have never been so happy to see people tear melon apart as I am right now
Holy L
L L L
I do think the lyrics are cringy or weak at times but the production, song structure, and vocals are on point. At least a 9/10 for me
Well I expected to walk away from this disappointed at the very least lmao
Love fantano but damn… you missed completely on this one
bad take
L take
Please review Willie Nelson’s Live at Budokan
This album was fire! what the hell? Even though I disagree with Fantano on a lot of albums This one&#39;s a highlight.
y’all are high thinking this is a bad review, like honestly i love brakence but this album was underwhelming as hell. easily 5-6/10
NOOOOOO NOOOO NOOOO NOOOOOOOOO I CANT NOOOOOO DONT NOOOO AHHHHH I CANT WHY WHY A 5!
I might lose out on they/them pussy when I say this, but I honestly see no redeeming qualities about the album. The lyrics are boring af for sure, but his voice and delivery are the real deal breaker for me. Like I feel second hand embarrassment listening to homie sing lol
I do not agree with this one ngl. Bad take.
worst take you’ve had by far
In all fairness the album is called hypochondriac so the name fits the track list
5/5 is a weird rating scale but i&#39;ll take it
dang fantano don’t break mi heart, i thought u were more than just a dude w/ a bass … but now i wonder if u’ve ever written from tha heart as an artist… maybe you’re just a critic — fair. this is a project from a solo artist, not a writing room. please don’t pander to having tha worst take reaction fam. hmm imma rethink mi mellon
Fantano vs #1 Brakence Stan
Kinda agree. I give it a 6/7 tho just because i like it musically so much. I know the whole braggadocious and weird sexy talk is on purpose and he kinda of second guesses his nature to be like that, but sometimes it comes across as way to dull imo
Review Diveliner
Bar analysis seems racially motivated
brakence makes music for sheltered white kids whose biggest struggle in life is that they don&#39;t like their own gender
Mad respect for speaking the truth
melon shut up challenge
Holy shit, we get blessed with artists like Jean Dawson and Brakence yet this man goes full cheak spread to shit on them. I appreciate the breakdown of the music theory but my guy, this is easily album of the year and his lyrics are eloquently pointed instead of being so direct,  he has depth. I would argue a 7 or 8 and that&#39;s taken in respects of artists like Kendrick albeit a whole different genre. Fantano, what are you doing?!
Nah it’s at least 8/10. Tripping mushrooms it’s a 10/10
You ever know a fanbase is gonna be really annoying before you&#39;ve seen a single comment from one? No reason
Listen, i do think its a pretty good crafted record (7/10 for me) but some of yall in here are really getting your feelings hurt just cause a melon had different opinion than you. *typing this as i get sturdy to the track 5g 😵‍💫
Massive L
as a long time follower of brakence i feel it is a solid 7/10 for me. song by song, certain songs can reach 8 or 9 as an experience as a whole. I do wholeheartedly agree with the whole ego thing, however, and do feel it played a part in watering the rating as a whole. Another part that played a factor in mitigating my rating was the fact that the whole album seems to all sound the same and while the composition may differ wildly, it seems like each song is just a jumbled version of the same effects, glitches, and kits. Not a bad thing in the least, but it makes each song much less different short of the more instrument based songs toward the end of the album.<br><br>Overall track composition with his transitions and &quot;we are going on a journey&quot; feeling I feel is brakence&#39;s strong suit at a solid 9/10<br><br>Mixing 8/10 normally i don&#39;t rate on this, but all the guitar, vocals, and drums are mixed exactly the same. This isn&#39;t a bad thing, but so much color is applied it feels like each instrument&#39;s &quot;colors<br> shouldn&#39;t really extend past one or two songs<br><br>Melodies 7/10 as a lot of it feels repetitive especially with vocal and instrument melodies<br><br>Performance 8/10 primarily with the hired on guitarist and brakence&#39;s own distinctive tone and falsettos, it&#39;s clear brakence&#39;s album is a display of musical talent as a whole<br><br>Lyricism is a 8/10 with certain cheesy lines in there, some still stick out as being really good.<br><br>Subject is 6/10 as although I really do like the idea of fighting oneself to make different music, I don&#39;t even think brakence has done much other than hyperpop. Instead of placing it in the perspective of &quot;me wanna go make new song but fan might not like&quot; instead he could take on the angle of being afraid of change as a whole and approach it from a stance of humility. This is really something that should be attacked in maybe one or two songs at most but should not be the idea of the entire album, and calling his production &quot;black magic&quot;. I get a lot of it aesthetic, and even fits in the hyperpop/glitch realm pretty well. Still think it was a bit extreme of a narrative.
L on Fantano for not knowing just how to vibe haha
feeling 8/10 because of lyrics. but if i was 15-16 it would be 10/10. bro he&#39;s literally 20 yo what did you want? his lyrics aren&#39;t even that bad, do i have to remind what lil peep (or any other emo rapper) lyrics were like when he was 20-21? +the fact that brakence produce his beats that way at his age is impressive enough not to be so strict about the lyrics. you can&#39;t be genius at everything
bro he&#39;s lke 19 cmon
For watchers without a dislike restoration browser extension, fyi Melon got ratioed here 2.6k to 3.1k
The production and songwriting on the music side totally blew me away. I have no problem with egotistical lyrics, I just find some other lyrical references to be cringe, namely references to internet culture like closing the app, liked my tweets, elden ring, etc. it always takes me out of a song, especially one trying to be emotionally weighty like these, when the lyrics pull out shit like that. Still, 8/10, musically amazing
I thought this would be divisive but it should be 6 at least for the production alone.
this is such an awful take
Fantano slowly transforming from a music reviewer to a therapist
fantano really processed someone struggling with accepting asexuality as “edgy lyrics”
Bro made an album about how he’s struggling w his massive ego fleeting and melons mad that he’s displaying narcissistic tendencies in his lyrics
Rappers make less impressive and more bar bones bars all the time that your praise, but because its a younger guy that isn&#39;t rapping it at a faster cadence you dislike it. All of a sudden braggadocio is always bad.
i think my biggest problem with this review is that anthony isn’t even considering that maybe the egocentrism and selfishness is the point. he seems to not like the vibes of the album, which is fair it’s not a happy album, but i think it explores the vibes it explores very well. <br><br>i read the album as a reflection, or an imitation, on how the world is dealing with ecological terrorism and climate change. brakence casually drops bars like “they’re laying waste to a new biome to make a case for the new iphone” in 5g, a song that’s basically saying “don’t worry about me baby i’m tough i’ve got this even though everythings going wrong”. or again on stung when he says “if i want honey know i’m gonna be stung” on a song that’s basically “grrrr i hate people don’t underestimate me”. brakence is, quite literally, making selfish art, but as a distraction from human greed and nature erosion. the amount of ego he presents on the album is a parallel to corporations, politicians, hell even artists, who go about their careers ignoring the fact that the world is going to end if we don’t do something, even though it should be the only thing that they’re worried about. hence the name hypochondriac as well, it’s the obsession with one’s health instead of the health of the world.<br>maybe fantano sees this and thinks it’s unhealthy, which i would probably agree with. i think it’s better to make music that directly confronts social issues rather than mocking those who don’t, because then history is only doomed to repeat itself. however, i don’t think this makes the album bad by any means. the quality of the album is not tainted by the ugliness of the emotional content.<br><br>i agree with what most of what he said though, production is top tier and probably my favourite of any album this year, lyrics are a bit wack sometimes(although i thought they were ironic and apart of the whole narcissism metaphor, but maybe i’m wrong). generally this album fucks tho.<br>8/10 best songs: 5g, caffeine, teeth, introvert, deepfake
yes, melon i know this is just your opinion, but your opinion is, well, a stinky pile of dog shit. since you&#39;re melon i&#39;ll let this one slide. don&#39;t do it again.
I would also give it a 5 but like his lyrics having toxic vibes wasn&#39;t the issue for me just some strange production choices and bitsy parts that didn&#39;t work together
To me this album felt more like an acknowledgement and exploration of Brakence&#39;s bad mindsets and ideologies than an acceptance of them. While I do agree there are some silly lyrics that take you out of the experience, I feel as thought the braggadocios lyrics on tracks like caffiene are meant to serve as a kind of manical perspective - that whole track to me is one big manic episode. Overall the few silly lyrics on this thing are completely overshadowed by the immaculate production, symbolism, transitions and musicality of the record. Top 5 of the whole year for me personally.
This felt like a therapist that never achieved his own musical dreams over analyzed the album from a resentful and very personal space. L for this review but A+ for getting Brakence more exposure.
Anthony’s too cisgendered to enjoy this album
L review per usual
Damn imagine claiming you’re a music nerd without even understanding music wild
wow the comments are wildly pretentious
Biggest L melonhead
I don&#39;t understand why melon is hating on brakence having egotistical bars when literally every rapper has bars WAY more egotistical bars than this. you barely even talked about the production. the production was what made this album. not to mention his amazing vocals.
yeah some silly lyrics here and there, but he&#39;s young. i think when he&#39;s like 25 he&#39;ll be putting out much better lyrics. musically and melodically shit is SO fire though
This is such an L I cannot even begin to describe how big this L is
Sounds like the disagreement is mostly bias based around not agreeing with the message of the album
it was perfection, L take
Review the new phoenix álbum
this just in: Brakence can&#39;t like his own music.. lol
I have no idea what melon is talking about
L video
Bros acting like Brakence is the first musician to have an ego
i wish you wouldve pretended this album didnt exist so i didnt have to hear these things you say about it
This album is literally incredible. I usually agree with you
It&#39;s almost like concept of the album is about the ego brakence has cultivated because of social media. This is while showing the influence the internet has on our generation and his music. The samples in introvert reference how people are desensitized to war and sex with video games and social media. Also the blatant lines throughout the album referencing trends and slogans that feel out of place are almost like an ad on a YouTube video and make sense when you look at the entire album as a whole.
Dawg what
I think a couple goofy lyrical moments doesn’t make it a 5/10… as you said the production is extremely inventive, his melodic writing and song structure is impeccable and managing to mix so many different genres and sounds while still creating a very cohesive sonic experience where each track seamlessly transitions into the next is one of biggest musical feats of this year - it’s probably my second favourite album of this year after Ants From Up There. Either way I’m excited to see what he comes out with next as hypochondriac exceeded expectations for me and definitely surpassed punk2
god anthony wow gigantic L
this shit actually made me mad lmaoo
bro didnt review the title track cause he didnt wanna day anything positive
Worst Fantano take since Mbdtf to be honest
why do i feel like this review isn&#39;t even about the album itself, its just fantano assuming things about brakence when as far as i know they&#39;ve never even talked or met
Do the Philadelphia eagles Christmas album
this is the best comment section ever lol
L
i completely agree with the takes on the lyrics and i thought the same thing whilst listening into the lyrics. but the album is WAY more than just the lyrics and its a shame that the amazing parts of the album were overlooked so blindly in this review
I love your content but I disliked the video because I disagree heavily with your opinion !
It’s like you went out of your way to ignore the context of each song and the overarching theme of the album
when he talks about his ego popping hes talking about EGO DEATH. LIKE, IN DRUGS 🤦‍♂️ (which like. the whole album is about lmao)
Literally the best album I&#39;ve heard in a long long time bro I just don&#39;t see any other way to look at it honestly
The part where he talks about argyle is interesting because I took it to be more of he is almost lying to himself that he isn&#39;t hurt by this in a self aware way, I&#39;m getting this from the defeated tone he delivers the end part in. while he talks about how he never loved her and such he can&#39;t help but break down near the end. <br><br>my opinion 8/10 album although I can see how someone like Anthony who listens very carefully to lyrics could be put off by some admittedly cringe moments.
Never seen a comment section so against fantano. Greatest day of my life
I think this review is the first one that really ages Anthony. He really might be too old to enjoy an album like this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iirPux8sPGA&amp;t=427">7:07</a> you aren&#39;t his therapist though? Literally why does this matter
Anthony, you cant give brakence a 0 cause he didn&#39;t go bald by the end of the album!.
I usually agree with Fantano, but this time I&#39;ve gotta chalk it up to disconnect. I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s never experienced the type of depression that comes with a mental illness piled on top of the usual hormonal late teens/early 20s angst, and I know for a fact he didn&#39;t experience it at that age during a time like the present, where every level of toxicity is multiplied exponentially due to the internet and technological advances. He critiqued meme-y angsty lines that resonate with younger folks to their core, he critiqued lyrics like &quot;I don&#39;t want a girl, I don&#39;t even want a man&quot; but ignored &quot;when I produce a beat its like making laced nootropics, I blow a fuse, repeat it, eternal state neurotic.&quot;<br><br>He called deepfake a tantrum and I cried the first time I listened to it because it sounded like a letter I wrote after I hit rock bottom. The line &quot;just do it, Nike&quot; in reference to self harm is gen z comedy gold, while also showing how used to his negative state he&#39;s gotten.<br><br>This reminds me of my dad reviewing new age rock music and not being able to relate to it like he could Motley Crüe.
common and predictable fantano loss
caffeine being the only song brakence has ever even like. slightly bragged about himself on bc god knows it’s in like maybe one other track (sauceintherough) and in caffeine it’s obviously meant to be satiric. like he’s hyping himself up so much bc his ego is fucking thru the roof fake as hell. i do not know how you can listen to it and conclude, “oh well he sounds cringy he thinks he’s some kind of god” yeah he does! he was on lsd !
Lnthony Lantano
I think the reason you&#39;re having trouble grasping a lot of the feeling and emotions on the track are he is describing his manic episodes, the medicine made him feel bad, and the fact that he&#39;s, what he makes out to be, addicted to LSD. He&#39;s also only 20 so I&#39;d also give some lee-way for that fact too. He has a lot of discovering of himself to do. <br>I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve ever seen a manic person who just BELIEVES they&#39;re God, but that&#39;s how I view any lyrics involving his ego. <br>The emotions are simple but they&#39;re taken to the extreme which is where his production going from soft to organized chaos at the drop of a pin becomes a symphony with the simple lyrics you&#39;re not a fan of. <br><br>Overall good review. I do agree on a low level with your dislike of the lyrics but the production is unlike anything ever and that alone would put it at a 6/10 without vocals.
This is the most I’ve disagreed with a review ever honestly.
if he sang about having a wet dream about charli xcx you would’ve given it a 9/10
y’all had me really excited hyping this album up in defiance of the review….shit is ass. like if post malone hired 100 gecs. anthony what’s ur elden ring build
comments say it all. 🙏 praying for Fantano
Yeah, yeah, so many obscure pop acts reviewed lately--when we getting some Satan for Xmas?
i can’t believe you missed the whole point of the album not even just production wise but LYRICALLY
LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
holy L jesus christ
<b>LOUDEST INCORRECT BUZZER SOUND PLAYING THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE VIDEO</b>
Oh nah 😭😭 what is this guy talking about. Brakence W. L fantano
Rappers have been arrogant since the dawn of time. You don’t say anything when shitty rappers like lil pump or yachty or Megan the skeleton talk about themselves like they’re gods 😂

Could you review faith in the future???
everything about it is good apart from the lyrics e.g &#39;bad bitch with the messy hair&#39;. But it doesn&#39;t ruin it for me i still think it is really good.
Yo my brother man you have done 0 Built to Spill, this needs to change
Brakence SUCKS
Cope &amp; seethe zoomer dipshits
melon clearly wasnt using his imagination
trash take
This review is spot on production is class but the song writing is pure cringe
genuinely never a huge fan of albums. This one was easily my favorite of 2022. it just did not disappoint and at worst it’s an 8.5/10
I dont think he knows that brakence plays a character throughout the album to make a story. L take from Fantano i give it a very strong 8 its up there with some of my favorites like call me if you get lost, demon days, and faces by mac miller. Each song hits and it plays with your emotions so well.
Think Fantano is just dropping the ball on understandanding how personal the ego is.
L Fantano moment
I do agree that lyrically it can tend to be a little cringe. I do also find myself at times feeling like the ego trip stuff happens all too often sometimes taking me out of it though some of his lyricism can sometimes be quite profound.<br><br>Nonetheless, I still love every entry on this album. Specifically teeth and introvert.
bro missed the entire point of the album 💀
walking L
fantano try not to nitpick challenge (gone wrong)
biggest L in a while…
this was a hard watch my guy.
honestly i hate to say it but the lyrics are indeed very shallow and it does, at times, pull from what makes him so good. His production and voice is amazing but it does fall flat when those things take a step back on the more stripped back songs.
That&#39;s a lot of words to say this album sounds like it was written by a kid who probably dabbled a little to often in hallucinogens.
Probably disagree with about half of Anthony&#39;s opinions but I usually at least understand where he&#39;s coming from. This is a hard exception.<br><br>It almost feels poetic to me that this dudes biggest gripe is with the lyrics and one of my favorite lyrics on the album is &quot;He&#39;s playing my song tryna decode, boy ain&#39;t no need for the discussion.&quot; <br><br>You cannot judge bars in a genre like emo/hyperpop the same way you would in lyrical hip hop. It would be like criticizing the weak line-work in a water colour painting. It&#39;s a different aesthetic. It evokes youthful, brash, raw emotion; not analytical word-play like Kendrick. The central focus of this type of music is, like you point out in your TLDR -- imaginative production and passionate performance.<br><br>I totally, TOTALLY understand if Brakence&#39;s vocal style doesn&#39;t do it for you. But if you&#39;re breaking down an album from a supposedly unbiased/analytical perspective (like a <b>music critic</b> should), you have to understand the landscape and themes of the genre at a bare minimum.
Its a 7. The album is really good when its good, but it makes quite a few less than tasteful artistic choices. It flows really nice but i cant shake the feeling it sounds like tik tok music. Still definitely worth a listen tho
not a fan of the edit at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iirPux8sPGA&amp;t=301">5:01</a>. was too jarring, spontaneous, and unfunny. ruined the video along with my vibe
we get it dude ur old

L review
the things being mentioned are such surface level observations that it shows you didn&#39;t fully dissect or listen to this thing<br><br>it&#39;d be ok if you still wouldn&#39;t like it if you &quot;got&quot; it, but to not mention anything beside &quot;lyric bad but some pop song ok&quot; shows that you fail to see what makes this thing great<br><br>I guess it&#39;s my fault to excpect you to be valid - just another casual Fantano L
I feel like Anthony listened to this album as a casual piece of music rather than a narrative. It shows that brakence REALLY knows how to pander SPECIFICALLY to his target audience, and does it well.
Its okay melon, maybe one day you&#39;ll get a musical brain in that empty squash skull:)
reviews like this are why we need the dislike button back
If seems like you’re judging the album based on commercialization while you focus on the lyricism that you determine as low hanging fruit. There may be some verses where that may be the case but you pay no Attention to the rest of the album. The production, the vocals, and the album order and construction was much better than a lite 5
L melon L
Did he have this sound before or after he listened to underscores?
the amount of influence that brakence has and will continue to have in the future is enormous. this needed to be rated higher. his album is amazing. you clearly did not look into it deeper
Feels like ur missing a lot of the tones of irony and overcompensation that brakence was trying to convey in his over the top ego trip bars. Its clear on most cuts he paints himself less as a good guy and more of someone who doesn’t understand how to align his newfound hype with his mental turmoil. I agree it can sometimes come off corny but it felt more nuanced than “ego emo sad boy raps about how he is so cool and successful off of 500k monthly listeners”.  L
10/10 project
Man lol
someone must have got their interview declined and is having a tantrum :( just breathe needo, biggest L on this channel and i&#39;ve been watching for years.
A 5????????????
can you do a review of MOTM I? I think its wierd how u only review 2 and 3 but not 1 which is arguably the best and most well known
he literally just ignored the story arch💀
I love Fantano but some of this absolutely flew over his head
Ratio
Holy u are wrong in every since of the word
I don&#39;t always agree with Fantano, but I truly respect his ability to convey his point. This time around, though, I felt like he kept harping on the same thing over and over again. At the end of the day, music is art, and art is subjective - to each their own.<br><br>To me, Hypochondriac is a strong 8.
More entertaining than Fantano’s reviews is his audience being unable to handle him not agreeing with them. This comment section is so butthurt.
I humbly disagree
Biggest fantano L in a while
It’s your opinion and that’s absolutely valid and I agree that some one the lyrics hit goofy, but I just can’t help but disagree. I think the warped perspective and story is very interesting. I think you failed to mention the story that in my opinion is pretty clear.
huge L
bro went into a sound design/production focused album and only critiqued the lyrics
bro has no taste in music 💀
my take on the lyrics were very different. i felt they were self aware which is why the album gets more serious in the end. i thought it really fit together and this is my 2nd fav album this year
bro getting ratiod without a visible dislike feature
discrediting the whole album just because the lyrics are a little &quot;egotistical&quot; isn&#39;t really fair :/<br>i feel like the egotistical nature of some of the lyrics juxtapose perfectly with the lyrics about self-hatred and his unhealthy mental state, i also feel like the album&#39;s braggadocios nature isn&#39;t too far off from other projects in the emo rap lane and he adds his own unique twist on this sound
Huge meLon
Your biggest gripe with the record is the lyrics and you don&#39;t even recite the correct words here. Did you listen to the record more than once?
wow fantano with yet another terrible take. color me shocked.
OH SHIT HE&#39;S ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT IT LET&#39;S GOOOO<br><br>Edit: aaaaand I finished it. Fuck.
This is MBDTF for glitch pop lovers
not watching vid, just gonna say i disagree heavily and move on
my drilla what 😭😝
👎
i love the music but some of the lyrics r so cringe 😢😢😢 chronically online kids sometimes have the worst slang
damn melon falling out of touch
i think the self awareness and acknowledgement of snobbishness is more of like hot bitch energy than it is a lack of knowing ones lane. brakence on that fem glow up. also the manufacturing heat line is good i think that shit goes hard. all love
Guys don&#39;t let this distract you at the fact that Death Grips is back Online. They&#39;ll be performing next year for Sick New World Festival. I don&#39;t know if I missed it but I don&#39;t think Melon have said anything about this.
This was a rough one to watch melon, easily high 8 clean 9 album no contest. Glad he was reviewed though, my boy deserves the listens.
This album is just cringe.
did melon understand the concept of the album?? probably the worst review ive seen from him in a while… i dont even enjoy this project all that much but its clear that fantano barely listened to it and picked out some lyrics he could use out of context. if you use these videos as a frame of reference as to whether or not you should listen to an album i would definitely ignore this one and find another review.
common fantano L
ur not really his audience, people his age relate more
i mean he’s 20, what else is he suppose to sing/ write about
Failthony Wrongthano
my friend, you have shattered my soul with this ):
I don’t know how you people listen to this shit it’s like glaive but somehow more annoying
How are people saying this is an L, this album is mid as fuck
huh
LLLLLLL
idk man, i almost feel like you really miss a lot of the aspects that make this album so good
Brakence dick riders are so weird. Def bottom 5 wrist fanboys
Although he still only has a relatively small following would say his ego comes from him birthing the scene of hyperpop and being the main creative influence for artists like Glaive and Ericdoa who are now popstar status touring with MGK &amp; Laroi. He talks about YouTube beats in this album, and says &#39;good luck trying to find anyone like me&quot; there was an explosion in the production style of brakence after punk2, producers and artists trying to recreate his sound. Not to mention he is self produced, so he is taking 100% of the accolades for his music.<br><br>First listen around I found a lot of lyrics corny, but listening back through they don&#39;t really take away from what he&#39;s trying to achieve. I think this is a great progression of his music from the last record and perfectly experimental. For me, the lyrics are actually fantastic for the most part, and in the times where they lack, his immersive, glitchy effects, punchy delivery, incredible vocals, and versatile cadences make up for it. And there is always something new to find in the instrumental.
Caffeine is a pretty damn awesome song, don’t know how that ended being his worst liked track.
Yea bro ngl n i say this non disrespectfully but you are just old asf. His lyrics weren’t supposed to be takin so literally. And if you hold albums to this standard then every album is gonna be shit to you. When he writes music he uses figurative languange alot reference to the “if this is my time just take out the iv” then proceeds to say just do it like nike. Like obviously hea just havin fun with wordplay. This was a terrible review.
I really hope he revisits this project. I feel like he totally misunderstood the storytelling and missed a lot of clever lyrics because he was hung up on a handful of cringy lyrics :(
Whole time I was listening to this, I was PINING for a fucking instrumental version. Production and such is very nice, but god damn by track three or four I could not get further past the guy&#39;s emo inspired vocals. Used to be HUGE on emo music back when I was 13 but that shit makes me tummy hurt now listening to it. Weird ass mashup of sounds that mostly works, but his vocals paired with his lyrics are corny and totally killed it. Feels like an album made for those folks still listening to Mayday Parade, but had their &quot;music world&quot; opened up by their first acid trip at an EDM festival.<br><br>Edit: wow between this thread and AOTY reviews think I might need to give it a proper full listen and be more open minded. I did love a lot of what is going in with the glitchy production, but I do tend to despise the vocal style Brakence is embodying here. Nothing against him. Only emo album I can still listen to front to back is the Black Parade. Will give it a few more spins before deciding to write it off.
This is an album for kids in middle school
This is at least a 7/10
your interpretation of ARGYLE makes me genuinely think you didn’t listen to more than the intro/hook. like genuinely lol because what you said is clearly not what the song is about AT ALL
the writing definitely drags it down but the production and vocals are so damn good that it makes up for it. i would give it an 8.5/10
Fantano my GOAT
Idiotic opinion
so true
this is a crime
the fact there&#39;s nearly a 1:1 dislike ratio
Bad opinion, you’re bald
I&#39;ve never seen someone so misunderstood the meaning of EVERY song on an album
Theres a level of self awareness and “intellectual greed”/deep desire for self actualization necessary in order to fully appreciate and understand the depth and weight of what he’s really trying to say in every word of the lyrics you dissed, and the whole album. Otherwise people end up washing them out with social standard/assumptions/general status quo expectations. That’s not to say the music isn’t something you can just listen to and dance to and enjoy, you definitely should do that its an insanely good album regardless of what it means to you personally, but the value of what he’s saying is so important that dismissing it like this is what bothered me. This album is self awareness driven, and expresses the unfathomable burden of trying to better yourself in an integral way. This album is calling out the ego, so the point is that he’s condemning the power trip that he’s also indulging, its paradoxical on purpose. The lyrics are so much deeper than just “ego feeding”. Its such a gigantic metaphor and a reflection/expression of the pain of trying to outgrow ones Self and ego. Its a work of genius from the self development spirituality lens. I see why people would see it this way if they’re not into that, which is totally fine and fair. Its just unfortunate to rate it like this when the topic isn’t something you are interested in enough to understand it.
It’s like a 9 sir
I just feel like there was some crucial misses from your standpoint… damn that 5 fuckin hurt bro 😭 personally the part with the lady AI telling us that he’s been deleted symbolized on unaliving to me and boy, did it just shake me to my core. As for the corny and overconfident lyrics, I feel like that’s just a part of brakence that I think all of his fans wish they could be like lol but hey different strokes for different folks still love ya Tony
I knew you were gonna pull something like this
This album deserves so much better than this trash review
this is a genuine 10 for me wtf
this review felt like you were kinda just grasping at straws the entire time, this album is a complete work of art and I feel like the review was a bit harsh
4/5 for sure
8/10 minimum. Period.
i definitely feel like melon misinterpreted the messaging. i think brakence&#39;s vulnerability about his self-obsession explains the corny bars, like he&#39;s still partially blind to his ego while simultaneously aware of it. it kinda felt like how a douchebag thinks from their perspective.
L fantano
I’m of two minds on this: I’m glad this got a review so folks know it exists. It’s a worthwhile record. The review is kind of a mess, though!
i can not stand the toxicity around fantano. like him or not, he has an opinion that is just as valid as yours. i LOVED the album, i think it’s one of the best albums i’ve seen in a long time, but i also like to hear what others think. his opinion on it has not changed how i view the album and i’m sure my opinion wouldn’t change his. THIS IS WHAT MUSIC IS ABOUT! there is no song or album in existence that everyone rates 10/10. consumption of reactionary and opinionated media should not affect your personal opinion 100% of the time. Anthony,Thanks for the review and insight of the album, because even though we don’t agree, i respect your musical knowledge and opinions
The lyrics are seriously cringe worthy. Can’t believe people are loving this
:)
L take
i think youre meant to take the egotistical, conceited lyrics at face value. it almost feels like a character, he&#39;s made it big and expects everything to fall on his lap as a result of his popularity. most rap songs are about how much money they have, how famous they are and how many girls they perform coitus with, so its kind of mirroring that in a sense. idk, just my thoughts. personally this is tied with quadeca for aoty.
It&#39;s a 10/10 for me.
thats why i can&#39;t hit the griddy
i agree that a lot of the lyric writing is so cringe to the point of taking me out of an otherwise great song which is really unfortunate but i think a saving grace for me at least was that the end of the album, specifically deepfake, sort of brings the egotistical nature of the first part of the record  full circle, being like &quot;my whole personality&#39;s fake&quot; like it&#39;s all just a front for his deep rooted insecurities and such. sort of recontextualized the rest of the record for me
no way he said 5
A truly incredible vocalist and producer—lyrically though I do agree. I think if overall my guy has a writer, project would genuinely be an 8/10.<br><br>I felt Quadeca also had this problem on From Me To You, but him stripping back the need for dense rhyming on IDMTHY really pulled him through.
fair enough but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iirPux8sPGA&amp;t=170">2:50</a> kind of rubs me the wrong way and invalidated the whole review. Very ad hominem addition and comes off as jealousy or just idk some kind of superiority issue from melon here. Just seems like something he should&#39;ve edited out in the final cut, really adds no value to the review / criticism
Anthony please just re-review this one you didn&#39;t do a good job
I won&#39;t forget this one Tony
lyrics were so corny thank god someone agreed
“The only bad thing you can say about his music is that it’s corny and I literally don’t care about that because he clearly doesn’t” - i dont remember who
i feel like him making an album about his ego is justified considering he organically absolutely blew up from Punk2 and started an entire trend and shift to literally everyone in both the emo rap and hyperpop scene trying to copy his sound and production. i think it is justified to have an album where he fights his ego and almost questions how human he is / if he’s just a selfish person. i think if we forget about the couple cornier lines on the album, the overall lyrical content is interesting. he’s going through a lot going from a nobody to the person everyone wants to be. he created a new pocket of organic sounding midwest emo hyperpop that has never sounded so good. i think you’re just a hater fantano and that you’re really missing the point and the gravity that brakence really pulled, making him deserving of questioning / having a crazy ego
Some people just wont get it.
glad we all seem to agree on this huge fantano L
Interestingly enough this is melons longest review of a single album in 4 months
Bro doesn’t understand how concept albums work
I felt that you ignored the fact that his ego is the whole point of the first part of the album, he then proceeds to break his ego down later on. He’s trying to truly learn about himself in this album. You focused a lot of the lyrics but got nothing they were trying to tell you. Overall pretty big L from melon here
why hasn’t Anthony reviewed any music from keshi 🤔
This year has been cursed with 5’s from Melon Man. I personally think this opinion is a big L. Hyperfocusing and nit-picking the lyrics to downplay all the other attributes.<br><br>It’s an opinion though and I cannot hate on that. Lyrics won’t soil the album for everyone, but they really do make an impact.
no
Man said he has more in common with Owl City than Aphex Twin and then immediately said the production on this album is cutting-edge.
i also agree that it&#39;s a 10/10
&quot;Stupid horse i just fell out of the porsche&quot; beautiful lyricism strong 7<br><br>I dunno man I saw you in the front row of that 100 gecs concert I guess song writing doesn&#39;t matter for every artist?
biggest L take
Personally this album is a 6-7 for me. I&#39;ve been getting used to brakence&#39;s sound since his last album punk2 and while i think this is an improvement from that last project i do think thing brakence&#39;s singing on this album is kind of weak. Which is a shame since he has done some impressive stuff on here.
brakence if you are reading any comments on this video, none of us agree with him... its a 10/10 album :)
sos??????
lol totally disagree
I just want to mention, Fantano have this a higher rating than he normally would when this lyrical issue happens. It’s you’re eating some of your favorite food, but someone put peas in it, and you hate peas. You can love most of it, but the peas are in the food in such a way that you can’t ignore it. And it kind of ruined the experience. Out of all the years I have watched Fantano, it really gets him the wrong way when someone acts like they’re the shit when they clearly are not. Or they are saying the opposite of what they mean with all seriousness. It’s cringey, but some things just get under your skin, and these are one of the things that get under his. Because it’s his opinion, and he’s not everyone. Just one of his quirks.
Girl what
this is proof that fantano does not listen to the albums he reviews
Started laughing out loud at “I’m not gonna sit here and let him-“ the irony of saying this after criticising an artist for having what he deems an inflated sense of self-importance is wildly funny
This album is just meant for a younger audience. As someone well into their 30&#39;s I would feel embarrassed listening to this out loud.
i think melon felt attacked with the line &quot;and he playing my song tryna decode boy ain&#39;t no need for the discussion&quot; <br>just like as a musican over 21 i felt attacked with the line &quot;how this shit ain&#39;t obvious to you i&#39;m only 21&quot; <br>still a great album
I really appreciate you giving him a 10 melon!<br>But I don&#39;t understand why you kept saying you would &quot;Break-ence his balls&quot; if you saw him in person. A little disrespect imo.
I never understood why people hate his lyrics so much. so much of the lyrics ppl shit on are clearly playful and not meant to be taken so seriously and its interesting that so many ppl don&#39;t get that. theres entire genres that are built on egotistical or melodramatic lyrics and its kinda weird to see brakence get hate for being inspired by them. in terms of lyrics this album is absolutely less corny than punk2 and even his &quot;worst&quot; lyrics never affected my enjoyment of the music that much I guess its just taste though
you fucked up on this one
This is actually worse than the mbdtf take
Hard disagree
This is your worst review by far.
I just wish more black and trans artists in the hyperpop community (who are the ones that created the genre anyway) got bigger like this guy
One of the main themes in this album is ego death… did he NOT look deeper into the songs or realize how the album starts off cocky only to become vulnerable as fuck that’s the WHOLEEE point
this definitely 9/10 and brakence is a new breath of fresh air on any newgen genre
Dont care review thaiboy
this is such an odd review from melon, 90% of the time I can see where he’s coming from with his main arguments even if I disagree with them. this review just seems really weird, focuses really hard on the lyrics and egoism of the album instead of the absolutely amazing production and super original sound. <br>and plus the whole point of the album is breaking down the fake egotistical persona as the album progresses to the end, finishing with a song completely stripped of everything besides Brakence and some keys
I feel like you missed one of the main points of the album, while at the same time brakence is trying to flex that he knows he has talent, he’s also talking about struggling with his self obsession.
Old man yells at clouds for 10 minutes
I would understand hyperfocusing on lyrical content if Brakence was just a singer/songwriter singing over other people&#39;s beats but he&#39;s not. Kinda disingenuous to ignore all of his production and instrumentation to focus on just one thing. Seems like in all of Fantanos reactions to Brakence he almost seems to have a grudge or something
your just mad because brakence wont make vinyls
This review makes me realize Fantano is out of touch
I never thought too deeply about the sub-bar bars peppered throughout the album until this review. They just didn&#39;t bother me that much because I&#39;ve viewed the narrative as being introspective of the most haughty and destructible parts of Brakence&#39;s self. Those disgusting lyrics felt more like fractional slice of themself, a repressed one at that, rather than the part they want to present to the world automatically. The album&#39;s an 8/10 for me, perhaps even a 9/10 on a good day.
Quadeca got the same review at a 5 for his FMTY. IDK a five is still pretty decent.
Nah I’m with Anthony this album is corny
Melon jesus i love you but I&#39;m feeling some personal issues were touched with this one😭 this album fucking wacks
Melon, review sam hydes entire career
Brakence: <i>sees the score</i> <br><br><b>Bitch, don’t think you could do me like that</b>
Brakence had an Elden ring line in here, Elden ring won game of the year, so this is album of the year. HOLD THIS L ANTHONY!!!!!!
He is not by any means a great lyricist as far as actual meaning behind the lyrics, but to me I don&#39;t focus on the actual meaning of the lyrics just how they flow and sound musically, which to me Brakence has one of the cleanest flows out there. Too much focus on actual lyrical content can withhold you from appreciating music the way I think it should be, but to each their own. I don&#39;t often find ppl that appreciate music like I do
I&#39;ve been listening to Brakence since the beginning of 2018 and he&#39;s come such a long way. The fact that Fantano is here making a video on his new album unequivocally shitting on it makes me so happy for Brakence. There&#39;s no such thing as bad press. Album is definitely a 9/10 in my books🤷‍♂️
The point of the album is to discuss his toxic ego wtf you think the lyrics are going to be about?
biggest L i’ve ever seen.
L+skill issue+ratio+this album made me almost as sad as seeing ur bald little head give it such a low number.
I agree with another comment on here - this review sounds personal lol. This album is definitely better than a 5. Production alone is insane and the vocals throughout the album were great. Maybe the lyrics were cringe at times but he’s only 21. You can go through any album and find cringe lyrics throughout if you really wanted to
It definitely feels like an album of a 20 yr old who was thrown into fame, it’s completely normal for someone with his mental problems to feel conflicting emotions between being arrogant and self conscious, his albums feel like we’re growing up with him and by the time he’s 25 he’s going to be dominating the industry, he’s so far ahead musically that once hes fully matured there won’t be anything stopping him
imagine giving this a 5/10 🤡🤡🤡
I think you&#39;re missing the point. He&#39;s super egotistic. But he realized that and his whole worldview got kinda thrown upside down. In the last track, I believe he&#39;s singing to his past self, not some lover
lmao at brakences fan base being triggered
Something tells me fanfandango doesn’t like the lyrics :(
I was so excited to see melon review this, only to be so saddened and shocked by this grandpa take on it
huge L
This kid made the melon feel things. Deeply.
Hear me out, I thought the lyrics were perfect for the emotional message of the album. He is continuously leaning into narcissistic traits—grandiosity, emptiness, projection, obsessive intense emotion, hyping up, sinking down, being impacted easily by attention, glamorizing vices, dysfunction, and high-functioning depression—all of which fabricating a masked personally describing their world through a shallow lens. He contrasts that with more thoughtful lyrics about what’s underneath the bravado. I thought it worked. He uses a lot of slang for his age group that’s socially accepted and popular, reinforcing that mask that he’s part of the in-crowd and has amassed fandom, yet underneath that is an isolated feeling person. Thanks for reading!
BUT THE PRODUXTIPN IS GOOOD THE PRODUCIO. IS THE GOOD THE PRODYCITON IS GKOD S NFNGNGNGMFAAAAAA THE PRODUCTION IS GOOD
Nooooo melon
After the drake situation, i thougjt this guy just loves a bit of trolling. No i see thats just all he is
If you’re gonna focus so much on the lyrics… you should probably focus on ALL of the lyrics. You completely missed the theme of the album. Album is a 9/10 for me.
deepfake and hypochondriac are both 10/10 by themselves
L <br>8.5/10
horrible take by the guy to tries to trick people into believing he has a complex understanding of music by casually throwing in random audio engineering terminology into his reviews, smooth brain take per the usual
the only thing this nigga complains about is the lyrics over and over. this is a near perfect album 9/10
I couldn&#39;t agree less with this review.. imo a solid 9/10 lol
Could you do a album review on Hawaii Part II by Miracle Musical?
L fantano
You dug way to deep on your perceived issues of the lyrics imo. Yeah I agree, the lyrics were a bit cringy at times but I really don&#39;t think you&#39;re viewing the album from the intended perspective and instead is just taking everything at face value. <br>I think it&#39;s pretty clear that alot of the lyrics are him putting up a toxic facade, kind of like an alterego tryna protect himself from coming to terms with how he&#39;s actually feeling (ex: argyle). I think he&#39;s pretty self aware of how alot of the lyrics are toxic and egotistical. He has described himself as a nerd so to think he&#39;s trying to have this kind of &quot;bad boy&quot; vibe is a little uninformed.<br><br>Also, I think you gave him alot less credit for the production and structure of the songs than you should&#39;ve (Also his singing). <br>Yeah, you did mention them but I think your opinion of the lyrics greatly overshadowed them. Being the young age he is and producing an album of this quality mostly himself is crazy. (Gotta give credit to Wyatt Otis tho)<br><br>Edit:<br>Wanna add this aswell. I know that the following might sound pretentious and cringe but I wanted to write it out anyway.<br>I don&#39;t really think you totally understand brakence as an artist. Being the age he is, the generation he&#39;s apart of and the musical community he&#39;s apart of the perspective can be pretty different from your own. (Even though he isn&#39;t really fully Hyperpop the fan bases overlap alot).<br><br>This new age of internet music is more self aware than I think alot of older generations realize, even though the music at face value can seem self absorbed.<br>To fully &quot;get&quot; and appreciate the music I think you would&#39;ve had to grow up in the same generation and be apart of the same community.<br><br>(Sorry for the long ass comment lol. I do appreciate you reviewing the album, and I appreciate you as a music reviewer but brakence is my favorites artist so i really felt like voicing my take haha).
never disagreed with a review more. the lyrics is decent and the album is an 8 MINIMUM
so the comments are making it clear that this is indeed a rare melon L
Alpha Games Bloc Party would be great to hear about
Easy 9/10 actually makes melon lose credibility to rate this album any lower
Can you review Half Alive please?
massive L melon
5/10... this one of my fav albums this year 9/10 for me... production is insane, i like the lyrics i think he is a great songwriter and his voice is sooo good
no
I gave it 3/10. This album is kinda cringe for me.
If next up is wells album i hope i dont hear another l
BOOOOOO MELON BOOOO
Overrated and overhyped af, glad melon didn&#39;t fall for it
Pretty much all of the lyrical examples you gave were bars, and I haven&#39;t even heard the record yet. That ego line is hard
this is even worst than the red light review
Album of the year for me
Hearing Fantano recount some of the lyrics, I was thinking they were terrible. But now listening to the album, they’re barely even an issue and are even endearing in some cases. Not sure why the lyric complaint takes up 80% of the review when the rest of the album is so good
Antonio el Fantas
You actually kinda put into words the cognitive dissonance I feel while listening to Brakence.
Hear me out quadeca X Brakence collab album would be insane
Knew I shouldn&#39;t have clicked this lmao. A fucking 5 bro 🥲😂. This album is amazing. Of course lyrics sound stupid you purposely say em stupid. I love the lyrics they hit right for me. Do better Melon.
Not too late to delete this, Anthony
Breakdance? Okay b-boy, quite unusual name
damn I thought i overanalysed music, of course it&#39;s nice to understand why you do/don&#39;t like music but just imagine how much music melon has to listen to to find something he can&#39;t find a problem with. Like, i stg at times he&#39;s just looking for a reason to hate on music. Yeah there might be a few lazy bars on the record but overall the songs are well produced, the guitars are nice af and personally I like what brakence does with his vocals particurarly on caffiene and 5g. 5 ain&#39;t bad tho
Big fat L for Melon
it feels like people are misunderstanding the point of these musical reviews, Fantano doesn’t have the time to delve into each and every albums context and backstory so he takes it as face value like many people do on their first listen of any album
Do you have an actual problem with the music or with Brakence&#39;s attitude? Cause a 5/10 is a bit harsh for you not agreeing on him flexing, while enough artists do this unsollicited.
Anyone else noticed (beyond just this review) that Fantano&#39;s been relying on repeating lyrics in a goofy accent without explanation as &quot;criticism&quot; lately?<br><br>If clipping or someone said &quot;if this is the time just cut out the IV, taking that blade just do it nike&quot; he could just have easily gone on a rant saying its an interesting point about what it means to turn a personality into a brand; the artist&#39;s expectation of happiness when reaching fame (having &quot;their time&quot;) compared to the reality of losing your sense of self to the point of suicidal thoughts, all in effort to commercialise your personality....<br><br>Not saying he had to agree that it&#39;s a cool idea to put in a song or &quot;good&quot; poetry, but for a dude who made a name for himself by avoiding shallow &quot;criticism&quot; in his reviews like repeating lyrics in a goofy voice, its strange to see
Damn i feel like melon harped on the lyrics way too hard lmao. Punk2 for the record is a masterpiece to me, and this project had such an interesting sound and experience.
Anthony I’m giving up on your taste after this.
the last time he used the intro “brainthony draintano” was for NF’s “CLOUDS” mixtape which also received a 5
LMFAOOOO IMAGINE LETTING LYRICS IMPACT YOUR SCORE THIS MUCH<br>literally the least important part of music
Let me fix that for you<br><br>*9/10
L opinion
It&#39;s okay, everyone has to fall out of touch at some point. You had a good run Anthony
What is this cringe psychoanalysis of the lyrics? I want to hear you about the production/mix/music, god damn. You don’t deeply dissect  artists like Future for lyrics being toxic, so why so much here? Clearly brakence is , to some extent, playing a character; why is that such a hard concept to understand, to the point that you blow a whole 10 minute review talking about unhealthy ego levels and shit? Would’ve loved to hear your opinions on the transition/sound choices to the album but okay 💀
This is giving me flashbacks to the Instant Gratification review, very similar criticism and comments
NAAUUURR PLEEEEASE HE&#39;S A STAR
possibly the worst review anthony has ever done
I didn&#39;t really do a deep dive into the lyrics or themes but the lyrics I heard that fantano pointed out definitely made him come across kinda unlikable.<br><br>Still an excellent musician and producer though
L  LL L LL L
i know anthony saying this but still secretly listening to brakence in his room corner at night and crying to the new album
L opinion
i haven&#39;t listened to this guy, i just like watching emo rap fans take Ls
This review hurt my feelings. Please consider them moving forward.
1k diskikes keep it up
This is the most short sighted review for an album I have seen so far💀
what a terrible review listen to a again
The more I reviews I watch melon do the more I notice that he&#39;ll tend to get hung up on something he particularly doesn&#39;t like about an album and it really seems like it puts blinders on him for the rest of what an album is doing. Ya the lyrics aren&#39;t stunning (they aren&#39;t offensively bad either they get the job done) but the production the vocals they goddamn CADENCE CHANGES like this album is so so special. One thing can really kill an album for him and it seems kinda short sighted
I honestly get what fantano is saying, the fake self awareness shtick about your toxicity is very annoying but compare this to the many times he’s reviewed a rap album with super toxic lyrics that he’s given a pass to and it seems like bs, the interesting production alone should have pushed it past a 5
Anthony can you do a video on the Mormon Church being false.  Just do like thirty hours of research and then make a video on it.
I think that Fantano badly misunderstood the album and that’s why he cant enjoy it all the way<br><br>Hypochondriac is Brakence on a psychedelic trip as evidenced by the trippy album/single art, his numerous references to psychedelics throughout the album and the production that makes me feel like I’m on 5gs of mushrooms.<br><br>The different voices that he hears are the different parts of his consciousness or entities in the psychedelic realm; depending on your believes about those substances. And the glitchy production is a metaphor for his ego, or the fake shit in his life/personality. Caffeine is the glitchiest one and the one where he is most out of touch and the title track is where he is the most soberminded.<br><br> As the album progresses his ego diminishes as psychedelics tend to do to you. starting with caffeine where his ego is gi-fucking-normous. His ego diminishes and is able to see the bigger picture of his mental health. He finds small things like his relationship is toxic on Venus fly trap and teeth, the impact of technology on 5g, or the negative self-talk on cbd and argyle. He finds big things on deepfake like how his whole personalities fake. Then on introvert he has a complete ego death and is “successfully eradicated” and he finds the true reasons for his unhappiness is that he is chasing love from a person who won’t give it to him.<br><br>Am I making sense?<br><br>Fantano’s main problems with this record is that it’s centered around oneself and sad in all the worst ways. But the point is that he went on a spiritual journey to reveal the toxic effects of these thought patterns. And that’s what makes it so good, so cohesive. Weather his psychedelic experiences are productive is a different question but they sure are interesting. I think that if Fantano would actually understand this album he would enjoy it allot more than a light 5.<br><br>I get that the lyrics are not perfect, but I can look past that to give this album a 9/10.
He should be giving more credit to Brakence&#39;s production on the album. The album has many moments where it shines a spotlight on the sound design and melon boy doesn&#39;t give it the credit it deserves.
It makes me happy to see nearly every comment disagreeing with this take.
oh god this is hyperpop&#39;s mbdtf isn&#39;t it
Brakence: <b>has depression/mental health issues and writes songs about it</b><br><br>Bald man: bad vibe = bad song
this dude is just reading into his lyrics way too much and getting mad about it for 10 minutes
I personally love caffeine was disheartened to see it was your least favorite track. Thought the energy was addicting!
This vid was a miss for sure…
i was like sure, 5/10, ok<br><br>least favorite CAFFEINE???? This is 69&#39;s chocolate all over again<br><br>whats wrong with you melonie
friendly reminder this loser gave rainbow bridge 3 like a fuckin 8 💀💀💀
L melon this album is great<br>ur opinion ig😭
Needed a few “ siege the means of production “ to get a 9. Ask Ashenpire.
wrong
I respect your opinion but this is genuinely one of my favorite albums in a long while. His music genuinely makes you think. Yeah some of the lyrics are woe is me and a little drawn out but like you said about his commentary about egoism, he lays it out on the table in a way that you can picture certain scenarios play out. <br>I also genuinely wish you talked more about production side as well. I felt as if every energy change in his voice happened at the exact same time in the beat and it is honestly insane how he can convey his emotion perfectly in the composition of the actual music as well as the vocal side
You should listen to the new single by Das Kope. Think you’d dig his work
I.... Agree🌟
You&#39;re too stuck up on the lyrics, like I get it some of it is kinda cheesy but the production is so good that the lyrics are overlooked entirely. And it&#39;s not even all the lyrics either. It&#39;s clear you only listened to this album once through. Bad take
Criminal. Actually a 10/10
Brakence and randy himself sorta seperate on this album lyrically which makes it confusing sometimes. honestly tho, i loved the concept he was getting at and it&#39;s 100% a 7 or higher
I&#39;m really glad I went to the comments first for this video. Decided to check out the album after seeing all the glowing praise, and absolutely loved it. Couldn&#39;t disagree with this review more
very embarrassing on ur part ❤❤ do better
LOOOOL
I was expecting a 7
Anthony I think you need to listen to it again
Never heard of this dude before but this review made me check him out - dude&#39;s production was actually insanely good. The lyrics were mid but I didnt really care cuz it sounded great
nah he&#39;s right. vocals lyrics aren&#39;t good and I can&#39;t get into the voice
This but not Aries last year? L
the narcissism is a character dude cmon
ok that nike bar was flames man come on🤣🤣
oh hell naw
He just….. like….completely missed the mark here. I mean usually I can see where he’s coming from when I disagree with a review but this is bad. He completely missed what I understand the “concept” of the album to be and that caused him to get upset about the intentionally conceited lyrics. And he also says the album is not unique and is closer to owl city than aphex twin. But also says the production is amazing throughout and very unique, etc , etc. just a miss all around from Anthony
this video pissed me off
The production isn’t even experimental….
Man, gen z has been really coming with the terrible fucking names lately, destroy lonely, delete zeke/Jane remover, brakence etc
i love brakence, i agree that sometimes his lyrics are kind of cringe lol but i think he puts a bit of irony into the lyrics
I thought the self-awareness and reflection was pretty present/evident throughout. Really don’t think its fair to score a record this harshly because of how the artist’s “personality” comes off.
Voldemort
joker mode
The feedback about argyle was outta pocket man. You clearly did not pay attention the lyrics at all
it’s crazy that you can only talk about the lyrics on an album largely production driven and still miss the point. he’s saying that the lyrics are too egotistical and weird at times and it makes him come off as crazy. but the album is called hyperchondriac, my reading of it is he’s stuck feeling this way for so long but he knows it’s wrong so he starts questioning himself and why he’s having these neurotic thoughts and feelings in the first place
Horrible take
Usually Fantano underrates great stuff because it&#39;s too experimental or lacks production value but this one doesn&#39;t hit either of those boxes. Not gonna age well melon!
Had to stop by and say this is the fattest L you have ever taken and could perhaps make every other opinion you&#39;ve ever had invalid
Genuinely the worst Fantano take I’ve witnessed. Nice opinion, sorry it’s wrong though
bro thought he was on to something and missed the entire point of the album LOL
when it came out i was thinking it was kinda mid tbh 6/10 not for your specific reasons but mostly because it felt like any narrative choices on the Lp like the samples where thrown in to try and impress instead of make it better and just took me out of it (the writing was also very much annoying when i would try and pay attention to what he was saying)
this album was garbage it scores lower for me
Old melon is showing his age. L/10
love the postal service in the background. classic review incoming?
brakence is the brent faiyaz of indie pop
✍️✍️✍️✍️✍️
tbh I agree with this review largely but Caffeine is the actually best song on the album imo. The production is cool but the vocals and lyrics are kinda embarrassing at times.
L take I can’t trust you anymore
Great album review.
Only person I’ve seen not love this dude , let me check out the album and see what’s up
It seemed like you were onto the story, I think the whole album is the thoughts in his head (like a stream of consciousness, rather than a narrative).<br><br>The whole album starts with an acid trip and I think the lyrics are a series of non-sequiters. Kind of like Naive Melody by talking heads.
BOY THIS REVIEW CRAZY
L
He finally said his name right
naaah lil bro you tweaking 💀 a 5??? 💀
Granted I’m a huge fantano fan, but I’ve never seen the comments flame this man so hard.
really likked the album but i cant say i disagree with this video
Easy 9/10 for me. Brakence’s music always stands out. Seriously inspiring.
a 5/10 is generous <br>Brankence is truly one of the worst artists of this generation.
Where tf is Thaiboy
Major L fantano
common fantano L

Hey, I&#39;ll take it. Remember when he was an EDEN clone to the public? Well now Brakence got a higher score than EDEN. so.... That&#39;s a win!
Brakence da goat
Common Melon L
issa 7 to me
I love brakence and am dissapointed that he gave it a 5 9/10 for me
I don’t see why lyrics coming off as antisocial and ego centric should be a problem.
This is the nicest a fantano comment section has been after he gives an album a low score
I give this review a light 4 to strong 3
I agree. Introvert, CBD and Teeth I liked. Lyrics in times are very silly. Production is very interesting though and imo carried a lot of the shortcomings of album.
bald2death
He DEFINITELY did not understand the actual premise of the album and why some of the lyrics are how they are. Disappointing for an album review.
9.5 out of 10 for me for sure. staple album for the genre
At least he pronounces brakence properly now
We&#39;re gonna remember this review for awhile
I love you Melon but this ain’t it. Not even a little
this might be one of your worst reviews since mac miller swimming
people are so hung up on a number score its ridiculous, maybe idk listen to what he says or something lol
I will completely agree there&#39;s some corny lines across the project (elden ring bar is perfect example) but the ego related lines you have an issue with, to me felt self aware and mocking of his own persona. Especially from the perspective of the albums concept, you are listening to an alien like extraction of his feelings following a rise to fame and relationship overall culminating in an ego death. I don&#39;t think its meant to be interpreted as &quot;these are my thoughts and beliefs&quot; but rather an alien view of the many feelings felt during all of this. Which I think is best painted by the overbearing angsty lyrics.<br>And even if I&#39;m reading into that wrong, it&#39;s definitely not enough to taint the album&#39;s production and overall creativity to a 5/10? is it? <br>This album is an 8 or even 9 in my eyes cause the only shortcomings were a few lyrical moments that pulled me out of it briefly and even then I have to applaud the ambitious concept especially with all the outside teasers and world he&#39;s tried to develop prior to the album.
I don&#39;t rly get what people see in Brakence, I&#39;ve never been able to stand his voice
Bro a 5??!!!
you interpreted argyle so wrong it&#39;s honestly impressive
I feel like he missed the point of his music because he wanted to find something wrong with it.
you missed the entire point of the album so hard it&#39;s genuinely impressive
Yeah this one hit id give it a 7 on some of theses songs he dropped some shit
Honestly, I had never even heard of brakence before this album dropped, and I just heard teeth randomly and I haven&#39;t been able to stop listening today this album since. Melon is tripping in this review.
This is so sad. Dude finds one thing he doesn’t like about the album and bases his whole review off of it rather than acknowledging it and moving on to acknowledge the other aspects of the album. Easy 9/10 for me
Misread as brokencyde at first, never been so diappointed in my life
this might be the worst fantano take ever
i think we already know brakence is not his vibe. 5/10 from fantano is honestly a W.
How could you be so off with this one ?
I personally would give this an 8/10 I think the lyrics can be a bit quirky or idiosyncratic at times and really aren&#39;t the strong suit on the album but his production vastly oversteps the poor choice in lyricism you so heavily pointed out. The cohesion on the album also provides a superior listening experience when contrasted to his previous album. I think you focused very heavily on the lyrics in this case but I can understand why when they are really outlandish at times.
LISTEN everybody saying he doesn’t understand the ego death concept ; your wrong he literally touches on the ego death concept several times . He gets it , i just feel like he can’t get past the lyrics . He praises the album the whole time on a production level but he can’t get past the lyrics even tho he understands the concept . I think he’s annoyed by him for whatever reason , that being said  5/10 is way too harsh . But it’s his opinion / his channel and at the end of the day that’s all it is
Maybe I’m old too but I agree with this 100%. I don’t really see this one aging well with his current audience from a lyrical standpoint. Reminds me of something I’d listen to when I was 16, lose my mind over, then revisit 10 years later and realize it wasn’t that deep
Let’s be honest with ourselves. As great as the production is and as cool as the vocals are, the lyrics are bad and Brakence comes off incredibly unlikeable. Saying “don’t listen to him it’s not true” is just dodging genuine criticism that could be used to help grow.
Wow this is such an L
rare melon L
LLLLLL
Tl;dr: Brakence is sonically groundbreaking, but i hate that he knows it…
Thanks for reviewing, but major L this is a 9.5/10 for me
Idk, this was definitely album of the year for me. I think it&#39;s easy to focus on some of the individual weak points in theme and lyricism but the whole album together told a nice story and had flawless production. Not to mention he made the whole thing himself!
That LCD Soundsystem hoodie is fire, makes me want to feel like a teenager
Anthony the type of guy to listen to Ride the Lightning by Metallica and think they&#39;re on death row and knock the album for it
Bro I love the melon, but this is just a wack review. This album is genuinely one of the best of 2022.
Anthonussy fantussy
Sorry melon this album is for 25 year-olds and younger so your opinion is irrelevant
Lots of artists write incredibly conceited lyrics. The thing is, it takes skill and charisma to pull it off. I really enjoyed Quelle Chris&#39;s DEATHFAME from this year. Super conceited lyrics, but he makes it work, it makes me smile when he says all these ridiculously masturbatory things. With THIS album on the other hand... it&#39;s cringe.
Alternate review for those who couldn’t stand to listen to this colossal L: album fantastic, 10/10
basedthony fantano
9.3
Society has progressed past the need for this bald millennials opinions
this and the 22, a million review are the worst 2 reviews on the channel
Bro said joker mode 💀, I think you got a little too caught up with the lyrics man
I’m not mad he says it’s a 5, I don’t even like the album that much<br>I’m mad about WHY he says it’s a 5
generational gap hitting a bit too strong
this was more of an &quot;interpret the albums lyrics&quot; instead of an actual MUSIC review
dont get me wrong hes onto something but i feel like he just doesnt understand mental illness as a concept
Please review Built to Spill
I&#39;ve been thinking that if production is good enough, you can get away with poor lyricism to an extent. It&#39;s also important that the lyrics aren&#39;t outright terrible, and I don&#39;t think these ones are. Mostly just awkwardly worded here and there. I think there&#39;s more interesting things going on here production wise you need to focus on.
Listen. The whole album is ego death. and the beginning is his ego on blast. he is saying all of those things because that&#39;s how he really does think sometimes, but he gets more and more vulnerable overtime.
Too bad Anthony, I already formed my opinion of this album, and it’s one of my favorites of this year
I&#39;ve never seen you hyperfocus on lyrical content so hard and hardly even describe the sound of the music being presented.<br><br>fair enough, the lyrics can be cringe at times.... but a light 5 is frankly absurd
argyle is fire, dun care.
The funniest shit is when anthony Fanta said brakence is a tenor.
we don&#39;t care about no garbage Hyperpop kid post real music like the thaiboy digital back 2 life review!
oh no. he didn&#39;t understand it at all.
holy shit you are a baby boy, rough
EDEN           brakence<br>             🤝                                 <br> fantano not getting it
what the heck man
did NOT expect this review, but im not too surprised. at least it got reviewed, easily a 9/10 for me
🍅🍅🍅
It was a 6 for me that grew into a 7
There it&#39;s something extremely wrong in Melon with a mustache and a hoodie
WRONG.  This is the most advanced music currently in existence.  There&#39;s nobody that could make something of this caliber alone
Totally down when a rapper is about himself and how many women he gets but when a white guy does it, it comes off “egotistical” 😂😂
this has got to be my one of your worst takes
i agree actually. i agree that i wasted 10 min here lol. i mean if u wanna poke fun of the lyrics for being cheesy sometimes it’s fair but for what the concept is and how he’s delivering it with the cadence and tempo, it suits the vibe. similar to how drake said “she said she a lesbian girl me too” , it makes no sense but did we vibe to it? yeah
album is 8/10. Totally agree with Anthony on his points with the lyrical side of things, but when it comes to production the unique sound, I really cant find anything else like it.
The Fantano rule holds true. Low review score = the album is fire. Idk why you guys are surprised about this. He’s trying to be controversial.
Bro ur calling his album pretentious while being even more pretentious yourself!! 👎😂🤣
The absolute worst take. You totally misread the entire thing and his actual meaning with being braggy. He is confident in his music, it&#39;s the rest of his life he is struggling over. His relationships. His addiction to the internet and mindlessly stalking an unrequited love. You didn&#39;t even talk about how it&#39;s all resolved in the last track. Like I am so confused on how someone like you truly missed the point. 9/10 for me. Top 3 albums of the year.
C’mon Tony
My cousin introduced me to brakence right after punk2 dropped, and I gotta be honest, I agree with Melon less and less the older I get. The Mac Miller, Deftones, Tool and $B reviews in particular punch me in the gut, and this is just another I can’t agree with. I can understand not liking how egotistical a good chunk of the album is, and yeah he’s got some wack lines, but his out of the box production and structure adds so much more value than I think you give it credit for. Not to mention, calling the album hypochondriac sells the ending reveal and writing a lot more. It fits the egocentric lyrics like a glove, even if you think it’s just meant to justify everything else that was said. 5 hurts Melon.
this album scratches every itch in my head
Oh.. this review is BAD BAD LMAO 😭
holy shit fantanos biggest L ever wtf
I actually agree with this quite a bit, his vocal delivery also seemed pretty forced and overdone with the high notes and &quot;hardness&quot; for example the start of caffeine. It just got too annoying to the point of halfway through most of the songs I was ready to move on
L Melon
call it a 10 in 10
10 minutes of Anthony being offended by “Brakence’s ego”
sorry melon, but your opinion is wrong and you will now explode
Melon going to war with the zoomer because he has to burst his hyperpop sadboy ego
May you please Review the new Roddy Ricch project
I&#39;m happy brakence is getting recognition and I&#39;m here for his growth as an artist. Every time you play him in front of the homies, you always gotta preface it with &quot;Listen, the production is crisp as hell, but the lyrics WILL get cringe, just try to ignore&quot;. And never, for the love of god, play brakence in front of the hoes. Made that mistake and am currently suffering 3 lawsuits and divorce court. That being said, brakence is definitely one of my guilty pleasures, fun for drives to just jam to. Can&#39;t wait for him to get control of the pen.
Come on melon, we’re waiting for the Sza 7
L + ratio + you care about lyrics too much + get a job
I really enjoy the sound of this record and will continue listening to it for that reason but I can appreciate a lot of the points made here. Maybe this review pays too much attention to the lyrics but if they bother him that much then that&#39;s a valid critique. I mean it&#39;s ultimately just his opinion.
man got so personal with him for no reason LMAO, 9/10 for me imo - i feel like this was waaaay too under-rated
vocals and production should make it at least a 7/10, i don’t think lyrics can bring down the project that much
oof. first review of yours where i think you are so completely out of touch that this isn&#39;t even worth watching completely.<br><br>this review also felt weirdly personal lol
Melon hasn&#39;t tunnel visioned on lyrics this hard like... ever, right?
I think you MEANT to say 10/10. This project was phenomenal, a 5??? really???
MELON THIS IS A TRAVESTY
Its too late melon I already have a very positive opinion of this album
saint anger
worst take i&#39;ve heard in a minute, album is no less than an 9/10 as a whole imo
Damn u know it&#39;s bad when literally the entirety of your own comment section is clowning on you, rip
Review deathconsiousness
9/10 for me, been listening to the whole album repeat since it released last week. My only complaint would have to be that I can&#39;t focus on my assignments cos I start jamming too hard, love brakence&#39;s work !
“Conceited and antisocial” is something he can say very, very frequently about other lyrics, but saved it for this. Melonteresting.
This is a whole new low for you holy shit
bad melon
I respect your review. I think im a fan more of the sound of the music than the actual lyrical structure. The sounds sound good so i like
Bruh the lyrics aren&#39;t even bad idk what ur bald ass is on abt this time, usually you have good takes but i cant get behind this one tony...
I feel like he didn’t give enough credit to the production.  Yeah the bars are kinda cringe but who cares when he’s hitting insane groundbreaking production
first idmthy at a 7 and now this. like i’m genuinely just disappointed
What an L
Unbelievable L taken by Melon here. Different strokes for different folks I guess.
Can anyone who has the dislikes extension tell me what this vid is at?
Now let’s see that dislike number
noooo hOW COULD YOU
Album was a 7 for me tbh
I would probably give it a high 6 or low 7 in my opinion but I agree with pretty much all of fantanos criticism.
this is up there with quads album for me
Brockhampton hasn&#39;t been gone even a full month and Melon is already turning into an Ameer clone
respectfully disagree
nahh i need to kill myself i just HAVE to
You gotta stop reviewing music bruh, continuously posting the worst takes known to man
This isn’t Thaiboy Digitsl 😡
part of what i&#39;m sad was glossed over was his age -- he&#39;s a young guy, even younger when he started amassing tons of initial fame. all of that &#39;nobody&#39;s like brakence&#39; being fed to him so vehemently and so early on his career no doubt influenced a lot of the ego that presented itself in this project and the transition thereafter. the acknowledgement, and subsequent &#39;eradication&#39;, it takes a lot for ppl that young to see their heads getting too large. and i imagine it fucking sucks being that impressionable in front of so many people, but i&#39;m def looking forward to the growth in his next project (something that i think really starts taking form after deepfake)
This is incredibly close to how I felt about Punk 2. Love the sound and energy but good fucking god most of the songs had lyrics that made me wince
Fitting that you wore an LCD Soundsystem hoodie cause you really are losing your edge if you&#39;re giving this a 5 lmao
this is yeezus for 20-year-old white guys
Best album of the year imo
Man y’all really overrating tf outta this album.
You must have only listened to half of the album
I get that he has a bit of an &#39;ego&#39; at times - not sure if it&#39;s actually part of a concept or not, though I&#39;d like to believe that for his sake - but this video feels really demeaning. Fantano really acting like being an artist that&#39;s accomplished as much as Brakence isn&#39;t something to brag about,
dude is 20 years old... its overconfident on purpose, that&#39;s the vibe he created, and that contrasts with the antisocial aspect. Take a breath before my ego pop is a sick line... the over-clipping is fuckin awesome, you wrong on that one... its overly emotional on purpose, that in turn contrasts with the goofy bars, every lyric doesn&#39;t have to be bullet proof, it&#39;s fun music... if you don&#39;t get it just say that... the concept is that an alien entity captured brakence and are harvesting his emotions for energy, also a super sick concept, should&#39;ve seen the extraction teaser for venus fly trap... are you just trying to get more views? Maybe not a 10/10 but it&#39;s definitely nothing less than 8. Good try. You must be so cool for these lyrics to be so whack lmao get over yourself.
so basically good production but bro annoying as fuck
Anthony really showing his age with this one. Idk how he loved songs like &quot;fwb&quot; yet this level of braggadocios lyricism is too much for him.
the &quot;its aoty i just tune out the lyrics&quot; critters are out
yea this is a trash review lmaoo
Can you review the new a boogie album?
i wasn’t expecting fantano to just talk about how much brakence sucked him self off on this record and ignore the concept and the story arch of his ego explored in this album but hey each to their own. i know this is a AOTY for me
LLLLLLLLL
bro took the lyrics way too seriously 💀💀
I love the intrumentation and singing but lyrics matter. They (along with tone of voice and other emotional indicators) convey mood and mood is one of the most important things in music, if not the most important. The mood here just feels too whiny and self centered. Art is self expression, so it matters what the &quot;self&quot; doing the expressing is like.
yo can u review 4s4ki killer in neverland
common L fantano
Honestly 5/10 is not too bad, I personally liked it but these comments made it seem like it was given a 2
i understand the lyrics are lacking on some tracks but honestly it doesnt bring the record down for me the music just hits like CRAZY and nobody is really doing this hyperpop shit like him
Yeah, I didn&#39;t like any of the songs that weren&#39;t already out. The lyrics were cringe. I played punk2 all last year and this just did not hit the same.
The lyrics can be cringe at times but it’s literally the character brakence is showing throughout the album, should’ve literally been obvious when the AI comes in to speak in on introvert. Itd be fine if there was other criticisms that marked it down but to a 5 is outrageous especially since most of the criticisms are just harping on the lyricism and not the songs themselves. Also venus fly trap or 5g not being in the best songs is a travesty
This is my MBDTF
The AI commentary in introvert struck me as what he meant to represent major labels. He would rather make music that HE loves and wants to make instead of serving the purpose of major music industry heads.
I feel like if you&#39;re gonna listen to sadboi hip-hop hyperpop you gotta go into it with the expectation that the lyrics are gonna be emo. Especially when they&#39;re written by a 21 year old lol
For some reason everyone in the comments is is taking about the album and not the fact that melon is wearing a hoodie???
I don’t really get the “egotistical” critique. I feel like a major theme of the album was progressing from being very cocky in the early tracks to being humbled and reflective in the later tracks.<br><br>I personally found the progression the album follows to be beautiful, but I guess to each their own.
didn&#39;t know I was clicking on a lyric review
Definitely agree with most of Melon&#39;s points here about the lyrics being too much. I will say I felt similar when I was 21, so hopefully he grows out of it. Production is a 15/10 tho and am very eagerly awaiting whatever he does next
While I agree sometimes the lyrics aren’t perfect, who listens to electronic hyper pop for lyrics? If I cared about that I would go listen to Kendrick or something. The songs are catchy and production is great, nothing to complain about.
I’m not saying he’s a lyrical genius but light 5 is a bit harsh when that’s pretty much your only criticism. L take personally it’s at least an 8 for me
The whole album is about him letting his guard down.<br><br>The beginning of the album shows the facade he puts on and the bravado. He doesn&#39;t want to be in a relationship. But he is the &quot;bug&quot; that ends up in the Venus Fly Trap(falling for someone). By 5G they&#39;ve broken up and he&#39;s scrolling to distract himself. Preparation is him and the his ex struggling to resolve their issues, and him using psychedelics to cope. By Stung he&#39;s hurt, and it literally &quot;stings&quot;. Argyle is his lowest point of depression, then deepfake he&#39;s being honest with himself. He admits he&#39;s been putting up a guise to protect himself. Introvert and Hypochondriac are both reflective and serve as almost one concept. He&#39;s accepted reality but he slips at the end of introvert and screams how badly he wanted that person. He&#39;s heartbroken. Hypochondriac is the final thought. He just wants some closure. <br><br>This album was literally perfection from every angle. Including the lyrics that have gone over a lot of your heads. Jesus fucking christ.
Oof this is gonna be infamous. Shit is catchy and innovative as hell
this is melons biggest boomer moment to date
This is possibly the worst take of all takes.
Not death grips so bad-Anthony
Holy hell this album is average. Glad at least someone sees it
nah
There&#39;s no inside meaning to this, but I just know in my heart that Quadeca is excited about this one
This review is the 2020&#39;s version of MBDTF
10/10, you’re tripping
just accept that you hate leos anthony
This is very disappointing but I do agree his songwriting could use some work
It&#39;s offensive that you&#39;d put this within 2 points of the Quadeca drop tho
Worst review ever. This is quite literally the best album that&#39;s ever been made and if you don&#39;t think so you should listen to it until you realize you were wrong. Unbelievably pisspoor take.
My problem with this review is he only focused on the lyricism of the album. Not the vocal techniques and complex production Brakence achieved on this. Not to mention the whole record feeling coheive with each song transitioning almost perfectly between each other. <br><br>And I think the lyrics were more written in the perspective of an alter ego type personality instead of a directly his irl thoughts. In my opinion it was a very good narative throughout the album of how ego can tear someone apart.<br><br>High 8 for me personality.
Massive fantano L
It was a nice journey melon, but i bid you farewell
L
I think he definitely misunderstood the meaning of caffeine.
8/10
Been waiting to hear your thoughts on this one, thanks for covering it :) I personally loved the project, but not as much as sminos, both I was looking forward to a lot
A FIVE? i am disgusted
Album was 8 maybe even a 9 out of 10 for me, not sure how someone can listen to half the songs and not be lifted into a different dimension
L
Top 5 worst take to date
This review makes me think he played the album in the background while he was editing or something. Maybe he’ll return to it later on and enjoy it more?
I feel like you harped on one issue for way too long, I do agree the lyrics are cringe worthy at times I don&#39;t think it ruins the experience for me. The production is AMAZING and the vocals are infectious.
i think Melon got the the line about bubblegumpop wrong. it is not meant as a jab, quite the opposite. it&#39;s selfreflective. it&#39;s saying that eventhough he is making poppy music people still can&#39;t help but enjoy it / say it is good. so the whole &quot;Owl City front&quot; kinda falls flat for me
Album of the year
that postal service in the background doing double duty: the owl city comparison and the announcement of them touring today
A BRAKENCE FANTANO REACTION IS HUGE
yes some lyrics cringe, but why ignore such good production 🥹
I have a feeling some of the clips from this review are gonna&#39; end up on a future Fantano Reads Wack Bars video. I can almost see it...
Such a good album. L rating
when viewing the entire album as a progressing story the cocky and arrogant nature of the lyrics in the first half of the album makes so much more sense. because of the underlying story of dealing with growing up in the digital era and the burden of knowledge while still telling a story of dealing with mental illness.
CAFFEINE WORST TRACKS WOOYOTOOYOTOTOTOYOOYOT HWTATATTTTTT WHATTTTTTTTT WHATTTTTT WHATTTT
yup. ur completely right about this one
randy we love ur angsty lyrics pls don’t change
oh wow this a L
astronomical L, wow
Could only stomach about 45sec of Caffeine, this shit is such bad zoomer music. 🤮🤮🤮
this feels a lot more like a personal criticism than it does a review, like almost no attempt to actually look for a concept or storyline and just focusing on some fringe cringy lyrics. weird! but it’s a 10
absolute L here this album is a 8 or 9 /10
Brakence, if you see this, we love you. Don&#39;t listen to this bald man on the internet. Keep being yourself. You are a generational talent and a breath of fresh air. ♥️
Punk2 had less of the lyric issue as it came across as a more humble album and I think with this he traded off earworm intricate humble songwriting for drastically improved production in my opinion
Idk Fantano most of ur views are ight but this is a fat L
Llllllllllllllllllll
L
I’m sorry Melon. I can no longer get my musical opinions from you 😔. It is a sad day.
time to wake up melon
Wait, there were other Elden Ring references in music this year?
insane people still respect this guy’s opinion. i completely understand not giving it a 10, but a 5 is fucking insane
Yeah I get it, lyrically it isnt the most modest or unique thing ever. But the production was insane.
That’s unbelievable melon
I remember Melon saying something about being told about Brakence by someone, but I can’t recall who. I think it was in the weekly track round up where he reviewed Dropout? Regardless, I seriously have to wonder if something happened with that relationship, or has happened between Melon and Brakence behind closed doors, because this review was almost hard to watch. It almost feels like he’s talking about Drake in the midst of their beef, like there’s something personal going on. Got a super weird vibe from this
L
Damn i went to high school with him. Great to see him doing this good with his music
Hypochondriac is a 8/10 bruh
This is the worst take I have ever seen.
A 5/10 seems wild for an album with some of the most niche production of the year - great production at that (regardless of your opinion on its lyrical content).
Basic album
This and the Brockhampton reviews got me thinking Fantano really on bullshit nowadays
‘Lyrics about self-confidence and embracing your corny traits = bad’ <br>-melon
BABY DONT BE MY CRUTCH WHEN THIS SHIT GET GORY
from the creators of &quot;least fav Hellfire track is Eat Men Eat&quot; we have &quot;hypochondriac&#39;s worst is caffeine&quot;<br><br>good review and all, just hard disagree
I kinda got the critiques until you got to deepfake, and I realized you are holding brakences “ego” above literally anything else he did on this project. A lot of the “over inflated ego” is very much tongue and cheek and said ironically or to just fuck around. Even so, his ego is well deserved because he’s gotta be one of the most unique and talented artists coming up right now.
You did not follow the story of this album if you’re calling brakence egotistical
I was surprised by it. Top 3 album of the year for me
This hit personal. Album is a 9/10 for me. Every track hits for me in a few ways. Although their are shortcomings in lyrics, it shouldn&#39;t bring bring an album that far down. To me, I feel as if this album developed a new form of experimentation that works in most ways but in some cases do not. Still love the album from the bottom of my heart, and I cant wait Brakence&#39;s future.
cant believe music didnt start until this album dropped
The lyrics are painful, it&#39;s the very reason why I&#39;ve never been able to get into his music even tho the production and songwriting is phenomenonal
Another L on the Fantano board
L + ratio + ur bald
I can’t wait for him to roast the new Glaive album
okay now we need a brakence interview😂
fw the lcd soundsystem hoodie, where do I get??
ratio
ugh really couldn&#39;t disagree more
6/10 for me, it has dope moments, buts starts to get stale
Loved the album but agree with just about everything fantano said. When you put all those questionable lyrics back to back like that...yeesh. Maybe I&#39;m just getting old.
5/10? You’re a joke buddy
dont agree with the rating, but thank you for doing a video about it
I just wanted to point out that the Nike bar is also a Bladee bar. I feel like it makes it a little more clever than your average nike bar
fantano you have no way of knowing this but im actually performing satanic rituals in hopes you review cities aviv which u totally should!
Plot twist: In case you reviewed it he put the AI woman saying “brakence has been eradicated” solely to teach you how to say his name right
L + ratio + bald
Day 353 of commenting until Brainthony Draintano reviews Carriage House by Woodward and Parker
W album, W review
Worst album cover of the year
I can usually respect this man’s opinion even if I don’t really agree but this is such a fucking L
“Do I have bad vibes?” - every brakence fan
the way you ignored the top notch production, arrangement, cohesiveness and all the good things about the album in this and just focussed on  the lyrics that are clearly not up your alley is insane to me
Brakence goes by they/them pronouns
I don&#39;t think it does embrace egoism, I see it as more of a concept album of the journey of becoming egotistical and bigheaded, and that getting him nowhere because it&#39;s all fake for the sake of it
I really liked the album on the first listen, but when I dove into the lyrics, I was overwhelmed with cringe, and now I find it hard to listen to haha. I&#39;m excited to see what he does in the future though, that production was fire!
disagree hard
Now that nobody wants to defend Ye, Fantano had to drop a new equivalent to the MBDTF review.
you missed the entire point with the lyrics oh my god
Love the melon but this is the biggest L ever. It&#39;s a 10/10. I get that a few of the lyrics aren&#39;t deeply poetic or anything, but they&#39;re not at all the drive for the album.
Bruh the production alone should bring it to an 7 or 8/10 😂 my guy on crack
I dont think Fantano listened to the album as a story or even more than once, him being egotistical is part of the story he laid out and the girl with poison kisses is a manipulative person. It rounds down to introvert at the end of the story where the AI is eradicating brakence, its clearly an overview of his progression as an artist. It shows that brakence split himself as an artist from himself which made him egotistical so the eradication is destroying that split as much as possible. And then hypochondriac is that true brakence/randy combination where he is spilling his emotion and realising he the wrongs he has done. obviously the lyricism isnt the best, but the production makes up for that insanely and i dont think fantano takes it into account. This is at LEAST a 7.
i may be late to comment fantano but that does not reflect my desire for you to review cities aviv - working title for the album secret waters! review it tony or i will unfortunately cry myself to sleep every night for the rest of my life!
Melon I love you, but respectfully you’re underrating this album rlly hard. Easily a strong 7 to light 8 for me.
It&#39;s okay melon, maybe one day you will understand the greatness of brakence
I actually agree with Anthony. It&#39;s instrumentally amazing, but I can&#39;t help thinking how much I&#39;d rather hear other people singing over these beats and instrumentals. I don&#39;t care for his voice and the lyrics are pretty lame. It feels like listening to a high schooler whining for the majority of it.
boy says “a little bit of internet hype” lol he’s clearly out of touch with the size an excitement of and within smaller scenes
bro compared brakence to owl city
Dang, this is definitely a top 5 record of the year for me, but I do agree that some of the lyrics make me raise an eyebrow lmao, but you also gotta get the context in where it’s coming from. Brakence is a young guy born on the internet, and Hyperpop’s typical stylings really lean on that online background so it makes sense one of the pioneers of the sound like Brakence would have his content revolving around it. Sure it’s melodramatic but it always feels genuine, the emotion he brings really heightens the overall experience and grounds what would be an otherwise pretty insane, all over the place project. <br><br>So yeah, L Melon, but I am glad you reviewed it nonetheless :))))
L honestly
not as good as quadecas album but still enjoy  it
Yeeeeeeaaaaah can’t say I agree
I can&#39;t imagine listening to a hyperpop album and analyzing the lyrics lol
I love this album and glad melon reviewed it even if we disagree on it, totally get why it may not be for him as even I cringe at the drama of hyperpop/glitchcore lyrics. I wasn’t a big fan of brakences older work but this project has me excited for his future
the moral of this story is that you don’t like his personality
apparently hot take according to tiktok but I love the songwriting I just think the production is sooooo fucking annoying like ok we get it u like glitch noises
L take
Fantano w another miss 🙌🙌
its a 10 you nimrod
Idc if he rated it a 5/10, I’m just so proud of my boi brakence starting to get more and more recognition since the time I randomly stumbled upon him on SoundCloud back in 2019 😌. For me, deepfake and introverts are some of the best tracks I’ve heard this year
L take
Im curious to see the dislike on this one...
album of the year 🍉
speechless lmao. this is AOTY for me, thank you for reviewing tho! wish you liked it as much as me 💀
Huge gigantic colossal enormous gargantuan L today Fantano
It&#39;s gonna be alright, Fantano. Just breathe.
Hey Fantano, big fan. This is the worse review you have ever conducted. It is YOUR perspective that needs to change, not brakence.  Please, give the album some more listens and hit us with a redux.
inb4 the comments section starting a riot
I totally agree with you and I find your 5 a bit generous. I don&#39;t know how you managed to listen to every song fully.
Well damn. I wasn&#39;t expecting this low of a score, this is probably my AOTY and easily a 9 or above from me. Mind you, lyrics are probably the last thing I focus on when it comes to music so figures.
Biggest L take. I can only see you turning back your opinion on this album on twitter
I dislike this album 👍
Thaiboy review Thaiboy review Thaiboy review Thaiboy review Thaiboy review
One of the fav albums of the year and I pretty much agree with everything said lol, if the music was anything less than incredible I don&#39;t think I&#39;d be able to get past the lyrics but I tune out the awful lines.
it is hard to ignore the lyrics, but if you do, this shit is awesome.
One of the rare L fantano takes
This guy has Patrick Beverley energy
Ngl this is easily my favourite album of the year
HUGE L
When TF is the nfr collaboration?
i disagree tbh, prob one of my favorite albums this year
deepfake slander and not mentioning the outro is crazy
Weird that in one breath melon talks about how he doesn’t want to judge someone’s outlet to showcase their feelings and emotions, and then in another breath talks about how those feelings are invalid for the other 10 minutes of the video lol
worst fantano L of the year
one of the best writers OUT and you just said that shit
Today, We Riot In The Streets.
I hope Brakence will go the Quadeca route and take this criticism to heart, and then make a 10/10 masterpiece that will get a 7/10 from melon<br>EDIT: I really love this record, and I don&#39;t really care what Melon gives these albums. It&#39;d just be cool to see a similar leap in production and song writing as Quad had between FMTY and IDMTHY.
WHAT.
y u no emo
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iirPux8sPGA&amp;t=269">4:29</a> No clue what this means…
I have not met a brakence fan I liked being around
Remember, he gave MBDTF a 5 as well
No.
this man is too old to listen to brokanco!!!!!!!!
bro no
cant wait to read these comments
are the lyrics really bad enough to take such a cutting-edge powerful sonic experience down to simply a light 5?
fattest L you’ve ever taken
ego death
u missed the entire point of the project melon
Guys mbdtf got a 6 so this is basically an 11
Probably your worst review
my thoughts on the album were that it was a clean breath of fresh air from brakence and generally is better then punk2 but the way he mixed reggae drums in on stung is very cool, its s very very good album and i can agree with some of the sentiment from anthony but i do feel like the next brakence album will be exciting to say the least.
Damn fantano really putting the <b>L</b> in melon
not cool bro
Stung makes this album at least a 6 melon did you not get the memo????????
If this was a instrumental album It wouldve been an easy 8
There gonna be a diss track on the next Brakence album
nah wtf
im pissed off at this one melon
common anthony L
i liked this album but knew this was coming and all the criticisms make sense
This review almost got personal jesus christ lmao. I get that the lyrics aren&#39;t top notch, but it&#39;s easily the most nuanced hyperpop project out there, especially since most artists in the genre don&#39;t even drop full coherent albums. Idk, I think there&#39;s a lot to be desired from the production/vocals alone, but to each their own yo&#39;
De las pocas veces que estoy de acuerdo
Decided to listen to some of the album since everyone&#39;s mad at the low score anndddd it&#39;s just ok. The music really didn&#39;t make me feel much at all.
deepfake is one of my favorite songs this year
8/10 for sure. But thank you for reviewing this album and getting it some recognition, hopefully for the better. I agree with the lyrics being kind of cringe at times (maybe we are just old- I’m 32) - but not enough to detract from how great everything else is. Production is crazy, unbelievably catchy, great vocals, variety in styles, does all his own shit. He’s very talented. I’m seeing him live next week.
what an awful take
this is my MBDTF
so this is how kanye fans felt after the mbdtf review
MASSIVE L WTF
Melon: I think this album is well written, excellently composed and deftly executed.<br><br>Me: So you like it?<br><br>Melon: I hate the hyper pop egoism philosophical stance the album takes so light 5<br><br>Me: Wtf
Hit this LP with an 80. I really like the shit this album does. It&#39;s interesting and the vocals hit the perfect spot when im feeling unique midwest emo shit. A 5 seems low to me. But well crafted opinions all around. Love from WA
Huuuuggeee L fantano
CAFFEINE AND VENUS FLY TRAP ARE BEST SONGS IVE HEARD WHAT THE HELL.
I respect your opinion but this makes me wanna spit all over the floor
Wasn’t expecting this
Wow I haven&#39;t disagreed this hard with fantano in a while. This album hits on every level for me.
im sorry melon but i already made up my mind<br>i love this album
Brakence is just hyperpop post malone imo
Sorry melon , this is in ur top 10 Ls for me
Nahh it&#39;s good as
For reference the average score of this album on AOTY is 80/100. I haven’t heard it yet but I just know this is gonna cause a hell of a stir.
review the new matmos album man, thing&#39;s been out for so long and it&#39;s deserving of coverage
i thought that said bearface
Melon just gave this a 5 cuz he cant do the griddy
L melon
meLon
bro accidently rated it dived by 2 lmao, its not divide by two day anthony you silly goose lol lmao lol lmaoo lol
IM SO HAPPY YOURE EVEN ACKNOWLEDGING HIM
The best part of the album was the wombo combo sample. Brings it up to a 10 for me 🤷
5/10 😭
Totally agree. Man has talent but is so full of himself (and not in a funny braggadocious way)
expected higher, dang<br>album was amazing though, definitely aoty contender for me
Another poignant review. You are very perceptive.
Anthony is drained to the core now
caffeine being worst track is classic fatweeniedoodle. genuinely one of the best albums of the year
😭😭😭😭😭
We almost had an L free year melon, better luck next year
I never thought I’d have a MBDTF moment until now
One of your biggest L’s ever.
This review is objectively bad.
it&#39;s actually pronounced &quot;brah-ken-say&quot;
hoodie melon rare melon
HOW IS CAFFEINE YOUR LEAST FAVORITE
cant a white boy from ohio get one win in this cruel world?
Can&#39;t wait for the R. Kelly Review, I heard its a masterpiece !!!! /s
The lyrics are great though what
haha funny joke review melon! now do the real review where you give it a 10 😁
Melon. Saying 100 gecs better over and over is not a review.
sorry melon, your opinion is wrong this time around
braktano
Brakence’s falsetto scratches my brain perfectly
Wow very surprised you actually reviewed it! Definitely agree that the production is amazing and the lyrics are a tad over melodramatic. Know he can make better and greater things!
This actually the worst outcome the lyrics are my favorite part😭
And this why I&#39;m happy the Destroy Lonely fans leaked your divorce papers
I feel like Brakence is definitely watching 👀
this shit boutta get gory mr fantano
Wrakence
Long reviews are back! You’re gonna get killed for this tho
Fantano posts the worst reviews on December because he hates the holidays
This is worse than 9/11
a 5/10 mathematically simplifies to a 1/2
you would&#39;ve given it a 10 if it was called hypochondrimelon
Least favorite track: Caffeine<br><br>????????????????????
bro gives breakdance a 5/10 like ok bro do one
I‘ve never commented on one of your reviews but that score hurts man
Bald
i had the same issue with the midwxst ep i liked them both but hyperpop lyrics just generally aren’t very good
oof
Just because this album was a 5/10 doesn’t mean you can just give it a 5/10 Anthony
I’m just glad you started saying his name right
at least a 6 melon YOU HAD ONE JOB
Still waiting on the thaiboy review melon. Also this is at least a 7 come on!!!
Ok now I’m mad
CAFFEINE IS SO GOOD THOOO
I don’t agree at all im just happy you reviewed it. Personally an 8/10 for me
bro needs to chill out with the 5s
What a great video!
unironically melon’s biggest L of the year
Bruh. Caffeine is a banger.
FIRST 🍉💗
L. Don&#39;t listen to the lyrics
this is my mbdtf moment
Anthony just because you don’t like germs doesn’t mean you can give this album a 0/10
bababooey first bald boy!!!
