hi everyone breathing drain Tano here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of this new breakage record hypochondriac this is a brand new project from singer songwriter producer multi-instrumentalist break-ins who has been building quite the organic Following over the past few years breaking out with tracks like fuckboy and FWB in the thick of the pandemic 2020. these tracks and more ended up gracing the very cut and dry album that he uh dropped immediately after Punk two whose tracklist was so short it just didn't really feel like a super complete introduction to break-ins and his full potential however hypochondriac seems to be that much more thorough and robust entrance that I was hoping for when I had first come across his music as yes this record over here kind of gives us the a fullest picture of breakinson's musical makeup which is a pretty unique one at that as we have a lot of emo inspired vocals lyrics and songwriting underscored by glitchy pop production and whips of math rock guitars as well as hip-hop beats there's also the matter of break-ins's very husky tenor which has a lot of vibrato on it much of the time plus he processes it in a way on his tracks that gives it um like a part synthetic part humanoid quality getting into the record itself it did manage to be the multi-genre fusion experience that I hoped it would right from the first track we have melodramatic lead vocals calling out over Punchy beats and Matthew guitar Loops a standout hook as well with all I can do to make me get over you which I am singing very badly the only thing that makes me hold back on the track quite a bit is um some of the lyrics where break-ins goes on saying things like why you want a link I'd rather finger [ __ ] strings I don't know how to be a lust King no I don't want to be intimate you want me playing you like an instrument I mean Different Strokes for different folks not everybody needs to be DT F the moment that they're propositioned but the tone of these lyrics and others on this track just comes across a very conceited and maybe even slightly anti-social even slightly obsessed when you look at some of the more braggadocious bars on the track about being a trendy boy who's making checks to continue funding his uh big Pants music projects and if there was ever any doubt that his feelings were kind of leaning in this direction we have the following cut caffeine which goes full ego trip as break-ins says how this [ __ ] obvious to you I'm not even 21 my music be the snobbyist somehow I'm gonna get it done him calling his own music snobby is kind of a tell and not in the way that he thinks it is because it's clear he's trying to get across that he's truly on to something groundbreaking here but I don't think that could be farther from the truth there's even a moment on the opening track where he takes a jab at bubblegum pop as if he has more in common with Aphex Twin than Owl City and believe me it's the opposite which inherently there's nothing wrong with but like have a sense of where you are guy and look it's sad that this energy is like just spilling out all over this track and many others because it often ruins perfectly good and very Cutting Edge production not to mention the mix of Vibes on these tracks becomes a bit silly when he's working in these random kooky samples from the internet including the Wombo Combo reaction okay keeping up with that true emo Spirit the song Venus flytrap is about a girl that he is deeply obsessed with and she's playing him he can't resist her she's got kisses laced with poison still one of the catchier and Slicker cuts on the record even if some of the lyrical content is uh kind of the same story with the track teeth although on this one break and says ego is under the microscope again his Newfound Fame sees him mixing self-expression with self-obsession he later follows this up with a bar where he is fighting for his life like the ring is Eldon Jesus it's it's a hard game yes I get it but ugh he also says that he's gonna take a breath before his ego Goes Pop why why off this smidge of Internet hype you're literally out here on your record making one of the worst Elden ring references most obvious mind you of the year how did we get here the track is still not without its merits there are some points where lyrically he does make some interesting metaphors about being objectified as a performer but then he instantly undermines it with moments like I hit Ctrl alt delete and yet I can't stop manufacturing hate again it's sad because the production is is generally pretty good and break-ins also seems to know his way around a good song structure but I'm not going to sit here and let him launder these completely awful bars through uh some good tunes and beats intellectual greed switches things up with one of the more rock driven instrumentals on the lp the drums and guitars on this one are on 10 though I'm not too crazy about the production sounding a little too blown out the vocals are especially passionate on this one too as Breakin sings about all the things that he wanted out of success coming with his music be it money Fame uh everyone under his Reign it's a music career it's not a dictatorship granted this track feels more like a commentary on egoism than an outright Embrace of it but uh only slightly break-ins also leans a bit too hard into all of these uh cookie pitch vocals on the following 5G and while there is a solid tune at the core of preparation exercise the Glitchy sped up passages around the midpoint and then the dejected Ambi and pop passages to follow are just kind of disjointed and obnoxious following this up though is the track CBD which I legitimately think is a great song fantastic song even if it is a little woe is me cause no one cares for me except me still the chorus is smooth it's funky it's one of the better pop hooks I've heard this year many of the bars on the track are free of the usual toxicity on the album though I do think breakings enjoys his uh Lone Wolf Joker mode uh a little more than he would like to let on though he does subject us to a lot of uh strange bits of emotional bitterness on the song stung which I love and respect this track's genius musical transition from the previous track very smooth totally seamless the wavy arpeggio beds throughout the track also set a perfect stage for break-ins to go into this personal musical monologue which again great in concept great in concept but uh it's utterly ruined with bars like if this is the time cut out the IV taken that blade just just do it Nike and with Argyle The Narrative of this track I'm such a bad boy I didn't even love you I was pretending the whole time I don't want a girl I don't even want a man my only friend is whatever I'm tripping on look everyone deserves an outlet for their feelings I don't come on here to delegitimize the emotions going into this track I just don't think they're being um explored from a very healthy place is what I'm saying which also comes through on the track deep fake as well even though the keys and the falsetto vocals have kind of a beautiful bonivare-ass quality to them on the intro narratively the track does see break-ins acknowledging his ego and talking about how his personality uh was fake now that his ego has been popped however this realization doesn't see him kind of replacing that with anything better as the Tantrum he's throwing over this very powerful progression and uh beat is really just in here sword in my opinion though I suppose in a way it does bring things to a very explosive end and sets things up for some of the revelations on the track introvert which I think is genuinely one of the more well-crafted songs on the lp even if it is couched in a lot of the same woe is me deprecation the cute country s beats and guitar passages are quite nice we have a section of more silly sound effects which is eventually met with this uh woman speaking she sounds like she's some kind of like AI or computer program or something saying break-ins has been successfully eradicated he would rather make selfish art than serve a higher purpose has has he been deleted were we just experiencing this like Angry emo boy simulation the entire time what is going on here uh and is this just an attempt to like post Hawk justify like all of the uh crappy Vibes and attitudes and perspectives throughout the album up to this point oh it's like bad and I know it's bad and I've acknowledged that it's bad uh because I've I've been deleted I guess but like truth be told there's a lot of selfish art being made out there every day even if break-ins is acknowledging that at this point on the album the fact that he takes himself as like a prime example of doing that uh just again is another example of the ego being shown on the record even though it's trying to actively work against being egotistical in this moment and show at least a modicum of self-awareness look there's nothing inherently wrong with an album that is uh centered around oneself or or even just kind of being sad but in this instance uh due to perspective due to philosophy due to uh whatever it translates in the worst way even if the genre combinations the songwriting and production generally on this thing are pretty good and if what self-awareness we do see on this record uh from break-ins is true and real and genuine next project will move on to something else in terms of perspective and truly flush the egoism that this album is very obviously embracing but simultaneously saying that's bad I'm feeling a light too decent five on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best or the best what should I review next hit the like if you like Please Subscribe and please don't cry hit the Bell as well over here next to my head is
