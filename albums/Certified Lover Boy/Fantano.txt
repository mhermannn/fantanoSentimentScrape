hi everyone knowthony way tiano here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of this new drake album certified lover boy this is a brand new lp from aubry graham or drake toronto's very own six god is back with his sixth album after getting a pandemic pushback with the half-baked darkling demo tapes serving as a sort of placeholder in the meantime this record came to us with absolutely no teasers and quickly took shape seemingly in reaction to drake's ongoing beef with kanye west which flared up once again after a feature verse that drake dropped on the new trippy red album and if that backstory seems too convoluted for you to care we're just getting started please now there are multiple lines off this record that could easily be read as shots at kanye west as well as the near entirety of 7 am at bridal path which might seem insignificant but i feel like for this review it's important to note just how much this rivalry between drake and kanye consumes drake pusha t's devastating diss track the story of adidon may be a few years old at this point and drake's numbers may be as impressive as they've ever been but thanks to that whole ordeal we now have access to this section of drake's life that suddenly he's so open and honest about as if his honesty hasn't just been a series of omissions up until this point not only that but he now has to make being the world famous rapper who had an unplanned pregnancy a part of his brand and while i appreciate drake putting on a game face and embracing the realities of fatherhood his actions still speak very loudly to an insecurity he obviously has around how all of this came out drake seems more infatuated with the whole thing than he did on scorpion maybe because around that time he wanted personally and mentally for their in his music to be at least like some distance from all that considering it just happened but now on no friends in the industry drake is bringing back that if you're reading this it's too late energy type of vibe and dropping beef bars as if we don't remember how 2018 played out and look not to portray kanye and pusha in this situation as 100 in the right 100 angels or 100 honest because it's beef but look as much of a distraction and a focus all of this is uh right now it's not the reason clb is such a dud of a record and why that is we may never know the real answer but from an outside perspective it seems like a lot of it could have to do with a lack of inspiration something that's been looming larger and larger and larger on drake's project since he dropped the dreadfully boring views from the six and certified loverboy i think is the most punishing of these 90-minute marathons that drake has been dropping as of late and that's mostly due to a lack of memorable songs and even memorable performances from drake himself like he is legitimately outshined by every feature on this project even the ones that don't even sound like they're trying all that hard hello travis scott the record does have a pretty decent kickoff though with the song champagne poetry it's dramatic there's a beat switch it's got kind of that tuscan leather energy to it the sound of the track is good but the first few lines give us an idea of what we're going to be in for for the entirety of this record and that's a lot of putting up fronts and a lot of gaslighting as drake says i've been hot since the birth of my son i remain unfazed trust worse has been done when you are literally so obviously phased that you cannot get off of this topic the continued responses and mentions and engagements in this ongoing feud yeah that's that's you being phased bro and again look i think the performance on this track is good i love the chipmunk soul on the instrumental but pretty much this entire track is just meant to convince us that drake is effortlessly winning while everyone around him is struggling and there is an extent to which that is true because drake does continue to do a lot of numbers and get a lot of engagement despite little to no effort on this record the following track poppy's home features more dramatic soul samples along with bars meant to provoke the rap world as if drake is some kind of chaotic sitcom character walking on to set to audience applause here drake is clearly relishing his spot at the top he is excited that his existence angers people he is dropping more dad bars talking about supermodels doing coke the first leg of the track is not bad but i have no idea why he buries the momentum of the song into a weird little nicki minaj appearance that's not a verse and then from there kind of plays it out with a long-winded montel jordan section the whole thing feels like two-thirds of a song really i don't know why drake couldn't like finish it off as strong as he started but overall this track does feel like a real like puff out your chest kind of moment which plays out really weird as we transition into the very weak and and not puff your chest out girls like girls where drake claims girls like girls where i'm from which i'm not sure is this an indictment of the men of toronto or is this a lack of understanding um that they're lesbians in every city around the world considering that drake thinks liking women as well makes him a lesbian maybe it's the latter now i know drake is just joking obviously but this is not a joke that has played uh much of anywhere relevant since like 2001. but honestly this track's greatest sin is being so goddamn boring that while i'm listening to it i kind of want to just like hook a car battery up to my nuts just to get some kind of mental stimulation the b is too bland for words and on top of it drake could not sound more unenthusiastic the only portion of the track that grabs any real attention is the little baby feature on it and he's rapping on this track like his life depends on it the effort gap between drake and his collaborators on this record continues on to the song in the bible with givion as well as little dirk they are obviously the most interesting things about the song and it's hard for them not to be considering just how awful drake's vocal lines on this track are they don't seem to make sense at all at least to me over this beat drake also sounding very low energy on the song love all and of course like he was not going to drop a better verse than jay-z on the song even with hove operating at 50 thankfully fair trade with travis scott sees things picking up a little bit drake's flows here are actually catchy and melodic direct and hooky i've been losing friends and finding peace may seem like a stereotypical drake bar at this point but it's still the best hook this album has to offer thus far the slow psychedelic instrumental transition into travis's section of the track is pretty sick as well overall i'll say i think it's a good track for this record but in the grander scheme of things it's pretty low impact i mean reminder these are the two guys that brought a sicko mode next we have the record's first real attempt at dropping a banger a huge single way too sexy which um is one of the most embarrassing things drake has ever released in my opinion there is an awful right said fred sample of too sexy which goes right into an interpolation with future on the chorus the idea itself for the track is horrendous and somehow drake makes it even worse with a very underwritten verse anyway if chance the rapper can't live down hot shower i see no reason why drake should get to like revel in this especially when future becomes pretty much the draw for the track and young thug is seen exiting through the back of the song quietly like he didn't even want you to know he was there then on the song tsu things turn a little bit weird yeah it may have another drab beat tedious flow whole song is about a stripper kind of trying to get her life together which i guess is fine but then the narrative kind of shifts into drake uh supporting her financially for sexual favors she kind of has a business uh plan in mind for something the song itself the situation it portrays it seems benign too benign to actually be interesting especially with the second half of the track sounding so comatose but if we're being serious and honest about what this track portrays is this not just drake taking advantage of the power dynamic that his money and fame and influence affords him by manipulating someone who's not in the best spot economically and obviously has little to no family support as you say in the song which is kind of weird and sort of tone deaf and i guess in a way it's ironic that there is like a little r kelly writer credit on this track too because of a accidental instrumental incorporation following this we have the song in too deep which is at least one of a few tracks that just did not need to be here especially since this one doesn't really seem like it knows what it wants to do does it want to be a slow dramatic missing you ballad with chugging guitars or does it want to be a psych-trap banger where drake once again plays second fiddle to future over an instrumental that sounds like a leftover from travis scott's astro world the song piped down feels more essential by comparison but nothing new narratively for drake in the grander scheme of things as we pretty much have passionate angry drake here who is fed up with the thanklessness of this relationship of this romantic dynamic on your ass like back pockets is one of many clever lines on this thing and he is absolutely convincing as he is pretty much begging uh how much money do i have to throw down for you to pipe down how many bars do i have to write how many pens do i have to go through still though this just kind of feels like a track that drake could have easily dropped five years ago and it would have sounded exactly in line with everything he was doing then so even if this track is decent it does feel indicative of drake being sort of in a state of arrested development he can't seem to progress past this stage narratively same with no friends in the industry which i think is a banger if i'm not really paying attention to the content because drake continues to sling this no friends lone wolf angle despite the fact that there are some serious mental disconnects that come with it at this point like when it comes to the beef stuff on the track drake is a paper tiger clearly why he's even continuing to talk like this i don't know and right now who are you not friends with this is a star-studded track list and you've repeatedly collaborated with future once again who you did an entire record with like clearly you are close to some of the biggest names in the industry to some degree you even had to bury the hatchet with kid cudi to get him on the record so honestly even if this track is kind of fun to listen to i just don't want to buy into the facade anymore i don't care and to the degree that what drake is saying here is true it's weird that after all of these years of saying this it doesn't dawn on him that maybe he might be a part of the problem to some degree the song knife talk continues this mean momentum underscored by an instrumental with a deadly classic memphis sound a project pat is even on the track amazingly he does a great job on the front end and a 21 savage is in the mix too so yes it does have that classic memphis spooky sound to it but with more ornate and i guess cinematic instrumentation laced into the beat it's another track that i think is good for this record but uh in the grander scheme of things i guess is just okay in 2021 i guess i'm just not really excited to hear drake cosplay as a gangster pretty much 7 a.m on bridal path is diary drake once again you know the tone of voice he gets the energy he delivers whenever we have a track title that features a location and a time and look there's some biting bars on this track for sure like in response to a kanye dropping drake's address on instagram he says give that address to your driver make it your destination instead of just a post out of desperation i won't disagree that kanye posting that was petty as and pretty childish but the fact that kanye mostly sidestepped this whole thing in any direct or long-winded way on his new record versus drake over here who was like totally obsessing over the whole exchange for multiple bars on certified loverboy i think it illustrates a lot about how each artist approaches their craft when they're making a record because kanye drops a record about constance you know his mother his faith things that are going to be significant to him and relevant for a very long time meanwhile drake exists purely in the now he is for the instant drama and for whatever is happening in the moment and  whether or not it's actually relevant to anybody in like six years erase my mind is kind of like a really heavenly weekend rip off with a lot of harp laced into the instrumental and i know drake's early stuff inspired abel's work for sure but i feel like i'd rather listen to abel do this sound at this point especially if it's not going to be done well with the song fountains drake continues to push these chilly canadian versions of dancehall and afrobeat on us and yeah it's probably the most soulless and uninspired and boring song he's dropped in this vein ever get along better with ty dolla sign is a pretty decent classic r b and rat blend there are some excellent vocal lines on the track really heavy instrumental but not a lot of variation i feel like i'm just kind of experiencing the same portion of the song over and over and over granted it's a good portion of the song but it would feel a lot better if it didn't come off so one dimensional then you only live twice is an instant banger featuring lil wayne and rick ross and in my opinion this is the only spot on the record when it comes to meeting the moment and actually like delivering the energy that i guess like matches that of his features and his guests yeah drake shows up i don't know why it took this long 18 tracks to get some objective heat on this thing but that's the state that we're in but again while it is great i feel like drake is kind of functioning off an old formula here he's bringing a very like you know take care lord nose type of vibe and formula here but maybe with uh just like the tempo a bit higher on the cutty track let's be honest it's pretty one-dimensional as well cuddy is the draw drake is nowhere near as interesting and their chemistry is just nowhere to be seen even though i'm happy that uh the two of them buried the hatchet uh it's not like they're making magic here and then for whatever reason the still and spacey r b of  fans sounds exactly like a song off of the weeknd's house of balloons but like a totally one and it's also kind of hilarious that drake uses this track with the weakened sound on it to make a commentary on toxic masculinity a little bit it's like half the time drake doesn't know whether or not he wants to rip off himself or rip off some other artist on this project he's just kind of switching back and forth between that over and over and then with the finishing track we pretty much close up shop with a diary drake once again gonna be honest and say at this point on the record you've given me zero reason to care about anything that you're saying anything that you're trying to pitch me in terms of like this is what's happening in my life this is what is going through my mind i don't care i don't care you are only as interesting as the music and the songs that are accompanying your narrative once again i'll sum this up by saying this is just a very uninspired record from drake not a whole lot going on here creatively a few decent tracks here and there but uh nothing coming together into a great project here and uh yeah feeling a light three on this one tran position have you given this record listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should i review next hit
