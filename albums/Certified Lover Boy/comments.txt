CERTIFIED PEDOPHILE
Now onto the Kendrick beef. ❤
The album cover is a reference to how he has kids with tons of different women only to abandon them until he can&#39;t anymore.
We  all know if it was called “to pimp a lesbian” he would give it 10/10
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=800">13:20</a>
Good lord, this album will be never looked at the same, EVER again.
“Certified Lover Boy, certified pedophile, wah wah wah wah wah wah”
You only live twice drake is a James Bond fan did he put a Sean Connery nod or Ian Fleming rap in there
Kendrick: 😡 <br>Drake: 🤬<br>Kanye: 💃🕺🪩<br>Hotel: Trivago

Certified Boy Lover
I never heard this album but yebba&#39;s heartbreak is a masterpiece
I gave the album a listen, with the expectation it would have that drake sound, i mean Kendrick said it best, drake on the melodies, unmatched. This shit here was not it. Aw hell naw
In light of the recent events, I interpret the cover as an admission of how many baby mamas he&#39;s hiding.

certified boy lover
Sounds like No Friends in The Industry aged like wine. He’s just 3 years ahead of his time
the take on no friends in the industry now...
Melon would have given it a 10 if it was called &quot;to pimp a lover boy&quot;
12 baby moms is wild
certified boy lover
“I know that drake’s early work inspired Abel’s quite a bit”<br><br>I think you’ve got that backwards Melon
It would be a 10/10 if it was called to pimp a lover boy
The best part of this album was Travis&#39; short spot on fair trade💀💀💀
if this was called to certify a lover boy by kendrake lamar he would’ve given it a 3
This is one of ugliest covers ever made.
Im sure Drake wrote this
Bro this album fukin sucks<br>great rating! /srs
Elevator ahh music
Ik a lot of ppl do not like clb and say it’s bad but personally I notice that a lot of 16-18 year olds like it, at least from what I seen, im 16 and all my friends fw clb heavy with songs like, champagne poetry,fair trade, n 2 deep,tsu, no friends in the industry,fucking fans, get along better, yebbas heartbreak, knife talk ofc, pipe down, girls want girls, in the Bible, race my mind,imy2, way 2 sexy(yes I know 😭)and fountains. maybe it just appealed to more of that age demographic, to people like us we will probably see this album as a classic listening to songs like n 2 deep singing out loud together or playing basketball to knife talk. Although my top 2 is thank me later then take care. It’s really interesting how everybody perceived the album but hey I guess that’s how it goes with long running artists and older fans. I would give the album a 8.5 tbh but to each their own 🤷‍♂️
It would be a 10 if it were called &quot;Certified To Pimp a Butterfly&quot;
Views was good
Бро ты похож на пришелеца
This isn&#39;t even a review. This is a confrontation of Drake&#39;s manhood😆
🗑️
Be warned This guy likes introspective hip hop...only. He&#39;s viewing drake through a misplaced lens.
Damn I hate &quot;Way 2 sexy&quot;
bad review<br>to pimp a lover boy is a 11 u dumass <br>im gonna subscribe
Melon did NOT just call Views a snooze fest. The disrespect
this is a very fair review imo, but i love N 2 Deep ngl
This album is for tik tok cringe kids
DIS ALBUM SOO GOOOD YALL TRIPPIN AFFFFFF AAHHH
the agenda this guy has against drake is insane
I like you only live twice from this album. But that’s only because Rick Ross and lil Wayne carried it
🤰🏽🤰🏻🤰🏾🤰🏻<br><br>🤰🏿🤰🏽🤰🏽🤰🏼<br><br>🤰🏾🤰🏾🤰🏽🤰🏿
Fantano you are a straight nerd. Maybe if you tried to have fun listening to these songs and not being a weirdo you would be happy in your life.
You a nerd
CLB is easily an 8 maybe 9 yall just some nerds
It would be 10/10 if it was called “ To Pimp a Lover Boy “
Correctly assessed
This album is terrible, in my opinion, but if anyone else likes it then I won’t judge.
I’m a little sad he didn’t touch on Yebba’s contributions, she was top notch
This was not an album review, this was Drake’s assassination with no remorse 😅
I love the cover art for this album, you should look up the guy who made it. You’ll definitely get some kicks out of it
Loudthony sightano
Bro the album cover is so tacky 😭😭😭
Drake - Certified Boy Lover
certified boy lover
This album is as long as Lift Your Skinny Fists....let that shit sink in!
i played this review over the instrumental of NY State of Mind II and it was perfectly on beat
Champagne Poetry is good
Knife Talk makes this album a certified banger ya fool
13000th comment, as an extreme drake stan, I don&#39;t agree with any of this, good review though
8.5/10
Hook a car battery to your  what now?
After finishing this album, I felt so unaccomplished. The most mid album I’ve ever listened to. Only like 4 standout songs and all were with features outshining Drake
Certified boy lover
Way 2 sexy and knife talk are my guilty pleasure songs tbh
Looking back at the album it aien´t  that bad tbh,  just mid. A few good songs, a few misses and a few solid ones. Overall a mixed back but it aien´t that bad compared to when I first listended to it. At least a 5-6/10 and definetly better than Honestly Nevermind
tbh i love this album
This album might’ve been decent if he just cut down the majority of the track list
He ripped off BROCKHAMPTON on the album cover lmao
I can’t remember a single Drake song.
Certified Lover Boy
this album has no skips btw
Nothany waytano made me cry 😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭
I absolutely love this album 😣
CLB is his 12th Album, not his sixth 😊
drake got some good samples, but why his songs in the after-morelife era sound so boring ahh? Any of his debuts beats the modern ones, and I mean Views ain&#39;t a good album too, it&#39;s rarely seen such a guy dropping his level so many times until Her Loss brought him back a little
I think Drake in 2011 would be embarrassed of himself now.
This album is literally the best album Ive ever heard. Is fire wherever you look at it. He is paying child support for all of those kids, relax.
Bro went +3 points
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=364">6:04</a>
And now his new album is trash.....RIP Drake&#39;s career.....
this album has aged well
7.5/10 since it’s grown on me, but I like your perspective.
The album was incredible. A daily listen
Champagne Poetry is top 10 drake tho
Bro I’m looking back at ur review u smokin crack dis album a 8/10
aw man just started the video and
This comment thread is absolutely savage.
I don&#39;t listen to Drake at all but this is a very bad album cover. A kindergarten do that cover
In Summary, CLB Is More Of The Same…
IM FEELING A LIGHT 1 ON YOUR EXISTENCE
Drake beef be like &quot;Drake dropped this album in response to the drama with Lil Pibby Flibby where he was featured on the verse of Goofy Hours to follow up the Duppy Fluppy Diss Track he dropped 9 months ago&quot;
&quot;Drake and his collaborators&quot; for some reason that sounds so sinister 🤣
So this is what drake is still mad about? 🙄
If I was Drake and I saw this review, I would write Melon a DM and tell him that his existance was a light to decent 1
Gave it 1 soft vegan cookie
Terrible review drake deserves a light to decent 9.<br><br>Your existence is a light 1.<br>And the 1 is cause vou are alive.<br>And cause you somehow wifed a black girl<br>I&#39;m feeling a light to decent<br>1 on your existence
I thought this was a pretty fair review. Although I love N 2 Deep
this review is finally relevant once again lmao - drake mad
You can tell theneedledrop hates drake. It&#39;s not drake&#39;s fault he is the most popping artist since the early 2010&#39;s. Judge him by the same standards you do everyone else please...
you know drakes ass was watching this with his fists clenched and holding back tears in order for him to dm melon
The fact Drake probably knows about the car battery to the nuts joke is sending me rn
Drake really became a Certified Boy Lover on this album
more like certified lesbian boy
I still cannot get over that cover art.  like - really? omega kek
Girls like girls. Omgosh , awful song. Can&#39;t get through it.<br>Same for way too sexy.<br><br>But TSU is fire tho cmon.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=361">6:01</a>
The Cudi track is the only good one here.
I just realized this; any reason you skipped reviewing Yebba&#39;s heartbreak? I love that song, doesn&#39;t really fit on the album but it&#39;s a fantastic saddening piece.
Certified Goofy ahh Boy Lover really is my favourite album
I liked yebbas heartbreak it’s good
Certified Nonce
this getting a 3 and no stylist getting a 1 is mean
ALBUM REVIEW OF EXOCIETY DECEPTION FALLS AND KILL BILL SNOWGLOBE THEORY.
you can feel Anthony&#39;s disappointment as he comes to terms with the fact that he&#39;ll have to listen and review to Drake&#39;s albums... forever.
Drake cosplaying as a gangster 😂
🤰🏽🤰🏻🤰🏾🤰🏻<br><br>🤰🏿🤰🏽🤰🏽🤰🏼<br><br>🤰🏾🤰🏾🤰🏽🤰🏿
The woman who song yebba heartbreak is from the same place as me west Memphis!!!!!!
Certified Groomer Boy.
come home the kids miss you
Drake is great I&#39;m a Canadian and he is great
Drake is Naruto Kanye is Sasuke
Maybe Drake should start naming all his songs and albums with locations and times, maybe then he&#39;ll make a classic
W
I like this album
Honestly music critics are a joke if the shit sounds good then it’s good simple as that. I bet you 90% of this guys viewers won’t like clppings which hosts im pretty sure his favourite album ever or atleast close.
If it would’ve been called “certified melon boy” it would’ve been a 10/10
this is exactly what I think about Drake and the relevance of his current music and lyrics 💯 well said Anthony!!
Look this guy has nothing bad to say about this album. My man is bringing up the past while this album it&#39;s just music. It&#39;s fire. He&#39;s just hating. He didn&#39;t even review any of the songs
I love dark demo lane; I feel like his unofficial releases give more value than the official at this point.
You only gave this album a 3/10 because all of the songs were boring, uninspired and generic.
Lets be honest, Drake would easily eat Kanye alive in a rap battle. Kanye gets embarrassed by Pete Davidson every single back and forth. All he can do is send Pusha T to ghostwrite his songs and diss Pete Davidson if it ever comes to that
Props to Anthony for reviewing CLB the way he has, takes real patience to be elaborate about how Drake fucked up lmaoooo<br><br>Knife Talk is so good when it starts. 21 really doesn&#39;t pull any punches.....and then you have that Drake verse 🤦🏽🤦🏽🤦🏽
This is Drake&#39;s plan instead of making better music he will just keep making trash albums until CLB looks better by comparison 😂😂
This got the same rating as the Jack Harlow album 💀💀💀💀
Man we all deserve this album an apology after hearing Honestly Nevermind
Drake woulda fell off a longass time ago if he hadnt grown a rly nice beard no homo
Who would’ve thought in 2021 that we’d be getting a WORSE Drake album only 9 months after Certified Lover Boy. Those who thought this was rock bottom underestimated champagne papi
Certified boy lover
Drake has always had the most shitty unrelateable lyrics about himself, this album sucked but ain’t new
I loved girls want girls but that&#39;s about it
Rated it a 3 because he missed the opportunity when the girl said she’s lesbian and didn’t say me too
Drake’s new album is better than tpab. Kys Drake haters!
Honestly Drakes CLB is much better then honestly never mind
came here to watch this again, as I await the review for the super boring, cringey, &quot;honestly nevermind&quot; album
That might be the worst cover art of any album ever
Imy2 is sick though 🥲
if drake is glad to have haters, i am more than happy to oblige
&quot;Girls like girls where I&#39;m from&quot; I didn&#39;t know Toronto was Themyscrya
Well taking in the fact that The Weeknd actually wrote most of the tracks on “Take Care” and gave them to Drake because he was an unknown artist at the time but wanted his music heard, he more than likely wrote Fucking Fans with enough of drake’s input to make it lackluster
truly an OVO thing
you just hate lesbians
I dunno I kinda liked it. It’s a vibe 🤷‍♂️🔥
Are those a bunch of pregnant girls on the cover?
you only live twice goes crazy ngl
If they named this album certified donda boy it would have been a 10/10
Drake slaps
Whomever wrote this drake album did a bad job 👍
Hmmmm... decent 2...
Can you please put time stamps on your videos somewhere on the screen for each song?
imy2 is the only decent track. probably because it&#39;s more like cudi ft Drake.. than the other way around
It doesn&#39;t matter about your first week sales when the album isn&#39;t even mentioned not even a full year later.
None of his albums are a classic. Sorry
Certified boy lover
why tf is a nerd reviewing rap music
Mid
I don&#39;t like the direction that Drake has gone in, since everything after Take Care, which was his finest work in my opinion. Scorpion had 1 good track, which was God&#39;s Plan, but I hated the sound of everything else on that record. This new one is better than Scorpion, but still doesn&#39;t hold a candle to Take Care.
This is a great album.
Now, 7 months later. I heard knife talk once in a youtube short and sadly i remember way 2 sexy forever. Other than that i cant remember one song or say anything positive. Light 1. Seriously. Hype has died, pusha bodied you once a again by not giving you any attention on a 9/10 album. Aubrey a L machine
N2 Deep is easily the best son
Drakes been spittng the same bars since his debut, and I&#39;ve just not liked his music the past 5 Years
hook a car battery to my nuts just to get some kind of mental stimulation... wow
Ngl this album was a snoozer but surprised knife talk and champagne poetry weren’t in his favorites
Don’t sleep on Yebba’s Heartbreak y’all
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=360">6:00</a> 💀💀💀💀
Man shit on the whole album, it’s not his best by far but the songs are good 😂 imo. If you like drake a lot you just do like this album. Not as much as IYRTITL or nothing was the same or take care etc. but I do listen to these songs. Love all is a banger, TSU is a banger, Champagne poetry slaps etc etc.
At least Drake’s worst album is a billion times better than Kanye’s best album 😂
CERTIFIED BOY LOVER
Drake kinda sounds like deluxe Nav on this album
based
This whole album was mid.
I don&#39;t KNOW FOR CERTAIN if Pat was there 4 Knife Talk.   Its THE EXACT SAME lyrics from a song he did w/ Juicy J &amp; A$ap called &quot;Feed the Streetz&quot;.  No different inflection, it sounded copy-pasted.  Maybe he got permission to use the snippet, but its lazy as hell regardlesd for a &quot;signature track&quot;.
honestly on first listen i liked this album. i never liked songs like in the bible, fucking fans, or girls want girls but i found the rest of the album enjoyable. but it has absolutely no replay value. only songs i can go back to are champagne poetry, pipe down, you only live twice, and fair trade. maybe love all
First time I agree with you
How much would someone have to pay you to be a production manager for an album?
white boy mid
Drake <br>Ain&#39;t <br>Got <br>Shit <br>On<br>YE
Please listen to Masego he&#39;s more so underground but he made the instrumental from champagne poetry and he used it 10x better
tbh this album was actually really good
Most of drakes albums tend to take time for it to grow on people and age better the older it gets. Champagne poetry, love all, fair trade, tsu, no friends in the industry, 7am on bridle path, race my mind. It ain’t the best drake album but I’d definitely say it’s pretty good or pretty solid instead of saying it’s bad decent or below average.
melon head
Awful review.
The next Drake album might do better than this because the expectation is going to be high as hell and he’s needed right now.
just realized this man has given clb the same vote as luv is rage 2... <br>if Uzi is a 3 clb is -10 bruh
I really like fair trade
bravo!
Sometimes u have to see something in a emotional way dude
Now I wish he used ghostwriters
What is Drake trying to do with the cover?<br><br>I think he went to H&amp;M, found out he didn&#39;t have much money left after his last 2 laughable albums and could only afford 12 different sweaters
My favorite thing to do when I’m feeling down is watching Fantano review Drake albums because
I thought the album was good af
I hate how people use gaslighting as a replacement for “lie”
Did you guys remember when Eminem said in the song Zeus where he is giving Drake an advice that people are gonna turn on him when he is even more successful. Look where Drake right now dropped CLB which is trash/disappointing doesn&#39;t live to it&#39;s hype. Well Drake never learn his lesson.
The album cover looks like an NFT
drakes the lesbian icon we need in this world tbh
Tbh... this album slaps tho it has some good ass bangers. Fair trade is legit goes hard af
Some of it is really bad but the vast majority is fine. There&#39;s nothing great and a lot of it is bordering on good but, the majority is fine. Some of the lyrics are abysmal.. like the lesbian one.
Certified Lover Boy (3) + Donda (7) = 10
yall sleeping on race my mind fr
Drake is my favourite artist but honestly clb is a 6/10
🤰🫄🫃🤰🫄🫃✝️🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧💧🌩🌎☀️🌎🌈🌙☀️🌗☀️🌦🌙🌧🌎🌈☄️🌘
Lets be honest<br><br>The majority of Drake&#39;s fan base, didn&#39;t care about Adidon diss track because they&#39;re not rap fans per sé, they&#39;re pop fans who don&#39;t care
First you say this album is boring and repetitve. Then you say this song is pretty much meant to convince us that Drake is effortlessly winning while everyone around him is struggeling. You think that the record has a pretty decent kick off. However you also say that this is a really catchy song with no good vibes in it. For me the sound of the track is really good. I also love the chipmunk soul on the instrumental and I like the vibe in the song. The lyrics in this song is really good and the part he talked about Kanye West was for me the best part in it. Anyways.I feel your article is very unfair.
This reviewer blows,Drake has never.been greater no drop drip off. Get real dude review the songs theyre good.
Certified lover boy more like certified lullaby
So views was a great album. Not his best, he didnt force feed 5 singles from it and the production is excellent. The songs blended great for an overall sound<br><br>2. Clb i agree is so boring that it should be sold as sleep music. Clb is drake only album that didnt get better after a few listens. All his albums id put em on repeat even scorpion which is crazy underrated.
In My Opinion: Certified Lover Boy: Decent To Strong 4/10 (OH GOD)<br><br>Fav Tracks: Champagne Poetry, Love All, Fair Trade, Pipe Down, Yebba&#39;s Heartbreak, Race My Mind, You Only Live Twice, IMY2 <br><br>Least Fav: Girls Want Girls (carried by Lil Baby) In The Bible (carried by Lil Durk) Way 2 Sexy, TSU (good song but sounds rapey af), N 2 Deep, No Friends In The Industry, 7AM on Bridle Path, Fucking Fans, The Remorse
That is without a doubt the shittiest, laziest album cover I&#39;ve ever seen.
we love to see it
Favorite Tracks: Way 2 Sexy, Girls Want Girls, Back to Back, Wanted You, Myself, Lose Yourself, Gucci Gang, C.R.E.A.M, King Kunta, Mask Off, Lucid Dreams, Jocelyn Flores, Nas is like, Hit em up, Toosie Slide, and NY State of Mind. 10/10.
Im upset he didnt put tsu in favorite tracks
Nobody cares lmao
Bro i love your reviews! You crack me up. This was definitely  a heaping  pile of  {T r @$ h}
Aubrey Fake Graham
&quot;I was on yo ass like back pockets&quot; -Aubrey Graham......
bro drakes the goat your mad
i personally think race my mind was the best track on this album, everything else is just trying to be a hit
I like drake more than i should but i couldn&#39;t make it past right said fred. Future blows. Over them. Oh well.
Dog Boy gets a 0, but Certified Lover Boy gets a 3. You good, dude?
how does swimming and CLB have the same rating 💀 as well as Sick! and MBDTF, ah fantano you never fail to confuse me
thats a little high
Drakes address is googalible. Was never doxxed.
Feel like Drake was rapping for his dag gone life on clb. And for that I give him <br>SHUT THE FLUCK UP!! I WAS WRITING THIS AS YOU SAID &quot;HE WAS RAPPING LIKE HIS LIFE DEPENDED ON IT&quot; !!! YEOOOOOOO that&#39;s wild oh my gosh<br>AHHAHAHAHHAJA gtfoh!😆<br><br>Dang
4 tracks in.... I just knew I was 4 tracks in because I checked my phone. Shit so boring I couldn&#39;t go any further. A 3 is actually pretty generous
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=458">7:38</a>
I very sparingly use this term but by golly that is one seriously cringe-inducing album cover.
I enjoyed this record very much, just a couple skips.<br><br><br><br>Unsubscribed.
Still better than Gunna
I’d rather listen to Loverboy.
basically new rap albums only get 3s unless they’re super lyrical😂😂
Keep in mind that this is half of what Anthony gave MBDTF
3 was generous let&#39;s be honest I feel like hip hop has moved, a couple of years ago he constant fire. Now it is so boring, no progression so very bland.
Drake has always been somebody who played a kid in a wheelchair on a popular children’s show pretending to be a rapper
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=361">6:01</a> my favorite part
your nose is so cute
The only song I enjoy is IMY2 and that’s just bc of cudi lol
The most interesting part of this album is when ppl were calling it Certified Boy Lover
I definitely think this is a 1/10 melon man was being soft on this kinda like drake gets soft when their of age
Drake is to rap what Imagine Dragons is to rock
Ngl IMY2 is probably my favorite song on the album
Honestly one of the worst album covers of all time. The album itself is fucking god awful but the cover art is a whole new level of terrible
Drake makes music for people who think wearing Supreme makes you cool
Drake fans likes every song that drake makes
When you Love somebody fr, it can only translate to hate if shit go sour enough. Ain&#39;t even take no time to make up
This man a legitimately a Drake hater 😂😂😂
I honestly keep watching this review because it’s just hilarious atp lmao
This album is the epitome of &#39;I&#39;m not crying, you&#39;re crying!&#39;
Drake is tiresome old sounding rapper, he needs to go back to just singing.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=364">6:04</a>
I&#39;m here for the Drake slander
me:<br><br><br><br>random kid: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=10">0:10</a>
Godamn
I&#39;m actually impressed by Anthony&#39;s capacity to endure bad music. My mind just becomes completely blank whenever i hear a single bad song. I couldn&#39;t bring myself to pay that much attention to a whole album to critique it in such detail.<br>Props to you for torturing yourself for our entertainment and information :D
Every time Anthony says &quot;Toronto&#39;s very own&quot; in reference to this man, a small part of me dies
The album sounds like it was written by a 12 yr old 🤣
Its actually a bad album. Except like 3 songs. The man drake just simply put , sings too much. Hypocrisy at its finest with his lyrics too.
Knife Talk was amazing until drake came
now that the dust has settled I can frankly say that this album sucked and after 3 months it has no replay value compared to it’s direct competition - Donda. The only tracks I really enjoy are intro and knife talk
Do Verb T &amp; Illinformed new album „Stuck in Foggy times“ please<br><br>It s modern old school uk hip hop and it slaps while having a message
Reminder this is the same score Apocalypse by Thundercat got
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=365">6:05</a>
When dj Khaled gets a higher score than drake
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=359">5:59</a>
Drake 🗑️
After seeing drake preform this live in LA coliseum. I agree with melon. The crowed wasn&#39;t feeling anything but knife talk and no friends in da industry. The rest were sleepers 😭
Drakes album felt like another COD game, same formula but different coat of paint while Kanye’s felt like the next God of War, TLOU, or Red Dead Redemption II
knife talk is one of those songs that kills me when drake starts rapping.
No way he thinks this is worse than scorpion
A lot of drake haters in here lol
I thought I was one of the few who thought CLB was not very good lol
Only song on this I can listen to is fair trade
Kanye vs Drake fakest beef of all time
The few albums I’ve seen this dude review he pretty much sh*t on them. This guy is a hard man to please when it comes to music. It doesn’t matter what anyone’s opinion is. If you like the way any music sounds, and it makes you feel a certain way then that’s all that matters.
4/10
This record falls apart after Champagne Poetry, minus a few ok pop singles.
Damn zero dislikes!
He called it certified lover boy because he makes out with boys
yall hate, his numbers inflate
Hey, give Drake some credit. He&#39;s trying. He got off his ghostwriting addiction on this album, which is how we got stuff like &quot;say that you&#39;re a lesbian girl me too.&quot;
Let’s be honest, the best bars we heard in this video was Melon’s outro
I don’t care what anyone says, clb was better
Thank you! You could hear how uninspired this guy is on the whole album. The big single is cringey.  No growth or effort for the last 4 albums.
Nice review Anthony, but did you really need to give him a 0/10 just because he&#39;s a lesbian?
Worst Album by Drake.... period.
Why would you even dignify this album with a review
this was a less harsh sounding review for a light 3 than i expected
Clb is just not good when I hear everyone praiseing 2 sexy then u know the album is mah at best
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=363">6:03</a> best melon quote of all time
This album is already aging phenomenally well
never thought he’d one up how boring scorpion was but i was wrong
At least its a much better album than donda
Aint no way yall listening to his opinion.. Aint no way boy
We just gonna ignore the car battery to nuts comment?
2 months later I just have to hard disagree. Minus a few cringe features and a couple boring beats, Drake delivers the vibe I’m looking for. This one will be a grower for sure, and real ones will know it’s above a 6. Pushing 7.
2 months later and the fact that anybody in their right minds prefers this collage of trash and lazy tracks with no heart and soul to them, over Donda, an album that sure has some low points (Junya, Jonah) but also has incredible high points like Jail, off the grid, moon, hurricane, heaven and hell. Not too much an incredible crescendo climax ending with No Child Left Behind
im only now realizing how much of a soyboy he is
There wasn&#39;t 1 bad song on this album it was so 🔥
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=364">6:04</a> pure gold
Anthony , I think YOU are fazed by the engagements of Drake and Kanye , what do you want him to do ? Not talk about his son ?<br>Respect : we will remember you’re reviews for their legendarinousness and brutal truths .
The features were amazing, and i loved some of the production.  but it felt like drake just dragged them dowm
rate my sex playlist :<br>1. Teen X (feat. Future)<br><br>2. Ni**as in Paris<br><br>3. Siiiiiiiilver Surffffffeeeeeeeer intermission<br><br>4. Junya <br><br>5. Junya Pt. 2<br><br>6. JumpOutTheHouse
Rihanna told Bitch Made Fake Drake to GTFOH...JUST BECAUSE...LOL
I love a few tracks off this album <br>1-fair trade <br>2-champane poetry <br>3-papis home <br>4-love all<br>5-7am on bridle path <br>6-no friends in industry<br>7-pipe down<br>8-you only twice
classic melon review. feeling a strong 9 on this
The album cover is horrible
I&#39;ve called the album &quot;certified boy lover&quot; so many times it sounds weird hearing &quot;certified lover boy&quot;
Drake won, numbers don’t lie
Bro this mans just said views is dull like what ight he don’t get it
Album cover definitely needs to be in a future worst of all time vid.
How Drake go from that fire Scary Hours 2 EP to this? That lesbian bar could never top “I had sex, ok?”
Bro even got Donda in the background 😭😭😭
I have an idea for a album, I’m gonna complain about women but also beg women to come back into my life and the cover will just be the pregnant iPhone woman emoji all throughout the album cover. I listened to this album and I wanted to kill myself afterwards
I agree
Somebody had to say it people thought this album was so good
Anyone realize melons using a green screen?
Drake is a white woman in a minimal amount of blackface larping as a gangster
Knife talk is the only track I’ve heard and I was wondering why drake was even on he sounded so soft and out place I mean damn thank god for friends drake
Disgusting album...  Deleted the whole album after 2 listens...... Ew...
Not going to say race my mind is biting Rick james
Drake Paul
No talking fellas. Knife Talk hits really really hard. It wouldn’t have been on the album though. It was meant to be on Savage Mode II. Can’t even believe listening to this song and knowing that it has that troll cover, maaaan forreal 🤯
NO MORE LULLABIES ROCKS!!!!!
papi&#39;s home is dedicated to people like fantano. look at this views on this shit compared to his other videos lol. homie has it as his main video when you open his channel too smh
I don&#39;t think that repeating &quot;donda better&quot; for sixteen minutes and calling drake the n-word for fifty five seconds is a real review but I agree with you
Aye you be outta pocket some times but you was absolutely spot on and fair in this review. CLB was definitely not hitting on shit.
I also thought you only live twice was the only decent track on the record<br><br>Wayne goes in and it does feel like an old drake song. Still a banger.
Fucking stupid. Clb 10/10
I loved the cudi track
I uh…i really like the album
This album has grown on me significantly I think some of the production on these tracks is great and Drakes talented vocal skills shine throughout the entire album I would give this one a 6
Damn….I really liked this album 😅
It would be dope if he reviewed Yebbas album too
I think what really sunk this album is the somewhat lack of thoughtful introspection from Drake. I know that he&#39;s moved on from replicating the sound of Take Care and Nothing Was The Same because he wanted to shift from the perception that he&#39;s a sensitive guy, but his life has significantly changed since those albums and this would&#39;ve been a good time to reflect on his successes and failures. <br><br>In fact, I think CLB could&#39;ve worked as a concept album the way the Weeknd did with After Hours. Perception has always been a thing with Drake, (e.g. Sensitive Drake, Jamaican Drake, Actor Drake, etc.) so why not embrace that perception and work to completely dismantle it through the music, like developing a character arc and such? <br><br>Maybe I&#39;m thinking too hard about it since we already have the final product, so it probably doesn&#39;t matter in the end. It&#39;s just that Drake&#39;s latest catalogue of music is making me lose respect for him as an artist. CLB doesn&#39;t give me the impression that he&#39;s working on maturing his sound or even himself.
When u find drake has beef with kendrick:
Hip hop and rap is dead. It&#39;s just totally lame and uncool. Jump ship, and start listening to Black midi 👍 get behind the actual musicians in this world today.
Great review
Only has knife talk and IMY2 to carry the entire album
Always thought Drake was overrated anyway, he’s popular because it’s popular to like Drake, what a mess
He floods Kendrick Lamar with endless compliments. He floods Drake with endless eternal hate.<br>I never expect anything positive from him about Drake.<br>I hate biased critics
lmao even AOTP scored a higher rating
wtf so Ed Sheeran new album is worse than this trash for you? 😂😂 0/10
never forget that Pusha.T&#39;s disstrack is probably the reason CLB was made
Corny ass raps
We all can see that this guy is not talented at all Industry plant worst part is he’s going to release another 10 albums like this 💩
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=358">5:58</a>
The songs I liked most on this album were the “r&amp;b” style ones, the rest weren’t really all that great
dawg just say u don’t like Drake
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=363">6:03</a> CBT &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; CLB
Craziest thing about this Drake can &quot;half ass&quot; his way to a record and still pull 744 million streams in total. And there&#39;s absolutely nothing these comments section haters can do about it. The man is inevitable
God i was disappointed heavily when drake dropped this. Album cover AND the album was completely awful lazy and took no effort whatsoever
Drake sucks
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=358">5:58</a> you’re welcome homies
Anthony Fantano built Abhu Grhaib.
Certified Lover Boy? More like Certified Sex Offender
Can we talk about how trash that cover is?
I agree
Light 3 is a good rating, its not good. But it has some songs that mightve improved if they put in a bit more work
Nahhh, Way 2 Sexy slaps
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=792">13:12</a> <br><br>The greatest summary of why Drake&#39;s music ages poorly.
Way 2 Sexy is the only good song
Fair Trade so good
I bet he wrote this
I don’t like the album THAT Much… <br>Anthony do not judge the person or words in the song but the melody… Anthony Fontano should make an album and we can rate it who agrees?
“it makes me want to hook a car battery up to my nuts just to get some stimulation” oh my
Well... God&#39;s plan i guess
So drake fanboys just letting “girl you a lesbian, me too” “co parent of the year” “ to get a kid like this” slide… y’all murdered chance tho for talking bout his wife, at least he didn’t hide his wife from the world before putting her in his garbage work.
Ngl i was on kanyes side but CLB had some bangers. Both albums are extremely different and shouldnt be compared if it weren’t for the drama between them. Im also pretty certain melons stupid criticism is the source of him going bald, hate me later
After over a month of listening to BLB and Ronda, I can say you are gay but probably not born that way, maybe you got the moderna vaccince twice or something
This is Drake’s 4th red flannel since Kendrick’s last album.
true opinion from mr fantano
&quot;I&#39;m too sexy&quot; is <b>the worst</b> Drake song I have ever heard, if I&#39;m being honest.<br><br>They took an iconic song, and shat on it.
You are so good at what do
Even a light 3 felt too much
The red flannel shirt means 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩
Trash album<br>Xxxtentacion &gt; drake 🤢🤢
I&#39;ll never listen to a bit of this album, but the cover is a solid fucking 10.  Hilarious!  COTY!
Blackface Drake... Laquana Morris... Alleged Assault... $350,000... Shhh Quiet
I&#39;m going through all your video to just dilike
Dam man always hating on drake you never did positive reviews on him l
Even though I like the album, I do agree with some things you have said (GWG being the main one). However, I do nott agree with the low energy statement. I feel that songs like In The Bible and Love All do well with that low energy kind of rap/singing he is doing
Rare melon W
People need to remember that Russ produces his own beats.
Drake cover art some 🍑, but my god the Kanye fans trying to make the Donda cover seem deep and extremely meaningful is too funny
Drake&#39;s popularity is proof we are surrounded by assholes.
Still better than dark side of the moon
Fantano just hates everything 😕
What a bunch of sh*t. What does childish public fighting with kanye have to do with music? What does moaning about your  personal problems in a recording have to do with music. Hiphop sucks so much.
N 2 deep is slept on
Certified Lullaby
Wow, he didn’t say “Champagne Papi” once
The album cover is so cringe man
Best fantano line to date <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=363">6:03</a>
I love these comments y’all r the GOATS
the rapping on this album is as painful as a dagger in the back
3 is a little low I think he deserves a 4 don&#39;t downplay the album
Funny how drake doesn’t have to try cause there’s no talent anymore to compete and Kanye try’s so hard just to make the same numbers
Certified Melon Lover
The fact that he tried to pull the politically correct card on Girls Want Girls is exactly why this man should not be reviewing rap/hiphop tbh. ITS A JOKE BRO
fantano do a review on Morgondagen Inställd I Brist På Intresse
While Way too Sexy is a trash tier song, I actually enjoyed this album a bit. Girls Want Girls was a vibe despite the awful “you are a lesbian, me too” line. You only live twice was a banger and a half. IMY2 has an amazing hook by kid cudi, dope intro by juice wrld, and drake does good on the song. Fair Trade was just amazing. Papi’s Home was too. I also liked Love All. <br><br>I don’t know lol. I liked what I have heard from this album so far and its only growing on me.<br><br>Meanwhile Donda was rly bad album to me after having listened to Kanye’s previous albums. It was just really boring, and Kanye’s auto-tuned vocals were annoying far more often than they were fun. Finally, he felt like a feature on his own album. <br><br>Ultimately, I do not get this circlejerk surrounding “donda good, certified lover boy trash.” It really seems like a bunch of kanye stans bandwagoning their idol.
CAUSE MY TOP 5 IS DRAKE DRAKE DRAKE DRAKE..........
This album blows
MY TOP FIVE IS DRAKE DRAKE DRAKE
The whole thing shouts <b>First world problems</b>
only vid i&#39;m not angered by recently
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=10">0:10</a> thats one sexy man
bruh wtf im trippin his shirt is moving
It&#39;s only 4 songs here I&#39;d return to.<br><br>Champagne Poetry<br>7AM on Bridle Path<br>You Only Live Twice<br>The Remorse<br><br>The other songs are either uninteresting, carried by its feature, or both.
Tbh this hate review seemed kinda …forced. Album wasn’t bad. Seems like Anthony kinda went in trying to shit on the album
ok but you only live twice slaps
Funny how im coming into this video learning about drake&#39;s whole personal life. I now know more about Drake than I do any other rapper because of this and I don&#39;t like it lol
Kanye is just a real Artist!!!!!!!! Real Talk!!!!!!!
I&#39;m so glad I&#39;m not the only one thing this about the album.
When you&#39;re at the point of basically rehashing Busy Signal&#39;s &quot;I Love Girls that Love Girls,&quot; you know you&#39;ve messed up somewhere along the way.
ill never get over how much i liked Chicago freestyle, still not sure if its cause i like the og Eminem stuff tho
Bro I can’t wait until Drake get’s a NOT GOOD it’s going to be beautiful.
Listen the worst part about both Kanyes and Drakes albums were themselves. That being said, and I don&#39;t even like Kanye very much  but at least Kanye had a couple of good songs on his own. This was average Drake stuff and he got outdone by everyone on the album.
jpro
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=250">4:10</a> yeah it is true 🤣🤣🤣🤣
more like Certified Boy Leaver amirite fellas
Melon is mad that hes not way 2 sexy thats why he gave it a 3.
More like <b>certified cringe boy</b>
i just have to laugh with this vid and comment section... hahahahaha
This guy just regurgitates what he sees on Twitter and y’all listen
the album cover is literally disgusting i don’t care
Drake the type of guy to say his dad can beat up your dad
Drake the type of guy to say “cut it out”
Drake the type of guy to ask a girl out with a note
Drake the type of guy to write everything down in his diary
Drake the type of guy to yell “better luck next time buddy”
Drake the type of guy to do pinky promises
Drake the type of guy to tie his jacket around his waist
Drake the type of guy to double knot his shoe laces
Drake the type of guy to ask his mom for a goodnight kiss
Drake the type of guy to pay his girlfriend for sex 😂
Drake just needs to stop his role as a rapper he ain’t fooling no one anymore 🤡
Mr c but white
Album cover corny, not sorry
I liked Papis Home and Champagne Poetry
Without even watching the video my guess is a 2/10
Okay let me list CLB tracks that I can remember on top of my head; Fair trades,
Navajo by Masego &gt; Champagne Poetry. Same beat, Masego nailed it
As someone from Toronto, at least 50 percent of People who live here, especially people actually from the hood, fucking despise him. <br><br><br>People is me. Fuck Drake&#39;s certified boy lover ass.
agree with views being one of drake boring albums but I actually really enjoyed this one, enjoyed it way more than scorpion
This review is brutally honest. I hope Drake heard this. He needs to
I liked the review melon but I took issue on you not supporting drake coming out as a lesbian, very concerning.
Ya saying he’s using the same sound but I mean if it’s not broke don’t fix it
The way he came for this albums has gotta be racist 💀
Damn, Fantano just ripped Drake another butthole on here 😳  🤣
No matter how Drake flex, he&#39;s still that fragile, timid, boy...from Toronto...Canada.
This review didn’t age well. Couple big hits on the album.
I like how drake contradicts himself. First he says he a certified boy lover then he says he&#39;s a lesbian
careful this is the same guy that gave SOUR a light 7
Certified boy lover
Ur definitely a kanye rider lmao
I&#39;m back 3 weeks later. I thought the album was underwhelming on first 2 listens but I must this shit has grown on me! It went from a 4 to a 6.5.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=534">8:54</a>. Taking advantage of an unequal financial situation is the whole basis of capitalism. The fact that it’s sex work doesn’t make it any more problematic. Sex work is not more immoral than working retail. Giving the workers rights is the important component in both.
Did you actually try enjoying the album
I really did not like this album. Never liked Drake&#39;s music especially after giving him multiple chances, he&#39;s just so musically boring. However, I congratulate him on becoming a father and wish him the best!
Melon really got the donda vinyl early on his shelf
Drake the type of guy to say “Easy peasy lemon squeezy”
I&#39;ve been a Drake fan since back in 08-09, but even I haven&#39;t listened to this album twice. Pretty terrible.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=358">5:58</a>
This album sounds like how cold leftover macaroni tastes.
I love how Lil Nas X&#39;s DEBUT album stomps on this
This album sounds like he rapped while laying down
I thought both Donda and CLB sucked. Not 1 hit from clb and 1 off donda but theres twice as many songs to choose and they still suck. All autotune and drakes is terrible
Score too high tbh
The music made my ears bleed and this made the bleeding start again
Dude, you need a tic tac 😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=359">5:59</a> That&#39;s the most raw I think I&#39;ve ever seen Fantino be
Certified Lesbian Boy
Who remembers his Thank Me Later review for a radio station?
Let me use this as a reminder that Kanye West is the greatest artist of all time
M I L F<br><br><br>Man I Love Fantano

NO MORE LULLABIES FREAKING ROCKS BITXH
You can hate but it’s going to do numbers regardless 🤷🏾‍♂️
Drakes is over
I like how people judge drake cause they think he came in the game rich what about before the TV show ? Anything ? Didn&#39;t think so.... as far as ghost writers ? false!!! actually people give ideas and word ties, not putting the pen in there hand to write on the pad thats not ghost writing 🤔   just simple collaboration and everyone ignores the rest of the rap game its there job to come in with good lyrics or punchy catchy lyrics.. look at eminrm and Wayne you know em wrote some of Wayne&#39;s lines don&#39;t consider that ghost writing consider it collaboration ghost writers is every song and every lyric wrote by some one else dumb ass😑😑
Why do you review drake? I think it’s clear by now you’ll never like anything he puts out. Yet you review everything he puts out? If you’re reviewing for the masses, shouldn’t you take the perspective of what the masses like to listen to. But if you’re just reviewing for yourself and fan base then why subject yourself to something you already know you’ll hate? Seems like you just do it for the views, which ironically is many of the things you criticise Drake for being…… I would respect you more at this point if you simply didn’t listen to him
i literally thought my ears weren&#39;t working when I heard this album. After watching this review I realized it wasn&#39;t just me who had a hard time staying interested in this album. This album was so boring that even this album review started to bore me.
Yeee
What kind of album cover is that? Does Drake have a pregnant belly fetish? What do you guys think?
idk maybe im just way too much of a future fanboy, but way 2 sexy was a highlight of the album for me
There really is no comparison between this and Donda. Kanye&#39;s project is so emotionally focused and just matured waaay off any beef because Kanye knows his priorities. Drake ain&#39;t even releasing the best album of the day.
do dog boy zillakami
Antony giving the album a 0/10 after comparing every lyric on the album to the “Gods plan” lyrics for 16 minutes is not actually a review silly
Great album, I had to listen to a few times, its a Drake album man, this is him throughout career, I give album a 8.5.
Christ i just hate that album art
blampany potato sounds whiter than my feet when he says &quot;bro&quot;
I saw this album cover and I immediately came here and I have to say: I&#39;m not disappointed
Views is one of my fav drake albums
If any other rapper like Freddie Gibbs or JCole were to make the same album but with their bars and lyrics, it would be a 8/10 or 9/10
no cap, this album is so lazy
Views was hard
You not mentioning Yabba&#39;s Heartbreak is a 0/10. Easily the best song on that album.
The fact that Drake is the closest thing to lyricism you can get from someone you can play on aux is sad
THANK YOU <br>i thought i was the only one who found the album to be bad
Too sexy is ok and the song with 21 savage is ok
I totally agree with everything you say on this topic
Certified boy lover
Not even gonna lie, I was a Fantano HATER but this video is so accurate about Drake&#39;s psyche Fantano did a great job lol.
Drake has to have one of the worst “lows” in his discography, along with rappers like Logic and Eminem…not trying to hate but in the recent years, their projects have been bad
&quot;Pretending i have listened to the album&quot;
This was my last review listening to u ur voice doesn&#39;t matter the album is fire plz don&#39;t listen to this lame
Certified Snoozy Boy
god, the drake hate is strong
CLB: Certified Lesbian Boy
I&#39;ve never seen a review of Anthony&#39;s where I have 100% agreed on every point he makes, until now.
“Hook up a car battery to my nuts, and hope I get some sort of mental stimulation.” - Melon 2021
Literally fell asleep during the first few songs, 0/10
Stream Vice Lord Poetry
this album is amazing for when i can’t sleep. the moment it plays, i snooze.
No “Jinjer - Wallflower” review?  Please~~
In all honesty, I just refuse to listen to CLB because of that name
Certified boy lover
I rarely agree with Anthony when it comes to rap, but this album I agree with. Boring and far to focused on what I think is childish
This album sounds like a high school fuck-boy on his way to Lacrosse practice
this album is actually better than views and scorpion 🦍
“Ima fuck her friends and send her back to metro housing” bro what the FUCK
I wonder which one of the girls on the album art is 16
Man this video is wildly biased and comes off like a complete hit piece. As a music reviewer it&#39;s really, really weird for you to post a &quot;review&quot; like this. Really embarrassing.
Certified sleepy boy
certified boy lover is the worst album to ever come out 🤡
Drake should just flat out say he fucked kim while she was married to kanye, if hes such a badass and is so unphased
When will Drake stop being an incel? The world may never know 🤷🏿‍♀️. Got all that money and therapy still can&#39;t fix it.
yup.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=358">5:58</a> for y’all
Everybody likes way 2 sexy. I hear it so much already, I&#39;m kinda surprised you hate it. It&#39;s really the only hit off the album it seems
The car battery got me haha
What about *Yebba&#39;s Heartbreak*?
I don’t like this album but way 2 sexy is lowkey a banger
you said Tuscan leather... :0)
Hay for anyone reading this, just incase you didn&#39;t know Drake&#39;s song &quot; girls want girls &quot; is extremely dangerous and damaging to lesbians. Lesbians are constantly sexualized for male attention, you can see this in porn and also in this song. The only thing you need to be a lesbian is not attracted, and inferring that that&#39;s not the case is very damaging for lesbians, even if it&#39;s a joke. The idea that lesbians can be changed or it&#39;s a faze and need men is something that has caused corrective rape to become a commonly used type of conversation therapy. Not to mention the sexualization that lesbians face. Say if you denie a man&#39;s advances you can be harassed, hate crimed, or raped. I haven&#39;t even started getting to the emotional affects of having you and your relationships fetishzed have on you meantal. I not going to say I&#39;m disappointed or mad at Drake because I don&#39;t have high standards for men anymore, but the popularity of this song will reinforce the fetization and homophobic idea&#39;s that can get lesbians killed, raped, and harassed. I&#39;m just sad to know that peoples discrimination of me and my relationships will be validated though one of the most popular songs of the year.
Avengers Endgame may have grossed the most money ever, but Infinity War is the better movie. In my opinion, sales do not count when critically reviewing a form of media.
&quot;I am rich and my family is taken care of but I am still insecure from issues stemmed from my childhood traumas&quot; type beat
CLB, more like CBT.
@ me who likes hot shower because of how silly it is XD
I miss the Quintin Miller drake
A light 3....
Heard some of it at the barber shop. Bland. Some decent tracks but the same tired material.
Rip Drake. Montero climbing over according to Melon... 😏😏😏
Bringing Nicki on as the &quot;Momma&quot; of the rap game was charming despite me not liking most of her rants, but no matter how many &quot;sons&quot; she claims. She&#39;s That Girl while  technically not being that girl (due to her skillset) ...just like the so called &quot;Papi&quot; that&#39;s home.
Yo fantano basically said this was trash lmfaoooo
Donda&#39;s a 7, CLB&#39;s a 3; Drake and Kanye are a 10. Quite touching, Melon.
So ksi is better than drake
ive hated drake since 2007 and its nice that the world has finally caught up. drake sucks.
Prove Fantano is homophobic towards lesbian.
i want to hear your thoughts on Yebba&#39;s Heartbreak.....
Drake has no inspiration or direction. The fact that this was supposedly pushed back by the COVID pandemic, makes you believe that this CLB album was finished months ago. But that’s clearly not the case, because there’s too much drama about Ye on it. Most of which is pretty fresh leading up to DONDA’s release.
This take is all wrong.. CLB will be looked at as a classic in years to follow
Dam he mentioned drakes take care “lord knows” track I know he’s been doing this for a whileeeeeee lol. new here.
Lmao why are y’all crying in the comments just relax take a bit off the top TF 🤣<br>CLB &gt; Donda smh
Drake was just lazy with this one, the album sounded like all his other shit, nothing unique really stands out here... except for that horrendous cover art of course
He should should stick to features
Certified nothing boy
CLB a good album in my opinion
Dark lane demo tapes, was so much better than this album. Then again its drake, why would he work hard as a mofo, to make an insane album, when it will be an hit anyways and his hardcore fans base will stand behind it. At the end of the the day, its about money, creating wealth that his kids and their kids can live good from, and he doesnt have to try hard to make that happen, so why would he.<br>The consumer makes the artist, and seeing how big Cardi B and megan thee stallion has become, making a decent tiktok song is good enough, we have set the bar so low, its our fault.
Wish we could have the old drake back😪
You can&#39;t just take 3 points off the album because he came out as a lesbian
the only song that sounds unique for drake is no friends in the industry
His recent albums sounds the same lmao
How did this get a lower score than SCORPION. That just doesn’t make any sense at all this album wasnt even that bad
N 2 deep is a masterpiece. FOH.
Drake brings out what people hate about themselves.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=240">4:00</a> I feel you but…. As a non rapper who enjoys drake I see this narrative as symbolism. We’re all fighting a war. He speaks for that consciousness.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=150">2:30</a> yesss. I totally fell that if you’re reading this it’s too late continuum.
as someone else commented in another vid, can u review Pokemon 2.B.A. Master album plz?
it was mid
The juxtaposition you did @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=765">12:45</a> between Drake and Kanye&#39;s work is incredibly accurate. I agree wholeheartedly about how Drake is ever-present in the pop culture of the time while Kanye relishes in constants. But I don&#39;t agree with you in that Drake is bad because of it. It makes sense that different artists perceive themselves and their art in different ways and I, as a listener, have an opportunity to listen to both so the fact there is variety is a positive for me. I&#39;d agree with you if Drake didn&#39;t know what he was doing and ignorant of his status as the here and now, &quot;it boy&quot; but you can tell from his cover art alone that this album is tongue in cheek. He&#39;s just having fun and I&#39;m having fun listening to it at the gym. It&#39;s not revolutionary music, it&#39;s fun music.
Drake the type of guy to yell &quot;bless you&quot; when the next door neighbor sneezes.
The beef is fake they just tryna promote there album
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=993">16:33</a>
Honestly drake&#39;s songs have no quality and hold no weight his flow is catchy and that&#39;s why he gets the buzz he gets
Future outshone drake by saying i&#39;m too sexy 100 times that should tell you everything you need to know about the album
5k dislikes is drake
nothony waytano lol classic
Views is one of Drake&#39;s best albums and my favorite. This album is kinda wack. I&#39;d give it a 5.5/10 at best 6.0. I&#39;d give views a 7.5/10
The one time I’m happy to see the red flannel
darke&#39;s been cribbing notes from Nav. Girls like girls?!? come on, Nav where are you?
Way 2 Sexy is Drake’s Yummy
I wouldn’t say it would be a bad album but for drake standards it’s pretty bad
your reviews make me sleep. stfu
I’m sorry y’all I can only listen to jail and no child left behind but clb had me add all of it
This album is bad, let&#39;s say it.
Never in my life have I heard anyone say beef bars 😂😂
Used to be a Drake fan back when views dropped. Never liked any of his work afterwards. Listened to all of the new album. Definitely would give it a 3/10. I like Kanye’s new album but it’s not perfect. Ye’s album is waayy better and I’ll probably never listen to CLB again  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
The internet’s favorite Hogwarts music teacher back at it once again.
making a bunch of songs about how unfazed u are about something just shows how fazed u are about it
Yo know melon didn’t like the album when cal chuchesta’s mixtape was also a light 3

This guy is ridiculous! Nothing changes facts numbers don’t lie hate it or not
Texis—Sleigh Bells
Papi&#39;s Home had the potential to be one of my favorite songs by Drake, but the second half ruined it. <br> This album ain&#39;t it, chief.
gotta say I actually love Fountains, at least its a good vibe and Tems is great, but it just sounds so much like some other song
And in typical fashion for artist who are already established, the low effort song is huge, Way Too Sexy is dubbed cover countless IG videos.
Why was dark lame demo tapes way better then CLB
Drake and Kanye are both soft as fuck
<b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=358">5:58</a></b>
3
Drake&#39;s lyrics are so soft and tasteless on Loverboy that it would unironically be better as a mumble rap album
✝️
Way too generous imo 😂😂
melon man has the right opinion this time
He hate Drake. He just compliment everyone else even if they TRASH ON IT LIKE TRAVIS
Baby always try rap his @$$ off to the goat to keep up
Girls want girls is kit af
Drakes lyrics were on point in this album.. The album Speaks to all the true certified lover boys out there
Drake is the Marvel of music
1/10
You Only Live Twice was the best song.<br><br>Champaign Poetry was appalling.
This album was a certified piece of fluff garbage
yeah you&#39;re right. ahhhhh I just wish it was good. I&#39;m gonna keep listening to it anyway
Best Rap Albums this Year:<br>1. Dave - We&#39;re All In This Together<br>2. J Cole - The Offseason<br>3a. Kanye - Donda<br>3b. Drake - CLB
Ye had some bars towards drake too on donda
beatles worst album is better than this shit
crapy album like drake always is
Album is trash
I’m sry but I don’t want to hear from a 40 year old who hid his kid from the world telling me on how to be a lover boy, LMFAOOOO GTFO 😂 only edgy teenagers listens to this cringe shit 😂😂
Drake&#39;s midlife crisis
Review Jesse Markins Folk or Noir album!
This album perfectly embodies the exaggerated swagger of a black teen
The albums ok
White boy nobody cares about your opinion.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=365">6:05</a>
Anyone else notice that black vinyl in the background? LOL
Based and true
I&#39;m glad he agrees Way 2 Sexy isn&#39;t good, man can&#39;t enjoy that shit at all lol
You know what, I agree with a lot of what Anthony says. But the fact that he gave take care a 6/10 kind of invalidates everything he says.
Clb&gt;Donda, and this coming from a fan of both artists. I used to say the opposite, but after the hype shit ended and many listens here&#39;s my 2 cents: Donda contains extremely good tracks like hurricane and off the grid, however people need to realize kanye&#39;s album contains FUCKING 27 songs. 2/3 of the songs are skips, ruined by random features (thx keem for ruinin the best song, why the fuck carti was in off the grid), kanye&#39;s short and/or mid performances (jail,jonah, ok ok and I could go on) and dubious productions. Kanye&#39;s not rapping in many songs (was it so hard to include a verse in jail instead of a 2.30 minutes boring hook) it doesn&#39;t feel like he&#39;s protagonist of this shit. CLB feels like a sequel to take care and nwts and that&#39;s fucking great. Features are not unnecessary, on the contrary they&#39;re well thought (good job giving travis scott more than 30 seconds aubrey), but drake is still the protagonist. Drake&#39;s giving solid performances in almost every song. A few skips, but still a candidate for AOTY with kd2 and tos.
Crazy how baby keem did drake better than drake’s album on just one song (issues)
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Just subbed to your channel I&#39;m glad you kept it real in your review bro 💯💯
3 OMG LMAOOO
How can you account for the numbers tho he&#39;s breaking records, more people approved of CLB then disapproved, guess Drake wins again
Damn didn&#39;t realize Hot Shower had such a bad rep. That was one of the only solid, memorable tracks off Big Day.
Thank you for always keeping it real. Also this was very validating bc I hate Drake lol
Don’t cry Drake stans, although you probably are right now lmao
I listened to this and was like this is the most drake album
Kid cudi song was weird, he literally dissed him not long ago. Cudis feature bangs thou
I wonder how all y&#39;all feel giving Kanye a &quot;W&quot; over Drake when CLB outsold Donda handedly. Maybe y&#39;all should have streamed that album a little more than sucking Fantano&#39;s nob for not liking CLB. 🤣😂🤣😂🤣💀
&quot;Who is Drake not friends with at this point?&quot; Kanye, Melon. Kanye.
After listening to CLB I went back to Scorpion just to realise what a downfall CLB is.
NEW RATING SHOULD BE ADDED<br>CRINGE
Lmao light 3 might be a bit high but I understand
All the negative comments on here have no basis, even less so after the insane week drizzy just had. <br><br>This review dude is also cheeks, I’ve never watched him. ✌🏼
Thank you so much for telling it straight at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=547">9:07</a>. I don&#39;t care what yall think music is, but subjecting topics like this and any above and below is just sickening fr. Should at this rate have some type of moral standard in all this, and tht goes for all music💯
yebba track is your favorite but you left it out of your review?
Damn, this was “Eminem review” level savage
Meanwhile another track off the album has hit #1 on the billboards. This the same clown who liked Lil Pump🤣🤣🤣🤡🤡🤡🤣🤣🤣
I&#39;m actually gonna be fair to Drake and say this... Although I&#39;ve never been a Drake fan and think this album is awful. Drake does have quite a few songs I really like. He is just not the guy I&#39;d go to for a whole body of work.
You should give DONDA a review as well
Too sexy is absolutely GOD awful. So embarrassing. To know they’re playing it ANY club anywhere. Actually amazed anyone is at any club anywhere in the first place. Dummies.

Girls like girls is like if that one line in Every girl got its own song 10 years later
I don’t think calling Drake a “Certified Boy Lover” whilst burning a pride flag counts as a review melon but I’ll take it
Okay here’s how I look at it, I cut all the grass around the buildings I work at on Friday’s. I always pick 2 or 3 new albums I haven’t listened to and listen to them all straight through while I drive along. I listened to this album and I enjoyed myself while I focused on cutting the grass. When I listened to Donda I focused on the album while I enjoyed cutting the grass if that makes sense.

For me drake has always been middle good and the line sildes to real bad <br>Like ja rule drake would be in the same level if they came out even from a historic point drake is ja rule tier level. In wwf there is a thing called middle tier wrestlers i feel drake is a middle tier ive never really loved his music ive liked it but never loved <br>I always feel his 7 and j cole k dot Royce killer mike grovvy q jay rock Isaiah jid dave east Joyner dave skepta ghetts kano giggs make better muisc and are better rappers imo.<br><br>Thats why his middle tier even after over 10yrs in the game<br>I cant see him as a legend he will be remembered n loved probably as a legend im 30 so it might be age n the music i like already stuck on my ways n i think his bars are very corny or his flow sounds like he&#39;s gotta cold compare to all theretards rappers that just whine auto sing n become popular he&#39;s better but he never be top level tier imo.

The one time where I&#39;m happy that Anthony cant play us samples from the album due to copyright
Hi everyone badthany cover art here internet’s busiest music nerd lol
Even pop Smoke Faith album is better than Clb drake and pop Smoke is dead, that just show how Good pop Smoke could have been
Is drake overated?
Yeah I actually want to have fun as I hate my life I wanted to kinda wanted to support my family
L content L hairline lol
Man gave KSI&#39;s album a 5 and this a 3🤣🤣
Ayeeee I knew I wasn’t tripping when I knew this album was gonna be trash 💀, Anthony OnlyFantano did a bomb ass review 👌🏽
No evolution. Drake sounds the same every fucking time.
twin it’s about to be a year . Yunoreview TAGLIFE EP
I tried to give this album a fair listen but I couldn&#39;t finish &quot;Way Too Sexy&quot;, like jeez that was so cringy 😧
9-10 songs on top 10 hold the L scamtano
We need a review for Doe or Die 2
Yebbas heartbreak is probably the best thing on the album
certified boy lover
Never liked drakes style..  I feel like he was a front runner in making the very monotone bored delivery popular and I really dislike that kinda music
CLB felt like a monotone podcast of Drake just saying shit
How did he review every song perfectly in under 15mins ???
There’s no way hating someone this bad is good for your spirit. Please go find another hobby. I can appreciate a genuinely critical and unbiased review of CLB but this just seems like it was personal, like you genuinely despise Drake as a human being and it cannot allow you to review the album fairly.
Id give is a strong 4 honestly. Assuming 5 means average
Literally Drake has sounded the same for fucking years &amp; did it finally take this album for ya’ll to figure that out? He hasn’t evolved as an artist. Eminem, J Cole, Kendrick, each album they mature &amp; you can hear growth in there lyrics, Drake been on that same shit since Nothing Was The Same. But the shit will still go platinum &amp; be #1 on the charts, because also, radio hasn’t evolved as well.
i cannot get over <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=357">5:57</a>
not even remotely close to this, but you should check out Monomyth by Animals As Leaders
Ye and Push might have to build a new GOOD headquarters with all that free real estate they own in that mans head.
One of the only fantano review i agree with
Certified Sleepy Boy
Donda vinyl on the shelf
What&#39;s up with that album cover? I mean, 12 pregnant woman emojis? Come on, Maroon 5&#39;s Red Pill Blues had a better album cover than this, and that one was low-effort as well.
Just cause it’s a new drake album, doesn’t mean it’s good….the stans need to realize that
shout out to Masego for the boldest flex of the album, that Beatles sampling is lush
Lmao this album is so garbage. 1/10
Drake really went  “0 to 100” from “you’re hiding a Child” to “you’re texting a child” .
If Drake made an entire album that sounded like 7AM on Brittle Path and You Only Live Twice he would excel so much. He keeps making these shit ass mediocre R&amp;B and Pop songs that do not hit at all.
L take
It would be 10/10 if the album was called &quot;Certified Boy Lover&quot;
So basically, the album is as shitty as the cover suggests.
YOOO REVIEW AMYL AND THE SNIFFERS RECORD ITS GOOOOOD
I enjoy this album... It&#39;s a standard Drake project.
RIP mumble rappers, do ppl hate them yet, ffs. This album is embarrasing. My last two Instrumentals are waaaay better. Not kidding.
this album is a piece of shit. Kanye&#39;s is too. If they put they&#39;re last 2 albums together (together) as one album it would rival maybe...Kanye 2004 or 06
Big AGREE.
Dam tell us how you really feel. LMAO. HARSH. I haven&#39;t checked it yet but I will
Loved the album :)
when Knife Talk came on, I was like who tf put drake on this song
Telling Donda is better than CLB for 17 minutes straight isn&#39;t a review, Melon<br><br><br><br><br>Subscribed.
Drake just listens to his own music and repeats it.
Certified boy lover bad
Worst album cover of all time
Ksi got a better album hahhaha
Blasphemy on Abels name 🤐
Review Christ Dillinger pls
Drake is a egg like yr head
Review you signed up for this
Drakes music sounds like the diary of the worlds most hated man. “Yeah I have a lot of sex, strippers and girls yeah, I have a son that I don’t want uh yeah.
I love that people think posting drakes address is that bad like everyone in Canada didn&#39;t know... Like it was in the fucking news 😂<br>And this album is sooooo boring and so are people that still listen to Drake😬🥱<br>He&#39;s become derivative of sounds from Toronto underground, UK underground, dancehall and worst of all himself in the worst ways possible.<br>This is fast-food music... Soulless, boring and sad 😬
Kanye clearly won mentally n messed w Drake
You and Drake are lovers
I love how honest dude is about Jay being better than Drake even operating at 50%
THIS DUDE IS HILARIOUS!!!
NOT DAD BARS..IM FINISHED
I gave it 4/10 it’s ass bro
Drake is a Paper Tiger looool that was a bar. Bravo Fontana loool
Smoking on top five ,fuck that album fuck that single burn that harddrive(burn that shit)
If &quot;lol&quot; was an album, it would be this one
🤰🤰🏾

“No friends in the industry” - has Kawhi Leonard of all people on a video 😂
What the whole “CLB vs. Donda” thing FOR ME comes down to the person behind it, Drake is a rapper, while Kanye is a full artist
Drake has been lazy and boring for years. Nothing new
Logic looks different since he retired
Donda killed it
these r prob old tracks2^ he shouldv just leak.d th/old 1.s and work.d on a new sound^ still haven&#39;t listen.d+ dnt care2^
it was probably accidentally but i appreciate the black cloth in the back like it’s the donda record💀
I wish drake would just be himself. He&#39;s not a gangbanger like wutang or NWA and other 80-90s era hip-hop artist. He&#39;s a suburb raised Disney star trying to act like he&#39;s in &quot;the struggle&quot;.
My goodness this is the most I&#39;ve ever agreed with one of your reviews 🤣🤣🤣
Comments full of virgins drake the goat
Midtano
Yo my guy I just let out a NEW SINGLE MOONLIGHT if you have the time please check it out you wont be disappointed!!!
In the bible the song feels bizarre, but i like that shit
aubrey lol
it was camp/10
I&#39;m not sure what Drake is going for at this point: trying to pass off the facade that he&#39;s some mastermind of the opposite sex and would be getting it like this even without his money. Or that this weird power dynamic that he gets off on is cool. It&#39;s the equivalent of bragging you paid for a good looking hooker.<br><br>The lyrics and so called &quot;problems&quot; Drake faces in most of his songs could be summed up in a few words by any grown man with a mature mindset. The music is what it is but I this guy really believes in what he&#39;s saying he&#39;s never gonna have a good long term partner and he will continue to wonder why he feels sad.
This album sounds like Drake sat down and listened to his entire discography before going to the studio and saying “ I wanna make something that sounds EXACTLY like this”
Drake killed X...
Drake is so cringe
Donda better
Let&#39;s be honest drake is the most cornest overrated rapper ever and this album was str8 🚮🚮🚮😒
Agree with your review. But I still bop to his single when it comes on a radio driving. Lighten up. It’s just entertainment
Idk how Anthony missed the opportunity to roast the bar about being MJ. Really don&#39;t know how a person can be so unaware of themselves that they can publicly say &#39;I&#39;m actually Michael Jackson&#39; while rumours are going around of them grooming underages.
I was not prepared for the art for story of aidodon
I&#39;m surprised you didn&#39;t mention how &quot;girls want girls&quot; was...kind of homophobic? Like, I&#39;m sure lesbians are tired of being fetishized by straight men. Sorry Drake, absolutely zero lesbians are interested in being with you. It&#39;s literally in the title. They want girls
The melon here to give Drake his annual L
Do time stamps for songs you review  I missed my favorite song review because of YOU YOU YOUUUUU 😵‍💫
I’m stealing that he said drake is cosplaying as a gangster lmao
I thought it smashed Kanyes album, Kanyes was nothing but nonsense.
How the hell can someone &quot;Ripoff off themself &quot;?
Everyone’s reaction to CLB makes me feel like I’m crazy. I feel like it gets better with every listen. Definitely a safe album, nothing new, but a good standard drake album… idk
If I had to choose a song I like from this album it would be Remote control.
I watched a ballad white man review a friend of mines album and about lesbian experience and he said so many things that lets me know how much of a disconnection he has to the experience that was spoken about.
Drake gets slander for being comfortable &amp; not releasing different music yet he’s a culture vulture and jumps on everyone else’s wave, Drake has done songs in Spanish, Reggae, UK drill, etc &amp; people still harp on him for not being universal enough. People tend to hate on success. Drake is the Lebron of the music industry, he’s literally putting out Vibe music &amp; somehow people still find a way to hate.
N 2 deep was honestly the only good song in my opinion
I think the first red flag was the album cover. What the hell is that
Drake sounds uninspired and lazy….and this coming from the biggest drake fan….was a bit disappointed
more like certified boy lover
Wow this drake guy seems pretty cool! Thanks for the recommendation 😀
some of the cringiest and unfunny comments i&#39;ve ever seen. Good lord you guys continue to be so unfunny
That Young Thug line about him sneaking out the back killed me
i am confused, another LP? its not going vinyl.
Fantano really went track to track roasting each one
all drake does is take his premade, recycled music algorithms and make the same songs over and over. hes lazy (or smart) and found what works for him. he can put out anything and the masses will eat it up. that said, there are 2-3 bangers on the album but its very underwhelming
Drake has managed to make a load of money just by releasing the same album other and other again isn&#39;t that living the dream
I had to re listen to it because I thought I missed something
Even Anthony said it they be cosplaying gangsters
Drake is 35 saying he’s a lesbian
The tape was good
bro didn’t even talk about Tems 😐
Stick to pop reviews. This was extremely accurate unlike your hip hop takes
Don’t trust this man after he said Donda was ok. He deff getting paid. Lol 😂
Drake is a literal pick me bro lol
This is one of my favorite reviews
Yebba&#39;s Heartbreak is the best song on the album
Actually I don’t understand why everyone who doesn’t like it, has to give an opinion on it. I understand that this supposed to be funny balding guy makes his living out of it, kudos to you, but why y’all in the comments making so much fun about it? You are probably sitting at home all day, being loaded with negativity because you are an underachiever. I don’t like everything which get produced either, but if I don’t like it, I simply won’t listen and don’t care about it. If you compare this comment section with some other reviewer (his name is John I think) you get a way more positive vibe, which everyone could need in these days. Bye
Yo literally I respect your opinion but this is Atleast a 8-10 album. The production on this album the performances from all artist. The many styles he performs both singing, raping his ass of. Turning it up or slowing it down this just sounds like hate bro
Clearly he don’t fuck with Drake 😂
Kanye&#39;s album was more artistic &amp; experimental &amp; had more depth &amp; emotion, whereas Drake took more of a mainstream commercial approach, basically just trying to make songs that would play on the radio &amp; sell digitally...I get it, but as an album, I think Kanye&#39;s is better overall
I like “Hot Shower” fight me
In all honesty, music snobs are the worst. And no, I don’t mean the people who simply don’t like the album, I mean the thousands in this comment section who enjoy shitting on and trying to humiliate others for enjoying something that doesn’t live up to their “artistic” standards
STG if this gets a higher score than donda…Will update when done with video<br><br>Edit: At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=851">14:11</a>, looking good so far!<br><br>Edit: EVERYTHING’S OK BOYS LIFE IS GREAT, HE GAVE IT A LIGHT 3!
Don’t get why this persons opinion right or wrong has so many ears 🤷‍♂️<br>He’s talking like he has the formula to a perfect song or album , he just comes across smug as fuck . Maybe it’s the 2 + million subscribers stroking that massive ego of his
He needs to bring quentin back in to the fold
We off the grid grid grid,<br>Drake álbum mid mid mid
That album cover is the cherry on top
Do Grip ft eminem review‼️
Fantano, you can&#39;t just give a 3 because it wasn&#39;t titled &quot;Certified Boy Lover&quot;
I’m not gonna lie…. I like way 2 sexy 😬
I liked the album
6/10
you mad
Wait you didn’t like Views from the six?
This album was so boring
How the fuck do we manage to win everything but awards?
All I heard was bull
Imagine Kanye saw this video and tweeted something stupid to spite Drake like &quot;LMAO 3/10 HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!&quot;
Drake is one artist i agree with Anthony Fantano on, pretty much one dimentional, never evolves compared to Kanye who is constantly changing...
The worst part of that lesbian bar is that this hypothetical woman tells Drake that she’s gay, meaning she’s not interested and instead of walking away, Drake decided to say “Ah haha, girl me too 🤤” like a fucking weirdo lol. Did you think that line would convince her?
“I want to hook a car battery up to my nuts to get some sort of mental stimulation”  It’s okay Melon, we know you’ve done this before
Donda and clb were a let down. Kendrick needa drop an album.
This was a very uninspiring review!!  If you can’t admit that 7am was a straight heat your just a hater.
Lol this album is nowhere near as bad as he makes it out to be. Fair trade, 7am, friends in the industry, pipe down,champagne poetry, tsu, you only live twice, remorse, IMY2 and girls want girls were really good (yes I said girls want girls lol one line doesn’t make the whole song bad.) the rest of the songs were decent except too sexy.
I know you might’ve not liked the album all that much and as a drake fan I don’t either, but at this point you really just hate drake there’s no other way to say it 😭
NOOOO guys you&#39;re misunderstanding the whole point!! This album was meant for you to sleep and it succeeded so it should be a 10
He gave donda a 7 and Clb a 4 that should tell you he’s a kanyesexual
I wanna go to the moon
I give it a 8/10 because it was a compilation of decent songs  with a few hidden gems. He could of done more but I thinks he need to take a year off from music entirely to get his creativity back. It did seem like a lot of the same.
Drakes album sounded like elevator music in a Sears<br>Not even Dillards
I miss my friend wahhmbo
Ight Melon Travis ate his feature cmon man
lame content
lol this what we get from  drizzy when the ovo sweatshop is closed down.
Drake makes elevator music. in nutrally sits in between all the other sounds and doesnt fuck up the vibe. consistebt but boring. And yes he has a huge audience but says nothing of meaning or value.
way 2 sexy is the greatest song of all time
wow this review is way better than the one i put out. i feel insecure
Dude, Scorpion was already done, including the track March 14, which announced his son.
Who knew the glorification of ‘not giving a fuck’ would make people stop giving a fuck on purpose.
Fantano with another video proving he doesn’t have good taste in music
Anthony I love your music reviews but please keep you politics out, coming from a lefty, your politics scream partisan cheerleader and authoritarian left
You acting like you ain’t know Drake was a drama Queen! Still me guy tho!
he need to drop some afrobeat, island inspired songs again. Too Good, One Dance, Controlla
“ I’m just not excited to hear Drake <b>COSPLAY AS A GANGSTER</b> “<br><br>Anthony just buried Drake with one phrase. 💀😂
To be fair hot shower was trash way 2 is listenable
Drake was outshined by the features on his own album. Of everything that had features, his verses were the worst or most forgettable part of the song, not the best. He was carried by features.
Lol, Drake calls himself a lesbian on this album, bro it’s almost like he was dissing himself
He looks like logic
The second I saw that this album is well over an hour long it made me just want to end it all.  I&#39;ve been trying to get into modern rap as I&#39;m more of a rock/metal/folk/punk/fusion/prog guy, but it&#39;s proving to be pretty difficult. Anybody have some recommendations for good modern rap albums?
Certified Boy Lover
A CAR BATTERY?
this albums not good, but its way better than that 27 song pile of shit kanye dropped! 7am on Bridles a BANGER
If he cut like half of the songs the album would actually be listenable
Wow....a 3? That&#39;s pretty generous.
Drake should hire you before EVER releasing music.
Kanye won
Serious haters lol, good thing opinions are just that- numbers tell a different story. Its ok to like gospel 2.0...just know that the replayability is like only hurricane lmaoooooo
Boskoes review is good...:that shit ass
Drake hasn’t been good for years. The public is just now realizing it.
No Friends in the Industry is not Drake claiming he has no friends in this industry currently as Fantano claims, because obviously at this point he has many connects. Rather he&#39;s claiming that he came up in the industry without any insider contacts and simply just him and his brothers (whether or not this is true is up for debate) but Fantano&#39;s got the meaning and angle of this track entirely backwards
certified boy lover
Drake is just mailing it in at this point. He’s lost that magic he had in those early albums.
Wuuut.. Man said &quot;Cosplay as a gangster&quot;. <br>Flamed him
Everybody sleep 🤷🏻‍♂️ the album fire
this is probably the most disappointing album of his I wont even lie.
Bruh you’re a first grade hater
It must hurt to hate this much
Can you do a King Crimson tier list next pls
I’m glad reputable music critics are saying exactly what I thought. We don’t need over 20 watered down songs. What happened to 10 well worked songs. Most of the music is just so generic. I don’t know who his producers are but talent sure is missing.
DRAKE IS FOR NORMIES
tbf i dont really think that cbl is that good of an album. Donda on the otherhand...
Drake is lowkey a creep. Idk how these creepy songs get by. Desires also the song jaded is possible the most creepiest songs he has ever made.
Drake best album: if you reading this it&#39;s to late!!!
listen to the aaliyah album
&quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; best record in the album
Not a fan of Kanye, but Donda was way better than Certified Lover Boy.
Hook a car battery up to my nuts just to feel something 😂
“Chilly canadian version of dance hall”
Unpopular opinion: CLB and Donda aren’t that good
Second fiddle is an incredibly vital and important role and I&#39;d hate for you to compare such efforts to Drakes on this album, especially coming from a bass player you melonhead
This album is genuinely one of the worst efforts I&#39;ve heard from an artist with this kind of budget. What an absolute wet fart.
You know when the thumbnail is Tony looking like he gotta fart, the album has received a 2.
This many white people bashing a black man feels kinda racist to me
can you continue review good music please
Drake getting basic and he is embracing the process
Someone said drake never moved on and is still trying to find the girl of his dreams in the strip club to settle down with him lmaooo
Drake haters opinions will not be taken seriously
i’d give it a 1/10 tbh
The name on this record is so fucking cringe
The 1st time I agree with him lol
I think drake released to many singles that could have made this album better cause those songs on scary hours 2 was good then the track solid off of YSL 🔥 plus some tracks on Dark Lanes demo tapes were hard asf
I liked it 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
Yo, I forgot art that black face picture 😂
So True.
Lol 1.4 mill views
I give this an 6.6, because he’s 6ix god. Low key bangers on the album no ones giving credit to. The effort was a little off, but I think he’s just having his fun at this point. He doesn’t have anything to gain from it, so he makes it for the fans. He’s already got tons of money and he’s rich. I think it could have used a little more meaning and a good few of the songs be cut off, but it ezz what it eez. The album cover is garbage, but it does poke fun at the ppl hatin on his kid so I’ll give him that. I also think that to the receiving end of the music (my friends and family) have liked it and his flows and singing just keep us coming back for more every time. This album is important to me cuz of the bonding that has happened, even today me and my cuz were vibin to it. Music brings ppl together you know? I’m not a drake Stan if anything, I like both this and Donda, Donda is just simply better cuz its got tons of meaning and ambition behind it. I’m not stanning Kanye either I like both of em as ppl, businessmen, and artists. CLB hits different when you’re working out tho, try it bet it’s better
WHAT TOP 5 ARE YOU SMOKING ON KENDRICK?? COS MY TOP 5 IS DRAKE, DRAKE, DRAKE, DRA-<br><br><br>zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Did I miss him talk about Yebba’s Heartbreak? which is the best track.
Did I miss him talk about Yebba’s Heartbreak? which is the best track
As soon as i saw that there were what, 50 songs on the project? i knew it was a throw away.
Man how can drake drop something as fire as lemon pepper freestyle and then come out with this 🤔
All the Kayne fans are being salty AF
Y’all still listen to this FREAK !? LMAO
Imo this album is either overrated or overhated, it&#39;s fine
This album is artistic diarrhea
Kanye stans streaming anything but his music
its trash, kanyes is better
Dude really keeps producing one and half hour albums and not get tired getting negative reviews from fantano
This guy just called Views boring, tf
Drake is so consistent and reliable in which you know exactly what he’s going to release.
This was an awful album, can’t stand drake anymore
I like drake but wow this album was shit
In past two years Melon rated Eminem album higher than the Drake one and they are both below 6.
sup virgins
So kanye won...NOICE
was expecting a not good
That album cover is so fucking bad...
Drake sucks
Donda got a light 7 that means donda is the better album at least according to fantanos taste every one has different taste drop a comment tell me witch one u guys liked more
I wish yt ppl would stop consuming black art
damn, i just dont agree.
CLB and DONDA are great...<br>Best marketing ever and it works
Drake’s album ages like wine, I heard to listen to it for days for it to actually make it relatable. It’s really a nice album just give it more listens trust me. 10/10 for me
“Drake cosplays as a gangster”.  That what I been saying for the past decade 😆 😂
This is by far one of Drake&#39;s weakest albums. How he has fallen...and it sucks
CLB was a classic before it dropped
Dude has no taste 😂 Said Views wasn’t good 💀
CERTIFIED BOY LOVER
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=361">6:01</a> 🤣🤣🤣
I can’t wait till you review my albums lmao
wow and you not going to say anything bout yebba’s amazing vocals 🙄
Don’t know why Los cares about his opinion other than getting some viewers on his side
Someone should remind Melon that he doesn’t have to hate every album ever made that’s not called “To Pimp A Butterfly”
Did I completely disagree with this review…. Way too generous
A lot of comments I agree with but him saying he sounds like take care or older music… well no shit… that’s the style he’s known for and what made him famous….
Tell someone give years ago KSI would have a higher album score than Drake.
Drake owns a lot of real estate
Ah my Certified Drake Hater. I got what i wanted from the melon.
This album is dogshit
Is this a satire review? Lol This album is amazing! I listen to it multiple times a day!
At least, he beat Kanye&#39;s.
Yeah I usually like Drake but I wasn&#39;t feeling alot of the songs on this one.
The Story of Adidon wasn’t even all that tbh, Drake honestly slayed that shit lmaooo
Hot take: CLB deserves the 0 Chance&#39;s The Big Day received from Fantano
Boomer Hot Take! Drake has NEVER BEEN GOOD...like literally EVER
The best part is the album were the memes.
3/10 I agree
Bury the hatchet
Fantanos just making something up on the spot bc he stayed up late with his friends and didnt finish the album homework
why do i get Jarvis Johnson vibes from this guy
Views part 2
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=629">10:29</a> Certified Mother Boy
certifified boy lover!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>lol
i&#39;m disapionted that you didnt even mention the beat that he clearly rip off from masego
As a black goth, I appreciate the mention of Memphis horrorcore. You introduced me to a new genre.
I’ve had Way 2 Sexy on repeat for the past week. Straight banger!! 🔥🔥🔥
Laugh Now Cry Later solos the whole album
N2 Deep&#39;s instrumental is a screwed and chopped version of the Bun B song, &quot;Get Throwed,&quot; I kept waiting for Drake&#39;s version to get to the point, but it doesn&#39;t.
I like both the albums but Drake is more of an contemporary artist and makes songs that are for everyone (hence why CLB seems to be doing slightly better than Donda) and I sometimes think Kanye is for a particular taste nowadays since Yeezus as that album was very experimental and industrial and very different to his original sound which would obviously be hard for people to get, especially with a contemporary music taste. Like, not everyone is gonna understand Donda as much as they do with CLB. So I don&#39;t expect everybody to love it as much as Drake&#39;s album.
My only question is how many times does he listen to the albums.
It goes different on mute
I don&#39;t know what y&#39;all put attention to when listening to an album, but the 21 savage song is the most boring song drake has ever made, while the rest of the album has good songs, good melodies and is just okay
40 bumps him big
Certified boy lover?
Ayy everyone is entitled to their own opinion , 1 thing is you can&#39;t argue numbers reason he is number 1. But you honestly just sound like a hater the tone you just speak in this whole video sounds like you been waiting to hate on the drop .
L take
Exactly, this album is a testimony to drakes comfort. He’s comfortable where’s he at and that’s not a good thing. He’s no longer pushing boundaries and the growth has been stunted and stagnant. Oppose to Kanye’s music is something new and different. Some might not be a fan but you mos def have to acknowledge the effort put forth by Ye which the listening parties along with the visuals and involving his family in those shows. Definitely puts himself out there and thinks outside the box 📦 and that’s what’s makes Kanye the more exceptional artist in my humble opinion.
In a world full of Disney Star Wars and top charting songs by drake…who will destroy the sith and make bangers?
Tripping so hard this album is fye
How do you rate these projects? Do you rate them in comparison to the artist in question’s other projects? Or do you generally think KSI’s album, for example, was better than Drake’s?
It’s like a 4/10 and I’d rate donda like 5/10
Donda + CLB is 10/10 which is how I see it 😤
Got to give drake props for being the same his whole carrer, a terrible person who has never written a single bar or song and all dog shit music, good on him 😊
You can’t just rub your nuts and stare into the camera for 15 min and call it a review. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Can you?
he said hook a car battery to his nuts LMAO I CANNOTTTTTTT
Way 2 Sexy is a banger imo lol
4 songs tops
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=359">5:59</a>
You should review Baby Keems new album its such a banger!
That’s why you dnt go to a white boy for a opinion about rap culture
So apparently KSI is better than Drake…
HWH8 review please
Donda &gt;
Your opinion doesn’t matter anymore
I would give this album a 12/10, because there are 12 pregnant women on the cover art!
Disappointing. Barely any bangers, Just shallow music. Few good tracks but cmon Drake.
I am not even memeing but thats a god awful cover art
I&#39;M SURPRISED DRAKE ISN&#39;T IN THE COMMENTS
Your glasses do be lookin clean doe 😳😳
Fair trade was the best song on CLB
It really was massively dissapointing, I was really really looking forward to this album
White
I&#39;m surpised you didn&#39;t mention the weird cover art. I absolutely despise Damien Hirst, but it&#39;s such an amazing shitpost
Masego - Navajo (2017) same sample
IMY2 seriously how can you think that&#39;s a mid record? Best track on the album.  Drake and Cudi both shine on that beat.  Give that another listen seriously it&#39;s the best Cudi feature I&#39;ve heard in years
Funny how Eminem predicted the future:<br>&quot;I&#39;ve had a great view to see the (See the) game through (Through)<br>And, Drake, they&#39;re gonna turn on you (You) one day too (Too)<br>And the more you win, the sooner (Sooner) they do<br>They&#39;ll be calling you a trash bin<br>Sayin&#39; that your new one isn&#39;t better than your last and<br>Even if it is, once they start to turn their backs<br>They ain&#39;t never comin&#39; back in&quot;
I agree on the Way 2 Sexy
Even with hov operating at 50 percent
i loved it tbh
Skip the 17 minutes…light 3
&quot;I guess I&#39;m just not really excited to hear Drake cosplay as a gangster...&quot; 😂😂😂
He&#39;s on the right side of history with this
I’m glad he likes “too sexy”
Couldn’t have said it better myself
Race my mind and friends in the industry are the best tracks on the album.  Tsu has to be the worst song in there.
I think this album was supposed to be bad. Drake is already on the Metallica level, he’s got a big enough back catalog to fill his sets for the remainder of time. People can’t stop talking about this shitty record.
CAME TO SEE DRAKE GET ANNIHILATED
review Unknown T - Adolescence
You are not a drake fan lol we all know bel just do not review of bus album of you dont like it jesus
Best song is Yabbas heartbreak.
So it’s been settled. DONDA won.
Everything about drake is just boring, even fantano cant save this review from being boring, and its all drakes fault
What&#39;s embarrassing about Drake letting everyone know he&#39;s too sexy?
people will just convince themselves the lyrics are good because hes drake
100% agree about that too sexy track.. complete embarrassment.
I like the record 👍🏻👍🏻
This is a shit album. 1/10
Drake is Done...
People in the far far far future. Drake sucked in our time just like he still sucks in your time.
Hella ppl lying in the comments
My guy said “Drake cosplays a gangster” 😂 this why I listen to Fantano 🤣🤣🤣
Drake is the McDonalds of Music
You must be so tired of making these reviews. Like I don&#39;t believe you enjoy this anymore
wow… a 3 just because he’s a lesbian? just say you’re homophobic and go Melon
Damn, what did drake do to you melon?
context matters and this guy doesn’t know the context 🤣🤣
car battery analogy is how I feel when I listen to any of drake&#39;s music, how does a man talk so much shit on the same 3 beats he uses every time
zzz…
Clb is like finding a water bottle in the middle of the Deseret,<br><br><br><br><br>Except it’s not water it’s vodka
Would suggest listening to this album if you&#39;re trying to sleep. Tried it thrice now.... 10/10 would recommend 👍🏽
DONDA for the WIN
The rich tempo descriptively pause because lamb multivariably knock plus a bawdy softball. silly, bright station
He didn’t lie one time. He just said what ppl was thinking
i think its the worst album cover I have ever seen.
Yeah melon drake is one of the best to ever do it and I think you’ve got some immature beef with him cuz you’re looking at some great music and shitting on it. Go listen to the chanting and ranting on donda like the “super intelligent music genius” that you clearly think u are. The fact that u think the travis scott song had the best hook really makes me question whether u are meant to listen to hiphop and judge it. U have some of the worst takes i’ve literally ever had the displeasure of entering my brain and ears. Tsu has a “drab” beat and sounds “comatose?” You’re so off sometimes that i really think ur fans have just hopped on the drake hate bandwagon with u and gassed up ur garbage takes. Go listen to some death grips and hopefully maybe it can satisfy the musical complexity that you’re clearly seeking in every song you ever listen to even if its just a bs feel good track. Drake is a paper tiger? Nah u are dude ur music judgement is worse than a reaction channel.
My thoughts exactly just a collection of hype songs
This video was more well written than clb
🤣🤣🤣🤣 who are you not friends with!
Said like a true kayne fan, Way 2 Sexy fire btw
all he says make sense but 3 is too low lol and i don&#39;t even like drake that much
It’s really funny how all of youse think u guys r music expert or some shit, the album is<br>not the best but it sells iono what kinda shit you guys are into but if something is selling it means that a lot of people like it so giving like below 5 means that u have a different music taste lol
You would&#39;ve given this a 10 if there were pregnant men on the cover.
I really thought that album cover was just a joke but then it became reality..
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=375">6:15</a> 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Is that a 3 out of 3 you are giving the record? I thought the record sucked and it signifies the end of the Drake run. Wonder who is going to be next up to bat. ..my money is on 6ix9ine
ANTOn Bambino please review The Glitch Mob - Revisions because it cannot miss
Baby Keem&#39;s new album! Please. 🙏🏿
Look, hear me out, I know this is off topic but is Mark aka Loopdaddy like your alternative universe version of you? I find the resemblance is uncanny.
the album is as bad as the cover for it..
Thank god for DONDA. I listened to this once and never again.
Imma go listen to CLB just for you Fantano fanboys lmao. Cheers
Imagine actually getting offended over a joke. lmfao sad asf
This album was made for drake fans not outsiders.. y’all just don’t get it!
🤰🏿🤰
rap is cringe now*
Drake&#39;s name is Aubrey?
on songs that sound good he critiques only the lyrics doesn&#39;t mention they sound good. On songs that he hays excellent lyrics ignores that and questions the choice of beat. You coming off like a hater.
I just love how Wayne spit a 🐐 verse &quot;You only live twice&quot; 🔥🔥🔥
Rap music sucks dick right now no lie. Every new verse that comes out Ive heard a thousand times everyone been saying the same shit for so long.Kanye’s album is different. Very good
MY TOP 5 IS DRAKE DRAKE DRAKE DRAKE DRAKE
This album isn&#39;t as good as KD2
I don’t hear no girls hating on this album it’s all dudes… I’m not a drake fan but I feel like it’s all hate.
Damn you one hell of a critic
Certified (Red) Flannel Boy
Already knew u gonna give less than a 5 and i didnt even watch the review lol
Proof DONDA is better
You overrated this album
way 2 sexy is now winning
Wtf 😂 Best album he’s ever dropped. Best flows, best beats, best raps.
Drake sucks
How the hell you gonna give the same rating for Eminems MTBMB Side B the same as Drakes CLB. CLB was garbage and MTBMB Side B was great. You a hating a**hole
worst Drake album
Funny people talking about another man pushing himself when they been at the same job for the last 10 years making the minimum wage 🤣🤣
it’s time to admit that it’s 2021 and Anthony loves women...
honestly the way 2 sexy video made me like the song more
lil baby ruined girls want girls this guy hating
No, no, no, you can have your opinions on other songs and other things but “Fountains” or anything with “Tems” in it, keep your opinion to yourself………thank you 🍈🙂
Donda always wins.
Fantano&#39;s opinion on any hip-hop should always be ignored
-1/10
Fair trades the best on that album i don’t know how but Travis’s part in the song is bad how do they manage to mess that up the only song in the album I like is fair trade 🤞
Battery..Check! Nuts..Check! Alexa  - play Donda by Clearly Better than Drake
I LOoOOoVE Drake...I did not like this album. Scorpion was wayyy better.
what an absolutely cringe album title<br><br>drake you are almost 35 years old
Still can’t get over that trash album cover. Terrible idea, decent album though
a
Yoo you think this is a 3<br>But Im Wald is a 3.5<br>Are you kidding me?
why are the pregnant women built like airpods
Worst album ever
lol
MELON IS BACK. Welcome back Melon
Love a lot of drakes music just couldn’t get behind pretty much any of these songs
Certified Lullaby
Everyone is saying CLB is amazing just to not like Donda
this album was so boring i skipped to the description of this video to see what the score was so i could move on
Man I already knew drake album was never fucking with ye
every fiber in my being tells me that Way 2 Sexy is terrible but I keep coming back lmao
“Car battery to the nuts” will be referenced on the next Björk, Death Grips, and Carlos Santana trio LP.
This album is a solid 7 in my opinion.
Drake doesn’t ✍️ his lyrics and he damn sure doesn’t make final decisions on what comes out. This album could be old unfinished songs the label was sitting on. Put some new features on it and call it his new album 🤷🏾‍♂️
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=540">9:00</a> women arent fragile, they dont need coddling. Even if their situation isnt the best they can make sound decisions.
Damn drake is raps louis ck
CLB WAS NOT FOR HIS FANS….this shit was for the industry…. Meaning he didn’t put an album out for the fans who wanted to hear bangers he made this shit for the tik tokers who make little corny dances …. That would get more plays and more money in his pockets look at the album cover art … this is for the money this was a quick money maker … that album cover art was just a genius way of marketing to get more plays
This guy f**kn gets it 💯💯💯
First time that Fantano ranked an album higher than i expected
Bruh I legit added 3 songs to my playlist must have been some foreshadowing.
You&#39;re a certified boy lover
Please sound treat your room. If I had to review your recent sound it would be like 2/10.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=10">0:10</a> this random cut appreciation thread
bruh you rated swimming the same as clb i cant trust your music taste anymoreeeeeee mr fanfany fanfano
There&#39;s some weird shit going on. We need Death Grips to come save us
People who say CLB is fire got mid music taste
How you gonna say Travis didn’t put effort in when this is the most rapping he’s done on a verse in quite a while
All facts in this video. Scorpion was a banger. This is watered down. Maybe if he would of keep wants and needs, what’s next, pop star, live now laugh later, and solid. I would have been more acceptable but these tracks are weak in comparison. Catchy after a couple of listens sure but if he wasn’t drake, no one would get past the 3rd or 4th song. Album cover is going to be so old in like 5 years. But he such a good business man he athletes and legendary rappers joining he’s success and co-signing. But at this point, this album is like the anti-donda and not in a good way
You know Drake messed up when KSI got a higher rating from Fantano.<br>Round of Applause for KSI on this one.
Drake fanatics gonna be mad but whatever the album was just meh lol💯
So after listening to this Donda&gt; CLB
I couldn’t really tell you about the album but that cover thought
I think it should have been at least a 6 tho tbh
SUBBED, THIS WAS A GREAT REVIEW
Not drake cosplay as a gangster 😂
It still boggles my mind how someone as talentless &amp; generic as Drake became so popular
you couldn’t pay me to listen to this clown. terrible album cover as well.
<b>Me and Anthony feels the same way about this album</b>
Someone had to say it…
Drake is just the Karen of hip hop
I hate the fact that i half to skip 3/4th of a song for me to listen to a part that i like. Thats like 95% of the songs on his album....ugh travesty that Giveon only had like a min.
DONDA would have been a more solid record if it replaced Junya for the Life Of The Party record that Drake leaked and if it had a better verse from Kanye.
DONDA W CLB L
looking for depth in drake&#39;s music is like diving for coral in a paddling pool lol
imagine dropping an unfinished diss track from your rival which is better than any of the tracks on your album, drake is basically shooting himself and saying kanyes the real asshole, also who let that album art through
love how you have donda looming there in the background taunting clb.
It was a good album.
&quot;girls like girls where im from&quot;has double meaning. one you mentioned. the other being: lesbian and/or bi girls like Toronto girls
This got a worse score than Lil Pumps mixtape
how many single moms did a Drake make if a Drake could make single moms?
🤣
TSU is like a really bad version of 305 To My City
It&#39;s an outstanding album to have playing in the background when you&#39;re hosting a group of people you&#39;re really not interested in. The sound is so shallow, the conversation is almost guaranteed not to delve into anything authentic and personal. You won&#39;t have to worry about any heartfelt sentiments being shared to this tune!
Completely justifiable, I need Drake to do better
Way 2 sexy best song on the track cmon melon
Drake really said, &quot;I had to fuck a lot of girls to get a kid like this&quot; like-- no you only need 1 girl to make a baby Drake... Some of his bars just make absolutely no sense
Drake only released certified lover boy because Kanye was releasing donda and getting so much popularity from the media and fans. Drake was getting jealous and wanted everything to be about him. Drake is also the reason xxxtentacion died. He was getting jealous that x was blowing up and getting lots of fame so he payed those murderers good money just so his career can live and people will still talk about him. Drake gets jealous of newcomers and verified rappers new releases because he wants everything to about him. Fuck Drake.
Both Donda and CLB were disappointment. However I think CLB was better
It wasn’t a good album, but BOYYY does Fantano change up his criticism when talking about Drake lol I hope he isn’t being serious
fantano is automatically going to hate on every album...what&#39;s the point of him listening to music anymore lmao, unsubscribed 👁👄👁
Anthony Fantano only gave this album a low score because his mother was on the album cover.
Album Of The Year goes to Tyler or J Cole… if Kendrick doesn’t drop that is!
Ethan Klien is probably gonna like this cuz his such a Brainlit.
4.1K Drake stans Disliked this video.
Oh snap! A light 3! I wasn&#39;t expecting that. 🤣 I agree but damn!
Was this review written by kanye?
certified snoozefest
Genuinely asking how the fuck is this guy a legitimate person to be a critic expert? He is more equal to someone that has an opinion talking loudly when they never made music or wrote it.
You def on the right side of history with this one...Kanye 7 - Drake - 3. Thanks Monsanto!
Love All, N 2 Deep, Race my mind, knife talk, 7am on bridle path and Fair trade are enough to deserve at least a 6, you trippin.
I would like to know how with so feww audiotions os a newly realeased album one can reach a conclusion abourt the work.
drakes new album is trash lol just look at that album cover
Fairtrade certified melon
I think Drake is at the point where hes just putting out whatever knowing its gonna sell no matter what. Also doesnt help that he has tons of fans who just praise him no matter bad the music is. Its gonna be like his other recent projects where it does crazy numbers but then nobody talks about it after a couple weeks.
This is a trash review and I don’t believe white males should be reviewing a damn thing rap
CLB = boring rehashed status quo bs.<br>DONDA &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;clb
that album is absolute trash
Jesus love you, he died on the cross for you, accept him as your lord and savior he can change everything. For God so loved the world that he gave his only son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life&quot; (Jn <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=196">3:16</a>&quot;<br><br>But you must repent too. From that time Jesus went about preaching and saying, Let your hearts be turned from sin, for the kingdom of heaven is near. (Matthew 4:17)=
i enjoyed the album
You’re literally a hater just for the clicks it gets you. What a joke
True
drake would be a much more respected artist if he died or disappears 5 years ago so he couldn&#39;t release anything else. 😹 <br>like tupac or kurt cobain
Donda &gt; CLB
New Donna vinyl on the shelf
People in the comments are too harsh, this was a good album, it just didn&#39;t have enough of a vision to bring it all together. Certified Love Boy could have definitely been named something else and this collection of songs wouldn&#39;t change. I wish instead, he brought a nostalgic boyhood vibe that evolves into adolescence as you go through the tracks. With a focus on things he loves from then and now.
My biggest disappointment was N 2 Deep, one of the best instrumentals on the album and I feel like Drake fumbled on it hard
This the worst review I’ve ever heard in my life. Quit doing reviews
The boundless halibut compellingly love because afternoon concordantly grease upon a scintillating charles. animated, nappy language
I love disliking every video from this melon head 🤝
the one good track was the one without him, just the woman singing
Certified Mid…
I saw the cover art and knew it was a 3 🤣🤣
smart man, he was even generous with a 3
The best album this year is The Off-Season
Idea: ant horny fantano
I think a 3 is too generous. The album cover deserves a 1 alone.
Y’all just gone ignore that chipmunk soul comment
Quads Album &gt; Drake&#39;s Album<br><br><br>Fantano Agrees too
You seem to be reviewing more and more popular albulms and less fringe material. Don’t get me wrong, you do what you want to do, but the channel is less interesting to me when you review what everyone is already talking about.
I’m way too sexy for this cap Fantano
Hey talentless boy, release some of your trash music for everyone to clown on
how can you be a lover boy while being a grown ass man.
why is he green screened into his own room
I checked out &quot;Love All&quot; first since Hov is on the track. I&#39;m grooving out listening to his part and then Drakes goofty ass voice abruptly cuts him off before the bar is finished. Terrible editing choice and just gave an overall bad first impression...
L
Your reviews are fkng terrible. Talk about monotone and boring that’s all your personality is 😂
Im a Kayne fan and thought this was the better album, im getting old I guess.
anothony pls push your glasses up, they are not framing your eyes properly and look wonky
Trippie Redd&#39;s album is better
You’re calling ksi’s AOTP better than this album
My only enjoyable tracks were Fair Trade and Fountains. TSU would&#39;ve been great but he messed it up with that stupid intro and beat switch up. The rest of the songs weren&#39;t bad, just boring.
drake felt so monotone the entire album &amp; what made it worse is that it was all like ambiguous stabs at ppl he had beef with so to people out of the loop it literally felt like he was talk rapping in circles with no tension or build. i would say most ppl are expecting songs like hotling bling or one dance that are relatable and easy to grab on to for anyone, or he couldve went more on his 2012-14 style, but it felt so aimless. + the cover art doesnt even give you the chance to take the music seriously. sorrhy bye
Even The Fans Think The Fatnnek Is Better lol
“IT’S A TREE NO FOREST!”
It was immediately immediately IMMEDIATELY, overrated by every rapper and the likes.  🤣🤣🤣 it’s truly not that special . One song was nice
Had to stop watching when you said Views was dreadfully boring. I personally think that album went completely over your head.
That’s what I said, Travis and Drake gave us sickomode and this is the shitty track you give us, now? That’s when I realized Chi Hi Da Prynce ghostwrote most of that track!
No cap I&#39;ve been listening to Drake heavy since 2011, I remember the first song I heard of his. I remember exactly what was happening the time I heard him for the very first time in high school anatomy class from my nigga and the song was shot for me. I been a fan ever since, bumping his shit with no fucks given because in my eyes he was the GOAT. And a decade later, with my expectation high and my Spotify at the ready... I was just... I was confused. The album cover alone was egregiously terrible and I figured the tracks in CLB would make up for it but... god damn I don&#39;t even know what to say. I ended up listening to Donda and shit moved me more than I could have ever expected. And Drake just left me so disappointed I didn&#39;t even finish the album. Smmfh.
letsss gooo. drake is trash
The album sucks. It&#39;s the same style he&#39;s been doing for years. You can literally rap the Keke song over one of the tracks. It&#39;s a compilation of old songs done worse
So everyone that watches this channel and the actual channel hates drake?😂literally these comments are brutal lol
Bro the &quot;chipmunk soul on the instrumental&quot; is The Beatles&#39; &quot;Michelle&quot; being sampled
Drake is so over hyped and overrated. He has some outside the box wordplay still here and there but the music passion ain&#39;t there. It&#39;s more fame than music now for him.
I absolutely loved Views. Everything after that has been mid tho and this one definitely sucked ass
He just sounds like he’s trying to be Tyler and Kanye at the same time on this album
This guy seems generally against Drake. Again more like a hater and constantly judging the artist instead of the songs.
Hater
truth
N2Deep is a banger, the best switch-ups on the album are a throwback to what he did with if you&#39;re reading this ... The whole album is a culmination and combination of all of his previous albums
Its ok, not really engaging or exciting. I feel like any of the songs on CLB could fit on any of Drakes other albums, nothing original or new. Agreed, a snoozer for sure....
Certified Millie Bobby Brown Lover
Never once dug him. He always sounded like a mediocre rapper who maybe had connections in the industry, so the media hyped him up
Did u mention Yerba hearthbreak? That’s the best song on there and he not even on it
Drake the type of guy to ask his high school gf to open the jar of pickels
So Donda + CLB = a 10
This nigga said drake cosplays gangster. he not lying
I actually agree surprisingly
🗑️ album
RED FLANNEL ACTIVITIES 😈😈😈
Certified Hater Boy
Spot on
I liked it more 7/10 but its your opinion
Drake is better than what he gave us.
The best part of the album is still the music video for Way 2 Sexy and Kawhi Leonard dancing on it
The first track is Masego&#39;s &quot;Navajo&quot; just without the percussion...
Drake has become the &quot;Nicholas Cage&quot; of music industry
REVIEW DONDA OR ILL GROW YOUR HAIR
This record was such a disappointment. Can’t believe people actually think it beat out Donda. Donda had problems of course but some serious brilliance which there is zero of on ‘clb’
Album&#39;s molten human dog trash.
Correction: Travis brought us Sicko Mode; Drake was just there.
3 is too much
No friends in the industry and the collab with Weezy &amp; Ross are the only great tracks on CLB. IDGAF about beef though.
loved every moment youngingtony oldheadtano
Listen I like Drake when he&#39;s in his bag he&#39;s in....he&#39;s definitely given us records over the yrs HOWEVER....after his first 3 albums ironically NOTHING WAS THE SAME which is his best all around album....I was disappointed in this album its not a lot of replay value.... but people will be biased &amp; not keep it 100% real that it wasn&#39;t his best work I wouldn&#39;t be Mad if he took some time off &amp; got back in his inspired bag I guess when you been at the Top of your game for so long  its hard to get inspired
I just can&#39;t take this guy serious
I agree
Chipmunk soul 🐿
canada really is the corniest country huh
Yup. This album was so boring. How didn’t they know that.<br><br>The Travis Scott track was such a let down too
Honestly I’ve never agreed with Anthony more
Drake lol.  Clown shoes that guy is.  Oh Aubrey.
a 3/10? It wasn&#39;t that good
Most of this review is a character breakdown more than it is evaluating the music LOL &quot;drake does have industry friends&quot; &quot;drake isnt a gangster&quot; etc etc. This review loses all credibility when 7 am isnt acknowledged as an amazing verse lol i cant imagine how much of a Kanye stan you gotta be to say some of the shit said here lol
He used Nothany Waytano on this and during his video on Ye, which I just watched before seeing this. Weird.
how dare he try and keep his worldwide superstardom lifestyle away from his newborn son 🙄
when u said views from the six is “dreadfully boring” i knew you shouldn’t be judging Drake albums. normally i agree with you 100% but there was nothing wrong with this album. views being boring is ridiculous it was one of his best albums, just because tempo isn’t up doesn’t mean he’s not going in. i find him to be more truth telling and almost coming from a place of guidance to the kids when the beat is slow. his voice has always been incredible and he can speak from that place of guidance all day if he wants to, because he’s done this the best.
nah CLB over-hated
turn the 3 upside down, it’s a 9 now
I can honestly say this is the only review of yours that I watched where you seem to be influenced by haters of the artist. There isn&#39;t any objective criticism in this review.
Drake just dropped an album with features the best isnted of them featuring him and him being the best on them
Great review
I&#39;m just here to say that might be the shittiest album cover I&#39;ve ever seen
Certified boy lover stinks
Everyone here hating on drake and saying they don&#39;t listen to him... but when drake drops streaming records are broken... something just doesn&#39;t seem to add up
My favourite part was when I fell asleep mid way
Started from the bottom, sike, thanks for the money gottem.
Best review you’ve ever done man! Well done fantano I am now a fan <br>DONDA was way better honestly <br>Keep up the good work
It may be time for drake to maybe start considering retiring, like just release singles and maybe 2 albums
I get that it was a bad record but a 3, he gave ksi a 4 and one of them is clearly netter than the other
Bruh this is the worst review I&#39;ve ever heard of an album lmao
I get it, you&#39;re a troll huh?
It&#39;s an rnb album for women lol we not suppose to like but bet ya girl do hence the pregnant emojies
Not the car battery 😭😭😭😭🤌
Wonder how KSI feels now that he’s better than Drake and Eminem
And, Drake, they&#39;re gonna turn on you  one day too <br>And the more you win, the sooner they do<br>They&#39;ll be calling you a trash bin<br>Sayin&#39; that your new one isn&#39;t better than your last and<br>Even if it is, once they start to turn their backs<br>They ain&#39;t never comin&#39; back in <br><br>  Eminem
Too sexy is 🗑
Drake is the worst part of his own album. If he shut the fuck up this would’ve been a 7.
I hate how the pregnant 🤰 move around when you listen to the album
way 2 sexy for a 2
You should listen to Body Jumper by Provoker
Love him or hate him drake is at the top and you can’t stop him!
No ways is CLB a 3! No ways 😮
“Hello Travis Scott” lol
I don&#39;t believe any rap beef is real anymore.. they both literally benefit from it and most grown ppl wouldn&#39;t make music to &quot;beef&quot; with ppl much less ppl with Millions on Millions. It&#39;s entertainment tho, fabricated or not
Please review Rose in the Dark by Cleo Sol. It&#39;s such an inspired and beautifully crafted album.
As I am entering my 40&#39;s I realize what hopefully you are realizing as well fantano.  Arrested development is something that is deflating.  These legacy hip hop acts that are making same same music doesn&#39;t match where they are in there lives.  Why even make the music move on let the new great kids help us transition to the next phase.  Older acts learn how to be a grown up.  And dad bars are not the answer.  Also our ear has changed this content is simply hollow
Terrible album should have given it a &quot;Not Good&quot;
People hate Drake as a person more than they don’t like the music lol
L
Anyone else exit the video when he said views was dreadfully boring? 😂😂
And then some of his fans are like &quot;Drake isn&#39;t even trying anymore he&#39;s just having fun with it 😂😍&quot; Nah bro he&#39;s just become lazy.....
Light 3 bro seriously
yall dont get it Aubrey is writin songs that make Millie think hes cool, yall forget they be textin all the time STILL... the r.kelly collab was not an accident...
The only good song on the album was champagne poetry the rest of the album was mediocre
This why I unfollowed Anthony recently. Praising Kanye (while the dude hasn’t put anything good out in years), while drake puts out consistent bangers and gets shit on. I can’t vibe with his musical taste anymore.
I&#39;m too sexy for my shirt<br>Too sexy for my shirt<br>So sexy, it hurts<br>I&#39;m too sexy for Milan<br>Too sexy for Milan<br>New York or Japan
N 2 Deep is throwed by bun b reused
Can we talk about how much I hate this fucking album art?
How much did this clown pay for that garbage album art? If you can even cann that art.
BUTTHONY BUTTANO
Nah he tweakin
Drake the next r Kelly
Dont worry guys, drake moved on to this,he just said he&#39;s lesbian
U seem very biased nerd
Let’s all give jj a massive W for beating Drake
Ur so beg
Why do people continue to listen to him? Honestly I have r listened to him since nwts and sounds like nothing has changed
I can&#39;t wait for Melon to give this much criticism to Pusha T&#39;s next album and his dope dealer raps.
Travis was my favorite feature off the album
How tf did u give cole album a 7 and this a 3. Cole album was legit ass in a cup haha
His worst album
I would take away at least 1 point just because of the cover
Listen again! It’s a classic you a hater !
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=357">5:57</a> What you came here for
Honestly only came here to hear people make fun of this album
the fact that this wasn’t a NOT GOOD is really disappointing. hahaha
Worst album art of 2021
Funny how I hav never seen this man wit any hoes💀💀
Y’all really be praying on a mf downfall 😂 not gonna lie this album wasn’t that bad imo 🤷🏽‍♂️ <br>Not his worst but not his best I give it a solid 6/10. <br><br>“Nobody praying for you when you winning” - Drake “The Remorse”
The verses that were under written, were the ones he had to write himself, I&#39;m sure.
Drake is a representative of an over emotional generation of males.  He makes who&#39;re music.
Drake is the type of guy to shake after using a urinal and then say &quot;Whoopsie! Got a little drippage!&quot;
If you don&#39;t think Drake is complete creepy freak for thinking this is a good cover, you&#39;re a creepy freak too.
CyHi made SICKO MODE
Horrible horrible  lil baby an jay z killed that hole album<br>Let me guess the record industry now dictates the sound of the rap music?
That 1st track was really Masegos...
Dude got the donda cover on the shelf and all over his shirt. Talk about biased.
I dont even think this nigga tried with this album.
It&#39;s official, Donda &gt;&gt;&gt; CLB
CLB wasn’t that bad just forget about the beef and you enjoy it just fine
A comedian said it best , “You have to take off a couple years to live life or else you won’t really have any new material…” Drake needs to take a couple years off and live some new life experiences 🤷🏾‍♂️
Zero if no Project Pat
Bro, I was literally laughing this whole review. I just find CLB funny, it&#39;s not even in competition with DONDA
KSI AOTP got better rating, let that sink in.
Donda In the back the whole time
drake stans freaking out over anthony fantano&#39;s thoughts on the shitty album just proves that drake doesn&#39;t have a fanbase anymore......<br><br><br>he has A CULT! a really dangerous cult. very similar to donald trump.
The last time i see this guy... He was motivated by thicc boy...
What review from vultures  and lames who review ppl they never really liked anyway lol
you said a lot without saying anything… I understand you have some gripe with Drake but cmon the guy lays down bars that simple
HOW IS UR LEAST FAV TRACK WAY 2 SEXY UR A HATER OMG HOW CAN YOU HATE THE HOT BOY ANTHEM GUESS YOURE JUST NOT HOT ENOUGH TO RELATE MELONHEAD
The lesbian Drake was hitting on should be like &#39; okay lesbian Papi, you go get the butt plug and ill go get my strapon&#39;
Who else was expecting a “Not Good”?
Sir Fantano been taking huge Ws the past few weeks, I love it man.
With the Ho ratio I’m  like David Caruso
holy shit a light 3????
white ppl bruh
That album cover is the most effortless cover I’ve seen in a rappers album and the fact that someone who has so many fans did that is very disappointing,I’m a huge drake fan but this is the worse album😕
no way fantano settled the dona v clb
Drake got numbers but this album flop
💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
Congrats to drake who made an album cover worse than a black square
Im not even gonna listen.<br>Why Drake is so big is one of the great mysteries of the universe to me.
I think Drake is really resting on his laurels. Love him or hate him, he moves the needle in hip hop and people are captivated about what he does but I think he is getting too comfortable. Next thing you know, other rappers will eclipse him and put out better albums than him. It looks inevitable.
omg thank you! when I heard 2 sexy i skipped after 40 seconds. Hideous. <br>Drake made everyone wait for 1 year for an underwhelming album. disappointing., its like he just put shit together to compete with Kanye.
I wanna see Fantano go bar for bar with Drake 😂😂😂
Is that donda on the shelf? That&#39;d be wild
So donda win
&#39;I am a lesbian&#39; - Drake
Should&#39;ve gotten better ghostwriters.
ngl i was bumping this album hard, but as most drake songs go it got extremely old extremely fast. was falling asleep the second listen, straight ass
I was never a fan but I decided to check this out yesterday and unsurprisingly to me I dropped it after I barely got through like 4 songs and so I&#39;ve got a question. Do you have to be a huge Drake fan to like this shit or is it actually just fucking dogshit? Can an actual fan tell me if they like this cuz I can&#39;t comprehend how can someone possibly like it.
THANK YOU!
Is it Donda on the shelf? Oof 😅
Punishing!
I fell asleep 4 minutes into the video 😴
yo i guess KSI officially made it as an artist now, since his album scored higher lmao
This album cover is just lazy as fuck
You can jump off a cliff with this take my boy.
Terrible take.
I&#39;m a lesbian ~ Dryke 2021
This is your best review. Simply because I agree
It&#39;s official. You a CERTIFIED DRAKE HATER
I thought some of the songs on CLB were good. Nice beats, nice flow, some nice bars. I wish there were more songs you can get turnt up to though. Its too R&amp;B. For sure Drake is insecure about the situation still. I thought it was miles better than Kanyes Dondas which I believe you gave a 7? I would gave drake a 6.5-7 and kanye a 4 which is just a unfinished mess with repeated beats from his old albums. Disappointed in both
two years wait for a steaming pile of shit. i’m glad i’m not the only person unimpressed
CLB made you realize just how cohesive Donda is even if Donda didn’t seem so on its initial release.
Donda &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; CLB
If you can’t see some of the features are in the ‘brother’ category on No Friends in the Industry then I’m not sure that’s a Drake problem
The fact fair trade is the best song off the album says all you need to know about the album
Kanye? Drake? I’m 24 and I feel like I’m too old for this shit now man it just sounds like noise now
issa solid 5 tbh. take out half the album though and it’s a 7. too many filler tracks
A 3 for the fastest selling album of all time….someone’s wrong somewhere
Donda vinyl on the top shelf.  Subtle melon
Shang chi album review
My favorite Drake song is &#39;No Child Left Behind&#39;
Nothing to say about Yebbas heartbreak?
I personally think Drake should have made CLB as a mixtape rather than an official album.
As always folks chance the rapper is married, logic biracial, Kendrick a Gemini, Kanye a Christian, and Drake has a son
This album is like when they made the live action Avatar the last airbender movie
If you look up &quot;pompous&quot; in the dictionary.. you&#39;ll see this clown&#39;s face
I give the cover 1/100
Why do people think hating popular music from the most popular artist makes them seem cool and subjective?
certified lulla by
I agree drakes wordplay is average but y’all the same people who hear  &quot;I talk to God every day that&#39;s my bestie. They playing soccer in my backyard, I think I see Messi.&quot; And go crazy 🤣
how is it that CLB and Swimming share a rating
‘ creamthony pietano here ‘
Album would have been a 6 if the beat selection wasn&#39;t so dogshit
Fantano says drake fell off when Fantano has really fell off
I totally disagree... Champagne Poetry is worst song on the album, Girls Like Girls or whatever goes hard
Can’t be a lover and a fighter … he a studio gangster
All the Kanye fans love fantano even more now
Did my man really just compare Champagne Poetry to Tuscan Leather
Fantano gave it a 3 because it’s popular to hate drake and he needs to appeal to his audience. Low key he be bumping the album behind closed doors
i liked it a lot
This isn’t new… Drake albums be mid… but the 1 or 2 songs like Champagne Poetry have unlimited replay value…
One thing Anthony doesn&#39;t seem to consider when  reviewing is that the swag that artists have has an influence on what they flush out to us. The cover for this project is what I mean, Drizzy is at a point where he isn&#39;t jogging with weights around his ankles. He&#39;s more like skating with rockets under the board, meaning he is at a point where his career cannot fade away so he doesn&#39;t care for critique. This album is for the culture; not for making exciting music because he it&#39;s hyped as fxck anyway. Everyone of his big releases makes his environment such as the people or even the vibes around him. It&#39;s not like he cares what environment we are in or what influence he could make on it so why would he put actual thought into this album? That part of his career is not now. It&#39;s really influenced by his swag at this point. Of course it&#39;s Drake so standards and his niché go hand in hand to make a release that is not even close to his best mainly because of his swag.
The album cover is tone def. idk why it’s so bad
Look man I&#39;m sorry you thlammed your penith in the car door, but that&#39;s not a justification for dunking on Drake.
Light 3?? Lol I cant take yu guys seriously I dnt care for drake but I’d be lynn no to myself if I said 3 I listened to the clb album 5 times in 3 days it’s not bad at all there is this grow all over thing about it but it’s back to Freddie Gibbs
Just say you dont like hip hop
Fantano gave 3 because literally 3 good tracks present on the album.
The montell Jordan line was a hit FR fr
such a perfect review.exactly what i thought . flawless review .i really thought clb was gonna b a classic shit was so boring
Drake is one of the most overrated artists in existence. His music is always crap tbh
The Weeknd wasn’t inspired by drakes early work lol. If anything drake was inspired by The Weeknd’s early work. Which explains why The Weeknd gave most of not all of his music  to Drake for Take Care.
This is a 5...  the branding was some of the best we have ever seen. It&#39;s a 5. The Fani pack hated with rating here.<br><br>This album is mid or slightly above mid. It is not trash<br> NO!!!
The tearful ornament minimally terrify because butter arguably command amongst a guttural H habitual thomas. snobbish, regular boundary
how tf did this beat Donda for more streams in a week
How did this get a 3 when there were less than 3 good songs
There was about 4 good songs
I almost like 89% guarantee he just put out the throwaways because of donda and will drop a surprise album at some point.
Clb&gt; donda
Stupid music is for stupid people?
pronounce toronto right wtf
That cover is something else like wtf was he thinking??
white people should stop reviewing black music
I thought you were Logic lol
why do people watch this bald nerd?
What did you think of the Juicewrld sample
There&#39;s no way I&#39;m listening to this
you&#39;re wrong and its ok. I promise.
Please read this carefully ;<br><br>Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .<br><br>The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .<br><br>Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake . <br>Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..<br><br>Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ; <br><br>Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) . <br><br>Do this, and you will be saved .<br><br>If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .<br><br>You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .<br><br>Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;<br><br>‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
“In 2021 I guess I’m just not really excited to hear drake cosplay as a gangster”<br>Truth.
You hate everything this man drop 😂
Inthegranderthony<br>Schemeofthingstano
Drake did not make the music in Champaign poetry it’s used in a mesego song I hate that he gets credit for it
Amen
He right the shit is mid
wait, the album being good or bad aside.. what has this guy done to constitute a platform? album was whatvever but im not gon let you shit on tsu and pipe down cause that shit fire
Nothany the fantuck you didn’t 3/10 ? 🧢
Hey needledrop. I love your channel but I’m surprised you didn’t do more research about the song N 2 deep. The song get throwed by bun b is the sample. Which brings the ties back to TSU (Texas southern university) in Houston. And we all know Drake loves Houston. And it’s funny that you brought up ASTROWORLD because that also had many many samples of Houston rap on it.
3 is generous
what sucks is that drake is likely not going to grow from the negative reaction to CLB creatively or mentally. He’ll likely ride on the high of the streaming records (which we all know means nothing) and the praise from his celebrity friends. I feel like as an artist he’s at this “idgaf what any of y’all think i’m richer than you” and i get that , fair enough but it’s exactly this kind of thinking and ego that is going to damage his career and eventually end it, probably with him not being considered as good a rapper as he has proven on take care, NWTS and IYRTITL. it’s a shame really, the album teaser of him recapping all his albums felt like he was really going back to his old roots and well as the time he took.
He dissed his kid son????
Never heard so much shit from one persons mouth
Has any noticed how he wears flannels a lot haha someone should make a joke of that
You know nothing
Yess...Turnstile got higher than Kanye and Drake, how things r meant to be
This album was very wack. I enjoyed Race My Mind and the Hov feature. Everything else is a throw away.
3? I give that shit a 0 that&#39;s shit was trash 🗑️
Drizzy feel off!
GET EM MELON! 🔫🔫
Unfazed*
Hello, Humans.<br>The NYPD had a police officer follow Andre the Giant whenever he went out drinking. This was to make sure he didn’t get drunk and fall on anyone.<br><br>TERRANCE OUT
&quot;Unphased&quot; is actually spelled &quot;unfazed&quot;.
W review
No one gonna mention the juice wrld intro on IMY2?
I’m Anthony Fantano and it’s cool to hate on drake
Dark Lane Demo Tapes sounded fire as fuck, fire from front to back aside from maybe 1 or 2 tracks... Then we get this bullshit, refried beans ass record... Ugh, such a let down. Lol<br><br><br>Edit** y&#39;all really still pretending Views wasn&#39;t the closest thing to Nothing Was The Same besides Scorpion... Ight.
I don’t listen to anyone’s album who refers to themselves as “Papi”.
Certified Absolute Weirdo
clb was interesting…<br>pros<br>-the 5 songs i keep coming back to<br>-features like baby, durk, tems and future impressed me honestly<br>-samples on the beats<br>-the overall vibe isnt bad. its a late night album and i dont mind it<br><br>cons<br>-the album cover<br>-drake’s bars and overall maturity of a freshman in high school<br>-the random songs that just don’t fit into the theme and vibe of the album. i like 21’s verse but knife talk had no reason being on there.<br>-the total misses at kanye stay in your lane please<br>-a lot of the songs where drake just does what he usually does…rap about his son, how good his life is, how much money he has in the same repetitive flows for 5 minutes<br>-the fact that features outshine drake
People in these comments are way too serious. Drake doesn&#39;t make music for us he makes It for his close friends and family. That&#39;s obvious
i wonder if we’d still know about to adonis if drake never went up to wyoming…
&quot;lil baby rapping on this track like his life fucking depends on it&quot; hahah
called views dreadfully boring. Who actually listens to what this guy says???
Perfect review
When Ford and other big brands mimic your album cover you’re shit is weak
Donda better then clb but do anyone remember when Anthony had hair?
Because anthony!! DRAKE WAS THE ONE FUCKED OVER BY KANYE IS IS LOWKEY A ENERGY VAMPIRE AND A CREEP! Have you not had someone cross you and then act like they didnt do anything, and call you sensitive? You keep the melons fresh up there your ivory tower?
Fantano: &quot;I want to hook a car battery up to my nuts&quot;
Drake doesn&#39;t have a heart on his hair. It&#39;s a 3 for CLB’s rating out of 10 lmao.
I really appreciate Drake&#39;s inclusion of some contemporary jazz/gospel/neo-soul artists in his work like Yebba and Kiefer (end of Knife Talk), or the Hiatus Kaiyote sample on More Life. Even if their inclusion is just kind of an obscure attempt at &quot;existing purely in the now&quot; by bringing in relevant artists from other contemporary genres, it&#39;s exposure they wouldn&#39;t otherwise get but deserve.
Next do gg bb xx by LANY
Looks like the debate is settled
Album is trash. Just a rehashing of Drake&#39;s mediocre work, not even his good work. There are only a few decent (not even good) tracks.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=361">6:01</a> 😂😂😂😂😂
3,000 of the dislikes are los’s alt accounts
Album was too sexy for him
The 3 God
Drake album is a 7.5/10 for me it’s alittle bit of take care/reading this too late/with a little bit of more life into it..
CLB: The Adonis Cut
And the album art is hideous
this is the same man who gave mbdtf a 6/10, i don’t trust him
Obvs Kanye shouldn&#39;t have doxxed Drake, but Toronto ain&#39;t that big, everybody knows the Bridal Path, everybody knows which one is Drake&#39;s, it&#39;s not really a secret.
KSI’s 2 albums get better reviews than this 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
CLB album of the year 10/10 drake is the goat imagine listening to this fool
Bruh said &quot;Drake cosplay&quot;  ?💀💀💀
I enjoyed the album. Views and Scorpion were boring. This has a little more of a pulse.
What would you all like to hear Drake rap about these days? I’m curious.
Anybody else read the title at first as “Certified Boy Lover”?
Diary Drake. I&#39;m crying.
Drake is for the simps, not me ima pimp
Drake&#39;s flow on his verse on girls want girls is legit I&#39;m confused.
Bruh way 2 sexy is in fact a banger and for some reason everyone is freaking out about the “lesbian line” when thug <b>literally asked to be molested</b> on the track
If we take donda and mix it with clb we get a 10 from Fantano. <br><br>Checkmate Melon
WHO ARE YOU NOT FRIENDS WITH????💀🙏🏿😭🤣
who is this nigha ?
Ahhhh yesss all the Drake haters in one place. Have fun with this one
J. Cole album &quot;The Off Season&quot;🔥
Lmao at all this Drake and Kanye talk and who&#39;s better talk. Both use ghostwriters, they aren&#39;t rapers they&#39;re performers/actors. I grew up on Kanye and liked drakes early stuff. Both was really good but now I can&#39;t bring myself up to call either one of the best if they aren&#39;t behind the lyrics.
Hearing you break down this album makes the album art in the background look dumber and dumber as the video goes on
I’m a lover boy so it’s a 10
bruh this album deserves a &quot;not good&quot; just by the album cover alone, sh*t is terrible like cmon, you got the money and means to make a decent album cover and all your team got was emojis?
TSU makes him sound like a predator..
so biased not woth the click
cant understand how he still sells albums, songs are trash and his voice is getting annoying as fuck
What&#39;s a Drake?
Yo low key Lil nas x is gonna be album of the year!!!
was gonna listen to the album but then i saw the flannel
Fax honestly
So phased.
Welp I already knew Kanye&#39;s two-discs were gonna be better than Drake&#39;s 2-discs
This man is definitely a virgin
CLB was terrible.... couple decent songs but thats it and honestly the same for Donda
the regurgitated garbage and people finally realizing how shit he is , better late then never everyone 🤣
Fantano&#39;s Hip Hop takes &gt; Joe Budden
The album cover should deduct at least 2 points
My favorite part about this new album was the fact that I could look forward to what Melon had to say about Way 2 Sexy
As a Toronto native, please stop calling him the 6ix God. He does not represent us. I promise as a city we are so much better and have so much more to offer than that hack, that con, that fake, that clown 🤡
Drake just be releasing the same album over and over
100% Accurate! 3/10 is well deserved for the snoozefest.
Most forgettable album I’ve ever heard
why does he look like a discount logic
The album is about as good as its cover art
Fantano: can I get a shout out?<br>Drake: No<br>Fantano:
Nobody cares.
This was more Drake review than album review. But yeah, this album sounds dated and samey. But there are some joints on it. Could have been a 10 track album. <br>5/10
Didn’t listen to the album, just came for the 3.
Am I the only one who liked way 2 sexy
This album grows on you. It is NOT his best work, but I wouldn’t say it’s worse. More life was his last good album.<br><br>Edit: I do want to say the hype he created comparing this to his NWTS album and then hearing the jay z song being more RnB was a huge let down. But hand full of tracks make it above average, but not excellent.
“Love All” was fire and was better before Hov got on it .. love Hov but he was only ight on it…
men i trust-untourable
Donda&gt;
“ in 2021 I just don’t want to hear drake cosplay as a gangster “ lmao you didn’t have to do that.
Fantano laying the law down
i thought it was fucking shite and im a fan of drake
lesbians do not want to associate with drake<br><br><br>thank you &amp; goodnight
The vibe of “Love All” does it for me, even if he really aint saying too much on it, the beat, the underwater ambience, best track on the album.
THIS IS THE MOST HONEST REVIEW OF CLB I&#39;VE HEARD SINCE IT WAS RELEASED!!!
Drake album sound like he just tried to recreate all his old albums and mix it into one record. Alot of songs sound like throw aways to old songs that could have been on his old shit.
So what about the grander scheme of things?
i love your plain honesty
Also think it&#39;s worth addressing a point of hypocrisy on the album. Drake mentions his love for Htown multiple times, then proceeds to rip Kirko Bangz&#39;s sound on In the Bible.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=365">6:05</a>
That song was great until Wayne got on it 🤮
Drake: I am unfazed, here are 30 songs about me being unfazed. <br><br>Kanye: i am the glob glob golgolab.
I think that Drakes comedic lack of self-awareness might actually simply pass into the point of him being idiot on this album. Production is fine and some of his flows are nice, but man all of Drakes actual lyrics are bricks.
This album was average,<br>And I&#39;m a Drake fan...dude&#39;s literally giving us the same album with just different titles
hes right though
Drake has no competition, he just having fun with this shit. He gonna take his spot….
TL;DR:<br><br>Drake is trash.
I don’t get all the hate i liked clb beats on point, punchlines and catchy flows. Y’all are over analyzing everything just let music be music.
This dude feels like because a lot of people like drake he has to dislike him
It’s so crazy. Like views from the 6 and this album just aren’t liked because it’s not rap. I feel like I really enjoyed those albums. This isn’t a flop. It’s an ollie . I also didn’t take this album as him being insecure I felt this rap was more like. Hey I’m chill, and Ima take some look back. Idk. I feel like this wasn’t ever supposed to be a hype track. Its relaxing I think it’s supposed to be. That’s how I felt at least.
If Drake didn’t have a kid he’d have even less to say
I don’t usually like all of your reviews because we all have our own opinions but you killed it on this one.  Everyone on twitter was talking like Drake was god and was back and I could barely make it through the album without falling asleep.
Cant wait for the Fantano album to drop.
We need a lego drake minifigure
fantano you should listen to bach
Clown
This whole video was a diss track
Knife talk is incredible change my mind
Tbh this has more enjoyable songs than it is to be taken as a project. In project terms this is horrendous but we all know each of these songs are doing numbers in the charts. I felt like there were a lot of fillers tbh but we’ll see.
Does a Drake album review wearing a shirt covered in Donda album covers... brave man.
Those 3.5k dislikes are all angry Drake stans
The worst album Drake has ever released. I’d give it a 4/10.<br>Is this the end of the Drake era
Donda has more replay value then this trash
Drake: I am unfazed, here are 30 songs about me being unfazed. <br><br>Kanye: i am the glob glob golgolab.
MURKED 💀
I wonder if drake watches these
The fact that you neglected to mention Yebba&#39;s Heartbreak is unacceptable.<br>Best track on the album and you can tell Drake I said it
I really think that Drake tried as hard as he could to not try on CLB. Like he might’ve purposely made a cringy, trendy album to make people talk about how bad it was because he knew that it would make more people want to listen to it to see if the reviews were for real
Ksi got a better score than drake bro
Quick Thought: What if Drake put that trash album out just to show that his worst shit can sell better than Kanyes &quot;best&quot; ? Like to hear some thoughts.
Romans 3:23 states: &quot;For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;&quot;. We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 &quot;But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.&quot;. God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus&#39;s sacrifice. John 14:6 states: &quot;Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.&quot;. Romans 10:13 states &quot;For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&quot;. <br><br>   Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don&#39;t let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you&#39;re getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it&#39;s because Satan doesn&#39;t want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it&#39;s not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It&#39;s everlasting torture with no relief. I&#39;m only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
3? That&#39;s actually nice.... should&#39;ve gotten a 1....Drake&#39;s CL-Mid album....
Drake: I am unfazed, here are 30 songs about me being unfazed. <br><br>Kanye: i am the glob glob golgolab.
React to the number 23 by casisdead
Hearing this album pissed me off
Not going to watch this, just leaving a comment. Dude really hates what he hates (which is fine) but He really hates Drake. 😂 not going to waste my time.
Drake&#39;s never had eloquent or complex wordplay imo. His die hard fans are just simple
It’s awesome how Drake dropped a whole ass album flexing on how much of shitty person he is lmao
people are so dumb
CLB was actually great
Drake is a typical narcissist and American feeds into him cuz we to our super narcissist
You was the best of all time at the time doe. Not 2016 anymore
CLB 10/10 🤷‍♂️
&quot;Y&#39;all know this is just my opinion, right?&quot;<br>The album does suck, but you&#39;re still offensive during your review.
heavy 1
CLB is basic...
Honestly probably the first Fantano review I’ve agreed with 😂
so these are what drake haters look like lol
drake is so over rated man, album had 3 decent tracks tops.
Can you just review the album? Thank you for all the TMZ nonsense
DONDA &gt; CLB
Drizzy been down since IYRTITL <br><br>All his projects since that been whack.
he gave a better note to ksi&#39;s album... JJ this is a highkey flex
Jesus Christ Loves You!
Jesus Loves You!
Very good review I agree Clb was very mid Donda&gt;&gt;&gt;
I thought it was trash too
CLB is boring and mediocre..
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” &amp; Cosmos 🎈
Drake? More like poopy pants!
Race my mind take is weakkk
Did Kanye pay this guy?
Views aint boring my guy ...
Great Review I thought I was the only one who didn&#39;t like way 2 sexy And thugga  didn&#39;t wanna be on it just doing a favor Drake Is A good Artist
What guys this guy is wrong
Review screen violence
Drake vs Ye ... who won?
This album is good if u want to sleep on a air flight
Meanwhile 2 SEXY is a massive hit right now
From the cover alone this title was disgusting.
I&#39;ve just noticed how weird is your mustache it looks like a little sombrero lmao
That boy hates him 😂
The cover art of albums in the past few years has been so good, but then 2021 came along to completely fuck up that streak.
Well said, well said...
Is this an album review or a physiological evaluation of Drake? Know your place music nerd, your opinions are whack and your glasses are trash.
This guy defo looks like he’d be on trial for inappropriate touching
Ive gotta say Fair Trade is the probably the best song on the album. That and No Friends in the Industry cause its just a banger
melons a hater but his review wont affect drizzys sales or the amount the hoes rockin with this so. fuck it, stay bitter
Ksi got higher score than drake
I swear every Drake album reminds us that Drake is shit
This is one of the worst things on YT straight up disliking the vid rn
I don&#39;t even like you but I came to your video to say you&#39;re absolutely right
Anthony, you can’t just give this album a 3 because Drake’s son is 3 years old.
2 Sexy is Garbage
A mil views and 10k comments on how Drake is bad lol but y’all still care so much, y’all still show up. Y’all bozos
Your tripping dude check the numbers
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=358">5:58</a> is my entire thoughts on the album in one sentence
Drake&#39;s kid is going to grow up knowing damn well he wasn&#39;t wanted. Drake&#39;s gonna make sure of that.
where is yebba&#39;s heartbreak review
Honestly for me the topics on this album are hot garbage but the flows and beats and singing is great so 6.5/10
Ksi&gt;Drake
I&#39;m convinced this dude doesn&#39;t actually like hiphop but the take was fair. Lol
Damn I was hard on this album but he really didn’t like it 🤣
Can someone make the melon a new green screen without the damn paper clip holding green fabric lol
True. Bad album, help yourself Drake.
Fantano: &quot;Kanye approaches his albums about things that are significant to him and will be relevant for a very long time&quot;<br>Kanye: &quot;poopity scoop&quot;
Drake sucks, I dont get the popularity
Damn, I keep trying to listen to CLB, but I’m not feeling it at all… no new energy, nothing interesting, hard to listen to
&quot;Certified snoozer&quot; 💀
you gave lil pump an 8 you&#39;ve lost all creditability
how tf is CLB 3 points better than The Big Day tho
I&#39;d rather listen to Donda and Eminem&#39;s Side B than this
3/10? Mate, that&#39;s generous.
3.3k downvotes lol. So many OVO stans in shambles. Sorry but your overlord Aubrey Graham still talking bout his one month failed relationships with strippers at the age of  34 is a bit played out now. And the music is just stale now. This album sounds like Drake patting his tears with hundred dollar bills that he snatched back from someone&#39;s g-string when he realized she wouldn&#39;t fuck him. To me he peaked at IYRTITL, and his albums before that were pretty damn good. But he was also way younger, and his sound was arguably more interesting. So it goes, these big artists don&#39;t necessarily care about making artistic music at a high level, they want those TikTok kiddos to meme out to their shit so they can get those checks.
i know a lot of people view drake just whining in his music and am not defending him but that a part of music and why we really love some songs, listening to songs that relate to your problems and release your emotions into music
living in a world where ksi’s album got a higher score than drakes.
Lmfao KSI has 2 albums which were better than drakes it seems
Its pretty ignorant to say Drake reignited the feud with betrayed
I can&#39;t believe thats the album cover, its so ghetto and ugly
Damn alot of haters and fantanto has always been a hater as well
Maaannnneeee I liked this album except for in the Bible
This guy knows so much abt music and how it works what makes a good song etc but yet all my opinions about music are different
This guy has NEVER given drake any props lol
Crazy how I got most of this from my listen.. and you don&#39;t even have to dig to find the flaws.
This is definitely not Drake&#39;s best work but hearing your breakdown of songs like &quot; TSU&quot; is a perfect example of why you can&#39;t have people who are disconnected from the culture critique the culture. You can literally see the confusion on your face about his relationship with a stripper 😂... This isn&#39;t as much time deaf as it is literally the relationship between every dude with money and strippers! Not a justification, just reality. Like have you even been in a strip club?
damn well he wasn&#39;t wanted. Drake&#39;s gonna make sure of that.
And Drake they’re gonna turn on you one day too<br>And the more you win the sooner they do <br>They’ll be calling you a trash bin<br>Saying that your new one isn’t better than your last
grow up knowing damn well he wasn&#39;t wanted. Drake&#39;s gonna make sure of that.
This is clearly a space for hate critics. Nothing more lame than pompous &#39;critics&#39;.  This is one of Drakes best project. If youre bored--maybe youre boring.
Donda shit on this.  666 got his ass whooped by jesus.
I think drake bringing that stuff back up could mean he is fazed like melon says, but it could also be him wanting to make sure his brands comment on the issue is: unfazed. Does that make sense?
That album was ass 😎👍
Oh here it comes xd
dont even lie way 2 sexy is cringy but is on repeat
All things end
In 2015, when Drake became a SUPER MEGA ULTRA star… u can tell he realized <b>“I don’t gotta put effort into this shit anymore cause y’all gonna buy anyways 🤷🏽‍♂️”</b>
Seeing the lack of effort put in this album, it feels like he originally intended for it to be a mixtape, however the hype for it caused him to make it be an album.<br><br>Hence why it was pushed back almost a whole year.
As a lesbian it’s time for drake to stop
I totally agree with everything there is one track out of 21 and that&#39;s the rick Ross lil Wayne track other than that it&#39;s all garbage.
views had his most hits u dumb
I&#39;ve come to the conclusion God ain&#39;t gonna make me get rich... he&#39;s saving me from myself :)
good thing i dont trust reviewers and judge for myself
ummm so ksi did better than drake?
Was expecting Drake to full EP be UNTEMPO. nope downbeat mostly
This album is an abortion
i mean drake is supposed to sound low effort, easy bars kinda thing .thats just his thing these days
One thing drake is not is gangsta
giving the album a point for each emoji on the cover is a bit much anthony
I just don&#39;t the drake hype. He sucks ass
I’m a certified lover boy
There are so many good songs
Melon: <b>says “transition” before the video’s over</b><br><br>Me: 👁👄👁
Nas drops Jay Z follows behind. West drops Drake follows behind. 2nd drop always most talked about because its the last new thing people hears. Game.<br>But Nas best joint out. Shoukd have name his back 2 back albums. FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH
I am a certified lover boy.
Studying the craft Nas  level ahhh... can&#39;t reach it
NB: All music critics aren&#39;t musicians themselves
DIARY RAPS
Song he dropped earlier in year Ok&#39; I thought the album was going to go that way... show your flash,  show the money bravado, take your listener&#39;s around the world with the fame and money... show us RICH.<br><br>NOPE he goes backwards and still paying for hoes that use him them leaves him, and being passive aggressive.  <br>And yes like I mentioned years ago IMMITATION IS ANNOYING  and yes like I rap years ago PEACE OF MIND is what we should be after, drop some fake friends /peers.... in his Michael Jackson swiping style from broke folks with the style.... ahhhhhh<br><br>Too many fillers.  Like 6 filllers And needs editing for flow of album... order of smiley and Rick Ross way out of place.<br>But he&#39;s cashing out. Banking<br>His album still a better listen than West Count Dacula missing fearure... organ sounds.<br><br>Both banking... off bland&#39; Nas got the best album out.
i&#39;m gonna be 100% i loved this album 10/10
Drake so lazy and gets washed by production and feature verses on the whole project, samples are fire tho
So we not rockin with N 2 Deep?
Thank you Anthony for being the one level headed reviewer out there. Drake has not evolved an inch in all these years. I get it a strong 2.
How can you think you know so much about music, yet know fuck all, and have questionably the worst music taste out of any youtuber ........ how does anyone watch this guy lmao its laughable
Excited for the JMSN new album review if u do it 😤😤🔥🔥 the only album I enjoyed on the 3rd of September 🤷🏿‍♂️
DONDAAAAA
Way 2 Sexy is dope, what is this guy&#39;s problem. I seriously do not understand his hot takes.
The only sincere review l have heard since both albums came out. Drake&#39;s album was hideous to be called an album seems like what a kid would do even better while Ye&#39;s album was thoughtful
Best intro by far😂😂😂❤️🥇
Dope breakdown.
I bet Anthony didn’t even know that was a Beatles sample. Scrub
I swear I feel like I am the only one that loves this album. I’m not usually somebody that even listens to Drake albums becides “Nothing Was The Same” I always just enjoy the singles he puts out because he will always drop something I like. This is the first time I listened to a Drake album and I enjoy the whole thing as a album and everybody is destroying it online 😂
can we get a review of that car battery thing
Well said man
Yup, Scorpion was a masterpiece.
Somewhere, Pusha T is smiling because Fantano dropped a Pt. 2 of Story of Adidon with this review.
Anthony Fantano musical opinion doesn&#39;t matter to the culture ..... i get it if you don&#39;t like the album but fantano don&#39;t dictate music !
honest review, I agree.
I&#39;m glad critics are not holding back.  Drake and some of the other mainstream rappers needs to up their game.  His songs might still get streams but that doesn&#39;t mean the quality needs to suffer or stay stale.   If anything, if an artist is in position of reaching a wider audience, they should feel more responsible for delivering quality hip-hop and r&amp;b to the masses.  Music fans deserve better.
Is that Donda in the upper right??
Think Drake needs to do another WATTBA style collab but with Meek Mill. Amen, RICO, Going Bad vibes.
Shoulda been certified girl lover
melon articulates his hate so well, all I could say after listening was “this shit trash”
Every drake song sounds the same to me these days, hasn’t switched it up for years now and it’s kinda boring
CERTIFIED w.
This is why I hate this channel. A 3?!? This album is actually really fun on repeat listens. It&#39;s at least a 6 or 7.  3 should be reserved for whatever it is Soulja Boy is doing.
People don’t even know to not let Chance live down Handsome 🤮
Drake womanizes women on rap records and asks for forgiveness on the RnB tracks. That&#39;s his whole career in a nutshell.
Drake talks about NOTHING in his albums.
Bro just called the UGK beat from N2Deep a Astro World throw away you the best worst music reviewer
type pullupswaggy on any music plaform<br>better than donda
you gotta listen to it backwards.<br>its more kosher.
What&#39;s the rating?
I like way too sexy tho
drake has become a complete parody of himself
I think it&#39;s because drake hasn&#39;t really evolved as a person.  Like J.Cole, Kanye, Jay-Z grow every album because they&#39;re in a different mental space every album.  Drake is still trying to find a &quot;good&quot; stripper who wants to settle down and then complains about them wanting his money.  Like just grow up and pick better women.  There&#39;s more to life.
I actually like the album and think it’s on equal footing with donda
When people ask me you fuck with drake?? Nah!!
CLB 10/10 if you could do better let’s hear!!!!
Ew
This just proves Mr. Knowledge Strength Integrity is better Drake
Review Senjutsu goddamnit
idc about meanings in music, if it sounds good i fuck with it.
Anthony ripping Drake open is one of the only ways I&#39;ll happily give Drake my time.<br><br>P.S. The album art is a really good example of a bad idea
this album is so boring, it has no replay value. everything sooo generic. i&#39;d take a nap if i listened this one more time. 1/10
The album was great. Everyone is such a hater on Drizzy anymore. It’s sad. But yet praising Donda? Come on..
To me drake just seems like he has no improvement, he can’t tell any story, and it’s just the same topics over and over. Everybody in the game is becoming like that. That’s my opinion
L
off the grid was fire <br><br>wait wrong album
I agree the album sucked.
ksi got a better album rating then drake lmao
Clean his ear out&quot;. Drake Songs are way better.  I like Kanye West  old projects. Ye donda Music just weird. None of the feat. U can&#39;t hear it. 🙄🙄
Album was decent deserves more than a light 3 come on.

The only video i agree
Drake makes music for high school girls
Poopy-di scoop<br>Scoop-diddy-whoop<br>Whoop-di-scoop-di-poop

Album sounds like the rest of this new generation rap albums it&#39;s decent 7/10 for me
Oof
People really think Drake is above making a trash album like he can do no wrong 😂. I love me some Drake but I&#39;m not deaf
as a drake stan, this album was as bad as the artwork
his 15 yr old fans are mad at you melon please apologize to them
i&#39;m always listening when i make videos, this song is nice

I think your rating was very harsh &amp; saying a song like N 2 deep shouldn&#39;t be here is strange since it&#39;s one of the better songs on the whole album
The merciful physician peripherally whip because granddaughter putatively trot vice a proud uzbekistan. weak, zesty period
Thanks Melon Man❤
3/10 is too high Anthony
Views was better imo
Why did Fantano skip past commenting on the glorious Yebba&#39;s Heartbeak?
feel like fantano always misses the point with Drake. the album arwork, the content, about it &quot;not ageing well&quot; - Drake is all about encapsulating the NOW. he&#39;s the best at it and one of the reasons he&#39;s the current pound for pound king. this is the guy who invented &quot;YOLO&quot;, was the first to incorporate those universal feels we ALL get from the most recent technology (&quot;3 dots, you thinkin&#39; of a reaction still&#39;... he&#39;s talk about being a father in general (Side note: inspiration on the album which fantono says there&#39;s none of - referenced in the very first line i believe) but also that all these rappers in the game are in his sons &quot;Papi&#39;s Home&quot; etc. so YES the Damian Hurst emoji art won&#39;t &quot;age well&quot; as he said in his other clickbait-ey video about Drake&#39;s merch (it&#39;s Nike, that;s why he don&#39;t give a fuck what on it imo) but it makes sense for HIM - the KING of the now and present &amp; like I say, one of the reasons he does so well. It&#39;s relatable. Hov&#39;s rags to billies timeless story (and 99% of the rap game&#39;s imitation of) just ain&#39;t him. What&#39;s poppin&#39; right now for me? I&#39;ma lay it down in a way that anyone can relate.... &quot;My soulmate is somewhere out in the world just waiting on me&quot;. People feel that.
I really liked CLB, but after hearing this review and actually reflecting. CLB is no different from anything that he&#39;s dropped since views.
Push bruised that man&#39;s soul.
This guy said girls like girls is boring <br>🤣🤣🤣🤣I’m fuckin dead
&quot;Pusha-T&#39;s DEVASTATING diss track&quot; 💀<br><br>He&#39;s still sore from that shit 🤣
1M in one day, well done !
No risks not ever. 💤
I&#39;m convinced that melon don&#39;t like the afro-pop sound at all. Tems did a good job on the song
ANGRY KANYE FAN DETECTEDD DONT WORRY DRAKE WON
Drake: Raps about being unfazed for 90 minutes. (light 3)<br>Kanye: glob........(light to decent 7)<br>Musical genius right there.
The worst rapper ever
Drake is fuckboy music
man I started listening to Drake not so long ago, so sad i don&#39;t want to hear him again.
Drake is just dead he old asf now
melon i think its unfair you gave point to this album just because &quot;you like lesbians&quot;
This guy is genuinely funny
Man bro clean your ears 🤣
ksi AOTP BETTER THAN DRAKE CLB CONFIRMD DONT SLEEP ON MY MAN KSI
I don&#39;t see why Drake wastes time on albums anymore. Just write 4 good songs, release it as an EP or single and do that 4 x a year
Idk how y&#39;all like Drake&#39;s singing it&#39;s so boring and corny
Man this guy hates drake more than I hate me ex wife LOL!!
How&#39;s your hero Joe Biden doing?
This guy is like SNL doing a music critic.
I&#39;m so glad to hear someone else feels this way. This whole album just came across as SO SHALLOW to me. Read the room, bruh. You&#39;re dropping this fboy nonsense when folks are coming out of major loss &amp; a year of lockdowns. Nobody wants to hear how much money you have &amp; how u dislike your son &amp; just want to h03 in clubs. Maybe at 22 that would be like.. kinda relatable I guess. But Drake is now pushing 40, right? This is just cringe.
Before I started watching this channel I used to think those were vinyls behind him smh🤦
If Kdot drops, and it’s mid af, then that whole generation is finished. (It probably won’t)
I LOVE HIS HONESTY. C.L.B. IS PISS...... YOU GUYS ARE IN DENIAL.
Perfect rating. He hasn’t been good since 2015 and ppl are starting to realize his foolishness. He stopping caring years ago.
for this cover &quot;art&quot; alone this deserves a 3/10
Drake is the Taylor swift For men
Drake making music never best after the end of the greatest mixtape in 2010s &#39;If You&#39;re Reading This it&#39;s too Late&#39;, because his music that became &#39;too pop&#39; and too desired for woman. The latest album contains &#39;The Worst Art Cover ever&#39; unlike Kanye&#39;s Donda (still blank until replaced by Deluxe Edition).<br><br>NOW, DRAKE GONNA BE METAPHORIC
😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣ANTHONY AKA ANTONY ... YOU WENT IN SIR.. damn I knew when you wore that red checkered shirt shit bout to hit the fan🤣🤣😂

When I was (much) younger I always thought Drake looked like an egg. <br><br><br><br><br>Considering he just said he was a lesbian... maybe he is an egg.
Drake was talking to Tony on the intro to “Papi’s Home”
You put the Kanye vs drake music creation in a hilariously generous format, cmon bruh drakes just that lil emo kid still mad and obsessed with every bad thing that&#39;s ever happened to him and Kanyes just that unstable kid who completely forgot he even had beef with the emo kid who he bullied last week 🤣🤣🤣
I will say I do like Race My Mind though. I like the lyrics.
man i swear yall hate doesn&#39;t translate to real life, everywhere u go everybody listens to drake and talk about how good the album is, hop on reddit or this chanel and all you see is white 14 year old kids that hate it, kanye fan base changed dramatically after his crazy episodes, real life people realized how fucked up he is and stopped giving him credit, now his fanbase is exactly the opposite, kids that wanna fit in hip hop culture so they say the safest thing to say &quot;Kanye is good, kanye doesn&#39;t  make bad songs, drake is bad, drake is pop&quot; this had to be said, sorry

You skipped yebbas heartbreak. Imma sucker for interludes lol
CLB is one of the most boring rap albums I’ve ever heard. It was a drag to get through and I almost fell asleep listening to it. Generic lyrics, generic beats, 80% of the features not being good (but Lil Wayne was some life the album desperately needed) etc… Also Drake can only rap about like 5 things: “Hey I get girls” “Hey I also get money” “I have a kid” “I have beef with Kanye” and “all my homies switched up on me.”
LMAO I expected this rating and im not disappointed 😂 album&#39;s a joke
You only gave him a 3 because he&#39;s black
Unrelated, but can you roast anything that involves Drake’s pet Smiley.  All of it sounds like ass
I kinda want to hook a car battery up to my balls just to get a mental stimulation.<br><br>- Nintony Fantendo, 2021
SUUNS REVIEW. A TRENT REZNOR TIER LIST NOW!!!!
The greatest asset this album has is its features and 3-4 good songs. Like Yebba, Tems, Giveon, Hov, Ty Dolla Sign, Weezy, Lil Baby, and Lil Durk give above average performances over a mediocre ass Drake verse. 😭
Drake talks about his kid like Logic talks about being biracial
I still enjoyed the album so idrc tbh
Moral of the story, he&#39;s not progressing or doing anything new. So you&#39;re just tired of Drake...
Perfect assassination melon.
🤡 CLB is fire FOH… I give ur face a light 3 but I give CLB now that I love every song 10/10 go cry
Y’all made the same comments when views dropped, secretly listened to it, and now call it a classic. Fake drake hate will never get old
and of course, drake chose the most bland, money-hungry, unpleasant artist of our generation to design his cover art. how fitting.
It’s safe to say that, CLB is Drake’s worst album ever. Too many unnecessary features, boring ass beats and melodies. Drake is losing it fr fr
I love the review Melon but, you didn&#39;t have to spend half if it insulting Drake for being brave and coming out if the closet.
just a nothing artist. not bad, not good; just... nothing.
i always wonder who made you think you know music more than any other average guy 😭
I zoned out for about an hour until Rick Ross came in
U thinking way too deep views from the 6 btw was his best album
How the fuck does an artist at  the top of the industry drop such garbage?
Everyone hating on Drake like always. Just watchin greatness pass straight through their eyes without achieving anything.
Love was a man who was nailed through his hands &amp; Feet into a cross before that he was whipped &amp; beaten and wore a crown of thorns, he committed no crime or sin,his name is Jesus Christ!  God loves us all so very much he made a way for us sinners to come to repentance through Jesus! Jesus’s blood was paid to use for our sins, to cover our sins and wash us clean! As white as snow! for those who believe in him &amp; who receive them as their Lord &amp; savior. remember Death couldn’t hold Jesus  down! After Jesus died on the cross, God rose Jesus Christ up from the dead on the third day! Jesus defeated death! &amp; those who believe &amp; receive Jesus as their lord and savior and believe on him name, they will also be raised  up from the dead when they die and they will  have eternal life with Jesus in heaven! So with this all being said please seek Jesus now while he may still be found. Time is ticking! We aren’t promised Tomorrow! God loves You &amp; calls us all to repentance! Come to Christ today! Come as you are! Gods doesn’t want you to fix yourself and then come to him, no come to him now! God will fix you! lay down all your burdens! Cast all your cares and burdens to him! Don’t Forget To Pray! He Is Here To Help You!  He cares for you! <br>I Hope You Have An Amazing Day ❤️🙌🏻<br>-<br>John 14:6<br>King James Version<br>6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.

Melon c&#39;mon, we all have lots of insecurities, and sometimes insecurity is what gives quality and depth to art
CLB = TRASH <br>*non comparible to DONDA level,sorry
Imagine Melon editing this video and have to look at the album cover for more than 16 minutes
1 milli views in a day...Drake got everybody eating
:O omfg i just found ur channel 🤦🏽‍♂️🤝🏽
chai
Drake still dropping bonus tracks from views
The entire point of this project seems to just be Drake trying to remind his son that he was an accident that he wanted the world to never know about.
Hip hop beefs are so boring. It’s like the only way these artists can sell is to get into beef with somebody.
Do G herbo 25 next but i don’t think you gonna relate to too much of it.
Eddddx
Praying for him to wake up may he save his soul
Waoo get 1mio in a day how 😳😳😳
Drake fans defending this is really sad, it’s really bad album and I love drake man
omg preach anthony
this man hates drake lol. not the music, the guy himself. it&#39;s so obviously tainting his listening experience. &quot;no friends in the industry is a banger, but yeah fuck you I know personally you&#39;re friends with others in the industry and a phony&quot; lmfao
Careful with this link
Congrats to Drake for making an album cover worse than a literal black square
Homie didnt think Kanye was gonna show up with a JIK and TLOP crossover that ended up being a banger
Drake and Kanye album are 5/10 I was expecting better from them both.
W
Yes. Been waiting for this. <br><br>Because the album isn&#39;t good, quite none of Drake&#39;s music is.
That thing with the car battery was a good idea
KSI is getting more score than Drake
Music to be murdered by &gt; CLB even Fantano agreed. W.
“They say that death comes in threes how appropriate” - Pusha T 😂
Both Donda &amp; CLB are TRASH ALBUMS
I swear this guy hates everything
If you genuinely still listen to this dudes music than you probably need a hobby/job
Didn’t listen just came too dislike the video
Why are people still listening to this guys music
I was hoping &amp; praying it was a mixtape
it was a long one.
NAH HE BUGGIN THIS ALBUM BANG
Dude your clearly just hating on drake
Donda &gt; clb
I like Views and hated CLB. Anthony didn&#39;t even like Views, so I know where this review is going Lol
Can&#39;t wait until we&#39;re out of the drake era
No Anthony, I don&#39;t think Josh will make a feature on a Drake track anytime soon.
We can’t blame drake for this album he didn’t even write the songs
<b>FLAMED! 😂</b>
Sheesh Red Flannel Doesn’t Mean It’s Good Fam 😬
The nigga had 50 features
Donda was ass
Sheeeeeeeeshhhh bra chill out 😂
Bruv tf you hating all for it&#39;s just music
Why is there so much hate y’all some sheep’s
Sounds a lil biased lol I guess the man can’t win. I liked the record. I favor DONDA also but this was far better than the last few LPs
Melon I can&#39;t believe you agree that this is one of his best projects since If you&#39;re reading this!
At this point, If ya&#39;ll don&#39;t know what ya&#39;ll getting from Drake, I can&#39;t help you.<br><br>Drake been splitting the line between actual hop hip and entertainment since Take Care and the peak was NWTS. Everything after that was spotty. He&#39;s at his best when he&#39;s introspective and at his worst when he&#39;s shooting the shit sometimes.<br><br>I actually enjoy this album for what it is. It&#39;s some of the Drake you like and it&#39;s some of it you don&#39;t, but it&#39;s more of what folks liked about him.<br><br>I don&#39;t expect Drake to peak anymore, and I&#39;m okay with that.<br><br>I also gotta say that I enjoyed it way more than the tedious  DONDA album.
Drake is trash.  Google drake tuna bagel.  Herb.
YEP
His last good album was iyrtitl, nwts was fire too but this is ass
Tony are you excited for new Kendrick
Knew donda was better
THANKS ALOT PUSHA-T!!<br>Now this man won&#39;t stop talking about his damn son!!(no hate 4 lil man)<br>Made Drake have a mid life crisis in his early 30&#39;s!
Great video!
Anthony has now upgraded from the &quot;melon guy&quot; into the &quot;guy that wants to hook a car battery up to his nuts for some mental stimulation&quot;
could you review the locket by mr jukes and barney artist
So?
When KSI gets a higher rating than Drake lmao
Agree with everything other than the slander of views, that was a great album
Am sure you about the culture 🤣😂😂 tell me more I 😂😂this guys albums must be 🔥🔥🔥 it&#39;s true what they say about critic&#39;s 🤣🤣
&quot;This album isn&#39;t bad enough, the cover art needs to make people ashamed to listen to it&quot; - Drake, probably
Probably gonna dislike Radiohead’s new unreleased song just like he disliked Kendricks
I personally love the album, but I respect your opinion melon.
You need to review family ties by baby keem ft Kendrick Lamar
I find it funny that while Anthony talks about how he has already heard a lot of the content on this album, I too feel like Anthony is making a lot of the same points and criticisms about Drake and his music that he has in the past
The album cover alone deserves a NOT GOOD
this albumn has r/ihavesex energy
I’m a huge drake fan but this album is his worst. I feel like Drake needs to evolve. He needs to grow up.
I hate Drake but shoutout Shlohmo
The first 2 song had me going OH SHIT NEW DRAAAKE and then it was like oh it’s <b>just</b> Drake wtf dude fooled me hard
Ooooo a light 3 and i don’t even listen to Drake🤷🏽‍♂️😂
Can’t stop playing this album. shits’s a banger
Let&#39;s go DONDA is better and Anthony Fantoni is not as blind as others.
Lol
Shoutout to quadeca for making a better album than drake🙏🙏🙏
I absolutely fucking hate the album cover
CLB is definitely not his best!!  I give it a 5 and I’m being generous
He too scared to try n make a new sound
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=357">5:57</a>
Say that you&#39;re a melon, girl, me too
This guy is literally the perfect example of every person that dislikes Drake. instead of judging his music based on his clever writing and bars an overall performance, they rate him based on whether or not they believe the stuff he saying or agree with it. i’m not saying this was drakes most cleverly written album by any means but this is the case for this crowd of people regardless of how clever the writing might be. they always resort to “Drake isn’t going to body no one, drake is soft he would never do that, Drake is in scaring anyone, Drake is not the greatest, Drake is not on top of anything, etc.“ instead of actually just judging the bar and whether or not they think it’s cleverly written. The truth is all rappers are fucking liars and for most of them, their life isn’t even interesting so it’s all they ever talked about was 100% factual information then you would be hearing stupid shit about how they get up and take a shower and have breakfast and start their day then run into some fans and have a complicated relationship with a couple of girls. It wouldn’t be fucking interesting and while that’s not true for Drake and a few other really big artists who do actually live a pretty lavish and interesting lifestyle, you have to judge The actual cleverness of the writing not whether or not you agree
Your voice sounds so much more dead from 3 years ago. Lol.
A “light” 3 is a 2.9
It&#39;s over, he had a great run.
Drake has officially entered the Eminem level of hate. So great and successful that everyone pretends to hate you and prays on your dive.
Wow... This is the first time I can agree with Fantano. 👏 Thanks Drake! 😃
It’s amazing how not too long ago this dude had  3 top 3 billboard singles at the same time - wtf happened
7/10 for Kanye? Yes acceptable 3/10 for clb freaking based and 100% true
How melon already got donda on vinyl
I prefer to the hip hop without boobs women guns money watches and cars…
i honestly wish his pen matured to give us a concise album bruh... like cmon
Spot on. Surprised you didn’t mention the cover “art” though
Certified boy lover
Yes good rating
You really reaching bro you look like Logics gay cousin. You think your over analysis makes you look smart but you really look like a 🤡
Way too sexy has to be one the worst song I&#39;ve ever heard.
Bro #5 on trending let’s gooooo
You make good reviews but like always this review is biased…
Drake and Kanye are both acting like little kids.
Fantano has never like drake and hes risen to be the biggest star ever. So clearly something is being missed here. And all his followers are experience groupthink. Boom you&#39;re all owned.
THATS ENOUGH SLICES
this album is trash but i&#39;ll be goddamn disappointed if i don&#39;t hear every track on this album played nonstop by all the white kids in every high school cafeteria.
Let&#39;s all dislike his songs. Honestly, if Drake didn’t have a kid he’d have even less to say. Could’ve made a whole album based around his son and his growth as a person but Drake is still the same person he’s always been
This is like most Drake albums, if you like his sound you’ll like this album. Doesn’t need to be a 16 minute review.
I love that Donda is the album on the shelf
The features are the worst part of this album, we want drake not travis fucking scott.
Wnthony Wantano
😂 I knew bro was going to kill this OMJ!!
Not a Drake fan for a fuck. But would be interesting to see someone like  him quite the taccy pop star bars and ego and and actually write a real song about every day struggles , depression, anxiety and humble beginnings. He could help alot of people if he went that route.

It&#39;s almost like Drake needs to beef to stay relevant
HE NEED TO PASS THE TORCH BUT HES A SCORPIO
Idk what the comment section is talking about art for y&#39;all know damn well if Drake went left abd did so extreme artsy shit y&#39;all would still hate that nigga lol
I was hoping something along the lines if &quot;not good&quot; But u decided to be generous
I agree with everything this guy is saying, just the tone and face UGH
drake is the taylor swift of rap
Is Drake taking lessons from Nav??? Lol
Certified shit album
Fantano has never heard Masego.<br><br>Stop sleeping on R &amp; B
You get paid to give these kind of reviews ? Lmao. You clearly know nothing about the culture and what drakes been bringing to the music world . Go react to hocus pocus clown
Drake doesn’t want you to get his music right away, he wants you to live with it AND YOU WILL!
Drake sucks.  That is all.
is that donda in behind?
Underwhelming album at best. Felt like views 2.0
Yooooo how did Anthony literally convey the same thoughts I had 🤯🤯🤯🤯
Big oof
Facts, CLB was very disappointing and I love Drake
I understand melon but when he said views was trash… idk bro. Views was literally a moment and a legit classic
Drake lost me after ‘Nothing was the same’.  His best project.😩😩😩
As soon as I saw the red flannel on the thumbnail I just knew he was gonna call this album bad lol
It’s always so weird to see some dude who knows nothing about music posting his shitty videos critiquing music. This corn ball should have disappeared a long time ago.
A boring one dimensional album
I think the only song I love-loved was “Champagne Poetry” - that shit got me so hyped then it fell of from there.
Damn Ik it wasn’t good but you ripped into him 🤣 sheeesh
I can see drake leaning against a wall and slowly sliding down it after watching this review
CLB cured my insomnia
Sad thing is Drake only has 2 more Albums left before he goes Lil Wayne mode and does 1 off features. I just hope he gives us 1 more classic Drizzy Album before he goes. For the Fans that have been on the journey since So Far Gone.
Drake is crap. He&#39;s just desperately trying to hang on what&#39;s left of his career. Kanye is a true artist!
FANTANO IS A KANYE STAND, so nothing new L-ANTANO.
Champagne poetry is just the soulless rap version of Masegos Navajo. It is literally the same exact beat but completely devoid of momentum.
I think you should review Black Bastards by KMD :)
Drake has the energy of a roommate who thinks that everything is someone else’s fault
I already know he’s gonn talk so much crap about it
“While I’m listening to it, I kinda wanna just hook a car battery up to my nuts. Just to get some mental stimulation.” 😂😂😂😂
Album IS straight TRASH JUICE!
I demand a re-uploaded version of this where this God awful cover is replaced with the liquid swords cover art, please and thank you
I can’t believe this review has more trending than the actual album
Agreed
donda subtly being the album to the right of Fantano is based
Trash record
The comment section is 10x more entertaining than this LP
Uhh Nothany Waytano...how did you forget to mention that the N2Deep track was already crushed by Bun B on Get Throwed! Love the chanel though
Ksi got a better score lmao
You know Drake watched this and got in his feelings
DRIZZY IS GETTING COOKED WELL DONE IN THE COMMENTS LMFAOOO
Me and my friends don’t bet for money anymore. Loser now has to listen to CLB w no skips, noise canceling headphones, at least 75% volume.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=364">6:04</a> I was taking a sip of water - almost spat all of it on my computer.
Drake needs to make a high fantasy concept album.
Do the new imagine dragons album!
Idc I liked the album.
Thank God you uploaded I almost had to listen to this trash before calling it trash
lets get real, this is Drakes first album he not having to prove something to his audience...<br>when Drake first showed up he had to certify himself as a real rapper - So far gone<br>his second project he rode on what Cudi and kanye created which is the emotional rapper lane, Drake made that popular - thank me Later<br>Drake took over for Wayne as the head hun-cho of YMCB - take care<br>proving he is the biggest artist in the game - nothing was the same<br>Drake faces Meek Mill accusations and his penmanship is questioned - if you are reading this its too late<br>Drake pushes the boundaries of his versatility - views<br>Kanye and Cudi beef - more life<br>Pusha T beef and just got washed by Pusha Thenos - scorpion<br>Filler Album - dark lane demo tapes<br>Drake has nothing to prove - certified lover boy
Y&#39;all made him ditch his ghost writer now look where we at
How did this get overrated…
I&#39;ve been trying to tell y&#39;all drake is super boring
I’m sorry you had to listen to this melon
Ahhh I can go to sleep with peace of mind now
This album needed way more DaBaby. I mean just look at all da babies in the cover art.
How fantano already got the Donda vinyl
Did anyone catch that guitar sample on &quot;In Too Deep&quot;?  From &quot;Get Throwed&quot; by Bun-B
One of Drake&#39;s worst
It&#39;s hilarious to me that Drake thinks this album is great
Hated the album on the first listen, like it quite a bit now. Many dud songs i suppose. But Anthony reviews are kind of a moot point at this....point. When you start debating the etical choices of the individual youre no longer reviewing music.
This is the start of Drakes falloff
Yebba heartbreak is the best song on the album lol
Six God with Sixth Album
How is this better than House Of Balloons? 🎈 🏡
Thank you so much for this, I’m so tired of everyone saying this album is any good 😭😭😭
The second part of “champagne poetry” had the potential to be one of the best tracks from the album but I just felt absolutely blueballed by the beat
Drake&#39;s a Scorpio, that explains everything for me, idk about yall
Back with another horrible review...ofc the album isn&#39;t drakes best but definitely better then a 3 out of 10 I&#39;d say like a 6 out of 10....and better then donda. This dude definitely a pusha t fan
the album is so boring and a waste of 90 mins
I really try not to judge a book <b>(or in this case, an album)</b> by it&#39;s cover but, given how meaningless, tacky, and shallow the cover is, I think I know what I&#39;d be getting if I listened to this foolishness. Fantano basically summed it up for me, as well. Also, Drake&#39;s schtick has been more &amp; more shallow, immature, petty, and self-absorbed since &quot;Views&quot;. ✌🏾
Drakes early stuff did not inspire the weekends stuff. Quite the opposite. The weekend inspired a lot of drakes early stuff
My dumb ass really thought Dickthony sploogtano was making a JAR media podcast reference with the thumbnail, I’m so uncultured
certified mid boy
What did y’all expect from a dude named Aubrey
More like Certified Loser Boy
I thought that he was trying to do the trollish low effort thing thats why I was bumping too sexy. But you know me I&#39;m a huge lil b fan, so.
I don’t know what y’all are listening to, this is an amazing album
bias asf 😂
That flannel fresh boi
This man does his best to appeal to 15yo white boys
drake finna sample this his next album intro😂
After my third listen I’m sitting around a 5. Taking it for what it is. Never expected a masterpiece. Favorite songs are champagne poetry, yebbas heartbreak (he’s not even in it lol) in the Bible is catchy to me for whatever reason, get along better. Then there’s the more obvious like fair trade, you only live twice. I can’t stand papis home, girl like girls, and TSU.
Thanks Melon, now I have an official opinion on this album.
Do Sosmula - 13 Songs 2 Die 2
DJ Khaled, Rick Ross, Future, Nicki Minaj, Lil Wayne, 40 and all these industry dons in the corner like &quot;I thought I was your friend Drake 😢&quot;.
I&#39;m back<br> Certified Lover Boy a light 5/10<br>Some of the songs where not top quality drake some where just ok or average or basic he was carried by a few features dark lane demo tapes was definitely better  tbh it had some great songs the intro &amp; outro was great &amp; some of the samples he used on the songs were used good &amp; some wasn&#39;t. It had a few great highlights but nun too special.<br><br>Favorite songs Tsu No friends in the industry 7am race my mind<br><br>Worst songs fu*king fans girls want girls
This video is such a good teardown I thought I was watching Jerry Rig Everything.
This chat is so biased it’s actually amusing 😂
Im kinda surprised this isn’t a not good. Drakes been making the same exact music since 2016 its time to STOP.
melon clamps a car battery to his balls in this review
Did he buy those jumper cables to get his mental stimulation?
way 2 sexy was definitely the best song ur trippin
sigma drake
Together Drake and Ye make a perfect 10
almost 1 million views in 24 hrs ...... looks like there&#39;s a strong following behind this artist lol
6min in and nothing but pure hate not even proper critique just a bunch of “i wish he would’ves”. Fantano get that hate out your heart man. He doesn’t know you! Or care for that matter.
yall care about everything other than music, the music is well produced, the flows are good. its fine, yall are focusing on the beef thats barely brought up so much
Glad I&#39;m not the only one who thought this album was giant wet diaper filled with garbage. Drake slippin...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=344">5:44</a> I’m unsure if drake felt it as a joke
He’s always hated Drake lol 😂 I’m not surprised at all.
did yall listen to more than the first 3 songs? lmao
Drake&#39;s been in the same creative space for like 3 years now. Anything on this album you can get for cheap on Scorpion.
The cover shows how little effort he put into this album
I love how we take hip hop opinions as gospel from a white man :)
His worst album by a mile
Liked 2 songs on Certified Lover Boy. Liked 0 songs on Donda. What a disappointing album war.
Is this 3 worse than Infinite Granite?
Is this even a music review lol
Drake is if u bought Kanye from wish
“Tired of Drake Cosplaying as a Gangster” 😂😂😂
🤰🏻
I thought this album was better then scorpion. Drake is definitely starting to decline quality wise, no denying that.
Look, I can not stress enough that I am not a fan of Drake. I think the entire point of his music is to appeal to the most mainstream demographic as possible, and I don’t like it. With that being said, you for real just sound like a hater. You COULD nitpick the shit out of any piece of creative anything, but none of your gripes seem like objective issues with the album. Just.. kinda sound like a hater.
im so excited to laugh for the duration of this video at people who unironically use the phrase &quot;clout&quot; still
This is the same guy who gave Views a 4... right?
Certified Boy Lover
Love the videos love to see you react to   &#39; central cee - loading &#39;
I love ur DONDA album in the back lol
Zero two álbuns idiot
At this point i expect nothing different from you hate the weeknd and drake best work lol but giving higher scores to lil yachty and etc… predictable at this point
CLB - 3/10<br><br>Donda - 7/10<br><br>You’re not slick, Melon.
Gotta love a red flannel that validates my feelings.
Bro I’m a artist too I talk about my kid a lot too. It’s jus a thing wen your a dad n a musician
I&#39;m a like this one of the strength 🤣 you teared into that boy. Agree with some of what was said. Not his best work . <br><br>I think views is amazing. So is Travis&#39; snapping. And I liked way too sexy. Was interesting compared to the rest of what I was hearing. Yebba and co. went off. The producers idk.
Here I’ll write a drake verse off the top of my head to prove he has no talent: “me and Maria in the truck outside, I’m at the Lakers court side with my guys, no lies each M is first try (FOR REAL) underground and underwater pateks, crib so big my attic got attics, I’m the garden with nico I swear shawty though she had it, can I mention my son while I’m at it, I’m a money and bad bitch addict [instert catchy hook over chopped up gospel choir sample]”
I think the run is over Drake.
why is there not a single drake fan here
damn i didnt know it was the holidays cuz that was a fucking f a t roast
I can not fathom that I agree with Fantano about this album. I found CLB to be bland, easily forgettable with no effort on the music. Like this is the worst laid-back effort from a musician I&#39;ve ever heard. Maybe I was expecting a little more effort, but nothing except disappointing results. It&#39;s the same monotonic style as Eminem has been doing for the last 10 years tbh. We get it drake you bang women and are rich but come on with new material man fr. and pls stop being obsessed with Ye man.
Melon, just say the album was too sexy for you and go
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=535">8:55</a> I was thinking, &quot;that sounds like some R Kelly shit almost&quot;. Then to find out it incorporates R Kelly&#39;s music. This Drake fellow is special kind of stupid.
I can imagine Kanye thinking<br>“He’ll sell more but no1 will remember more then 2 songs on it”
Kanye takes chances and Drake stays in his comfort zone.
Melon was mad in this one.
I really wanna have a long, excruciating conversation to whoever approved that goddamn album cover.
read the description and seen « way 2 sexy » as his « least fav track » so i then proceeded to write this comment and turn off the video.
Let this not distract you from the fact Logic is biracial
certified boy lover
Thnk you! ...i might not agree with melon  most of the time but this Time i definitely agree,drake has become the taylor Swift of hip hop (literally) and I don&#39;t even hate,there&#39;s a couple of decent tracks,what i&#39;m trying to say is all this hype isn&#39;t needed at all this guy is overrated af,just because you sell a lot of records doesn&#39;t make you a high end top tier rapper..
Best reviewer hands down 💯💯💯💯💯💯
There is no way he just complemented lil baby
Greenthony<br>Screentano
Kanye won 😎
Drake sounds mad cause he has a son lmao
surprised it could even get a light 3. this was a straight up 0 for me
What happened to cal
It’s official, Kanye won the album battle
Huge miss Anthony, should&#39;ve been a 2. This album was so ass I didn&#39;t even need to listen to it a second time to realize how bad the project is.
7&gt;3
Takeaways from CLB:<br>Drake fucks<br>Apparently Drake fucks <br>Drake is taking responsibility now<br>Drake is a lesbian<br>Drake fucks again<br>Drake has few friends in the industry. But what about the featu-<br>Oh Drake is still beefing with Kanye. <br>Drake has no friends.<br>He is rich and he fucks
Drake has always been a culture vulture.
On top of the Donda album in the shelf, you should&#39;ve used the Sonic version of the CLB cover just to add more salt in the wound lol
I love your melon head, but the song &#39;Fucking Fans&#39; is PARTYNEXTDOOR&#39;S whole sound. Not The Weeknds. PND needs more credit fam
So I’m at the beginning of this right now. And I’m just going to assume that he gave it a bad score because this man hates drake more than any other artist.
L album
CLB should’ve just been a R&amp;B album I said it
Anthony, did you really not like IMY2, that shit is my jam
It feels like it has no soul Unlike Donda
im 100,000,000% convinced drake might have piped Anthony&#39;s girl and he just hates him and his music LOL a 3 ???? but donda is ranked higher .....
N 2 Deep is one of the best songs of the entire album. Are you fucking kidding me ???!!!
Not really a shocker that he doesn’t like it
3 is a bit high for this garbage.
Albumn was dope but I got a nice set up in my car so shit bumps. Definitely nothing insane but better then some of these new artist put out. Also is Kayne paying this guy off lol.
Am I wrong if I say he look like a capybara ? I’m not tryna be offensive but this has been weighing on my mind
No doubt, Drake&#39;s album is still an event in the music industry, while Kanye&#39;s album is, of course, an art industry event. But you are inclined. This is a great record.
Definitely agree with this review have not been impressed with this album or donda, kdot will definitely look good after these 2 projects
WHAT TOP 5 ARE U SMOKING ON MELON?<br>CAUSE MY TOP 5 IS:<br>DRAKE<br>DRAKE<br>DRAKE<br>DRAZZZZzzzz… 😴
I feel like the songs would’ve hit different with a different cover
Way 2 Sexy is a hilarious banger melon
🌎🔜🔥B.C. and A.D. are timemarks everyone uses. Jesus Christ is the one and only Lord and Savior who Rose again. There is no peace without repentance and resurrection. ⏳⚰️🪦✝️
Garbage album, fucking hated it and glad I&#39;m not the only one
don&#39;t call the Masego sample chipmunk soul :/
Ksi did better than drake in his mind. Seems weird to think about but understandable.
Ksi’s album got a higher rating than drake’s. Unreal
Drake needs new producers.
Top 3 worst albums I have heard in the past 5 years.
Comment section full of weirdos who don&#39;t go outside the house and who make memes.
It doesn’t sit well with me that Drake continues to get praised as if he’s immune to making poor records while he simultaneously puts no effort in, brags as if he’s a high school hotshot, and shows no artistic (or character) development for the better part of his career. This album essentially screams ‘I don’t have to try because my stupid fans will scarf it down regardless’, which just feels lackadaisical and nearly a slap in the face to the people that have sided with him for years upon years.
This is my opinion of both Drake and Kanye albums: In one hand, i kinda expect drake to put garbage albums but at least it has 3 or 4 bangers in it that&#39;s what i look for a Drake album at this point and he failed at it on this album. On the other hand, Kanye is unpredictable, he either succeed expectations or it&#39;s a hit-or-miss album, thankfully tho he did the former.                                                                                                                                                                                                   <br><br>Drake needs to focus on producing bangers because that&#39;s his speciality, i&#39;m not sure he will ever come with a great album anymore as i feel he isn&#39;t in that zone like &#39;&#39;fuck it i&#39;m going all out on this album&#39;&#39; type of thing. Kanye at this point has nothing to lose and has no boundaries that he can&#39;t cross, he can talk about any topic regardless of the controversy surrounding it unlike Drake who play it safe since he released his album Views.
This dude just a drake hater.
Views Was hard nigga
Drake been trash, glad ppl finally seeing it
“ Even though you&#39;re multi, I see that your soul don&#39;t look alive”<br>“Your music for the past few years been angry and full of lies“ -Push
Who cares if the songs sound similar, this is a concept album and Drake&#39;s most centrally themed record. You take any concept record from the 70s or 80s and complain that &quot;the songs sound too similar&quot; or &quot;he talks about the same shit on every track,&quot; and people will look at you goofy. I like CLB because it&#39;s different than his other albums in that it&#39;s more conceptual and the songs conform to the theme, and the mood he&#39;s trying to set. Plus, if you listen to it more than one time, you&#39;ll note the differences in how every song sounds. It&#39;s not Drake&#39;s best but it&#39;s different, and it&#39;s pissing off the people who never really were fans in the first place, so that&#39;s a huge W in my book.
Need to see a review for sometimes I might be introvert
Search Jay Pop - Racial Hatred

Clb is 🗑
They are literally seeing how much shit they can give you and still make money off it
Damn a light 3😅&amp; it&#39;s trending@#3..Drake gonna get his lil feelings hurt soon😈
Way 2 Sexy is great. How can you hate?!
Finally someone understands that #1 albums aren’t always #1 thank you Anthony for being the one to say something about it!
This dude is miserable😂 CLB already a classic🤰🏽
drake is an incel
Im 100% convinced Drake lost his ghostwriter
3 is like... 3 as in, &quot;3rd best&quot;... album of the year? 3rd best Drake album?... 3rd best album of all time, maybe??
How do you like a YouTube video more than once?
This review feels biased. I think I&#39;m done with this channel
The rating seems so befitting
At this point poopity scoop scoopity poop is way more inspired than anything Drake does.
Wish I could dislike this video twice
Damn idk if drake got carried by the features tho. I get that this album isn’t produced very well and it has a lot of misses and unnecessary songs, but I feel like the features definitely did not carry. A lot of people think if rap is faster it’s automatically better. I think (just my opinion) that Travis absolutely ruined fair trade, and I think it would’ve been amazing without him. Also saying that 21 savage performed better is just incorrect. I will say that this album was hyped up wayyyyyy too much, but I also think drake gets so much unnecessary hate, and I don’t think donda was better at all. (Again my opinion don’t blast me) I think the Kanye album was kind of carried by beats, a lot of songs were too long snd boring, and there was a huuuuuge lack of drums. So personally I think both albums have flaws, but clb was more enjoyable to me.
Gotdamn! Lmao no mercy
Is it weird if I say that You Only Live Twive is possibly drake’s best song ever?
Never seen so many people getting triggered over a cover 🤦‍♂️
The views album is a classic … blown away he said it was boring and dull
I love how his shirt has lil donda album covers on it 😂😂😂 WHAT A DISS

Anthony Lumberjack Fantano 👨🏻‍🚒
Watch out Fantano or Drake will make a horrible album insulting you next
The fact that you still haven&#39;t reviewed the new iron maiden album DISGUSTS me
the album was not that good. but still your tone tells that u r being bitter n hating hating §§ like how can u not enjoy a track like race my mind and say that you rather hear it from another artist.
Surprised Anthony didn&#39;t comment on how out of place the Bun B sample on N 2 Deep sounds. Personally I&#39;m kind of tired with Drake throwing out these nods to classic hip hop culture when you know he doesn&#39;t really give a shit
Hate to say it but Drizzy might be falling off.. 😢 but I’m still a little confused because what’s next, Lemon pepper freestyle, &amp; laugh now cry later we’re all fire ??? Idk what happened on this album.
Lol Drake ain’t hungry no more, he gonna end up fizzling out like Lil Wayne, he was lazy AF on this album smh fr
I loved this album
boy ain&#39;t no way boy
&quot;Derek Chauvin is my personal hero.&quot;<br>-Anthony Fantano
Maybe this&#39;ll be like therapy for drake, he needs to be roasted haha
he literally put up an album cover that’s similar to donda in the back just so people can talk about it, again this whole review is just clickbait forsure. he’s definitely just picking out all the “bad” in the album and bashing it knowing it’ll cause an uproar on his channel. Anthony lost his edge
this album cover is awful
for a lot of these songs fantano is like &quot;the feature artist is so much better than drake&quot; and i kept being like, &quot;what is he talking about I don&#39;t remember them at all&quot;<br><br>then I realised i couldn&#39;t make it to the features for like half the tracks
3/10 is too high
I absolutely agree
One of the most shitty album covers ive ever seen
To all us Drake fans. This is our fault. Everything he dropped &quot;OMG ITS 🔥&quot; Drake lost me after NWTS. He started to fall off
It&#39;s apt to revive old Drake Jokes<br>Drake is the type of guy who makes eye contact with you through the crack of a bathroom stall.<br>Drake is the type of guy who opens bag of potato chips with scissors.<br>Drake is the type of guy who pretends to sleep in a car, so his friends would carry him inside.<br>Drake is the type of guy who rides a horse with both legs on one side.
I thought there were some decent songs for sure I find myself only going back to tsu imy2 fair trade papi&#39;s home and love all. Overall I give it a 5
Drake is like the white Drake
certified boy lover
*melon texts Drizzy<br>You will never recover<br><br>Drake-  *doesn&#39;t
If you like this album you have a low iq, this is coming from a Kanye Stan tho
Anthony he said that there is a fine line between his brothers and friends and he has no friends according to him what’s wrong with that
Certified Boy Lover
Turn that 3 upside down it&#39;s a 3 now
China now is a dictator country ! let&#39;s  help China recovery  the quadrennial national leader election!
we need a drake interview asap
Views is the only time I enjoyed Drake&#39;s music. I want a Hotline Bling 2 with another silly music video.
How do you ripoff yourself?
Is he part of Kanye camp 🤔 the way he hating on this album
Day 4 of asking for a Little Simz Introvert album review. Please.
Drake is to music what Disney live action remakes are to movies
I’m so glad you mentioned TSU. I was genuinely creeped out listening to this track.
i hate the word cheugy, but this is it.
Trendthony Pagetano
Man, if you really wanted to you could market the whole flannel rating. You’ll be like the Source 😂. Yellow flannel approved
Yebba&#39;s Heartbreak is the best song on the album and Drake ISN&#39;T EVEN ON IT!
search Jay Pop - &quot;Racial Hatred&quot;
search Jay Pop - &quot;Racial Hatred&quot;
im gonna shoot this shit into my veins
Is that a donda vinyl on the shelf behind him?? lol
He gave it a 3, oh shit. Lmbo! 😂 😅
Clearly you don&#39;t understand the culture.
Donda got a 7 ,CLB got a 3 ? This made my day
Agree
Drake going 📉📉📉📉📉
Agree 1000% with everything in this review. <br><br>I think you should check out and review the new release ‘Sometimes I Might Be Introvert’ by UK rapper Little Simz. It’s fresh, innovative and inspiring from a global star on the rise.
Garbage. Too political. Unsubscribed. Loser
CLB or Donda??? no, its not about the features, the mixing, or even the artist themselves, but the friends we made along the way
I think that whole Adidon beef hurt Drake, dude sounds like he doesn&#39;t want to rap anymore...
Honestly a 3 is overly generous
Nothing shallow besides this repetitive pseudo intellectual critique of drake. There’s enough bars and bangers on this album to match up with some of the best rap albums of recent years. But y’all will pretend to listen, minimise a body of music into a few cute sounding words like “cohesive” “artistic boundaries” etc, and drake will continue to be bigger than your favourite artist.
Kanye &gt; Drake 😊
Smiling With No Teeth in the background makes my heart happy.
When I heard Travis Scott&#39;s verse I was really wondering if he was trying to sabotage it.
Do a donda vs clb
Drake is mad because he didn&#39;t want people to know he had a son
Long time drake fan this album sucked
Clearly Fantano h8 cuz he ain&#39;t 2 sexy for his shirt
3/10 and #3 on trending
A car battery to his nuts for stimulation lmao omg 😂😂
hahahahah HAHAHAHHA
W
I didn’t like this album that much, I liked DONDA a lot and I know the fans have beef too. However I felt the light 3 was too harsh
DAMN.
Certified Boy Lover
Im 100% convinced Drake lost his ghostwriter
Drake album wasn&#39;t that good it packed substance
Album is tridashh
Wrong. <br>The CLB intro has some reminiscence from the track Furthest thing. <br>Not Tuscan Leather. <br>I know u heard them church bells. Just like in Futhest Thing
They could’ve held on to that Travis Scott song, that shit was flaming garbage.
Biggest mistake coming for Ye.
Just admit you don&#39;t like Drake or Eminem. You continuously just shit all over everything these two do and it seems more like clickbait for you where now you&#39;re following a formula to hate these two. You will suck Kanyes toes to absolute no end. I think you&#39;ve only given Kanye one bad review and that&#39;s only cause you&#39;re not very religious. Honestly it&#39;s old man. You talk about so many artists yet you don&#39;t evolve yourself.
Thank God you finally redeem yourself...
So you don&#39;t like it?
You were generous with the 3 tbh
I&#39;ve dropped better shits than clb
I don’t understand how you guys genuinely feel this negatively about the album when just about everyone else listened and enjoyed it
Just say you dont like Drake and move on Lmao. Cant even hide your bias in this one.
Basically the album sucks
LMAO best theneedledrop review I&#39;ve ever seen
Drake needs to make an album like the Eminem scene from 8 mile
This freak.
bruh I am a drake hater to the fullest, I just dont get, why hes so reluctant to make a real diss on the album, say they name lol AND WTF YOU CAN JUMP ON A BIG GHOST OVO SOUND MESH but nahhhh boring low beats, its like Donald trump,,, you coulda done ANYTHINGGGG and you did this lolol whyyy anyways My opinion lol
penelope scott next, she literally just talks
This is the most boring album I&#39;ve heard in a while and that&#39;s a lot considering Scorpion was just as bad. Shit is crazy long and has like 3 songs I would actually replay
drake 34 he needa pull some off durin 35 or its over cant be simp rappin after 35
they beef is becoming something where i have a feeling either ye will make watch the throne 2 or they will collab someday
certified boy lover
Drake is the chicken tenders of the music industry
Talking about Drake&#39;s sexuality for 17 minutes dosen&#39;t count as a review melon :(
I’m releasing my diss track tonight Drake is garbage after 2018.
Woopity scoop
Drake only beefing with Kanye so he has something to write about
I really couldn’t listen to this album lol. I’m not trying to get into comparisons but at least Donda made me feel something. I think Nothing Was the Same was the last album I really listened. Maybe the one after that but then I lost interest
You can&#39;t say this album isn&#39;t original though: it&#39;s the first record ever produced by a (recently come-out) male lesbian!
hi im anthony fantano and i critique stuff i didn’t create
this is the most spot-on review ever.
Not a diss, but I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve seen his face as one of those horrible 4chan soy boy images. I&#39;m pretty sure 4chan is a sign of the apocalypse.
You&#39;re entitled to your opinion, and I don&#39;t mean this as an insult, but it seems like many of your criticisms boil down to parasocially disliking Drake as a person? You claim he&#39;s copping The Weeknd&#39;s style even though Drake and The Weeknd are from the same city music scene and were both co-parents to that trend. You get annoyed with Drake for things like &quot;Diary Drake&quot; (despite the fact this is a draw for most Drake fans; that he is transparent and relatable about his mental state and personal feelings), but if you dislike him speaking on his life experience, it baffles me how you could ever enjoy ANY of his music. And you imply he raps about his kid because Pusha &quot;sonned&quot; him (forgive the pun) into acknowledging his child musically when there is no evidence for this as far as I am aware and it personally seems like a very disrespectful thing to say about a person without good reason? Maybe he raps about his kid because fatherhood impacts his life?
2/10 Album
W
Hey anthony after I listened to this album yesterday I gave this album a 3/10 because I felt like that Drake was trying way too hard and I don&#39;t like the fact how he&#39;s trying to sound so tough and I&#39;ve never been a Drake fan because I feel like that (when i say this it is a joke but also true at the same time) he has a fanbase of boys who cry when they&#39;re girlfriend either breaks up with them or cheat on them then the boys listen to Drake when they&#39;re sad that&#39;s what I feel like that Drake&#39;s music only appeals to boys who cry while listening to his music because either their girlfriend broke up with them or cheated on them that&#39;s just the facts Props to you Anthony keep up the good work
Los got bodied ngl
Put your diapers up for diarrhea uhm diary Drake xD
This album was so ass bruh 😆
1. Laugh Now Cry Later &amp; Wants and Needs are better songs than anything on CLB.<br><br>2. I seriously can&#39;t believe that this is the real album. There are 0 highlights, the beats are boring, nothing special and so many features...something is very off.
&quot;And I&#39;m drowning out the noise from the sideline. Sometimes it&#39;s louder than the voice I got in my mind. I can&#39;t even hear myself when I get quiet time. Like, how they tellin&#39; me I&#39;m done, when I&#39;m in my prime? They&#39;ve been trying to push a narrative since &#39;09&quot; - Drake on CLB<br><br>People just love to see other people fall. That&#39;s all it really is nowadays. Sad to see all these comments be so hateful. Y&#39;all been doing this yet still can&#39;t seem to find a way to knock him off the top. Artist of the Decade over everybody for a reason. All the records for a reason. No wonder everybody hates him, he&#39;s doing everything right lol.
Everybody time is short I tell you it&#39;s really short we are about to reach the point of no return. Please return to the our father in heaven whose name is actually Ahayah Asher Ahayah (paleo hebrew) or i am that i am, thru our savior his son Yashaya our salvation is at hand we need to repent now. Also hold fast to the 10 COMMANDMENTS that are in Exodus chapter 20 and the FEAST DAYS. They&#39;re planning a false flag nuclear attack on America And NYC soon go look at the news and the fallen ones (aliens) are going to reveal their self along with the antichrist who well establish a false peace out of this world war 3 chaos that&#39;s gone be created. Repent now and accept the salvation and pray that you may be worthy to escape the torments and temptation that&#39;s coming upon the earth in the rapture that&#39;s going to happen real soon🤷🏿‍♂️❤️🙏🏾
The factuals and the shade being thrown here are too much 💯😂
Couldn’t disagree more
Review the Peppa Pig album
Why did he call him Abel three times
From me to you &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; CLB
So KSI’s Album is 2x better than CLB?😂
Certified Negative Review
Ye and Drake both beat out for album of the year by the Shang Chi soundtrack. Who knew…
He said paper tiger hahahahahhaha
L
Donda &gt; CLB
Kanye vs Drake = beyond meat
Drake fans cant C the L they B taking
For the likes of a Drake “No inspiration = No ghostwriter”… which when you think about it… “No inspiration = No Quentin Miller” Which begs the question, Is Quentin Miller actually Drake, Is The Weekend Drake? What about Party… Is he actually Drake? Who is Drake?
Melon is uncomfortably biased against Drizzy. Watch “Way 2 Sexy” go platinum before the year is over.
.....so basically drake dropping &quot;Facebook single mom bars&quot;..bet
Fantano: Donda=7 and CLB=3<br><br>Kanye fans worldwide took a dub today boys
I listened to 5 tracks and turned it off. BORRRRINNNG
spot on
First time running into this channel. Not a very objective review.
Drake literally got out-rapped by Lil Baby 💀
Views wasn&#39;t boring come on thats cap. yes this album was trash
Review Petey’s Lean Into Life please
Y’all tripping in the comments section. Drake is hard as fuck.. Dope ass Lyricist for sure 🔥🔥Drake gone be here for many more years to come.. Y’all might as well get used to it.
BTS with megan thee stallion review pls? you somehow missed that track on the weekly review which is weird because it’s one of the bigger songs to come out recently….
Maybe the album cover represents us waiting 9 months for the album to sound good, I don’t know 🤰😒
N 2 deep was “throwed” by bun b not a Travis throwaway but I see what your saying lol
<b>Anthony Fantano is just butt hurt cause he&#39;s idol Kanye is getting dragged</b> . Nevertheless, it&#39;s really not that deep lol. Record 1000&#39;s of songs throughout over the years, pick 21 randomly &amp; put it on the album
Na this guy is genuinely funny, even though sometimes I don’t agree with his takes, I love that I’m not the only one that that CLB was lazy
It’s ironic that Fantano doesn’t buy into Drake’s “no friends in the industry” tough guy stance but he buys into Kanye’s religiosity? Wow. Just say you don’t like Drake.
Simple. He&#39;s doing it for the numbers, not for the art.
Dark Lane Demo Tapes &gt; CLB
I thought he&#39;d give it a 0, i&#39;m very surprised
7-8/10, had a lot of good moments but not his best work
3/10 is too high
Drake bout to diss you bro. You were too on point.
Mf’s listen to CLB but don’t C the L’s they B taking
I don&#39;t like the album but he never likes Drake albums. Why doesn&#39;t he just say he&#39;s not a Drake fan lol
I can now officially enjoy CLB, thanks.
Trash that&#39;s what it is
I agree with you it was not good not how drake used to be
CLB and Donda both were not their best albums drake from 2010-2014 will always be prime drake and 2007-2014 is for ye
All jokes aside, this is a wonderful review. Anthony is really, really talented. He was made for this.
Views boring? Wow. Im out
Can&#39;t wait for kendrick&#39;s album this yr... and also em he might drop 🔥
Bullshit!!! That’s all.
Great and accurate review
i miss the old drake
100% agree with this review
This 🤡 been hating on that man since 09 and still hasn’t put an album out himself
Why does the thumbnail look so cold. Like not super colourful
Donda won
YO MELON’S #2 IN TRENDING AT THE MOMENT FOR THIS LET’S GO!
#2 ON TRENDING <br>WAY TO GO MELON!
And some say Drake is a better rap artist than Kendrick Lamar. Lol, he may be bigger, but Kendrick is far, far and I mean FAR better rap artist than he is. Kung fu KENNY!
Unsubscribed
it just feels unmotivated, if that makes sense. :/
To do a reaction without the actual music, classic
The album cover is art that only drake can understand
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=358">5:58</a> This line hits harder than the entire album.
weakest beat switches ive ever heard, snooze/10
Tbh the only reason I listened to this album is that my favorite &quot;LA Based Jazz Pianist&quot; Keifer plays the piano at the end of Knife Talk. If you only listen to those 10 seconds or so, this album is easily a 9
A 3/10 is actually generous. I was expecting a 1
Somehow Dark Lane Demo Tapes is a much more enjoyable listen
This feels a lot like Drakes Relapse, the moment in his career where he goes corny and drops a level on rapping and creativity. The sad part is at least Eminem has the flow that is still interesting until his 40s but I don&#39;t think Drake has the talent to go into his 40s.
Say what you will but I’m genuinely impressed. Drake may be the only artist ever to feature both future and thug on a track and MISS.
Drake is a grown as man sneak dissing because he is in his feelings. Ego/pride is a hell of a drug!
Atleast he knows Donda is better than clb
The album sucked
This album is exactly what Kendrick was talking about from TPAB. A “talent show” where some artists just turn out garbage music, cut the checks and bounce.
the black record on the back could be dean blunts black metal
i like how the donda record&#39;s just hanging out at the back, nice one melon
The real winners from both projects... The features. They get to keep away from the beef and get nice checks from 2 of the biggest artists/performers this gen
Drake makes music for people who mean mug everyone at the bar and then hide behind the bouncer if a fight breaks out. He writes &quot;No Friends in the Industry&quot; on an album crammed with industry features, talks about how he takes on all comers after shrinking away from Push. It&#39;s just sad.
Drake might as well call himself Playlist Papi at this point. Incapable of making a cohesive project. Literally just a bunch of songs
Good thing art is subjective
Drake has a son and bangs girls. If you don’t catch that from the album straight away dont worry, he will remind you 10 more times on every single track
3/10 ? Hmmmm.... yep that’s a W for fanthony
Jesus Melon was scolding drake 😂😂
Factual posting Melon, good stuff
This mans a fool calling views a dreadfully boring album. Fr an idiot
Certified lover boy of anyone 14-17 years old
6ix9ine got higher score than this for reference
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=265">4:25</a> “ POPpies hOmE”
Dark lane demo tapes is better then this album 💿
You should review &quot;bb u ok?&quot; by san holo
I want a whole Drake &amp; DJ Khaled double album.
Thank you
Ant you’re kinda a Scrooge. Too sexy is the most bangin fun song this year. That thug ft was bad though.
Happiest I&#39;ve ever been to see a red flannel
Lmao this was rated worse than a KSi album
IM SEEING RED IM SEEING RED IM SEEIN REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED
If Drake didn’t have a kid he’d have even less to say
Spot on review thank you 👏🏽
Way 2 sexy was... Way 2 cringe
I really struggled to get through CLB. There is nothing unique or different on it that has grabbed my attention. I&#39;ve listened to Donda more than a dozen times front to back, including the pt 2&#39;s.Thats not to say Donda is perfect, but it is different and you can see the beauty in its flaws, not to mention Ye took a lot of risks and you can see/hear his vulnerability which draws me in. It almost seems like Drake is grasping for a topic to create content too and I find myself bored.
Jesus! I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen you rip someone like this Melon! SHEESH! Watermelon?? more like HARDCOREMELON
CLB is a R&amp;B Hip Hop Record made for toxic men and woman<br><br>If that was the description of Toxic Lover Boy. Might get solid 5
Well you can tell this guy isn&#39;t F*****g Fans..
His name is Aubrey and it shows
Way to sexy is amazing 😂 future snapped <br>Travis verse was mid
Dat boy said 3 I fw the opinion doe
This should of been a mixtape
A three??? <br><br><br><br><br><br>That&#39;s quite generous don&#39;t you think?
YOU ARE ON POINT ON THIS ONE....MINE IS 2/10
It&#39;s OUTSHONE Anthony
Drake did better in degrassi.
This record is a big bag of nono <br>Why was this hyped up
Do you think that Drake can do better or do you think that he’s lost his abilities to make a good album
Drake is a guy who I can tell has an immense amount of talent and versatility that he could use to make an actual decent album that’s listenable, even if it’s subpar. I can even tell that he still has it in him with his most recent songs/features building up to CLB like laugh now cry later, scary hours 2, and his most recent features. The issue is, he doesn’t push his sound and content  to make fans want to actually tune in to the album time after it’s release<br><br>It seems like ever since Views, he’s been taking that album and copying and pasting its formula into a new “album” and calling it a day (Even though I loved More Life). I honestly had the bar pretty low for CLB already since I didn’t like Scorpion and had mixed feelings about Dark Lane Demo, yet I was somehow still disappointed because I felt like I was listening to the exact same album I heard in 2018 which was the exact same album I heard in 2017<br><br>The utter fact that Drake is a 34 year old man with a son who raps about toxic masculinity and fucking different girls is simply appalling to me considering I know people at that age who have been married for years. Like my guy, you’re a grown ass man who’s calling himself something you’d expect a middle schooler to call himself after having sex for the first time<br><br>If I can give drake one thing I’ll give him this, he has the unbelievable power to make songs that fit into a particular vibe and when in the moment, that song can hit harder than any song out there (Take One Dance and God’s Plan for example). If he can muster up some of his talent to make an album that has a consistent flow that’s interesting and enjoyable and make it separable from all the projects in his discography, then he could possibly make one of the best albums in the genre. But with the way he’s doing things right now, I don’t think we’ll see an album like that anytime soon
Little simz
damn number 3 on trending
Has Anthony helped produce any albums? I know he plays bass and dude obviously has an ear for music.
You Only Live Twice is the best track on the album and Drake had the 3rd best verse on it still. This album was underwhelming for sure. No deviation from the sound we’ve heard for the last 5 years
Kanye actually whipped Drake
If Jpegmafia was on way 2 sexy it&#39;d be in Melon&#39;s top 10 songs
Donda&gt;Dark Lane Demo Tapes&gt;CLB
too sexy is just a troll tbh
I always wait until I can dedicate my time to actively listen to the full album before pulling it up. I couldn’t even get through the first 5 tracks without honestly falling asleep.
Donda &gt;
L drake is bad
certified boy lover
The roast on this album was hilariously on point. Good stuff man… haha.
Album Reggie blunt hell seeds  😬
Ngl way too sexy a bop
feels like we know nothing about drake himself.. CLB is just the same retread of clubbing/strippers/being on top etc. Like where&#39;s the passion?
can you review the melodic blue by baby keem. its coming out on the 10th
Bruh said Fair Trade was the best on the album, instant dislike lol
REVIEW READY TO RAVE, GAB3
IMY2 IS raw chill
That&#39;s it. Kanye won the beef
I enjoyed Poppy’s Home alot until… yeah, whatever Nicki did at the backend… too bad.
Certified lover boy ❌<br>Certified overrated shit ✅<br>This album had so hype that i thought maybe his best album is about to drop. But lol it&#39;s literally his worst album tbh.
Drake lacks self awareness. He has a lot of Yes Men around him that aren’t challenging him to grow artistically. His ego will be his career death. Gone are the days that your name is enough to sell an album🤷‍♀️
you only gave this a 3 because you hate sleepy music.
CLB 1/10 garbage album
This album fire melon boy is not valid 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️
This is the only review I genuinely agree with fuck with. Thank you
im sure drake saw this
Do the next Alien Weaponry album coming out this month
Finally someone to decide my preferences for me
How you start a family? The condom slipped up?
This album sucks bro idk how ppl can say it’s good and even better than donda blows my mind
Donda &gt; CLB <br><br>Stay Mad 💀
Certified hater boy
The only time I will agree with Anthony fantano
missing the point with the way 2 sexy song, its a typical Atlanta strip club type song , thats what it was made for
Should have no business reviewing rap. East one here “ no friends in the industry” he’s not saying he doesn’t have friends in the industry he’s saying there brothers and family. So you 3 minutes rant on this just shows you can’t even dissect a simple drake song
Sooooo basically fuck drake, okay got it
This album was very challenging to listen to. I was waiting for it to be over
Cmon bro you can&#39;t just give him a 3/10 because he&#39;s white smh.
He hasn’t drop a good project since more life
Drake needs Weeknd again 💀
You would give this a higher score if it wasn&#39;t made by a lesbian.
You should review fishmonger by underscores, Anthony. Strictly Drizzness.
This is literally just a place to shit on Drake at this point…
Comparing the CLB cover and the Donda cover really shows us that sometimes the best way to win is to not play.
Melon already got Vinyl of Kanye Donda in the background.
I rarely agree with u but this time we on the same page!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=480">8:00</a>  .. love that song and still caught myself thinking the exact same thing .. like &quot; damn this dude makes being a predator sound cool asf &quot; 😭
I love you, Melon, thank you!
#2 trending .........DAMN
Please stop reminding us Aubrey is Canadian. No one here is proud of that
VIEWS A CLASSIC
Safe to say Kanye wins this battle
Biased review
😂😂😂😂 this an 8 don’t care
Unfazed
“cosplay”<br><br>The word that took me out 💀 🤣
2 trending for the 2 good songs
When can we get a review of the OMORI OST (I&#39;m new here so if he doesn&#39;t review stuff like that I totally get it) I just randomly thought it would be interesting to have somebody who probably never played the game? To listen to the music and give a interesting opinion on it. I had this thought pop into my head when I remembered that he did the Peppa pig soundtrack and thought the sky was the limit for this man.
It&#39;s disappointing that having such a huge voice and reach, Drake decides to not say anything relevant every time
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Outgrew Drake&#39;s music last album. Thought he would have had more growth with this one. We are both around the same age but it sounds like I&#39;m listening to a 20 year old. Peter Pan Syndrome.
This is the best diss track of 2021.
Wait, that&#39;s the actual cover art?
Hey wait a minute….I like Hot Shower 😂
I just get a drake ad straight after this video 💀
comany &gt; sicko mode
Melon, I don&#39;t think it was a good idea for you to rate the album a 10, but then dock 3 points because he&#39;s Jewish, and another 4 points because he&#39;s black.
Boythany lovetano
Y’all crazy. TSU top 3 song up there. Drake did good on Fair Trade (didn’t need Travis), Pipe down was great, N 2 Deep was good. 7am on Bridle Path is amazing. IMY2 has grown on me and I like it. Race my mind is a nice vibe. Get Along was smooth <br><br>This project is easily better than Scorpion and almost better than Views.
The description says <b>CERTIFIED SNOOZER</b><br><b>LMAO</b>
Drake is to CLB what Chance was to TBD: the worst part of his own album
As a Drake fan I can say he has not evolved. Even though there are some tracks I love on here he hasn’t made anything new. It’s the same sound and same type of lyrics to be completely honest.
I love reading all the comments about how Drake is played out reaching his end… etc etc yet he continues to destroy all the records of your favorite rappers/musicians haha
yeah um if you say CLB&gt; DONDA , im gonna assume you&#39;re below the age of 11
this review is a diss track itself
I use Apple Music so listening to this album essentially cost me nothing, yet I am left wanting Drake to give me money back.
🤰🏻🤰🏼🤰🏽🤰🏾🤰🏿🤰
Donda on the back
This man&#39;s red flannel has the power to be #1 trending 😂
Ba ba boom get dunked on wheelchair lover blitch DFL!
Nah he buggin
Yooooo, I predicted it would be a 3.💀💀
This review was more entertaining than the record.
This review was more interesting than the actual album
In the thumbnail for this video you look like someone has opened the door to your bathroom, where you are sat on the toilet taking a shite, and they have taken a photo of you.
Anyone else really hate this album cover
Id rather listen to an uninspired boring drake than christian rapper kanye.
I think the reason why it seems like Drake&#39;s obsessing and ye isnt is because ye Is using that tactic that Drake used making his bars multi intended if that makes sense
Drake: I am unfazed, here are 30 songs about me being unfazed. <br><br>Kanye: i am the glob glob golgolab.
I like the donda cover in the backround
🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
“They hated on views just like they will CLB”<br>and I ain’t gotta say more
Oh shit, even worse than I thought ahahah
He gave it one less point than i did lol
Are we not gonna mention how AWFUL the cover is, probably contender for the worst one of the year
certified boy lover
Is it worth the listen? Let me know.
Even Anthony likes donda better then CLB
Certified Boy Lover
Why is a 34 year old man calling himself a lesbian, god Drake sucks lmao
Drake doesn’t care, this whole album sounds like background music at a random party because at least it gets him the most streams with the least effort. He just takes advantage of his name to make up for his lack of motivation.
Drake is the embodiment of virality over artistry
whenever i see melon in a red flannel i become a certified boy lover
nah dont do fountains like that. You didnt even mention tems
I wonder if Drake will actually see this
10/10 review
What’s crazy is that drake is known to make radio music and only 1 track is worthy of that lmao
Very boring album and forgettable
I might be in the minority because I love More Life. And grew to appreciate scorpion as it aged so I&#39;m not one who thinks he peaked in 2015. but my goodness is this album boring and terrible.
&quot;An actor not an artist&quot;
No/10
CLB isn’t drake’s best album by far, but this just sounds like a drake hater review🤦🏾‍♂️
Are we just gonna forget the young thug line “I’m tryna get molested”?
Boy .... The hate is thick in here. <br>Your wife must be a Drake fan. 😂
Zoinks
#2 on trending 🔥🔥
Too much hate 😂
THIS GUY BEEN A JOKE FOR A LONG ASS TIME WHO GIVES THIS GUY ANY CREDABILITY TO COMMENT ON RAP MUSIC .. I RATHER AK THEN THIS CLOWN
Drake&#39;s kid is going to grow up knowing damn well he wasn&#39;t wanted. Drake&#39;s gonna make sure of that.
Did Anthony actually not call Drake Champagne Papi? Unsubbed.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=365">6:05</a> LMAOOO
Certified L Boy
Tems is the best part of this album. Fountains is the best song on this album by far. On an album that is VERY MEH. On behalf of the lesbian community, Drake frankly we&#39;re tired.
Certified Melon Boy.
The best parts on this album was lil wayne and kid cudi lmao
At this point, I just think Drake is a boring person. Drake is 36 years old and still giving you the raps, topics, etc., that he had at the age of 26 years old. This is his sixth album. Drake&#39;s discography is loaded with fluff/minimal classics. At this point, the most successful modern greats had done something to step out of the box and push things for themselves artistically. <br><br>By 31 years old, on his 4th studio album, Kanye made 808s and Heartbreak. Jay Z by 36 years old had made The Blueprint, The Black Album, and two collaborative albums including a project with Linkin Park. Jay Z was already going out of his comfort zone. Kendrick is younger with less albums and has already given out of the box/creative projects. If we want to think of Drake as just pop, by the time Beyonce had made her 6th studio album, she was on Lemonade. By her sixth studio album, Taylor Swift had completely changed her original genre. She is currently 33 years old and making songs like she is Joni Mitchell. LOL, there is a HUGE difference between what she made at the age of 23 years old versus 33 years old. <br><br>All this to say that, Drake really doesn&#39;t have an excuse for being as boring as he is. He has the success and the money and probably the trust of the label executives. And he is making this generic stuff? There are pop stars that are just as big that would have already taken chances, been more creative, or thought outside of the box at this point in their career compared to him. Drake is stuck on arrested development. People really want to hear this stuff from a 36 year old?
CLS got a 3 and Kanye a 7 😁😁😂😂😅
So much drake hate!
Based melon
Drop a dud and sale 500k in a week . Weirdo
Review SosMulas solo album :) melon boy
Lmao whyte people judging black music is just ironic
Who is this guy looool
Is drake turning into Eminem?
Idk what you’re all talking about, but I absolutely loved this album.
This album felt like it came out in 2015-16
Tsu stands for Texas state university. A college in Houston, if that makes it any creepier.
Drake is finished. Period.
I prefer Scary Hours 2 over this, and that was only an ep.
Drake sucks and he&#39;s always sucked. Yall know this is just my opinion, right? Trans
What’s album on the lower shelf?
Certified Loser Boy
THAT COVER ART LMAOOOOOOO!!!!!! 🤣😂💀✋
CLB=<br>Certified Lesbian Boy
I honestly disagree pretty heavily, def should be lower, bottom 3 album I’ve ever tortured myself with
Thank you for letting me have an opinion now, Fantano. I almost thought I liked this album, happy I can now publicly express my distaste for it.
Drake is the type of guy who cries over someone calling him gay
All I keep thinking is who in their right mind gave the go ahead for that album cover it really is one of the worst I&#39;ve seen.
100 percent agree with this review
Should I watch Donda&#39;s Review 1st?
The truth is Drake set the bar WAYYY too high for himself that it’s impossible to please a guy like <b>this</b> &amp; everybody else like him. There’s a masssssive group of ppl that just literally live to hate Drake &amp; want to see him lose. <br><br>I wonder if Kanye stans would be honest enough to admit that if Donda released after TLOP, it would’ve been shit on but because it came after 2 AWFUL Kanye projects, the bar was low 🤷‍♂️. (Don’t worry, nobody holding their breath)
Drake can&#39;t get over the fear about losing relevancy and make something meaningful, because he can&#39;t make something meaningful and if he does he will lose relevancy. Many of his fans I see criticized Donda for &quot;why does an album need to have a meaning/message? just make hits!&quot;. Even the album cover was instantly judged &quot;it&#39;s just black&quot; they don&#39;t searchfor meaning or anything past surface level. Anyone who put thought into it could see it&#39;s because the color black is used for to represent Mourning and Grief (think funerals) and that album is dedicated to his late mother that passed, which he blamed himself for, for many years.<br><br>They don&#39;t care about the content of the lyrics, it&#39;s just background music or music to get hype too. It isn&#39;t an art for them. If Drake steered away from trying to make generic radio hits and make something different that&#39;s artistic and meaningful his fans would hate it as that&#39;s not what they listen to him for. Everything he does is to appeal to that fanbase, as it keeps him on top. That&#39;s where him and his own self proclaimed idol, Kanye, differ. Kanye doesn&#39;t care if people hate what he puts out. He does it for the love of the art. <br><br>People always try to compare sales and use that argument to show why Drake is better. You think Kanye is as obsessed with sales? The album before this was a full on Gospel album. He dropped a 7-Track album the year prior (terrible for sales streaming wise). He dropped Yeezus which at the time was so outlandish and different from everything else in Hiphop that even many of his own fans didn&#39;t like it for a while. Same with 808s, a full album talking about sadness and depression and feelings of loneliness, way before it became the mainstream like it is not to talk about feelings. Many of his fans then also hated that album, as it was so different from the prior 3 albums he had released. <br><br>His whole career <b>(even his first album, no street talk, gang banging, trying to act hard over boom bap beats. Just a kid with a Pink Polo and a Backpack tryna tell us about his life and speak on the media (Jesus Walks) and the black struggle.)</b> has been him trying to push boundaries in the realm of hiphop (music in general tbh) and make new sounds and do things with music that haven&#39;t been done before. Kanye does it for the love of the art and each album being significantly different from the prior. <br><br>Donda is a Gospel-ish themed album that was paying homage to his mom that was dropped on a Sunday at 8am, taking 2.5 possible days of streaming away from the album. <br><br>Drake does it for the numbers, not for the art. That&#39;s why he won&#39;t make anything meaningful and will stick to generic mainstream sound. He isn&#39;t trying to create art.
This guy really reviewed clb with a donda vinyl in the background 💀💀💀💀💀
Dark lane demo tapes is better than clb, change my mind…
Ironic when this video is #3 on the Trending list
A light 3 is pretty forgiving. A &quot;Not Good&quot; might be more fitting.
This is the pettiness I needed today. Bravo 👏
Drake&#39;s entire career is just him repeating the monoculture back to his listeners. The monoculture changes maybe every 5 years if things are moving very fast and it has been widely the same since about 2012. Drake&#39;s lazy methods cannot get the same numbers on every project because the number of new hardcore listeners he has on each project is outweighed by the number of listeners who expect his music to grow as they do, but his music won&#39;t change at all until he is sure that the new &quot;cool&quot; is cemented into society for him to copy which won&#39;t come again for 5-10 years.<br><br>The disappointment of the next 5-10 year period also adds on to the current period because fans expect twice the change but barely get enough to hold them over for the current period.<br><br>This is totally fine if he plans on making music that dies out right on time for when he retires but it&#39;s a lazy business move for his children and family because they will have much less in royalties and residuals than they would if he made potent music that could be unpacked by new fans for the next century.
Only 1 diary drake song per album anymore than that it’s automatic sleep mode
Funny seeing the OVO stans calling foul... Bottom line is Drake is on autopilot.
Love the channel.. You have inspired me to create my own channel..  Thanks and keep up the great work :)
I gotta check Fair Trade out because it&#39;s supposedly 🔥
Yep those highlight tracks seem to be the best ones on the album and the only great songs on it. And the least favourite track is quite hilariously bad indeed, even thugger can&#39;t save it lol
confirmed, drake and kanye west combined are only good as 1 kendrick.
Fantano is so bias lol
Please do mercury act 1!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=358">5:58</a> lmao
e
Why not review Grip&#39;s IDFT !? If you are in search of concept album !
Those &quot;15 minutes of anthony hating drake&quot; videos have just doubled in lenght lmao
Drake fell off
I gave this album two listen-throughs, and it&#39;s a two. For me it came down to the beats, there was nothing there of substance, no flavor, and just it was kind of meh.
Literally turned this shite off at Way 2 Sexy. Absolute dogshit
Holy shit, this vid is trending haha. A bunch of verified channels in the comment section. Trending #40 700k+ views. Red flanny.
L take
Bruh, he absolutely sharted all over this album lol
KSIs Album was better
Definitely agree with a lot of commenters here that this is an album that was way too safe for what he needed to put out. He relied on the Ye beef to push the album and seems like he&#39;s trying to relive old Drake styles mashed up into this album. I personally didn&#39;t like Donda or CLB very much and don&#39;t either either artist, but I feel like I enjoyed features on this album slightly more than Donda.<br><br>Definitely way too much hype for both albums this year because they were both lackluster.
Donda&gt;Clb
Dawg you should have said “the internet’s sexiest music nerd” bruh
Toronto&#39;s very own child lover you mean?
Agreed
I guess Ye won then
Girls like girls is terrible, I love the rest of the album
Certified MID Boy 💀 3/10<br>Yikes.
Too high
The best allegory I can have for CLB is Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man 3
It&#39;s not good but it&#39;s not worse than Scorpion imo
It’s official DONDA&lt;&lt;&lt;CLB
My boi KSI album got a higher score nice
So what your saying is donda&gt;&gt;clb ? @anthonyfantano 😏
This is Revival level of trash
Lmao I feel bad for drake fans imagine waiting years for a album like this
This is a reminder that he gave Lil Pump a 7<br>Watch Drake stans get mad :)
Everything he said is spot on. This album sounds very uninspiring. I guess when you know you’re going to do a billion streams regardless, it doesn’t matter
Honestly way 2 sexy is pretty fun to listen to if you don’t take it too seriously
How was Demo tapes better than this anticipated CLB … huge flop 2/10 for me 5 good songs out of 21
A THREE?!?!!
Last great Drake album is if you&#39;re reading this it&#39;s too late. The following showed us he still has bars, melodies and significant relevance. I thought this would be his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=284">4:44</a> but missed. I&#39;ll wait continuously for that now
It’s official. <br>DONDA &gt;
3/10 is actually a perfect score.
W
Based on the actual review, I think 3 was generous
Lets just take a moment to think about this: <br>CLB got a lower score than the mixtape from NF called clouds, and our melon doesnt even like NF
I love your videos!! They are amazing. Stay safe out there everyone ❤️🍒💖
Who else loves when Drake’s albums get shitted on? Dude should’ve hung it up after Take Care
I get so happy when people shit on drake:)
This is a typical drake album. He went on with what has always made him...<br>great features, one liners, and etc. <br><br>Donda my first listen i wasnt the biggest fan. But it started to grow on me. It was creative not perfect.... but i appreciate when an artist moves away from the typical mainstream style of hiphop. And kanye isnt scared to do so.
we need that hwh 8 review
Now we really really know Donda &gt; CLB
dude keeps trending with reviews.....CONGRATS
He stole that lesbian bar from Tourettes Guy
This album was so much better than Donda. I get that we all hate Drake but you gotta admit this is his best album in years
Even this review is boring holy shit lol
THANK YOU !!! THANK YOU BESTHONY BESTTANO
Disliked this video immediately
This is what I thought, cuz there are only 3 decent songs
literally how did nobody stop drake from releasing an album name that can easily be rearranged to &quot;certified boy lover&quot;
belly review please
Taking a comment from the hiphopheads sub Reddit, but Drake albums are like the FIFA video games. <br><br>It’s fun, there’s enough to keep you interested and play it, but it’s more or less the same as it’s predecessor. There is no noticeable progression or new element that makes things interesting. <br><br>His projects since Views, any song can be on any of the projects. There is no notable difference his last 4-5 projects in terms of themes, actual concepts, sonically, lyrically. <br><br>It sounds like a comfortable dude who made songs from the comfort of his mansion.
Potatoes gon potate🙂
He really dug into Drakes psyche lmao
What is the name of that album behind melon, in the lower shelf?
The future verse on Way 2 Sexy is like one of the only highlights
Everything in this album is mediocre
This dude doesn&#39;t have one classic body of work &amp; y&#39;all say he&#39;s the &quot;GOAT&quot;... Fuck outta&#39; here.
you can&#39;t review the album because you are not the type of person to listen to Drakes music
W Melon
This video is number 4 trending, lets make it 3 just for Drake
<b>Certified Trash Classic</b> is more like it Anthony hahaha. 😅 LOVE ME. 😭
Three rows of women? Three letters in CLB? A Three rating?? Confirmed September 7, 2021, Melon runs the Illuminati.
There were teasers
Basically, a strong 2
Kings disease2 &gt; donda &gt; clb
the album was total garbage
Money in the industry will be the downfall of music. Drake won&#39;t try anything new because he doesn&#39;t have to, if it ain&#39;t broke and is still keeping you the #1 selling solo artist then why change anything
Album review ❤️🚀
Drake has a son and bangs girls. If you don’t catch that from the album straight away dont worry, he will remind you 10 more times on every single track
This album just sounded souless
Review Chvrches - Screen violence.🙏
I find it funny theres people that actually think this is a good album. 😀😀
Very happy my girl Yebba was on the album, but it was a shame that she was one of the few highlights of it.
Drake has always been cringe
extra-trashy trash
Alright Melon we get it, you liked the new Kanye West record more than Drake&#39;s new record. No need to flex your vinyl.
Is that a donda vinyl behind fantano?
Idk…I think Drakes a strong contender for song of the year with “Life of the party.”
Easily the worst album cover in history.
*is based Kanye fan <br>* dislikes clb because drake <br>*elaborates no further
Features carried this album so hard.
I seriously think the cover + merch of CLB are so bad it affected the album rollout. There&#39;s nothing sexy or cool or &quot;certified lover boy&quot; about pregnant lady emojis or his weird merch captions and I think combined it killed a-lot of hype the album had.
Lil Baby’s reputation with Fantano has come a long way
You cannot have a year-long rollout and then release an album with absolutely zero concept or consistent theme. As a drake fan this was a massive disservice to his fanbase and has greatly lowered my expectations for whenever he goes back to the drawing board.
CLB, more like CBT, am I right lads?
We are living in a world where KSI’s last 2 albums is better then Drakes last 4 albums hope all this Anthonys credibility goes out the window if it already has not CLB is atleast a 6 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Valid melon man
Even if this drake album was objectively mediocre, drake fans would make it seem to be the best thing since Michael Jackson
not a surprise that Damien Hirst is behind this god-awful cover. worst artist of our time.<br><br>it will be funny looking back at it when apple updates its emojis in the next few years
Melon: yeah this drake track is good and decent.<br><br>Also Melon: but in the grander scheme of things, its fucking ass, fuck this album.
Demo Tapes is better than CLB hands down
Fantano just sounds like kanye fan
damn, Melon beating Mr. Beast on trending is cool to see
Everything surrounding this album fits so perfectly with the mediocrity of the songs: the album cover, the title, the merch, the marketing behind it; it&#39;s all equally and painfully mediocre
Man. Anthony HAAAATES Drake. But he LOVES Kanye. Way to support guys who support Trump and homophobes.
<b>I really liked the album but I can&#39;t like it anymore because Fantano gave it a 3. THANK YOU FOR RUNNING THIS ALBUM</b>
WTF is that cover
I thought in terms of recording quality, CLB was better than Donda. But bar for bar I think Kanye really outshined Drake. Both albums were seemingly chock full of some corny ass lines though. I felt like I had to sift through both albums for parts I thoroughly enjoyed. Their out of touch middle-agedness is really showing in both albums. And thanks to CLB fuckboys everywhere will be self identifying as lesbians. <br>I would’ve given Donda a 5 and CLB a 4.5. Two incredibly sub-par and mediocre albums from two dying giants.
I loved the album
Your opinion means nothing troll 🤡
album sucked
God bless Fantano. One of the few real music critics we have left. No bias, no politics, just judging the music for what it is. I bet those same critics who spent 80% of their reviews bitching about da baby and Manson on Donda won’t say a thing about the Rkelly writing credit either.<br><br>Just goes to show the industry has become a joke and Melon is for the people 💯
We pay this guy for his opinion. He also gets paid by certain people but I won’t say anything. We all collecting checks but really, a 3?
JJs album really got a higher score than Drake’s
&quot;Damn I didn&#39;t even know drake dropped......I&#39;ve been off the grid lately&quot;
Wack
Drake literally picked the most pretentious overhyped artist of the modern age and his cheesy unimaginative work to display the theme of this album on his cover. Genius.
Drake bad, Kanye good mirite?
I rate it the same
Still gonna sell more than kanye cry about it. It&#39;s a solid drake album.
I&#39;m no Drake fan (I haven&#39;t enjoyed a Drake album since IYRTITL), but why do we remember this beef as &quot;pusha destroying drake skullemoji skullemoji&quot; when the center of Pusha&#39;s track just focused on him revealing Drake&#39;s child. Why is Pusha praised for.... revealing a bit of information? There&#39;s nothing witty, skillful, or rhetorically powerful about that. It&#39;s just condensed shock valued that we commemorate today through cringey instagram polls riddled with skull emojis. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m making no comment on Pusha or Drake as artists, I just think the (often mindlessly followed) narrative that Pusha destroyed Drake because he revealed previously unknown information to be silly, immature, and possibly disingenuous in premise. Surely we have to have a higher standard.
The Donda Album Cover is better than CLB’s cover
I dont see how you can disagree with this. Its such a poor album. Donda washed it.
Could’ve made a whole album based around his son and his growth as a person but Drake is still the same person he’s always been
2/10 for me
Imagine going back and time and telling our teenage selves who are ride or die with Drake listening to Take Care and then Nothing Was The Same that Drake would just rehash the same beats, topics, etc. in 8 years. We would&#39;ve been so excited lolol
Why did he skip yebbas heartbreak?
idk if it was intentional, but the all black record in melon’s case behind him looks very similar to Donda, with it being all black and everything. I can’t tell what it really is, maybe the Black album. Maybe it’s a metaphor saying “I would proudly own and display my copy of Donda, but this Certified Loser Boy sure is a stinker.”
3 is very generous melon
Champagne poetry’s sample is just ripped from Masego’s navajo
So much salt in these comments, and you don’t even know who I’m talking about 😂😂
🎫🎫🎫🎫🎫🎫 Tickets for being here before 700,000 views
The album suffers narratively for sure and the cover doesn’t help. But approaching hip hop with the same energy of a white boomer Harvard professor doesn’t really add up imo. <br><br>Saying songs are “boring” cause they aren’t a “banger” like “sicko mode” tells me everything I need to know about your approach to his music and music in general
Low key only like champagne poetry and 7 am on a bridle path
KSI higher than Drake?
Maybe now Kanye West fans will finally shut up about that 6 he gave MBDTF.
🤰🤰🏾🤰🏽🤰🏼🤰🏻🤰🏿 &lt;-- CLB refund queue
Saw the thumbnail and thought oh no
you just hate Kanye, you love drake so much just marry him ffs
Watch everyone go back and be like oh I slept on it 🤦🏾‍♂️
&quot;N 2 Deep&quot; uses a UGK sample...sounds nothin like an &quot;Astroworld&quot; track. Go listen to &quot;Get Throwed&quot; by UGK. That song was a nod to Houston. Just clarifying...
WLR &gt;&gt;&gt; CLB
Drake needs to make a record with his producer 40 again. His albums have been going downhill the more he&#39;s using other producers.
Red Flannel?! Buckle up, Folks! Gonna be a bumpy ride!!
The cover accurately represents the music in the album.
Am I the only one that actually likes Hot Shower? (hate the rest of the Chance album)
horrible album
That 3 was generous, I love Drake but we have to wait this long for a new project and it’s just minimum effort? I want something I can’t wait to play again after listening to the whole album from Drake and this was definitely not it.. still so disappointed
The fact that you HAD to say the word nuts in this critique just proves what your entire motive is all along. Despicable.
CLB &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; PEAK KANYE
Drake is so boring to me .
I liked it...well the first few songs then it kinda went meh
it’s because he’s a scorpio
Anthony, I can&#39;t believe you left the Donda vinyl in the back during this review! Unbelievable!
Drake needs to just be the Degrassi guy that we all know he is and quit trying to act all hard or whatever. Learn to be comfortable being yourself, Drake; it&#39;ll be okay. I swear, the mean people will leave you alone if you&#39;d just make a real effort to be honest with yourself and everyone else.
I&#39;m still trying to decipher all the pregnant emojis on the front, are those all the 17 year olds he chases?
A light 3?!?? I don’t agree at all. I’m feeling this as one of my top albums of the year. I love all 21 songs right now. It’s between this and Donda for AOTY for me. I recognize the lack of something new on this project but I don’t think that’s a bad thing. Drake just wants to stick to his formula and keeps doing so and I wish he would take some risks but all the tracks aren’t bad by any means. The sampling and production is amazing. The lyrics are ok. The features go crazy. Travis went insane. That’s the fastest I’ve ever heard him rap.
gross
Such a hater lol
Light 3🤣🤣🤣🤣
melon
Ksi had a higher rated album than drake . Wow
so i get thinking kanye’s childish for posting the address but it’s public knowledge who in toronto doesn’t know where drakes mansion is? also he posted it at like 2-3am and deleted it relatively recently after posting it so i would say it was petty for sure but not fucked up or anything.
Views is boring?! Lol I swear people just hate for the sake of hating
Okay, your comments on TSU are so overly critical it&#39;s ridiculous. You have no qualms whatsoever on tracks where rappers talk about shooting people in the brain and openly degrade women etc but the power dynamic in this song bothers you? Make it make sense.
I mean I liked champagne poetry
It was more of a certified lullaby than anything
Sorry but the album gave me generation z vibes I was awful sorry, I didn&#39;t catch a vibe at all
My opinion on this remains the same. Just another drake record to play in the background.
This isn’t new from Drake, people are just finally starting to notice
Donda gets a light 7 but this gets a light 3 ,  you are trash I hope you get banned
Melons eyebrows go up, <br>Melons eyebrows go down,<br>Melons eyebrows go up, <br>Melons eyebrows go down,
So KSI made a Better Album than Drake?
Is anyone surprised Drake is boring? Come on.
Fantano woke up and chose facts
The amount of Drake stand I&#39;ve had to fight off for giving my &quot;opinion&quot; about CLB.....bruh.
Man just roasted every song
Drake uninspired? I disagree, Melon. He seems to be quite inspired by Chance&#39;s repetitive statements about loving his wife. Now every Drake song has to include something about his son.
So Kanye won this round?
globglogabgalab sample&gt;the entirety of certified boy lover
I still struggle to imagine someone who actually chooses to listen to drake
Liked for fantano talking about his nuts
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=360">6:00</a> ahaha 😂this was hilarious
Poor Drake 😞
Way 2 sexy is by far the best on the album, because of how hilariously bad it is. It’s entertaining for only that reason
Certified Boy Lover
If you listen to Donda and CLB together, you&#39;ll be listening to a 10/10 album.
Ksi Got 5 and drake 3 damn
This whole album was &quot;meh&quot;.... Didnt move me at all. Sounded like all his old ish, nothing to see (hear) here.
When I Scorpio calls out another Scorpio for being OBSESSIVE 😂 I love you melon
Stay hating Fantano, this album is breaking records 🤷‍♂️
I feel like listening to CLB is like watching Naruto without a filler guide.<br>So here is my filler guide for certified boy lover, only listen to :<br>fair trade<br>TSU but without the one minute long intro and the second half<br>N 2 Deep but skip the first half<br>Fountains is like one dance but less catchy<br><br>That&#39;s it
&quot;I bought another guest house, we are growing&quot;<br><br>I&#39;m so lonely.
The car battery line floored me, bruh!!!! 🤣 😂
Not here to argue but I have 11 tracks that are in my rotation. Definitely can’t fathom the idea that’s there’s only 3 good tracks tho.
Certified boy lover
Drake sees the Donda album every time he goes to sleep
Someone should re-release the record without drake on it
Donda &gt; clb
Ksi got a better album than Drake.
He could’ve made a decent album, not great or even good, but decent album with about 11 songs tops. But he gave us 21 and most of them are dumb as shit. The industry and fans let this happen. I used to be a drake Stan until 2016…Views was meh. Used to listen to a drake album almost everyday before then. People are surprised I don’t like him anymore and it’s because he hasn’t grown as an artist at all and his music is uninspired to say the least. Every album after IYRTITL sounds like a bunch of throw aways.
😂😂 expected 3 😂😂😂
Do a album review for Grip plz
Drake&#39;s career is seriously heading towards DJ Khaled territory at this point. Painfully boring, unambitious music, collaborators outshine him, tone deaf. I feel like he peaked in 2015/16 and just never quite hit this level again.
Hoes mad!!!!
Melon gave this a 3 just because Drake is a lesbian, I thought better of you Anthony.
he hates drake so much lool hardly objective
CLB is ass
All black album in the background. I see what ya did there… 😉
Also, Fucking Fans sounds like a PARTYNEXTDOOR song not an Abel song.
This guy is surprisingly funny
Album was trash and Drake still hasn&#39;t dropped a serious classic, mans washed.
you can say drake put more effort on the clb persona than the clb the album 😂
Drake is washed he fell off
Day 1 of commenting until Nothany Waytano reviews Carriage House by Woodward and Parker
am i the only one here who likes Donda and this album equally?
This album was having a group project at school and everyone else carrying the work for drake
wow ksi&#39;s album is way better than drake&#39;s clb album what a twist
The clear winner here is the gobgalob guy
3 loooool
There is absolutely no way this album should gets less than KSI’s cmon man
Donda vs CLB confirmed 7-3 match up. Thank you Melon Lord
Drake&#39;s note on apple music should&#39;ve pushed this into a &quot;Not Good&quot;
little simz review soon plz
This feels a lot like Drakes Relapse, the moment in his career where he goes corny and drops a level on rapping and creativity. The sad part is at least Eminem has the flow that is still interesting until his 40s but I don&#39;t think Drake has the talent to go into his 40s.
Facts
Drake make music for good looking people so it makes sense why he doesn’t like drake
Nothing more fun than collectively shitting on a Drake album
Fantano saying you hate pregnant women for 17 minutes straight is not a review nor a reason to give this album a 3/10
Had my like for the 3
Anthony got the checkered shirt on, this one is about to be good.
This guy is so dumb why is he reviewing music, no good takes in the whole video
Thank you!!! Drake is corny afff
diary drake lmao so true...
I respect him for having an honest opinion, but he’s seriously fucking weirdly harsh on reviewing
Great swerve from wearing the red flannel but giving it a 10. Keeping us on seats edge, thanks melon
Ight a 3 is ode 😭
Wow fantano destroyed drake
Where tf is the new big red machine review ?
i would&#39;ve gave it a 5
drake needs to stop copying nav
Certified Corny Boy
Draaaake 🤔🤔🤔😬
Rap music involves telling a life story. Drake literally has no more real stories left. He needs to make up shit or rap about other people.
We trending ?
Certified Boy Lover is like a shitty emotional vent from that one guy in Twitch chat
Well he’s paying for views and spins and it works for him. So it’s a win I guess but I agree I didn’t really like the album
HAS ANYONE SEEN MY SON
Should have burned that hard drive
donda way better! that 3 definitely fits that album.
Should’ve been a NOT GOOD.
Fantano gave CLB a 3 and House of Balloons a 2
Had to stop when u called views boring
only highlight on the album for me was Race My Mind, the production is crazy
im with this review... but Fountains is a banger. one of his best dancehall songs easy (and yes mostly because of Tems, but still)
Damm fantano hit the trending boy
Just tossin&#39; it out there that Feb 19 happens to be Millie Brown&#39;s birthday (purely coincidence ofc)
The Best thing is Rick Ross, and then zzz.
tropical fuck storm deep states. come on. i know you can do it
LETS GO
The fact Drake delayed the album because of a torn leg makes literally no sense. You don&#39;t need to stand to rap
the best song on this album is yebbas heartbreak,not only because drake doesn’t ruin it but yebbas voice is so dreamy :)
Eminem&#39;s MTBMB side B &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; CLB
“I guess in 2021 I am not excited to hear Drake cosplay as gangster…”
The music industry is full of actor&#39;s and ghost written computer generated songs and holographic disguised subhuman avatars waiting for 2030 to reveal themselves
I was literally slapping myself awake trying to go through this album. By Sunday I had given up. I honestly tried but man it sucked.
Kendricks line about “ducking the pandemic, I been ducking the social gimmicks” hits so much fucking harder than before after hearing CLB
Truly grateful that anyone else sees Drake for the corny, egocentric and fake fraud he is. Much respect, Anthony
Can we have a iron maiden senjutsu review
clb was bad, but definitetly better than donda
Man said a LIGHT 3. 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 as if there’s such a thing as a STRONG 3 😭😭😭😭😭
You rated this too high
come on our fatneek got a higher score than drake
Xxx is better than drake
Does nobody care about bars and writing anymore?
The album cover is so distracting, it pisses me off
Not to mention the weird line referencing Millie Bobby browns 18th birthday 🤢
Double that 3 it’s a 6 now.
IT’S OFFICIAL, BLADEE’S THE FOOL IS BETTER THAN CLB
I love the hate this album is getting. Drake has managed to please both his fans and his haters on this one. I love the album and feel the cover is the perfect way to troll the pseudo artistic/intellectual crowd. Hopefully one day Drake will get a 0 from Fantano and a Grammy on the same project.
It was meh…. I agree with everything you said. I have had no urge to go back &amp; listen to the album… &amp; I love drake… my Alexa alarm plays drake at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=390">6:30</a> every morning… but this album??? Could have stayed on the shelf
Donda &gt; CLB
The dysfunctional inventory mechanically seal because meal baly claim underneath a adamant alphabet. longing, malicious english
All of KSI’s albums have a higher rating than CLB.         ksi&gt;drake
do rich people not know about therapy? it really helps
He gave it a 3 because thats Drakes age cut off
He really doesn’t like Drake it’s obvious 😂
Drake should grow up!!!
Appreciate the review
CLB (3) &lt; Jesus Is King (4)
HE GOT DONDA IN THE BACKGROUND
Just like we&#39;ve entered late stage capitalism, this is late stage drake. :(
i really don’t like this review. Reviewers try so hard to make issues with about people’s albums. if you’re gonna review an album review it off of what it is not what you want it to be. Like don’t judge the storyline of the song and be like “the storyline makes no sense” or “the storyline is off” stop caring so much  and just enjoy it.
im<br>2 sexy fah this syrup
lospollos crying in the corner
Can&#39;t wait for the lospollostv reaction.
Pregthany Nantano would have been better
Yes! Rip this boy a new one. What an absolute garbage album.
To pimp a butterfly 10 - CLB 3 = Donda 7
Album was bad
This Drake album was a Kanye West concept 😑
Man y&#39;all trippin CLB is a great album
Drake feeding his fans shit and they eat it without resitance
Wtf is this man talking about fountains is fucking fire. A real nice Summer song you can chill 2 and he gon say it’s shit. Ok dude
Drake knows he doesn&#39;t have to do anything to get $$$ I doubt this was a real attempt at a good album
One thing I never heard Drake do before this album is lie. Lying about not being phased and stuff...
I stopped watching after you called Views boring. Like.. what?<br><br>Edit: but yeah this album is not that good lmao
Drake likes to throw rocks and hide his hand. He antagonized Ye for 3 years and plays victim when challenged back. Aubrey sucks at acting like he’s unbothered .
Ok yeah, but if you turn the 3 upsidedown… wait

Imagine losing to a gospel album
I feel like you didn’t talk about the fat people on the cover. I am still confused by that.
Dunkey did it better than both of em and he hasn’t even dropped the album yet
Ok but when&#39;s The Gentlemen&#39;s &quot; The Evolution of Tears &quot; yellow flannel review
Really surprised that an old balding nerd hates Drake&#39;s music. Way 2 sexy is an anthem by the way. Going to be played in every club
Honestly, I think y’all all got it wrong. I think CLB is a good album. I thought the features delivered and I think Drake is just delivering typical Drake type bars/singing. Did he revolutionize music? No, but that doesn’t make the album poor. 7 1/2/10 for me.
Drake doesn&#39;t beat Ye. Drake is fake as f***. He&#39;s cultivated a persona that is old, boring, and on repeat for every album. Ye puts himself out there every time and at least tried to push things forward.
im Certified boy lover
In the Bible was hard
I have a Behind the Music-sized theory that this Drake-Kanye thing is just the old guard eating itself to make room for something fresh and exciting. Or maybe I&#39;m just really hoping for it. Hey, that Little Simz album is super dope...
Please review the new Paris Texas album, been out for a while I wanna hear your opinion
Agreed
Donda better
My mate was tryna convince me CLB is better than Donda haha
Donda is way better than CLB
If we combine Donda’s 7 with this three we have a perfect 10
You would&#39;ve given it a 2 if it had a Pop Smoke feature

Comments full of drake haters
dude is a certified HATER
Fantano def off the perc he gave Ksi a five and CLB a 3
I hate how once this album cover got released every single drake fanboy tried to justify the covers ugliness by pretending that the whole of 2021 had been a bad year for rap album covers. Like bitch please, drake dropped an absolute abomination of a cover and y’all really have the audacity to compare it to other covers.
garbage ass album
Are we witnessing the end of drakes long time momentum?
I hate white technical hip hop heads
I haven&#39;t listened to this album or anything Drake put out, but I like hearing Fantano shitting on him.
Ranting about how Drake got you pregnant isn&#39;t a review Anthony
Your a hater 😂
someone should make a video titled “fantano hating on drake for 40 minutes straight”
Thought that album title was Certified Boy Lover, lmao
Is that DONDA lurking in the background on your shelf?
is that supposed to be donda in the back?
Please read this carefully ;<br><br>Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .<br><br>The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .<br><br>Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake . <br>Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..<br><br>Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ; <br><br>Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) . <br><br>Do this, and you will be saved .<br><br>If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .<br><br>You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .<br><br>Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;<br><br>‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
The album is great, Way 2 sexy goes fucking hard, and the fact that the video is a spoof is fantastic, classic goofy drake, we love it here in toronto🔥
Brutal
Pusha T ended his career
I fkn love this album.
Too me it felt too bland, like a watered down version of his former hits
Way too segzy is a banger tho its so bad its good if that makes sense
You&#39;re a hater
Donda Chant &gt; CLB
Yoooo he got the donda vinyl at the top right
Idk, i feel like he gathered 21 random songs he made and put them together... I really like Drake but this one is off by miles
On my way to slander Certified Boy Lover, knowing damn well I didn’t listen to a single second of it🤵🏻‍♂️⛷
I wholeheartedly agree 5good songs.  nothing was the same take care🐒
Better than donda and it ain’t close
Pay attention, gents. This video best illustrates when beta males get a glimpse into alpha excellence. Fantano’s brain is short circuiting because he literally can’t comprehend the lifestyle.<br><br>You couldn’t even peep the allusion between Drake and the Beatles in that first track. The contradiction of Drake’s identities present in the album is the whole point — but you didn’t get it. How can anyone trust your reviews if you can’t understand something that simple? 🤔
I haven’t listened to CLB, but I’m guessing it sounds just like Drake’s last album.
this can&#39;t be a 3, it&#39;s a 6 at lest
You should have named this the needle drop hates on certified lover boy. This is not a review. You literally have nothing positive to say about Drake and that just shows you&#39;re a hater.
I&#39;m ok with the album.. but the best song on the album doesn&#39;t even feature him... the beautifully performed &quot;Yebba&#39;s Heartbreak&quot; ...
Fantano is just mad because he wishes he was a lesbian
Listen Fanta, take that orange clip down there has to be a better way to hang that
Damn, here I was thinking &quot;This is a completely Drake album, but I&#39;m ok with it, I&#39;m still vibing with it&quot; and then Melon comes out and shows me that I need to change my mind completely.
A 3/10 is actually generous. I was expecting a 1
Seemed like drake just chose to do him rather than try to go epic with it
melon didn’t like CLB because he isn’t too sexy for this syrup, the world OR your girl
The project is a vibe just not as good as I expected
Its all good but where are my imagie draggies
Anthony, you laughing at Drake coming out as a lesbian for 16 minutes is not a review.
Anthony already got the Donda vinyl in the background
I gave it a &quot;Not Good&quot;
Melon always waiting till late at night for the most awaited reviews
kinda weird how obsessed melon is with drake and kanyes beef and his focus on “the now” when he makes his reviews. Left me feeling this review was a bit uninspired with skippable minutes on the review. Gonna give it a 5/10.
LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!
Drake will be forgotten in 50 years and Kanye will be a legend
&quot;Not sure if you know but I&#39;m actually Michael Jackson&quot; - well he does also have the uncomfortable relations with kids :/
I disagree on the first track. It is the worst on the album. Cringe
DRAKE STANS ARE MAD LMAO
I loved CLB
Best diss track of the year, Antnee.
Drake is mid as fuck
&quot;I kinda wanna hook a car battery to my nuts to get some kind of mental stimulation,&quot; - Anthony Fantano, 2k21
Clb &gt; donda
Bro my timeline full of grown men I know saying this album amazing, talking about the djs at the club bein sick of them already for askin if he had that new drake. People outside of like music heads really genuinely think this album is great and hate an album like DONDA for example. It’s ignorant but I mean your average person nowadays only likes radio music and very played out shit. Like basically casuals all think this album is great and drake is the greatest rapper of all time. At least where I’m from most people from the age of like 20-28 think he’s the goat. I just don’t understand it. I mean don’t get me wrong I love drake personally. But I really only like his old projects. I thought views wasn’t very good and every album after that has been worse. Granted I haven’t finished CLB yet. But I’ve gotten like 10 tracks in while driving and don’t think it’s as horrible as most of y’all do. But still it literally just sounds like the same old drake. Doesn’t touch Donda. Kanye is my goat but I’ve always liked drake in the past so the whole beef doesn’t really make me biased or want to dislike CLB. Side note I actually enjoy way 2 sexy. Idk It came on in the car when I was driving back home with my girlfriend and we were kinda smiling and laughing a little about the silliness of it and dancing to it but really only for the future chorus. I am biased bc I love future lol
Lol the way people turn into Yelp reviewers  about their opinion after Anthony drops a review LOL
Bro tell us how you think it sounds you focused too hard on other shit
If only Kanye and Drake could just unite…their Needle Drop scores…<br><br>T H E Y ‘ D   M A K E   A   1 0
Fantano confirmed KSI is now better than Drake 🤣🤣
RIP
Donda&gt;CLB every day
Such a disappointing album considering the features he&#39;s been putting out
The same guy that gave , kids see ghosts a 10... Foh
Drake is a grown as man sneak dissing because he is in his feelings. Ego/pride is a hell of a drug!
Certified snoozer... Now I understand Akademiks sleeping on the album. MY TOP 5 IS DRAKE DRAKE DRAKE DRAKE DRAKE 😴
Yebba’s Heartbreak was also on my top 3. Which is funny cus Drake isn’t even on it. Would’ve liked to hear your opinion on it.
The placeholder album cover was so much better...but atleast this one is fitting to the songs...ASS
This album is exactly what Kendrick was talking about from TPAB. A “talent show” where some artists just turn out garbage music, cut the checks and bounce.
i really don’t understand the cover… is he suggesting that he gets lots of women pregnant cus if that’s what it means it’s just weird
Yebba had the best song on the album. Rick Ross and Lil Wayne had the best features. Travis Scott had an awful feature
weird how you liked daddy&#39;s home and disliked papi&#39;s home.... sounds xenophobic to me
W Review ALL FACTS!!!!
DONDA BETTA
somehow has a worse cover than donda lol
Honestly if I was Drake I’d be embarrassed to drop an album like this
might be the worst cover art an album has ever had in music history smh
What an absolute shit review. Drake dropped a classic, realize that
Fantano literally said the album was so boring that he wanted to hook a car battery up to his nuts to get a little stimulation 💀
shiet
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=777">12:57</a> Sums up the Donda vs Clb perfectly
Certified F Boi  is for gay prisoners, epic he says i am a lesbian , he got the wap ..Drake tried to be trendy and failed for clout
I don&#39;t get why people still hate Anthony fantano review like lmaoo just ignore him if u dont agree with his views
They say dont judge an album by its cover, but this one makes that really, reallllyy hard...
Absolute terrible take
The only decent songs were No Friends in the Industry and 7am on Bridle Path
Artistically, Drake has real gall to even mention Kanye😒
Me as a kanye fan when I see the red flannel: <b>insert joker meme</b>
Certified Lover Boy more like Certified Boy Lover
He went from &quot;Nothing Was The Same&quot; to Everything is the same.
Make a video where you weigh in on the Kanye and Drake beef in depth
If Donda was a 7 and CLB was a 3, the 2021 version of Wolves gotta be a 10
As a huge Drake fan...this was a disappointment 😔
i need you to review the new Jinjer album
certified boy lover
This album has been growing on me.
I never agreed as much with anyone ever on any topic like i do with Melon right now and I don‘t just say it as a Kanye superfan, but also as a Drake fan who‘s been disappointed since Views and has absolutely given up on Drake
The car battery line is straight up manslaughter melon 💀
Not sure why you keep reviewing Drake albums
Ima be honest out of everything Drake has dropped since Views, this is probably my favorite. And that’s saying alot considering this album is just okay at best imo.
Sir Anthony. You sounded like a hater straight out of the gate with this review :D Thank you
Anthony refuses to see things from drakes point of view . He’s trying to sell records and make hits . Don’t think he’s ever really talking about himself in most of his songs anymore. Girls want girls is for .... girls . You criticizi it like that was very odd. Obviously he’s just going for a hit there
“I’m not excited to see Drake cosplay as a gangster” perfectly encapsulates my issues with Drake. It all feels like cosplay coming from him. He has some bangers for sure but there’s just a lack of authenticity there.
Knew this album was overrated
Never agreed with you more Melon king
Imagine looking at that album cover and going &quot;Yeah, that works&quot;
While I don’t agree with all your reviews, this is spot on &amp; I don’t understand how some people are actually pleased by this when he has a masterpiece like Take Care on his resume…
Obviously Anthony doesn’t like drake music so why keep reviewing it know your not a fan it makes no sense to me. He literally says the same things every drake album just in different ways
This album is acc good. Ppl r trippin fr
The fact that people even like Drake at this point boggles my mind. Sure, he had potential in his early career and had some unique qualities. But he has failed to live up to whatever potential he had over the last decade and he’s just no longer unique or interesting anymore.
The only review of yours I can agree with
why do u allways look mad. lmao
Thank you, Melon. For making my opinion. 🙏🏽
99% music critics are leeches
Where have I heard Nothany Waytano before?
This album made me sad,i really thought it&#39;s gonna be more thematic and movie like with a unique atmosphere like we had in Views
yes melon thank you
Yebba was the only good thing that happened on that album
I&#39;m starting to doubt if Dr.Ake is in fact a real doctor.
The only problem with clb and drake in general is that he makes formulated music and doesn&#39;t give us any new  new content wise. I like his songs from his past albums like More life and shit. Kanye doesn&#39;t have this problem his music is constantly influenced by things happening to him in real life. Sometimes it doesn&#39;t work out  like yeezus (my opinion). But other times it is great like in mbdtf and tlop. Id say ultimately Kanye is a way better artist. No doubt about it I didn&#39;t understand people comparing drake and Kanye albums together. Bcz Kanye will always be the better artist.
even The New CALassic had the same scor- <br><br>I MEANT IT WAS A STRAGN 10EN!
Wow, a 3.
way 2 sexy is so bad that i like it in kind of an ironic way
Light to decent 0
After listening to it for half a hour I turned it off. It&#39;s pretty garbage tbh
incoming angry drake fans
Drake more like Fake ahaahahahahhahahahahahahhahahagagagahgaga
i agree with everything you say it&#39;s pretty scary
I dont understand drake&#39;s appeal,at all. His voice is annoying,his flow is not special and his beats are super uninteresting,I like maybe like 3 drake songs and thats it

People are such dick riders. Dislike because they have a different opinion
I can&#39;t think of another artist in my lifetime who has been able to sustain a career as long as Drake has without adding ANYTHING WHATSOEVER to their creative arsenal. CLB sounds like it could&#39;ve dropped anytime in the last decade. <br><br>How the fuck are die-hard Drake fans able to eat the exact same thing everyday for 12 years? Y&#39;all got any respect for yourselves?
I HAD TO COME JUST FOR THE SCORE LMAOOOO we enjoying it over here, more records broken, ye has to be punching the air right now. y’all argue with yourselves now. 🤣🤣
A KSI album outdone a Drake album
I liked it but I can see why people don&#39;t. It&#39;s same old Drake which is fine for me, but yeah he should take some more risks
I think saying “Drake should’ve hid this album from the world like he was hiding his child” is a bit far Anthony
“I kinda just want to hook a car battery up to my nut just to get some mental stimulation” - Anthony Fantano
first review i actually agree with.
drake finna diss tony on his next album😂
Saw that red flannel coming from a mile away
But people have been saying the same thing about Drake for years. He&#39;s been rapping about the same boring petty subjects for well over a decade (problems with girls, friendship drama and the regular rap braggadocio) for some of his younger fans almost half their life. No new take. No new angle. Hey drake how has your life changed since becoming a father? Do you see yourself or the world differently? &quot;Im having problems with a girl. My friends are so fake. I&#39;m a lesbian&quot;<br>His fans are growing up. Unfortunately for drake, both he and his music haven&#39;t.
I think sometimes or a lot of the times the understanding of the fan base and where the artist is really taking with the song and the project clouds your judgement. For example, when you were talking about Papi’s Home, you missed the moment with Nicki and thought it was just nonsense but fans know and that’s why they did it.
good review
Hey Anthony, do you think you could review the older Muse records aka Origin of Symmetry and Absolution? I’m curious to hear your thoughts on the older Muse vs. new Muse.
Too Sexy is just funny, I don&#39;t think you&#39;re supposed to take it seriously
Going from Donda to this was like going from the White Stripes to Imagine Dragons
More like “Certified Boy Lover”
For God’s sakess  CLB vs Donda is just laughable. There’s nothing to compare. Kanye is an artist’s artist, who once again gave us something really bold, brave and interesting, with a lot of beautiful moments. Whereas Drake on the other hand comes off as a douche who produced a project that is extremely superficial , shallow and predictable.
Same score as Cal Chuchesta&#39;s mixtape. I wonder what Cal thinks of Drake&#39;s Certified Lover Boy. Been watching best of Cal Chuchesta videos on Youtube lately.
Y’all trippin I loved this album a lot of bangers
Kanye&#39;s constant experimentation and evolution with his music really exposes how &quot;safe&quot; Drake can be from one album to the next.
I feel like Kanye always takes mad risks and makes bold choices on his albums, where Drake always plays it safe. I always appreciate it when artists show confidence and boldness.
Anthony, you can&#39;t add 3 points because Drake leaked a really good Kanye track.
Donda vinyl on the shelf.
Jimmy got shot!
Calling urself a certified lesbian was a bit much Anthony but whatever makes you happy 🤰
I thought melon would give all Drake 10/10 just to be a contraian
Drake got rid of the wrong people in his think tank
Yup I gave CLB a 4/10, and that’s generous IMO. Fantano hit the nail on the head. CLB was trash and uninspired
Certified Bellend
Album&#39;s boring as hell.
The ego boost the goofy Kanye fans are gonna get from this. I hate music fans so much lol
donda on the wall to the right? you smooth fantano
Fantanto did what he had to do. 🤲🏼
Why does this absolute weiner keep showing up no matter how many times I hide and select don’t recommend this channel? If I wanted to watch a sentient soy plant making vaguely musical noises I’d rewatch watch day of the triffids.
The only part of this entire album I liked was the song with the Rick Ross and Lil Wayne features
Please review Smino&#39;s album blkswn, it&#39;s amazing
I mean as meh as the album is let&#39;s be honest there&#39;s no way this is 3 in a general context. Certainly 3 or 4 for a drake album tho
DRAG HIM
This is a really good review. I think you did well to highlight why I kinda like the album in spite of Drake not because of Drake. I would also note that throwing it on the background, it doesn&#39;t seem to bad, but that if I really sat with it I would probably find a lot of the same issues you took. I generally don&#39;t like Drake and hated Scorpion, so the bar was very low for me to find anything about it worthwhile.
only ugly bald people can’t get down with Way 2 Sexy
I thought this was album was going to be more like a love album lol
Damn this lowkey more pessimistic than I expected, I honestly just think due to your reference point you cant understand/feel a lot of the album
man I like fountains, I think tems did an amazing job
I honestly feel like Pipe Down &amp; YOLT are the only ones I’ll be returning to months from now
Knife Talk is favorite song on the album…
Gotta say I haven’t heard anything after the first listen except one song. Yikes.
This album had so much potential all love songs with great beats and great features but instead its almost all the same beats with 0 creativity to make bangers. Its as if Drake knows people like him so he dropped an album with 0 effort to see if people would buy into it which clearly worked to a degree.
Shoulda been a NOT GOOD<br><br>Btw: Nav better
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=365">6:05</a> 😂
Don&#39;t care. Review Little Simz and I at least want a 9.
Review I died for this?
drake be like no friends but will hop on a track with any upcoming artist and give them a stimulus feature (which is actually pretty dope of him)
You a hater
Album is pure trash
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Waiting on Side B before reviewing HWH8?

The only opinion I disagree with is the one about Views
Whats so funny is that there&#39;s people who think this is better than Donda

LOL KSI’s debut album got rated higher than Drakes sixth album damn
Thank you! The album has 0 inspiration, Drake just went into the studio to record another Drake album. The album has 0 concept
It’s savage that Anthony has donda in the background as a album he likes
Of course Kanye sidestepped the entire situation on Donda. The intention behind the album was a tribute to his mother, whose content should not be consecrated to a petty feud. It&#39;s difficult to compare Donda and CLB in this regard because their intentions are so vastly different. Clearly Drake is trying to be scathing and have fun and revel in the hate. This comparison that you&#39;ve made seems a bit myopic imo
day 3 of melon please review pantychrist by dana dentata
He&#39;s not friends with kanye....
You’re just saying that because he’s lesbian
DONDA &gt; CLB
Thank you for not being a Drake Stan, so many of those are praising this shit album
Kanye: I&#39;m going to make a cinematic, gospel infused album which serves as a deep dive into my faith and emotions at this time with a robust feature list.<br><br>Drake: So, if I like girls does that make me a lesbian? Also I hate Kanye and have no friends.
way 2 sexy is so funny, and so bad, that i actually love it with all my heart
LMAO
You should review some music next
So donda clearly won
This album got a 3 because you need to add this number on donda&#39;s 7 to make a 10
I agree
Are you on a green screen
I’M TO SEXY FOR THIS SRYUP!<br><br>WAY TOO SEXY FOR A 3!
I loved the album just wish Anthony enjoyed it too but it makes me sad to hear he had a bad time at the drake experience
This almost makes up for you calling MBDTF a 6 twice
Dude can&#39;t even just review the actual music cause he hates drake so much
It&#39;s no wonder Drake needed so many features and part of the marketing for this album were the features.
the moment this album was weaker than ksi&#39;s 😭
Agree with the majority of what you said. However, I think N 2 Deep is one of the best songs - love the beat change and Drake on the hook on the second part.
« Certified snoozer » LMAO
YOOO RED FLANNEL LMAO THAT MEANS HE DOESN&#39;T LIKE IT😂😂😂😂😂😂
Waiting for LosPollosTv reaction
This beef is so fucking fake. First meek mill to sell views than pusha for scorpion and now kanye for CLB its pathetic
Never forget: Pusha T dissed Drake to being a good father.
Thank you.<br><br>I&#39;ve tended to like Drake&#39;s stuff a bit more of than you.<br><br>But literally everything you said was what I was thinking as I was listening to this.<br><br>I kept waiting for SOMETHING but it was all so bland.<br><br>He gets bodied by every feature.<br><br>The beats are eh on the best of the tracks.<br><br>Getting through the album was a slog. Nothing that will make the playlist.<br><br>0.<br><br>Absolutely terrible.
It&#39;s sooo boring and I&#39;m mad about it 😠
LMAO
Idk how you gave it a 3, there&#39;s way less than 3 good songs on this album
&quot;I kinda wanna hook a car battery up to my nuts&quot;<br>- Anthony Fantano
After scorpion and now this I&#39;m pretty convinced that drake might as well just stick with releasing catchy singles rather than a whole album. Like clb  and scorpion have so many tracks I give 0 shits about.
Hey, that&#39;s the name of the show!
This album is mid because Drake wrote it himself
The opposite of &quot;judging in a vacuum&quot;
At least The Six is divisible by three.
i agree
Thank you
Logic from wish 🤣
First video of yours I’ve ever liked. 👍
&quot;I just kinda wanna hook a car battery up to my nuts&quot;
Way 2 Sexy in the worst tracks, but not Girls Like Girls???
This album cover is so bad, DONDA had a better one and THERE WAS LITERALLY NOTHING ON IT
My take-away is that a melon has nuts, not seeds
imagin drake get lower rate than KSI album! wow
Officially Donda &gt; CLB
Damn, didn&#39;t even feel like he tried to be objective 😂
FINALLY FINALLY FINALLY LETS FISHHSHWHSHD GOOOOO THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW TIMES ILL FULLY AGREE WITH YOU
I think the biggest problem on this album is drakes lack of self awareness. He just says things and hopes that the people listening dont actually think about it. It’s makes for empty, and down right meaningless lyrics. He goes through the same handful of topics but doesn’t even do a deep dive into them. It’s just so bizarre that someone with such a large team continues to make the same elementary mistakes on each album.
As the biggest drake fan. I have to say this is drakes worst album there’s nothing exciting to it
I DISAGREE SO HARD THIS ALBUM WAS A LIGHT 4 😤
Melon it&#39;s okay if you didn&#39;t like it but you didn&#39;t have to call drake the n word with a hard r
We gonna get a TFS Deep States review or nah?
Do screen violence by CHVRCHES
I actually think that way 2 sexy is by far and away the best song because of its comedic value and video
W
PAPERTIGER LOOL
Now this is a beautiful morning
you know anthony feelin extra savage whenhe puts the biggest banger into the Worst tracks
My god what a scathing review, I loved it 😂😂😂<br>Drake needs a kick up the ass and to get inspired like he used to be
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=365">6:05</a> the imagery Melon is giving us damn
This album is rightfully graded… the album is boring
Drake makes music for people who mean mug everyone at the bar and then hide behind the bouncer if a fight breaks out. He writes &quot;No Friends in the Industry&quot; on an album crammed with industry features, talks about how he takes on all comers after shrinking away from Push. It&#39;s just sad.
Drake seems very uninspired musically. Completely phoning it in since he knows it will do numbers. It’s sad. <br><br>He really needs to drop 40 and the same 6 people he ALWAYS collaborates with and work with some new people. Maybe they will pull something great out of him.
This the 1st time I&#39;ve agreed with you bro... Not bad, I&#39;ll give you a like, still fuck you for mbdtf and hob tho
Review “The Evolution of Tears” by The Gentle men.
Man, makes me sick people are all talking about this online when Nas just handed us a masterpiece on a silver platter not even one calender month ago 😭
Certified Trash Boy
Light 3 for a light 3 billion brain cells lost from drakes corny lines
I hate to be a gatekeeper but I REPEAT: the only people I know who LIKE certified lover boy have a very caged, unrefined palate in music. The people I know who LIKED CLB (especially over donda) hate any music that isn’t Drill or Trap.
This is a fat W
Wait so people really base their opinion on music based on what he says ?
It doesn’t sit right with me that this is rated higher than Cherry bomb
I LOVE YOU FANTANOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO YOU RE MY HEROOOOOOOOO
kanye should do a cover of this review
Every song sounds like March 14th....
Wtf do y’all want drake to do? Just stop making music? Lol
Kanye turned Drake into Taylor Swift
Accurate
This is my Certified Fav Fantano review
You can tell fantano really hated this album when he didn&#39;t call Drake &#39;Champagne Papi&#39; in the beginning
Wow middle age rappers beefing how cool
Donda album cover looks a lot better
Dog that car battery holy thats a bar better than anything on clb.
For all I care Drake could sing episodes from the Muppet Show or recipes for Indonesian curries on each of this songs. I&#39;m listening to his albums because of 40&#39;s beats and Drake&#39;s mellow voice.
The car battery line was a bar lmao<br><br>I don&#39;t even dislike this album that much. It&#39;s a nice mind-numbing vibey 90 mins. But that line killed me
Drake became background (annoying) music so fast. It&#39;s sad that this awful album is released months before the 10th anniversary of &quot;Take Care&quot;
idc about numbers fantano settled the kanye yeezy dispute once and for all thank you holy melon<br><br>edit: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=358">5:58</a> is brutal
Fantano telling drake he feels a way is weird. Sometimes I feel like people take way too much out of lyrics.
Drake might as well call himself Playlist Papi at this point. Incapable of making a cohesive project. Literally just a bunch of songs
Like other people have said: dude just seems uninspired. The story of every contemporary Drake album is some loosely threaded issue he punctuates on every song passive aggressively. Last album it was dedicated to Push and how butthurt he was about the beef. This album it&#39;s about Ye and how Drake has no friends.<br><br>So much of this album was carried by its production and features (thank you Tems, you managed to actually make me like Dancehall Drake), because Drake being the same exact Drake on every song managed to stick out notably to such a degree that you could just ignore him when he isn&#39;t saying something corny and weird about being a lesbian and enjoy the instrumentation that was utterly wasted on him. And honestly the album baits you so hard. Papi&#39;s Home and Champagne Poetry are such legitimately good tone setters, but you wind up walking away with the usual mixed handbag of trail mix that are current day Drake records that you have to pick all the stuff out that you don&#39;t want and keep the rest and it&#39;s usually a lot of stuff. <br><br>Dude needs to just semi-retire, live his life, hopefully grow in unexpected ways as a single father and figure out better material to talk about that doesn&#39;t amount to complaining about the women you throw your money and celebrity at deserting you for some innocuous reason or another. You&#39;re 34 years old Aubrey, 6 years away from 40. Stop rapping about shit you were dealing with when you were 19 and 26. You&#39;re Drake, you can do that, just get over whatever latent fear you probably have about keeping relevancy and disappear for awhile and come back with something meaningful.
Anthony really salty about Drake not telling him about his kid
Clb and Donda are equal
The real winners from both projects... The features. They get to keep away from the beef and get nice checks from 2 of the biggest artists/performers this gen
He gave the same score to Ohms. Bro.
This album is trash... Point (       ) Period. The 3 tracks we got a few months ago, lead me to believe he would be rappin-rappin. The features he&#39;s been doing as well lead us to believe that we&#39;d finally get that rapping follow up to Take Care we believe that he could deliver. But this album was boring and forgettable.
Review the new little simz
I think it’s funny that melon put a black sheet over an album cover in the back to point to donda
Drake is a wanna be sigma male
i still cant believe way 2 sexy is a legit song
Does this mean if you add CLB and DONDA you get a 10 album, I see you melon
W
what do you think is gonna sell more: An experimental gospel rap album or a pop rap album
wow in the end of the day Kanye some how broke Drake
Donda’s 7 + CLB’s 3= a perfect 10
Fantano could&#39;ve made a better album in 24 hours. Tell him! 😂
LESBOPHOBIC LESTANO HERE
drake puts on a facade that he think ppl want to believe is real<br>kanye is shows real emotion and a human being feels<br>light 3 is generous lol
Oof, I didn&#39;t think it was the best he&#39;s dropped but I enjoyed it. It&#39;s fun background music...
I’m crying 🤣 this guy is so Shameless 😭 Allow this Fantano 😂
This album and really shows how the Pusha T beef really affected him
Im on the other side of this. The consistent mediocrity is what makes Drake albums enjoyable, and I like the rnb, dancehall, and rip off soul so theres always some selection of stuff for me to like. Dude’s never gonna make a 10 but consistency goes a long way. (We are ignoring Care Package)
your content honestly trash now..... all you do is mass produce reviews now.. not the same (nothing to do wit drake ion gaf)
Certified Hater Boy
Drake killed it on Yebbas Heartbreak
Way 2 Sexy is terrible, but I knew Drake would make it a video🤣
CLB was hot garbage. Nice review Melon
Anthony, a passionate one-man cover of “Way 2 Sexy” wasn’t what I expected when I clicked on this video, but I can’t say I’m disappointed.
Once again, weezer &gt;
Boy, you are so on point with this review. First 1 I&#39;ve seen too, most choose to remove some truth. They lose criticism, makes it less convincing, feels uncouth, I&#39;m confused. Proves Drake can make trash and top charts, and Ye can play godly and claim that it&#39;s art.<br><br>And the life of the party, I&#39;m sorry, was Andre&#39;s part.
Lol he called drakes paper tiger. <br>Why direct drake&#39;s lyrics? He doesn&#39;t even kno what the writers really meant
3 is waay too low I&#39;d still give it a light 5
Way2sexy is literally song of the year fuck off
Melon spittin facts on this one
That young thug line 😭😭😭 “Sneaking out the back like he didn’t want you to know he was there “
drake fans don&#39;t listen to complete albums,  corse they are bad
Ksi&gt; Drake
Jesus Chris , is this a review or a hate speech .smh
I respect Fantanos review but I would not keep Donda on repeat. It&#39;s like watching a 3 hour slow burn movie. Yeah, the movie is good but not good enough to run it back.
Drake is just a great actor
It must suck to be a drake hater 😂 cause no matter what you say he still sells out
best drake album since if you reading this its too late<br>but also shameful for a 34 yo artist
Waiting for little simz album
Drake at this point is just a joke
Anthony said drake thinks hes kramer but he’s really george constanza
😂😂😂😂😂😂<br>Never Change!!!
3😭😭😭
Hi Fantano, please review Abstract Mindstate it&#39;s a Kanye produced record released July 2021 during the Donda rollout.
This is the GOATed review
🧢😂🤦🏽‍♀️ What did you listen to because it couldn’t have been Certified Lover Boy? If you don’t like Drake just say that bro 😂
anthony you can’t just add 3 points because drake is less black than kanye
as soon as I closed out the last track of the album, i could faintly overhear melon ironing his red flannel.
Track 1 the first half and Track 18 are nice the rest puts you to sleep had to try five times to get trough this album :)
I’m just glad Drake finally moved on from appropriating that reggaeton sound
uninspired is definitely how I would describe this album. without the kanye beef, this album would be infinitely less interesting and way more forgettable. Kanye did Drake a favor honestly by giving him something to rap about
so KSI had a better album than the biggest artist of this generation LUL
When is drake going to fall off fr? His stans are the ones keeping him alive. If anybody else dropped this bullshit it wouldn’t get a pass
The album equivalent of the McDonald&#39;s celebrity meals.
&quot;you know the tone of voice drake gets when there&#39;s a LOCATION and a TIME&quot; I haven&#39;t heard the track and knew exactly how drake sounds in this track. amazing review.
This album is at least a 5-6.
‘Papis Home’ is the best track on the album, next to the one with wayne&amp;Rosé
I would say Drake is the Marvel of rap... But there&#39;s Marvel movies I enjoy.
Donda &gt; CLB confirmed
That lil’ crease in the corner of the green screen has bugged me for nine years.
i smiled the second i saw that red flannel
This man really said Fountain was boring 😂
should have gave it a not good so he could retire forever
Should&#39;ve burned the notepad. 1/10
It&#39;s kind of hilarious how drake drops the same album every release and gets <i>lower</i> ratings each time lmao talk about diminishing returns
Hahahaha thank god donda got 7 and this got a 3🤣🤣😅🤣
Drake to me feels like a lost artist. He feels like Nelly 2021. He had the dream as a co writer for is first album. He had the weekend as a writer for take care and he had QM and party next door for IYRTITL. Now he has PND and it sounds dated and like left over tracks. He needs a new writing team.
Wack ass review from Clowntano
U way too on point Idk this is a drake talking album I can’t relisten to it enjoy 😉 l lie though views from the 6 is legendary also Scorpio
Say what you will about Kanye, at least he takes a chance with sounds. This album felt like bad album cuts of Drake on every album past Take Care.
He dont care
clb is fire.
RE VI EW LITTLE SIMZ SOMETIMES I MIGHT BE INTROVERT
Couldn’t agree less
BOLD move putting Donda behind your shoulder and on your shirt, knowing they beefing.
Thank you
Lol 9 mins in and this guy has nothing positive to say.
His last album was better I like tootsie roll
Kanye got a 7🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥<br>Drake got a 3🔥🔥🔥<br>NUFF SAID
LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOO 3/10 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
It’s official, I can finally justify that donda&gt;certified liver boy
Exactly.
Lil mosey is white
Good review.
Donda is a 7 and clb is 3 which mean he meant for it to be a 10
thanks to melon for squashing the drake and kanye beef
Girls hate each other in Toronto lmao
bro analyzed drake whole life &amp; the album lmaooo
All these check marks clout commenting
I fell asleep all I got from the album is that drake got multiple kids and he a lesbian
Please react to grips new album &quot;I died for this!?&quot;
7 3 10 the beef is 0
Race My Mind is so good, it sounded like it should be on So Far Gone😭😭
thank you now I can finally have an opinion on this album
He gave 3 because Drake &#39;s first letter is D. (its also the first letter of Donda)
I commented this somewhere else, but having really only actually listened to Hotline Bling and like that Kiki song (not by choice, to be fair), most of the other songs I’ve heard from Drake sound like the same song. I don’t really know what it is, but something about Drake’s voice, cadence, or beats just makes it fade into the background and I think “I’ve heard this” even if I probably haven’t. That’s just me, and I don’t hate Drake as an artist, I don’t know that much of his catalogue for that. The thing that made me not care for Drake as a person was the Adidon stuff with Pusha T, mostly Drake just quietly running from of it, and rather than just trying to pretend it didn’t happen, keep dropping tracks and bars pretending he’s untouchable and saying that he isn’t phased by disses. That’s just me personally though. Artistically, he just seems like he’s repeating the same formula, and who knows where he’ll be in ten years if he’s still going the way he is.
“Check the weather and its getting real oppy outside”
drake is the most over rated artist in the industry
Donda&gt;CLB
Beef bars 😋 yummy… I must be hungry
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=780">13:00</a> was a perfect comparison
Please review SG8* by Duckwrth. He deserves more attention!
LIGHT 3 OMGGGGG, Fantano is mad!! I&#39;m not saying this album is a 8 or 9, but 3??!? At least decent 5 no?
Honestly… this review hits
You don’t have captions :(
I feel like Drake needs shit to talk about like  think about it ppl don&#39;t like when he talks like he&#39;s a gangster. Him saying he has so no friends is repetitive. And him talking bout his son makes him look like he&#39;s affected . Kanyes inspiration rn is literally his religion take that away and what really is &quot;Donda&quot;. If I was drake I&#39;d struggle aswell to think of shit
&#39;&#39;I know Drake&#39;s earlier work inspired Abel&#39;&#39; HELL NAHH. It is the other way around. <br><br>The Weeknd made half of &#39;&#39;Take Care&#39;&#39;, Drake screwed him over, and that is how the original beef started between the two. <br><br>Know your facts Fantano. Abel did get inspired bij Michael Jackson and Prince however.
Anthony isn&#39;t a 3 too young even for Drake?
i like how the donda record&#39;s just hanging out at the back, nice one melon
lol at the young thug comment
So does that make Drake the first artist to get 10/10 from Melon?
Drake got bullied into being a good father but it seems all the bullying in the world wont make him into a good artist again
Bruh I kinda liked the album but after watching all the true words Fantano said he&#39;s made me realise this album is kinda weak.
I hate to say it but Drake made no progress And  a quarter they way through the album I was bored
The marines line from 7am needs to be acknowledged more
1.7k dislikes are from dudes that have a heart cut into their hair.
Hm this guy is good at reviewing music, he should make a YouTube channel
i completely agree w this except for tsu that song is a 8/10
certified lesbian boy
Drake knows no matter how lazy and repetitive his songs get he will make money off it.
Damn this is spot on
how do y’all watch this man 😐
You’re so incredibly biased Needle it’s insane
a Deep States by Tropical Fuck Storm review would be awesome.
You liked Donda, but this you dislike?<br><br>Clown.
better than donda
🤣🤣🤣
3 out of 10 agreed
Drake is dead
Drakes album boring af. Couldn&#39;t bring myself to even finish his album.
This album cover should give an additional -1 point
TALK THAT TALK FANTANO!
When he said the &quot;first objective banger&quot; about You only live twice, I felt that in my soul. I thought I was crazy thinking nothing on this album hit at all.
What the fuck, that&#39;s the tackiest cover I&#39;ve ever seen and I actually OWN Chocolate and Cheese. I had to take that shit up to a counter and purchase it in front of another human being in pre-internet times. And I still wouldn&#39;t even stream something with a cover that tacky. Gross.
This album art made the album sound 10x worse
tell me how dark lane demo tapes is better than CLB. for all the HYPE,  this album under delivered massively. and i’m a huge drake fan.
Fantano, you can’t just list all of the things you’re too sexy for and then give the album a 1.
Drake says no industry friends feels like a call to Kanye&#39;s old track Real Friends which questions how many of us have real friends. I think both artists have gotten a lot of help from friends but I feel like Drake has been made by his friends where Kanye has a vision that&#39;s always progressing in a new direction while being personal. Kanye feels like a person I know, his flaws and gifts are very apparenty. Drake seems more like a logo or commercial for the MyPillow guy on TV. I recognize that pillow guy but who tf is he? Like who is he really? And at the same time I ask that question I am disgusted and don&#39;t really want to know. <br><br><br>They say never meet your idols but I still would like to meet Kanye.
you could have used certified lovethony boytano as your intro anthony
Yebbas Heartbreak best song on the album, Ironic right?
Literally came here to watch fantano rip drake a new one, high key dislike him lol
I don’t think he likes drake
I been saying this since I heard it. The people who are gassing this album are hardcore drake fans and can’t be objective. This was probably his worst album thus far. It sounds the same as every other project. Nothing special or unique. Only track that was a standout to m was the one with Travis Scott.
How much did Ye pay you?
Drake is regrouping right now
No Champagne Papi reference in the beggining, what is going on with you Anthony?
This one I can agree with
As a self proclaimed Drizzy super fan, this album was so bad it fucked my day up. Mans is really getting too lazy. The features he did before this (Betrayal, Seeing Green) tricked me into thinking he would be spitting something interesting. But at this point I’m just disappointed.
lol aye bro stop covering rap music
As someone who is just now dabbling in modern rap I’d have to say I really liked this album, you give off an Antoine Ego vibe in this video just insulting the songs. “Cliche for drake” maybe he’s just consistently hitting the bullseye. You can’t put beef aside to understand weather or not the songs themselves are actually good and or fun to listen to? Maybe this “beef” is just what’s happening in the mans life right now and he thinks songs are deserved. Your job as a critic is not to think on the beef or what Kanye is doing and give credit where credit is due. These songs hit and the lyrics did too regardless of what they meant.
Lack off memorable songs? All I do is say drake bars
As a big drake fan myself, I have to admit that CLB was very underwhelming. Was expecting a more thematic play on the Lover Boy persona but the album seemed more like a mixtape with no real central theme.<br><br>After multiple listens, some of the songs definitely grew on me but when compared to something like Donda, CLB is just bland and objectively not as good. Many beats are static throughout the entirety of songs. There are no leading singles like how Scorpion had God&#39;s Plan, ect ect. Overall disappointing. <br><br>Drake is the largest he&#39;s ever been and can release below average music to his own standards and still top every chart and shatter records. Personally I don&#39;t feel he has the drive to really pour himself into creating another Take Care or NWTS level album or even IYRTITL tape :/ <br><br>He obviously didn&#39;t fall off or is going to anytime soon, but as I fan, I&#39;d like to see rekindled fire/focus on his next piece of work to prove he hasn&#39;t fallen off and can still grow
One of the worst records I’ve heard in a while. Donda is like the white album in comparison. Yuck
Light 3 😂 guy clearly has no taste in music has bangers on it , your opinion I know but fucking hell. No respect for the GOAT
Well said, 3/10
Thanks so much Anthony, awesome review. Drake has gotten so lazy and I’m glad people are finally saying something. Also as woman I’ve noticed the very weird and problematic things drake gets away with and it’s very weird shit. Thanks so much for calling him out. So much respect to you for that. It needs to be discussed
Damn 💀
can’t wait for this album to get its grammy nomination
Title to this video should’ve been<br>“I hate drake! He makes me insecure. (I’m a Kanye fan) - 16 minutes<br><br>Only people agreeing with dude are ye fans 😂<br>Same dude who put Donda and Lil Pump on the same level
What? N2Deep was dope. Whats this guy talking about? That was actually one of the few good songs off this album
Honestly didn&#39;t know drake did music still lol. Haven&#39;t heard him since like 2009
Facts
Drake is going through a logic like phase of denial
10/10 Review. A lotta people don’t wanna hear this, but they need to.
From hearing Tyler and cole earlier this year.. was expecting more tbh
was expecting a not good lol
Fantano reviewing clb with the donda cover on the shelf
I completely agree with this review.
this review is so delusional lol
This album is so bad I legitimately have no idea what Drake and his team are smoking. Like is this his actual album or is he gonna drop &quot;the real&quot; album soon and be like &quot;just kidding&quot;. I think Travis Scott on the album is the best and mainly by the standards of this album. That that track out of the context of the album and it&#39;s no radio banger. I was expecting songs of many kinds and lots of commercial radio appeal but what the album is seems to dabble in many sounds and suck at all of them. The tracks run too long which if it&#39;s a good track I don&#39;t mind but these are mind numbingly boring tracks. The intro track had some lush production but it felt like it could have been 3 tracks; a really slow way to kick off a slow album. Between the album cover, the iTunes description, and all the shenanigans I have a hard time believing that Drake thought this album was good to go. I mean sure he&#39;s gonna get the radio play, get the sales, etc. but everyone shops at Walmart once in a while so that&#39;s no surprise. There&#39;s nothing new here in terms of production and it&#39;s underwhelming. I had to fight the urge to skip tracks during my first playthrough. I even feel like the features really phoned it in. With the Way 2 Sexy song it&#39;s as cringe as it sounded like it was going to be but given how terrible the track is I think the features did their job...like putting diamonds in dog turd. Overall I could go on at length about this album but I will just end by saying my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined. <br><br><br><br>Thank God DONDA delivered.
Certified Boy Lover
Just not good at all. Kinda sad.
<b>Girl&#39;s like girls where i&#39;m from</b> &quot;I&#39;m not sure, is this an indictment on the men of Toronto?&quot; lmfao yooo
it&#39;s trash
Turn 3 round it&#39;s an E
This is proof for why Donda is miles better
Certified Lover Boy more like Certified L Boy + ratio
Drake has become one of those artists that I won&#39;t ever really get upset if his music comes on at a party or kickback but I won&#39;t actively go out of my way to listen to it either.
I wish you elaborated more on Yebbas heartbreak
Loved the part when you showed us your prothestic pregnant belly in order to mimic the album art, was very funny (even if Lil Nas X already done it, but hey, not something overused so I can&#39;t complain)!
Let’s be honest, Drake is only interesting when he’s on the come up. There is nothing for him to truly rap about anymore, he told us his life story, the story of his mother and and father, how he wanted to be a big rapper, and now we get shit like Way2Sexy…
Donda score + CLB score= New Kendrick album score
Fantano I get that Way 2 Sexy “makes you feel like a girlboss” but that doesn’t warrant adding 4 points to the score
Memphis
Murderer Donda smoked it
I&#39;m still mystified by Drake leaking Life of the Party. Much like you said in your video dedicated to that Melon, what was he thinking? Even an unfinished Kanye track sounds more ambitious than anything Drake has personally put out since 2015. Kanye is without a doubt an unstable ass at the same time as being a creative genius. He makes bad decisions with both his personal life and his music but the difference is he puts his all into everything he does. Drake on the other hand comes across as about as manufactured as any other celebrity, there&#39;s nothing genuine to him. After CLB he needs to really shake things up or else be forgotten in time just like 90% of the pop artists that have existed.
Drake has nothing meaningful left to say... I mean he does, but he won&#39;t tap into it. 💯
&quot;hook a car battery up to my nuts&quot;
thought Donda and CLB were both pretty booty cheeks imo
You make life worth living Anthony fantano thank you for the content
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=640">10:40</a> - Drake has been complaining about friends since 2012 😭😭
Thank you for confirming
I just wanna know how much Kanye paid you to give this review.
Man this is pure trolling😂😂 Drake could literally do anything and he’d have an issue with it. But genius way to pull views in my opinion
Welp <br>Saw this one coming
I thought he was at most give it a 4. A 3?!💀
My man Drake went from outshining everyone on everyone song to getting outshined on his own album. Man this feels bad.
How could ya antnee he has a kid
When drake does singles/ features he sounds good and shows why he is the best, but when he releases albums is ehhh or disappointing asf. I might aswell litsen CLB if i cant sleep since its pretty much boring to litsen to.
It’s official now, Ye won. No other metric or parameter needed
You done did him dirty with this one fantano but I completely agree
Where maiden
Only thing I’ve heard people talk about from this whole album is Lil Dirk promoting his girl’s company.
I actually fell asleep listening to this one
Drake would cry watching this review lmao
NOT GOOD
Good to see Fantano already copped that Donda vinyl.
DONDA&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
THE ALBUM US SO BAD
I LOVE YOU
YES
7 for Donda; 3 for CLB…….<br><br>7 + 3 = 10 <br><br>🤯
All his friends aren&#39;t of age yet.
This clown really rated CLB lower than dissimulation by KSI? Sorry but fantanos lost all credibility now
Way2ny<br>Sexytano
Certified Boy Lover
Hate the album name and cover, but I actually quite liked a few tracks off this one. Donda and CLB were both disappointing to me though.
But Drake let us know he was gonna delve deeper to a whole new place on this one.
Drake presented yet another mediocre album after a year of building of this “certified lover boy” persona I think fans expected a more thematic album but CLB brings nothing new to drake and I think this disappointment will damage the hype for the next drake projects. Not even mentioning how Kanye 100% out performed him. Disappointing
This is not the sometimes I might be introvert review melon.
Donda vinyl in the back?????
Review We Love You Tecca 2 next
&quot;She kinda has a business plan for something&quot;...🤣🤣🤣🤣
RIGHTHONY  SAIDFRANTANO!!!!
Certified weak pull out game. 😒
Travis’ verse went HARD the rest of it is shite
So we all supposed to ignore the album he has on his shelf...
Kings Disease II Album of the year.
Absolutely abysmal cover art, as if having 12 &#39;baby mommas&#39; is something for a man to aspire to. Pathetic
I always assume literally none of these beefs are true, but just meant to convey public interest, win for drake, win for kanye..
CLB put me to sleep. I really tried diving into it but nothing excited me. Fair Trade was good but it sounds like Drake is beefing with himself the entire album
couldn&#39;t even finish the album; too boring
while I give full credit to Superfanthony Grahamtano for his review and prowess in doing such, we forget that what Drake is doing here is his brand, it is his narrative. People enjoy his music because of the temporality of it - it&#39;s relatable because it is transient in emotions. In a regard, to criticize it for not being &#39;constant&#39; or &#39;narrative&#39; in the ways Ye&#39;s album was, is to completely misclassify it, and I&#39;d argue the score would have to be reversed (were it a spectrum). So, to drake fans, this was a hard 7. Mind you, I&#39;m a ye-baby, so it means nothing to me, but I stand by this, as I found this record as just that - transient. More drake. If his beats were getting stale, well, the soda fountain was just re-upped.
Champagne Poetry is immaculate tho
drake is really hoping that pusha t disses him on his next album so he can atleast be remembered this year
Certified NOT GOOD
The more successful the artist is, the more critical people are to it
we won
Drake is great at making hit songs and delivering on features, but albums? Nah. He hasn&#39;t been able to deliver a consistently good album front to back in a long, long time. So I didn&#39;t expect anything less from CLB, but, I got to say, it was worst than I could have imagined.
My mans just roasted drake for like  15 minutes straight😭
I always say that drake is the fast food of rap, it’s quick/catchy and will sell a lot, but there is no real nutritional value,  no substance to his music. Greasy garbage.
Review grip new album
Just let it sink this is only 3 points lower than mbdtf
are all the girls on the cover minors?
The album art is already showing me that the whole album would be bad. I  know that we must not judge a book by its cover but even an ugly album art has its limits.
KSI has a better album than Drake. This news must get to him
The only thing I’ve heard from this album is the lesbian line and oh god
Vegan beef review
DAMN I was thinking he&#39;d give this at least a 4
Great review, Anthony; don’t you think it’s a little unfair though to give it a 3/10 because, “if you want more spins, then you should be dark skinned”?
drake sucks
Drake titles song &quot;No friends in the industry&quot; Melon goes after Drake for having friends in the industry 🤣🤣🤣
CLB = bad but the Kanye is also ass
Good review, there were some good songs but it fell a little shy on my expectations. I think you should review Eric Bellinger next!  ERIC drops his album SEP 10 &quot;New Light&quot;.
everything started going downhill once he said turned the 6 upside down its a 9 now
NO REDHEAD PREGNANT GIRL. RACIST
Hey Anthony, I&#39;ve been reading online people saying that all the problematic stuff said in this album is portrayed by drake under the clb persona he made up for this album. I would love to know why you didn&#39;t think this concept worked at all for drake. Thx love u
“Light to decent -3”
This album feels like when Usher dropped Moving Mountains
Drake’s lullaby album for his unnamed babies out there. This album wasn’t meant for us.
Respect
&quot;Girls want Girls&quot; sounds exactly like a Cal Chuchesta song
When I seen how long it was I automatically knew it was going to be a bad review lol
If you have doubts about Fantano bias, he described someone helping other people financially as &quot;abusing power dynamic&quot;. gtfo
The fuck is that album cover.
Can we talk about how Drake and Millie Bobby Brown have been known to know each other, and the line: “Step up to my girl hands getting thrown up, February 19 is the day of the glow up” and MBB’s Birthday IS FEB 19??? YO???? HELLO…?
3 was too generous for this album.
i&#39;ve liked it
I think Drake&#39;s novelty  throughout his career has been two things: Expanding the landscape of rap music into other popular genre&#39;s, and crafting hits that are so catchy that almost all listeners of rap can add to their immediate playlist. Unfortunately it seems his novelty has worn out, and he&#39;s at the point where he&#39;s trying to match his old work instead of boundary push, to obviously no avail.
100% tired of Drake singing.
This whole album needs to be spanked and put in the corner
Drake aint evolving, hes the same. Kanye has evolved, has multiple different genre albums. We all know the clear winner.<br><br>808s &amp; heartbreak, yeezus, and donda. All made by the same person... incredible.
at this point the evil melon is just hating. drake is in his head rent free
nossa cara
I wanna know what he thinks of the Way 2 Sexy video
have the title of the <b>song</b> you are talking about on the <b>screen.</b>
how melon got the DONDA vinyl already?!?!?
Drake threw in the towel
Agreed. It&#39;s a big no
I actually like the album cover lol
Damn melon doesn&#39;t like drake one bit
This is a good review but how tf is this album better than Scaled and Icy for example?
I always been a huge rap fan but never liked any drake albums. Just his hit songs
i fw drake but ur review is 100% my thoughts since he dropped more life, i feel like he has nothing more to talk about and it shows in the type of music he’s going for which is straight club and streamable music
Guess Anthony’s on team Kanye
n 2 deep and TSU are simply just an homage to TX shit. Get Throwed sample, OGRONC etc......
CLB is trash…
this man is weird
This album was hot kaka
Drake is,  the Lebron of rap, the Tom Brady of Hip Hop. We’re witnessing a great artist in real time. Instead of enjoying the ride with them, we nitpick their games to death. <br>I don’t recall a time when critics asked M Jack, Prince, Madanna, JayZ or Nas to switch up, and experiment in their musical peaks. 🧐 There’s an saying if it ain’t broke, don’t break it. <br>CLB broke Spotify’s record for album streams in a day. <br>He’s a pop star to ask a pop star to make non popular music is just oxymoronic as Jumbo Shrimp.
Ya&#39;ll don&#39;t understand. Drake was trying to match the album with the cover LMAO
This album cover annoys me so much, I absolutely hate it. It&#39;s like the most tiktok zoomer target group oriented thing possible, by an artist who is trying his hardest to appeal to everyone in the mainstream by being as bland as possible ON TOP OF IT.
the donda vinyl in the background
It’s official donda is officially better then clb as certified by Melon
Common Fantano W
Thank you melon now I can officially clown on the Drake stans
Trash 🗑 CLB
too high
Drake batting a 3 red flannel average.
Anthony please review By The Throat by Eyedea &amp; Abilities.
Kanye West &gt; drake<br><br>Not trying to be “that guy” but I’m tired of people saying Drake is better than Kanye. That’s like saying LeBum James is better than Michael Jordan or The Weeknd is better than Michael Jackson. It’s utterly incorrect and downright disrespectful. Stop it
Album reviews should only be given after 2-3weeks after the release of the project to be reeeeally taken seriously
This cover art 💀
melon keeps taking eL’s
Thx for stealing my review off rate your music fantano :).
And people are still saying that Clb is better than Donda
Drake cant rap, drake cant design, drake is ugly.. bye
Just another reason for LosPollosTV to get salty content
The intro was good because it was JUST a Masego sample like it was just the intro of navajo copied and pasted
I’ve been waiting for this review 😂💀💀
This album just sounds so generic for me and the features don’t really add much. Donda is unique features are great and there’s a song that hits every emotion. I also think kanye has perfected the mix of godliness with rap and it’s brilliant. I also am a huge ye fan but donda has definitely met expectations for me
He now has to make being the world famous rapper who had an unplanned pregnancy a part of his brand🤣🤣🤣
Melon is the voice of the voiceless
Waiting patiently for that Senjutsu review hopefully dropping soon...
It truly is amazing how everyone’s ear is different and every album has a different effect on us all individually. I personally loved the album &amp; think Drake has definitely been rapping his assss off in these songs. I loved how skillfully he was at being Drake &amp; not trying something completely out of the range of who he is and his familiar style. Listening to it &amp; Not comparing it to any of his past work and anyone else’s work, it truly sounds solid (in my opinion). Though, I’m allllways interested in Fantano’s input. Looking forward to Travis &amp; Kendrick’s releases ✊🏾
Drake is unstoppable no matter what he does and this album will be more appreciated by some in the years that go by. Your live reaction to some of the these songs were hilarious though.
Thank you TRASH
I don’t like drake and I don’t like this album but this review was more than a little harsh 💀
Certified Lover Boy is certified ass cheeks.
Feels like hate lol
Peep the Donda album on the shelf, which I honestly assume is just a black tile he found
Just because Drake calls himself the 6 God doesn’t mean you can just divide it by 2 and give it a score.
My Boi Got The OG Red Flannel On 💯
3 is kinda high tbh
You talk a lot like Philip Defranco
Anthony, respectfully, you have gone through multiple reviews now where you knock a song because ~you~ would rather hear the Weeknd’s version than that artist’s; i love The Weeknd but can still enjoy Race My Mind (one of the only enjoyable songs on this project) because I think Drake put in a good performance in this style, and doesn’t deserve to be knocked just because Abel can also do that style well. Same thing with ‘Stay’ by Laroi and to a lesser extent, ‘Hold on’ by Bieber. Just my opinion on what should go into a review tho, all love
Anthony,  just cause you&#39;re not lesbian doesn&#39;t mean that you have to hate it
Just another Drake album <br><br>Passive aggressive diss bars <br><br>Copying some other artist and do it terribly <br><br>A-List Features <br><br>Dark moody production <br><br>Drakeisms (where every bar is a IG caption or Twitter bio quote) <br><br>Drake is still a groomer
Every 20year old rapper has ten kids and drake really thinks someone cares about him having one child wtf this man needs to get over himself
ah yes the red flannel so glad so see
Certified Red Flannel Lover
hey
Why does it come off like Fantano has some kind of vendetta against this album? Like he actually seems angry.
SUCK IT DRAKE FANS DONDA GOT A 7 HAHAHAHAHA
How does he take so many Ls in a row and keep on going?
Sign o the times. The best selling pop star of current times is an uninspired rapper who’s got no life experience to draw from and nothing substantial to share. I’ll be listening to Donda.
Love how it looks like this album literally made melon mad
CMIYGL better get AOTY
My man is legend he supports donda , album cover is all over his Shirt
This is an album where I actually agree with Fantano’s rating<br><br>Edit: solid 6 for me now, would be higher if the pacing didn’t suck at the end. The atmosphere of some of these tracks are straight ridiculous
I LOVED this album!
Drake PEAKED in 2015 and that’s ong
Drake peaked in 2015 and has been making Instagram caption records since then.
drake was never the same after pusha diss
I’m a genius, I gave Donda a 7 and CLB a 3 before fantano did
In case Drake watches this, a 3 was waaaaay too generous!
I usually agree with you but this review comes off to me as hella salty and biased. I’m not buying it. I thought this album was quite enjoyable as far as Drake albums go.
I’m so past this beef I just wanted good music and I genuinely didn’t enjoy this album whatsoever. Plus on a so called lover boy album and no PND feature was pretty disappointing lol
Whatever you say about this, Drake always keeps it a buck. Like Antetokounmpo.
IMY2 was my favorite of all the album actually, strange
&quot;Why can&#39;t losers ever lose in peace?&quot;
cool donda vinyl
The best part of this review is that DONDA is up on the bookshelf
Drake: Certified Bellend
anthony, you’re gonna make me a certified lover boy
Not even a &#39;&#39;(light) TO decent 3&#39;&#39; damn lmao
I liked this album but my biggest was the lack of songs I really felt like I wanted to revisit. There’s no Off The Grid on here. No Fivio verse.
You can’t just give this 3 points cause there’s 3 white girls on the cover
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=364">6:04</a> bro why 🤣🤣🤣
So basically it’s NOT GOOD 😊
Say what you want about the bias, but fantano doesn’t really side with Ye or Drake. This is a pretty fair analysis. The album was bad, get over it.
Melon saying “ i’m too sexy for this syrup<br>Too sexy for your girl Too sexy for this world Too sexy for this ice” for seventeen minutes straight isn’t really a review
U spittin fr king
Damn Melon, didn’t have to break out the microscope on the writer credits to find R Kelly .
at least he liked BTI better than CLB
you just a hater man😑
“... Drake cosplay as gangster...” lmao melon, that’s straight up manslaughter 💀💀💀💀💀
everyone went crazy on IG and I just had the feeling this was gonna happen
Drake is just Nav with a heart in his hair.
Drake is like a pokemon holding an everstone. He&#39;ll never evolve.
don’t care clb&gt; donda
Then people saying it&#39;s better than donda 😪
Drake just isn&#39;t a likeable guy
Felt like this record was only slightly worse than Kanye&#39;s, although they both were segmented and pretty bad.
and they say clb is better than donda smh
Drakes like madden, he drops an album that gets progressively worse each year yet people still buy it and keep the franchise alive
Certified Mid Boy
Can&#39;t wait for all the salty, TikTok-using fangirls to swarm the video haha. Gonna be entertaining
Melon is way too sexy for this red flannel
ksi&#39;s album &quot;all over the place&quot; got a higher rating from fantano than drake&#39;s album. that&#39;s nuts.
Does this mean Donda and CLB get a 10/10 combined
So you’re telling me KSI has a higher rating???
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=363">6:03</a>😂😂
True
The TSU song is creepy when you think about it. <br>A sec worker with no family, a millionaire paying her for sex, and an R Kelly writing credit
I forgot Drake was even on the kid cudi track today on this record
It’s official! Donda &gt; CLB
Cant wait for LosPollos to watch this lol
Ha Kanye won
Drake is so strange and embarrissing in a way, he just has this weird, well, &quot;Lover Boy&quot; energy - but in a corny-immature way, that comes off way too strong...I would not be suprised if something effed up comes out one day. The Stars are not alining. This album shows it...Insecure.
No way this got a three. Waaaaay to much.
Is anyone talking about how Drake recycled Masego’s “Navajo” beat from many years ago for the intro? And how Masego killed it and Drake just did little raps on it?
He went too safe on this one and as a result we got very repetitive Drake sound that we&#39;ve been familiar with for years..
It’s over. Drake is no more.
Fantano makes less sense with every passing review. Sad!
the loudest boos always come from the cheapest seats..
Get to the Little Simz album I don’t care about this shit!
I pretty mich agree but way 2 sexy is actually my favorite song of the record
Sooo many ppl really calling this shit better than donda ppl really love nut grippin drake it’s ridiculous
👏👏👏👏👏👏 glad somebody said it the only song I liked was the jay z one
The album is not great but I think this guy doesn&#39;t like drake very much.
I have a feeling Drake&#39;s gonna watch this in bed at 2AM and his gonna have a couple tears rolling down his cheeks
Drake pissed off melon this is hilarious 😆
Drake is consistent <br><br>Consistently boring uninspired and all around garbage
Certified Boy Lover Amirite
Oh no… it’s the Certified Lover Flannel 😮
Drake sampled a Machine Gun Kelly song for the beat for “N 2 Deep”! The song he sampled is called “Get Laced”. No one has noticed and I feel like the only one who knows this
Ty, album was Dookie, it felt like a lazy cash grab
not cosplay as a gangster 😭😭😭
Anthony Certified Wavy 🌊🌊🌊
Yeah you know why Champagne Poetry sounds pretty good? Because it’s not his fuckin song 😂 It’s Masego’s just with Drake vocals instead
he’s covered the vinyl in the back so it’s clb vs donda
Not every song needs to have some deep musical content or attention grabbing spirituality to it. Way2Sexy is clearly a joke and it’s for fun so have some fun mannnnn 😂
Best review to date
can you review jack stauber
Review We Love You Tecca 2!
Too high
The fact that WLR has a higher rate than CLB speaks alot
As a huge Drake since 2009, this 100% his most uninspired album
His worst album yet. So disappointing.
he spittin he yellin
Certified snoozer
I just want Drake to drop a track against melon just so Cal has a reason to drop another project
Huge W
I didn&#39;t think it was that bad to be honest. I&#39;d have rated it around 6/10 probably.
I&#39;m a huge Drake fan and this album really sucks. Scorpion had some really fun songs in my opinion and some of the biggest hits of Drake&#39;s career. This whole album feels lifeless and devoid of any ambition. Drake&#39;s greatest talent is his penchant for making hits, and this album hardly even tries for one.
u should review grip next
CLB 3 LETTERS, 3 DEGREES
HAHAHAHAHAH A FUCKING LIGHT 3
Thanks for letting us know, Melon. Unscubscribed.
The Drake stans ain’t gonna like this one
The album cover disappoints
Drake? More like... Dreck!<br><br>Okay, I&#39;ll leave.
imagine many years from now the kids of that generation will be confused about why drake was considered a great artist, his numbers won&#39;t matter in that period Aubrey isn&#39;t immortal at all.
I think CLB being half as good as MBDTF is rating it way to high
Certified lullaby 💤💤
Oh waking up to see certified fuckboy got a lite 3 is basically Christmas at this point
I really enjoyed this project but i already see him giving it strong 4 to a light 5
Probably the most accurate review of this album. So glad you gave it a 3
As much as he hates way 2 sexy. You can&#39;t deny that it&#39;s gonna be a club banger
Because it&#39;s a drake album and Anthony isn&#39;t the biggest fan, I expected a mid rating, but a red shirt I did not
Drake is so lazy at this point. I honestly couldn&#39;t get beyond five tracks
Hahahahhahahahajajaj
5/10 imo
This is the first album that I’ve liked where most people say it sucks. Solid 8 for me
Diary Drake, bruhhh😂😂😂
“This song is so boring I wanted to hook up a car battery to my nuts” is my all time favorite fantano line
First Time I&#39;ve ever thought of Anthony&#39;s nuts and hopefully the last time
Great review
ok melon but drop the 3rd 10 for the new little simz
Lesbianthony Iamtoono here…
All over the place got better rating than CLB tell the fat neek
When it comes to Drake i guess Anthony is just over hating at this point 😂
W
MELON BOMB
Drake hasn’t made a good album since IYRTITL
How’s Kanye’s unreleased Diss track and Melon’s Diss Review more superior than Drake’s released Diss track? Crazy times we living in…
Love the &quot;Donda&quot; in the background
Longest 3 review I’ve seen
Oh no 😂 I’m team Kanye all the way, but I actually liked CLB
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=358">5:58</a>
take this L anthony
The dead end hip hops boys gonna tear his a** up. I’m not surprised by this review at all and based on what I’ve heard so far on the album, I don’t disagree
awful absolute dogshit cover art offensively bad
If CLB is a 3, DONDA should be a 5, because of the number of letters.
This should of just been called certified dumpster boy
Honestly thought this one was a 2
Just looking at the album cover tells me all I need to know about the artistic direction of this album
I think it’s time to admit drake only cares about numbers than Quality. That is the major difference between Drake and Kanye
Dead ass 3??
AOTP &gt; CLB
Im off the grid grid grid<br>Drake album<br>Mid mid mid
Thank you for this anthony
Bodied
I don&#39;t dislike the video but you don&#39;t listen to Drake for any &quot;message&quot; or to be inspired by the content. You listen because it&#39;s entertaining. I don&#39;t care about any rap beef or drama that surrounds him. I care that the song is fun and/or catchy to listen to. I have other artists that fill that &quot;deeper&quot; level of entertainment
“Honey i know youre in labor, but can you quiet down a little, Fantano dropped the certified lover boy review.”
LMAO
I’ve said this before but I’ll say it again: I really don’t understand why drake would make multiple songs talking about Kanye when the album is called “Certified Lover Boy” 💀
loving that red flannel
I cant get over the emoji album cover
It would be amazing if you reviewed ‘Blue: Before Love undoes everything” by A2
big dub melon
Anthony fantano, internets busiest drake hater here
Fantano gives a Kanye album a bad review and everyone’s has 100’s of different opinions, fantano gives a drake album a bad review and the whole community is like yeah that’s valid
Probably the most honest review ive seen yet on this project
“Even though I’m happy they buried the hatchet,<br>It’s not like they’re making magic”<br>Fantano ruthless with these bars
Don&#39;t judge an album by its cover, except this one.
R. Kelly has a writing credit on this comments section
I am going to say it... Wale&gt;Drake Musically! Yes, I said what I said.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I thought I was maybe too harsh when I thought it was a solid 3/10, but listening to Anthony&#39;s complains I can see it&#39;s totally justified lmao. Drake really shouldn&#39;t get credit for the production (ie every sound being crisp) when everything still sounds so fucking bland.
I don’t know guys. Drake doesn’t take risks? Took a big risk being a rapper/ rnb singer. Took a big risk trying to do dance hall. To a risk doing the London drill. Now the risks he took are the norm for him and it appears his harshest critics want more out of him.<br><br>I agree that this album is for fans of drake. I agree this is not out of his wheelhouse and he’s done most of these songs before, it isn’t nothing new from him. I think he’s just doing what works for him and his fanbase.<br><br>But a 3?? Lmao damn nigga..I know you’re not a fan of his at all but geez lmaooo<br><br>I will say that Kanye and drake should make up so Kanye can get better lyrics and drake could get the production. Kanye definitely takes production risks, which is now the norm for him as well but he needs a better pen.
Drake&#39;s marketing strat of putting up billboards hyping up the featured artists makes sense in the sense that all of them outperform him.
Totally agree this album was Wack AF!
Drake been fell off. He only has 2 classic albums. Take Care and Nothing Was the Same.
Wasn’t the greatest but a 3?… cmon cuhhhhhhh
lil baby really did rap like his life depended on it 😂 he sounds like a hostage
Melon man&#39;s made it official <br>Donda&gt;CLB<br>light7&gt;light3
Red flannel? Seriously?☠️
Both of KSIs albums got higher lol
this was brutal 😂
the only bold choice made on this LP is the cover ... and its a bad decision
This guy needs to stop doing reviews
Drake should drop a collaboration album with Rick Ross. It&#39;s obvious he&#39;s the only artist who brings the best out of him. Drake is woefully uninspired by his life right now and it shows - it&#39;s sad to see his talent ruined by his apathy
Props to melon for listening to all these ~90 minute Drake albums so we don’t have to.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=357">5:57</a> LMAO
Never forget melon gave Swimming this same score<br><br>RIP Mac 3 years flown by
Drake aka the wave rider<br><br>I&#39;m shocked he lasted this long releasing the same album over and over. I&#39;m guessing his stans grew up and finally noticed lol. Drake has been madden, cod, and 2k the last 5 years.
KSI probably buzzing about the fact that both his albums did better than Drake
I think drake is done. He won&#39;t get any big hits anymore. Music has moved on from him
Great review Anthony
Hot take should drake retire?
Wow Melon really did a hatchet job on this album 💿 👀 🪓
&quot;I don&#39;t care&quot; sums it up well.
Not a single Ginger woman in the album cover......
Imagine Dragons next please!
so that ended up being the real album cover huh? wow that cover sucks ass
Listening to a drake album is the equivalent to ordering chicken tenders at a restaurant you’re not familiar with. After awhile you get tired of chicken tenders.
Drake has become the real life &quot;I&#39;m not mad don&#39;t put in the newspaper that I got mad&quot; dril  tweet.
it&#39;s official, Donda better
We want a video about donda vs clb 🙃
Kid cudi feature was the best
Fountains literally sounds like One Dance with different instrumentals.
Donda in the back just chillin
Damn 3 💀
Weak album
I really get the point yalö adressong, bjt cant u just enjoy the music without expectations? I mean its at least decent ypu can listen to it without giving too much thought to it, it sounds nice. I mean why cant drake stick with what hes doing he does not have to change for the expectations or am I wrong
“On your ass like backpockets” is such an Eminem line lmaoo
Just bc he&#39;s a lesb doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s that bad
That R. Kelly credit has me dead
Drake strikes me as a man who is profoundly, inescapably bored with his own success at this point. It’s like he’s spent the last eight years stuck in that casino in the Twilight Zone where he always wins and has come to terms with the fact that he’s actually in his own private hell. He’s like an inverse Pitbull.
Review ‘Ocean Wisdom’ - big talk
I swear it&#39;s only hip-hop &quot;enthusiasts&quot; that hate on this man
Fantano got pen game still
Kanye ≈ Picasso, Drake ≈ Andy Warhol
Did anyone else get a sense that Drake doesn’t understand what a friend is unless he is paying them?
love you for this review, been saying that he is the same since Views came out, and that album was fire, but still, he never progressed, same old character.
put some respect on masego&#39;s name melon
I thought he would give a 6 got damn lol 😂 i agree with everything he said though not that I typically do but when it comes to drake lol we mostly agree mediocre 🤣
Donda better. End of story.
All I can think about is your core fan base shows a little bit about you as an artist. Cut to fousey talking about the time he “met” Drake where he justified stalker behavior and called it manifestation.
nah because remember when he first teased this back at the end of 2020 and him making a big deal outta an album that turned out like this 😭
This album was solid! It’s just not want y’all wanted to hear! Y’all want rapping drake but y’all got to remember drake is a singing nigga
The Chipmunk Soul you mentioned on &#39;Champagne Poetry&#39; is from &#39;Masegos - Navajo&#39;, a brilliant track that i feel drakes rendition doesnt do justice
Drake is single mom rap
This guy just a drake hater tbh
Please explain to us what the fuck “Tuscan leather energy” is?!<br><br>Also, hooking a car battery up to your nuts would provide you physical, not mental stimulation.
That album artwork will age like whole milk.
Drake really needs that ghostwriter again :/<br>I didn’t remember a single track after listening to this album. Background music for dates
This shit even put the stand to sleep
You should check out Donnay Soldier &quot;A Soldier To Cry On&quot;, though its an EP that was released in may this year. Maybe keep an eye on him for his next project

Drake fans punching air right now 💀
The album cover is so corny that it makes dondas album cover look like an artistic masterpiece
CLB= Certified Lethargic Boy<br><br>This album was coma inducing.<br><br>P.S. Life of the Party (Unreleased track) &gt; CLB
i always hear the criticism that “this album sucks because kanye played it safe”, yet i don’t understand why people are so surprised when drake does. i mean literally what about this made you think it would be creative.it’s called certified lover boy with 9 pregnant women emojis.the album to me is great for what it is, if you expected it to be like kanyes album that’s dedicated to his dead mom thats kinda on you.
he’s not wrong you know
Drake was the soundtrack of the 2010s, but he&#39;s messed up big time with this album. It&#39;ll be interesting to see if he&#39;ll be able to regain his place at the top or if this is really the end of an era, sadly it feels like the latter.
THE MELON HAS SPOKEN!
This man gave 2014 forest hills drive a light 6 and you all still value his opinion 😂
This was more entertaining than the album
Kanye won
Certified Boy Lover sounds like some shit Drake would write.
Drake is trash. Let’s move on from this loser, and leave him in the past where he belongs.
I still haven&#39;t listened to this because of the horrendous album cover. It&#39;s so fucking ugly.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=754">12:34</a> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=801">13:21</a> he said all there was to say
Drake featuring R. Kelly and Godsmack - ‘Certified Child Groomer’
I really wonder if Drake will stumble upon this review
Yeah but what about the new Peste Noire
I think you&#39;re usually too hard on Drake but not this time. Idk why Drake would even release this
The only times I ever listen to drake is in the gym, and I’ll have to disagree with your take on Way 2 Sexy. Its a pretty good workout track. Really, I think Drake just makes decent gym music, nothing else.
Yeah, shit was boring.
Red flannel time!!!
I didn&#39;t care at all about what he was saying.<br>But the production was dope I loved every beat on this record.<br>And the Travis verse was sick
Opening track sucks in comparison to what it’s blatantly copying: Navajo - Masego. Please Drake fans go check this song out…
this album is sooo boring that im surprised Drake didnt put his name on it.....................wait a second..
I don&#39;t have much enthusiasm for Drake at the best of times but owweee I felt the 3.
Champagne Poetry, Papi’s Home and You Only Live Twice are the only songs worth keeping, the rest can go in the bin.
I&#39;m a big fan of The Weeknd and Race My Mind and Get Along Better has been my favorites so far so makes sense lol.
If you actually liked Certified Lover Boy you would’ve given it a 10
honestly Dark Lane Demos had more bangers and didn&#39;t put me to sleep like this record did.
Certified RED SHIRT BOI
😴😴😴
There&#39;s no song on this album that you didn&#39;t say something negative about.<br>You hate Drake and that&#39;s a fact lol<br>You have ksi&#39;s first album a higher score😂
when ksi gets a better album score RIP
hey mr fantano can we expect a iron maiden senjutsu review?
Drake consistently putting out mid music and yet he&#39;s still your GOAT kmt. Idk how he does the numbers he does he ok but he can&#39;t sing or rap at an elite level
Oh no the red flannel
Abel was never inspired by Drake.<br>Abel inspired Drake.
Yea, whenever I&#39;m low or depressed or I hear a bad Drake track, I hook my nuts up to car batteries too, just to spice things up.
My god you found 16 minutes of words to talk about this!
Kanye: 17 drake: 0
Pusha thanos laughing rn
CLB is is worst album to date for drake same formula but without the hits 3/10 evem if you love drake it&#39;s no more then a 6/10.
how come every drake album sounds like leftovers from his last album..
Drakes been ripping off the weeknd since take care, not a suprise anymore
Hot take: If Dunkey leaked CLB it would&#39;ve been at least a 5.
chopper hit him and he turned to a booty clapper
Drake out here releasing the same fucking music for a decade now
Album wasn’t great but had a few great songs.
come on man, think about Drake’s feelings.
He brags about losing friends and finding peace but disses dudes for losing friends. I jus can&#39;t
Knew he would give it a good score, drake dosent disappoint!
Drake hasn’t made a single good album since 2015.
There is no PASSION, there is no VISION, there is no AGGRESSION, there is no FUCKING MINDSET in this album. NOTHING is there. WHAT THE HELL IS IN THIS ALBUM? Tell me now. WHAT THE HELL IS IN THIS ALBUM.<br><br>I did like You only live twice but that coulda been on Nothing was the Same tbh
Pipe down a classic song
huh
GIVE LITTLE SIMZ HER GOD SCORE YOU COWARD
Deserves lower…
I was seeing if you still make YouTube videos, and I see you still have some of the worst takes on the net 🤝
White
Drake mid at best.
⬛ &gt; 🤰
W
Drake got some complex’s, all that money can no one around you can be honest with you lolll
certified lullaby
KSI got a higher score and I can’t even disagree
in conclusion, give Little Simz a 10 melon since that was better than this and Donda combined
Get his ass melon man
Who is Drake actually trying to please, it seems like he wants to please at least 30 different crowds and none of them actually care. <br>This dude is actually just reliving his highschool years through music.
Lmao Melon’s aggressive ass tone is definitely to just get a rise out of Drake hoping for some Post Malone-esque reference
lets talk about drake grooming young girls!
wasnt as bad as scorpeon, but yea fool should only drop singles
Fantano gave 3 because literally 3 good tracks present on the album.
Akademiks is punching air
Nas won this battle.
You became more of a troll then a reviewer…smh
Certified Minor Lover
Never getting that Dark In Here review
Lmaoooooo big time hater
Anthony,dancing in a thong to the song way 2 sexy is not a review.
Best review you ever did, well explained
Certified Lover Boy more like Certified Boy Lover am i right ?
Damn he hate this album lmao
The Story of Adidon really bullied drake into fatherhood. And hes still dropping bars about it. Shows you how big of an L Drake took.
Now THAT&#39;s bad
I don’t think way 2 sexy was made to be a good song. I think it was just made to go viral on tiktok
Agree with a lot of points but saying Travis having a better verse than Drake on Fair Trade is hilarious 😂😂
I enjoyed it for sure
I only liked fair trade….that was just it for me
I liked it &amp; listened to it all the week, but now i can&#39;t 😥🤧
Certified Lesbian Boy
Melon you can&#39;t just cut out all the &quot;Drake sections&quot;  and leave the features in and give it a light 7
Antonio el Fantas
I hate the album cover. Idk makes me think of Drake being a deadbeat dad leaving pregnant women
The reason it took a couple days for this to come out is because his red flannel needed to go through a was cycle
smiling with no teeth in the background, i love it! s/o to Genesis Owusu!
Lospollos is gonna lose his shit
This albums biggest sin is that damn album cover..
Shit review
Review Bruthamillz No waves vol 1
To be honest I saw Yebbas Heartbreak as a little turning point. Agree that it picked up a tiny bit of pace, but still really bad. Also the production was rarely bad and coupled with Drakes boring voice, I thought you were gonna give it a 2. <br><br><br>Rick Ross tho
How fantano got better wordplay than drake
This review is garbage
Drake has fell off badly, this album is mostly trash, couple Ok tunes, and this coming from someone who “WAS” a Drake stan
That has got to be the most unappealing album cover I have ever seen.
explaining why he can&#39;t be a lesbian &#39;cause he&#39;s a man for 17 minutes isn&#39;t a review melon...
Dude really had to bring back Hot Shower by Chance
KAnye drops a album talking about trying to get his wife family back , drake drops a album talking about Fuccin everyones girls smh ...lost my whole family due to the pandemic so donda was medicine for me
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=949">15:49</a> I can&#39;t believe as a Drake stan what you say here I 100% agree with. That have to be his worst outro
literally a fucking 1/10 I feel like I&#39;ve heard every song on here on every other album since take care bro is so fucking lazy and comfortable with his &quot;style&quot; that it isn&#39;t even good for background noise
If you’re reading this, you’re not a lesbian
Please review grip new album. I died for this?
Melon dropped harder bars in this review than drake did on the whole album. Cold
Way 2 Sexy is THE banger of this album and Young Thug got busy: “I’ve been kickin’ sh*t, might need a prosthetic, I pray toooo my choppa under my pillow, tooth fairy.” Cmoooooooooon!!!!!!!
This album would be a 10 if donda didn’t steal 7 points from it.
&quot;Im not owned&quot; the album.
Certified stinker of an album. Had to listen to it twice to make sure I wasn&#39;t having auditory hallucinations for how bland it was. Consistently average with cavernous lows.
Most streams in music history
Drake: the McDonalds of Music.
Seen this coming a mile away, needledrop just doesn’t fuck with drake period
I fkn love this drake bashing
How did I know the album score would be 3/10 before I even looked in the description😭
LETS GOOOOO A 3 FUCK DRAKE DONDAS BETTER
donda is more interesting
Bro &#39;car battery to my nuts&#39; must be the best burn I have ever heard in your reviews 😂
I thought it was just me who thought Travis didn’t put any effort on that song 😂
I knew before clicking this it’ll be the most bias review on earth, he has never liked drake never will
I can’t believe the amount of people I have seen that genuinely say clb is better than donda. The only song I see with any replay value is you only live twice.
Nice Donda vinyl in the background lmao
It&#39;s crazy to me that Drake feels personally fulfilled putting out the same shit all the time. Like it&#39;s never terrible or whatever, he generally has some bangers, but he just absolutely does not push the envelope.
Melon&#39;s rhyming outro is better than anything on CLB bar you only live twice
That album cover will forever haunt me
The album cover pisses me off
Please review Iron Maiden
Drake has been on a steady decline since if you are this it&#39;s too late album
&quot;I&#39;ve been dropping songs and getting 3&#39;s, honestly sounds like a fair trade to me.&quot;
I hope this is the last drake project you review because it’s clear you’re not a fan. You only do it for numbers.
FACT:<br>It took Fantano only 38 seconds to mention the far superior &quot;Kanye West&quot;
Re-review solar power pls
3😂😂😂😂
This guy has just been a hater from day one on every single drake project lmao . This whole video just starts with a rant about drakes insecurities and personal life lmao. Could tell instantly this will be a bias review, this guy talks with disgust in his tone when it comes to drake. Grow up man lmao , outshined by every single feature . Like seriously…
made me happy made me smile
This is why three to five year breaks for artist in the music industry is important. Drake please take a break and work on your craft low key.
You literally pointed out what I’ve been saying about Drake and him being about the now
This guy has the absolute lamest audience I have ever seen
Certified Lullaby 🥱😴
Worst Drake LP!!! Tyler bit Kanye and Drake!
Perfect rating for a trash album
Needle I didnt think the album was great either but damn 😂 Everytime you liked something it had to he followed by a &quot;but&quot;? &quot;This song was good But in the grander scheme of things&quot; Just say you dont like it then😂😂
Bro you gave death grips a 10 nobody cares about your opinion bald white man😂
Red flannel = 😈  mode
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=358">5:58</a> ....that roast though!!!
I’m gonna give you a wedgie after school tomorrow…
Drake is McDonald&#39;s music. You know what you&#39;re getting is mass produced crap. But people seem to find comfort in the consistency.
It’s official, Kanye won!
never has an album that has disappointed me while I had little to no expectations. Certified Lover Boy is worst Drake’s album I’ve ever listened to. Even to the point where I hated this album, not because it was horrible, but because it’s the same stuff that drake has done and saying the same things since I was in middle school. I was bored to the point of frustration, most of the features felt wasted with the exceptions were Jay-Z, Future (in Way 2 Sexy), Kid Cudi, Rick Ross, Lil Baby, Travis Scott and Yebba and basically felt like where Drake wasn’t giving as much. You might as well should have called 911 for those people for their backs broken for carrying the songs.  there’s only one song that would be considered a banger (even though I wouldn’t say it’s a good song and it’s very much a meme) and it’s Way 2 Sexy and while the majority of the 21 songs I liked (to an certain extant), outside of the fore mentioned song, there were completely forgettable. Also, some of the bars are corny, and don’t get me started on the infamous line “said you was a lesbian, girl me too.” Like I don’t know how Drake looked are the bars he wrote for this album and be proud of it cause it’s quite embarrassing.” Also, why didn’t Drake include Laugh Now Cry Later and the songs from Scary Hours 2, is just beyond me because those songs were pretty good. Maybe I’m just really spoiled by Drake’s music from 2009 to 2015, and pretty all but essentially one Drake project (More Life) has disappointed me and this continues it and I would say that I hated CLB so much that it made me appreciate Views and Scorpion more and I didn’t like those albums.
When youre starting out you rap about your life and  struggles and people can relate and empathise. When you get filthy rich your struggles become something not many people can relate to and dont really see it as struggles. Drake will never get the attention and respect he once had unless he hits rock bottom and starts to climb up again. Thats the problem with most rappers who change their life completely but expect their fans to be the same.
I think the album was bland because he’s on universal now and not on Young Money so he doesn’t have to appeal to that audience anymore. He is now a bonafied “superstar” not sure where he goes from here. I thought Dark Lanes was a lot better than this. He also missed the trick not sampling Yebba into a song cos that would’ve been fire
Best track on the album yebbas heartbreak, also tha only wan witout drake lmfao
Lol Melon really went into this review elaborating on all his thoughts when a &quot;Not Good&quot; review would have been sufficient. <br><br>He put more effort into his review than Drake into actually creating the album.
You think that Aubrey, Drake, the 6 god, the one running through the 6 with his woes, would take his 6th album super seriously and try to push the envelope on hip hop especially since he paved the way for the emotional hip hop as of late. The 6 god&#39;s 6th album was a dud. Its a damn shame. All the money, power and influence in the world and he still can&#39;t make a album that&#39;s consistently good throughout
So, Donda wins?
He didn’t say anything about yebbas heartbreak. Drakes vocal performance on that song blew me away.
It&#39;s a grower not a shower...wait shower and shower are spelled the same, is shower a real word though? hahaha woah man, yo yo im a shower in the shower watch me grow got penis power ha ha... neat.
KSI got 5..... Wow
lmao
Melon’s just mad because none of his reviews have any features on them. Sad.
drake is terrible
Lmao
I hope we get more about Drake&#39;s new lesbian identity on the next album
certified boy lover
Your delivery in the review makes me feel like you know Drake is going to be tuning in. Savage
Listened to the whole thing in one night. It was awful.
if Trippie Redd was on this album, the album woulda been a 14/10
This shit doesnt dessrve a 3. Im giving this album a 0.5/10
Uh oh Los Pollos is going to have an aneurism…
W review
Drake is genuinely one of the worst rappers of this generation. Not because hes as embarrasing as a tom mcdonald but becauses hes just so boring and uninteresting as an artist with some of the safeat production and songs in the industry
&quot;I kinda wanna just hook a car battery up to my nuts just to get some kind of mental stimulation&quot;<br>-Stimmy Nutano 2021
6.6 from pitchfork lol
talking about how good nav is for 17 minutes isn’t a clb review, melon
Drake has always been shit
agree with the assessment and analysis but not the score.
Wow, Fantano really got the Donda vinyl in the background 💀
here we go 🥱
A 35 year old guy calling himself a boy making songs comparing himself to a lesbian..... 12/10
Not gonna lie, I hated this album when I first heard it but now I can’t stop listening to it. There are some bangers in dih bih… tsu? N 2 deep? Love all? Champagne poetry?! Come on bruhh😩😩 mans said views was boring 😂😂 <br>My only quarrel with CLB is it does sound like a lot of the old drake we are used to hearing. Way to sexy was ass I can’t defend that, nor do I want to…
I FUCKING PREDICTED THAT SHIT. 3/10. <b>transcends to Fantano</b>
This means cal churchesta&#39;s mixtape is on the same level as this drake album<br>Don&#39;t insult cal like that at least his music kept me awake
Remember when Drake got butthurt after Kendrick&#39;s Control verse and claimed he was the goat? Hilarious how their paths have changed. KDot a true artist, Drake just a content creator at this point
RARE W
Drake about to drop a diss track on melon for giving CLB a bad score
Good review anthony, but did you really need to talk about a Drake album for 15 minutes instead of doing waky antics?
The review isn&#39;t late, he started listening to Lover Boy as soon as it came out and he just finished.
Calling Way 2 Sexy &quot;embarrassing&quot; is the most fitting take I&#39;ve  heard on the song😭
Melon scored clb lower than donda- the beef is over L for drake
Can’t wait for the day he shits on Jaden for his new/remix album
Really hope Drake is going the start getting more serious. This album was like bland milk
I remember when Drake said in an interview that he wanted to surpass Kanye in everyway. This record proves that he&#39;s got centuries worth of homework to do, to even catch up with Ye&#39;s legacy
He rip this album apart, and took his time too.
Drake gave smiley a better verse than he did himself on any of the tracks
hey look, donda AND certified lover boy are a 10 combined WOW
YESSSSS
I think that Drake&#39;s fall has something to do with his best project (take care) having to do with rumours, that it wasn&#39;t even his, but Abel&#39;s (the weeknd&#39;s) album in first place. There&#39;s so much shady from him finenessing albums to ghost-writing, to his private life to the way he&#39;s treating his label (read also as sweatshop - I only hope Roy Wood$ will be able to get out at some point and time, dude is everything Drake wants to be with Drake&#39;s poor imitation of Jamaican accent). There&#39;s definitely something really wrong with Drake and not only on social level.
Fantano based af
Had to click off when he said views was boring 💀
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=366">6:06</a> 💀💀
DONDA gang
Drake makin a song over a watered down beat of Navajo by Masego without listing him as a feature was a dick move, ngl.
Drake needs The Weeknd to write songs for him again since his albums are getting worse.
This album is very good and i don&#39;t care what y&#39;all say🤰🏻
certified boy lover is trash. you are right that only Fair Trade is valid.
Uh oh red flannel! That&#39;s not good.
Me and a coworker were talking about CLB and I told him that it sounded like Drake took himself and moved to the most unsavory parts of town, assimilated and wrote an album based on his experiences
Saw the thumbnail of him wearing the red flannel and immediately started killing myself laughing
Daily Reminder that KSI is able to make better albums than Drake
My nigga fantano i officially forgive you for your rashad review. Couldn&#39;t agree more
It this is a 3 what is donda gonna get lol. Really found donda so boring
Alright gang, now we know that Donda is objectively better
Watching people come to terms with the fact that Drake essentially sold them the same group of songs over and over again and get rich, is entertaining. It took long enough.
Who dropped a better album this year? This album isn’t 🔥but it’s definitely not trash let’s be honest.<br><br>Most of the music industry is mid.
Champagne poetry was good. The rest was unmemorable.
😂 ah I remember when people were saying CLB &gt; Donda the day it dropped🤡🤡🤡
Why do you have a little spot of hair at the front and then a river with the rest of the hair at the back lmaooo please get rid of it Anthony
Damn dude Drake could use this as a therapy session
melon saying you hate lesbians for 16 minutes isnt a review
Gotta give it to drake he made 21 songs feel like 63 not many people can pull it off like that!
How and where does one get certified to be a lover boy? Is there an office? A written test?
How on earth does anybody with ears compare this guy to Ye. They’re not even in the same ballpark
Damn he really put the donda vinyl in the background.
“I wanna hook a car battery up to my nuts” <br>- Melon
you could&#39;ve just called the video &quot;Kanye fan releasing a completely biased Review&quot;
Me: ooooof red flannel
Definitely don&#39;t feel like the album is as bad as you say it is. For this to get a 3 &amp; Donda to get a 7, makes absolutely no sense to me. Both were underwhelming records.
CLB project is the worst Drake album to ever grace the light of day, there&#39;s a couple bangers but the rest are genuinely horrendous to listen too.
I think the fact that Donda dropped before CLB made CLB look even worse than it actually is
I like drake
This might sound cringe but following the beef this album was embarrassing and showed that Kanye is an artist and a musician orchestrating the music and his albums. Drake is a rapper who jumps onto beats from random producers, and nothing more.  <br><br><br>Donda and CLB are so so so far apart it’s barely even comparable. Kanye took a W
Sometimes Fantano gets it completely right and this is it. I don&#39;t think I disagree with one thing he said here
You can&#39;t give an album a 3 just because there wasn&#39;t a gibgolglab sample
I hate Drake since he debuted so his huge success makes me really salty honestly…😇
drake is gonna put a hit out on Cal (because he doesn&#39;t know they&#39;re not the same person)
Thank you, finally someone cut the bs
nice touch to place the donda vinyl in the back, well done anthony
Tbh Dark Lanes Demo Tape is better than CBL, such a disappointment. Would&#39;ve been cooler if CBL was a surprise joint album with The Weeknd.
Drake&#39;s songs are just so boring that even Drake sounds bored in them
There&#39;s something about that album cover that makes me feel super uncomfortable and I can&#39;t verbalize it.
I agree with your scoring
i don&#39;t understand why people compare drake and kanye at all, drake doesn&#39;t make music he makes a product it&#39;s all business to him, while kanye is genuinely an artist that makes whatever the fuck he wants, it&#39;s two different worlds no comparison to be made
lol the drake fans are going to be pissed off.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=723">12:03</a> ooof, a decent Memphis throwback cannot save this man&#39;s career
When I heard Girls want Girls, I immediately thought That the song is practically a rip off and explicit version of Girls like Girls by Haley Kiyoko… and if it wasn’t for Drake’s slow dance voice and harmonizing, that song would be trash😂
C3rtifi3d Lov3r Boy.
Finally you took a w😂
You have a fantastic way of breaking down your experience and thoughts towards music 👏 <br>I agree wholeheartedly and take huge inspiration for my own work 💪❤️
Melon is prejudiced against lesbians confirmed
W
Hope Drake kept his Damien Hirst receipt.
I feel like Kanye always takes mad risks and makes bold choices on his albums, where Drake always plays it safe. I always appreciate it when artists show confidence and boldness.
Swear to God I&#39;ve heard that car battery line from you before
The music industry is just handing out one publicity opportunity after another for Anthony right now. This is madness.
drake just took a certified L
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=364">6:04</a> “I kinda wanna just like hug a car battery up to my nuts to get some kind of mental stimulation” <br>That was a better bar than drake gave us on the whole damn record
Kanye is terrible. Drake is terrible. Can we stop. Stop. Make it stop.
Please check out GWAR
Melon has spoken, Kanye has won the beef 🥩
Drake is the Call of Duty of hip-hop.
In conclusion donda &gt; clb
I love fountains 😭 tems is such a beautiful singer
muthafuk that album, fuk that single, burn that hard drive… (burn that shit)
yea melon, get his ass
“An indictment of the men of toronto” lol
This record is bad... I listen to maybe 2 songs then I switch to something else. So boring. I&#39;m not really surprised because his last 2 albums haven&#39;t been good. He has great features on other artist&#39;s songs though 👌🏾
Give Simbi a 10 already
The melon has become a WARtermelon
me when i saw the rating: GYYAATTT DAYYUMM
KSI&#39;s album is better than Drake&#39;s album in Anthony&#39;s opinion..And I agree
Where the ye hater at!!
Can&#39;t be more accurate
The only 2 albums worth reviewing from Friday are SIMBI and Usain Bolt&#39;s record! Get the yellow flannel out and give the people what they want!
This has got to be the only honest review on this album at least.<br>Everyone else has this album praised as Gold
kos omak
Pew. Light beef.
Donda = 7<br>CLB = 3<br><br>If Drake and Kanye ended their beef and made a collab album, they might make a 10
🤰🤰🏻🤰🏼🤰🏽🤰🏾🤰🏿
Too many people think experimentation = good music nowadays, maybe I just want to listen to some chart music I can vibe to in the club and not have to think about. I don&#39;t mind donda, i thought it was just a bunch if hit and misses, but too many people are using experimentation to justify it being &quot;good&quot;.
as usual haha
Certified Lesbian Boy
Fck lyrics i listen to enjoy music
I partially disagree with you here. You&#39;re saying that Drake responding now feels unnecessary and outdated, but what if he matured enough to respond only now? Maybe he wanted to prepare the response well enough, so it doesn&#39;t look clumsy?<br><br>And it&#39;s not a valid point that Kanye is better in this beef because he doesn&#39;t mention Drake too much on Donda. Ye basically limited himself talking about anything else than his mother by providing such album title and cover. If he&#39;d speak about Drake on Donda, it feels inconsistent, while Drake speaking about Kanye on CLB is pretty organic and follows album&#39;s narrative.<br><br>Speaking about songs, I mostly value sound, vibe and rapping. Lyrics and background matter less. That&#39;s why I liked tracks Girls Want Girls, Love All, Way 2 Sexy, Yebba&#39;s Heartbreak and No Friends In The Industry.
3/10 for the album art alone
Im satisfied
please review we love you tecca 2
Iyrtitl will forever be my fav drake project it has no skips
This man really put a black sheet over a vinyl for Donda (I think) on his shelf while reviewing CLB
It took immense talent for Drake to make this when he&#39;s clearly bored and uninspired. This may not be the end of the Drake era, but this is the death of the Drake formula.
Drake is just famous for saying the term YOLO. Don’t get the hype really
I’ve never understood why Drake is so popular, especially over the last 3 or 4 albums, but I’m glad more people are seeing it now.
I actually enjoyed the album
Wati he has a donda vinyl
Only nerds don’t like this album
Fantano ur just not a drake enjoyer and its fine
But why do you think so many people listen to Drake? Maybe because he produces enjoyable music for a lot of people? This album is no different. Instrumentals are amazing on the album and he just doing his thing, this is basically what Drake is known for. Some clever lines (some dumb lines as well ngl), good features, and in general lots of tracks that are fun to listen to.<br><br>Anthony, rating that last album from Trippie higher than this one from Drake is just wrong lol. Seems like you just don&#39;t like the artist Drake and don&#39;t care what he produces, and therefore don&#39;t recognize all the positives of the album. <br><br>But hey, everyone&#39;s entitled to their own opinion, just don&#39;t agree with you here what so ever✌🏼
Damn i was expecting at least a 5 or 6
Gotta love that you put the cover of Donda behind you to piss off Drake even more.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=630">10:30</a><br>😀
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=358">5:58</a> LOOOLLLL 💀
Anthony clearly choosing a side in this beef. His opinion on the album seems like he is mad at drake lol
I guess Isaiah should be happy he got a better review than Drake
Waiting for review of album Senjutsu by iron maiden
this album was ass
I haven&#39;t heard a more boring record in years 🥴
Certified Red Flanell Album
Way 2 Sexy is FIRE
It was okay, nothing exciting, but is it really album of the year? That&#39;s one bold statement, Anthony.
Remember when drake fans were saying &quot;features carried on donda&quot;, this is what features carrying looks like drake fans.
Next Drake album:<br>&quot;Everything Was The Same&quot;
Anthony Fantano has to hate on Drake or else he loses half his Subscribers.
Daaaddyyss hoommeeeEe
I thought Donda was very underwhelming. Then I listened to CLB and thought oh god Donda is a masterpiece on comparison 😐
CLB : 3/10<br>DONDA : 7/10<br>now stfu
Melon just handed Drake an L
Travis was way better than thugger durk and keem
car battery
I like drake but this album was straight garbage and so was donda 🤣
A light 3 😭😭😭 CLB really was ass
I’ve disagreed with most of melons album ratings but gotta say I think he’s right on the money for both CLB and Donda
And both artist sent shots on they tapes
I still kinda enjoyed it, I’d give it a light 6
Ah yes No Friends In The Industry ft. Thug, Lil Baby, Nicki Minaj, Lil Durk, Future, Hova, Kid Cudi, 21 Savage, Lil Wayne, Rick Ross and a back end hook from Adidon.
Child lover boy, I really hope Millie Bobby Brown aint bumpin this
Great review as usual, Anthony Fantano 👍
Good review 🤌
i think its funny when people mention kanye reacting to a drake song and vice versa. they both produce two different styles of hiphop and they both great at what they do. so seeing motherfuckers on here hating just to hate is hella corny to me. bet all you hating motherfuckers would ask kanye or drake for a picture if you saw them in person. think about it. you fake asf lol so just sit there, enjoy the music and be quite. ✌🏽
Ye won lol
Yo, drop the Little Simz 10/10 review, you Melon.
Woah, that was brutal
Imagine thinking this is the album of the year 🤡🤡🤡
Lmaoooo
doing more dad bars talking about models doing coke lmaoo
Fantano, got straight to the point and spoke the truth
FINALLY A TAKE U CAN AGREE WOTH FROM Anthony
A Drake video where Melon doesn&#39;t call him Champagne Papi? 😤
Red flannel let&#39;s gooooo
I 100% agree with Mr Fantano 👍🏿
🐻‍❄️
1.
I N
That’s it Kanye won
Your most viewed videos are the ones that included Drake, you got popular off of your hate for Drake. I see you, you break down songs, you take serious notes in your craft as a reviewer. But you&#39;ve become the Skip Bayless to Drake. This album is not Drake&#39;s best work of all time, and for those in the comments to say, &quot;it&#39;s repetitive&quot; or he doesn&#39;t change his flow,  you&#39;re just not a fan of drake because of Kanye or you don&#39;t know music. The album has great production, in terms of the samples that were used, the transitions in some of the songs were good. Drake has always been a diary rapper, so has every rapper in the era of rap at its pinnacle. Kanye was one, Jay-Z, J. Cole, Kendrick. Maybe if you&#39;re looking for a different way of him saying those things can be understandable.  But in my opinion your reviews are nothing new. You&#39;re never aroused by music. It&#39;s lame.
The cover art is so fucking bad
Where&#39;s the Little Simz review melon
Damnnnn that like to dislike ratio is STRONG.
he would&#39;ve given it a 10 if its called &quot;Certified Boy Lover&quot; instead.
Pretty accurate. 🗑
The best part about this, is drakes next album will definitely have a Fantano sneak diss
Didn&#39;t think it was possible to lose more credibility ever since Swans got a 10 🤦🏽‍♂️
is he wearing the same red checked shirt he wore when he talked about Drake&#39;s &quot;Scorpion&quot; album? Dig it
Damn, Anthony really made it through the album already without falling asleep constantly?
Feel bad for Little Simz tbh. She spends months dropping singles for SIMBI only for two much bigger artists to drop much worse albums in the same week.
Wow a 3 that’s crazy lol I agree though
nah it was pretty good.
Certified L Boy would be a better title
Serious questions now need to be asked about the legitimacy of the numbers he achieves for these albums
Forget this and donda. Listen to grip IDFT?
but i love it 😩
Who disliked right away before the video started? 🤪😂
Melon didn’t like it cus drake is a certified lesbian
Did Melon just call the Beatles &quot;chipmunk soul&quot; <br><br>The boomers will not stand for this
&quot;drake cosplay as gangster&quot; is the best way to say how I feel. The roll out of this was longer than It needed to be.... You can&#39;t polish a turd but you can roll it in glitter
RED FLANEL😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=358">5:58</a> Based
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=364">6:04</a> the review overall.
U know u wanna to give this a 0
Donda wins.
Screw you Anthony we bumping Way 2 Sexy 24/7 🥱😤🥵🗣️💯
I liked the cover actually. It&#39;s way better than the typical portrait shot with a logo, something Drake also did quite a few times. And he has put at least any effort into it compared to Kanye pulling a Yeezus again and giving us no artwork at all, although the one teased was pretty cool.
Thank you for saying what we all felt so eloquently.
<b>I think Drake’s career is finally starting to decline.</b> <br>I think he’s gonna have to drop KAMIKAZE in for the people who didn’t like his last album.
The art cover is something I expect future would put for his album cover
Another too long album, trim it down and then just put all the picks on a deluxe or something smh
Certified Lulla by
LMAAAOOO WE WON YEBROS PRAISE CHRIST!
The only track I’m going back for is YEBBA’s heartbreak lol
Anthony, saying “I’m lesbian too” for 16 minutes is not a review.
I love the Donda album cover on the shelf.
&quot;Diarrhea drake&quot; was so mean anthony
Drake has always sounded like he&#39;s ripping himself and others off ..the dude isn&#39;t an artist at all, just a vulture and puppet.
Watching LosPollos seethe and cope to this review was the funniest thing I&#39;ve seen this 3 day weekend
Drake make a 10 track, 40 minute long album challenge.
Drake is a walking L tbh, every year he gets more Ls
girls want girls is super creepy
More Life &amp; Scorpion &gt; Cerlified Lover Boy.
Certified Lullaby
Thank you for calling out the absolutely awful I&#39;m too sexy song
This album is a Certified L, Boy.
thanks melon, now I can like this album!
It was really, really bad lmfao
say that you a melon girl, me too, ayy
Album was so bad we forgot about the cover lol
Dude ur so gay
CERTIFIED LIGHT 3
The album is definitely a grower, but it’s clear melon made up his mind on hating drake this era
yebbas heartbreak is the best song on clb CONFIRMED
you talking about every single song except the best one… I see you
ive already heard DJs playing way 2 sexy at parties
U shitted on every song... even the ones you like. You had a caveat for EVERYTHING❗
I know it&#39;s a meme to call J. Cole boring but holy shit man, I never thought it would be this difficult to make it through a Drake project, I listened to IYRTiTL, Dark Lane and Take Care multiple times no real problem haven&#39;t really listen to Views nor NWtS but idk man this fucking album is a tough trek
“You only live twice is an instant banger” it’s a wannabe just blaze joint, even positive all three were on one similar in the past lmao rehashed ass album
Drake is the &quot;Live, Laugh, Love&quot; of rappers
The song drake leaked was better than this whole project😂
So we’re just gonna blow over his line about Millie Bobby brown ?
it’s not that bad
THATS WHY HES THE MVP
Dreadfully boring views from the 6? Why do people even watch this man&#39;s reviews . I agree on parts of your opinion of clb but that take on views was poor .
You have an emotional biased towards drake😂 like you actually don’t like<br>Him
So basically the album is dog poop.
I felt like I was going crazy when I saw so many people going &quot;how quickly did you realise this was better than Donda&quot; and &quot;man Drake is coming back hard&quot; and I&#39;m like wtf this is boring as hell.<br><br>Shit, I&#39;ve seen multiple people posting polls like &quot;who is the GOAT?&quot; and Drake is winning over Ye like wtf????<br><br>I guess these fools just need a trap beat and some corny bars and they&#39;re sold
I personally enjoyed this album as much as Donda (crazy I know). The main reason I think is that this album is pleasant enough to ear to tolerate and sit through where&#39;s Donda for how many awesome songs there are, there are hooks, singing passages or features that are just excruciating to me (baby keem with that lame ass autotune on praise god or the hook jonah. Just kill me please). I do wish that Drake would come back to IYRTITL days but I accepted the fact that he&#39;s just gonna be playing safe since it doesn&#39;t impact his numbers. Sigh... Feelsbadman. At least Tyler had better album than both of them
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=990">16:30</a> thanks.
Drake is really good at pop rap and that’s about it. I’m really just patiently waiting for new Kendrick
Lolll
This gets a 0/10 just because of the album art
I didn’t like the album either but this is such a shit review
finally someone who hates im too sexy as much as me
Ngl way 2 sexy one of the only songs I like, future sounds so cool on the hook
Glad I’m not the only one who thought this project was a train wreck
🤣
Melon don&#39;t sit here and call that &quot;On your ass like backpockets&quot; line clever cuz I GUARANTEE you if Eminem said that you would SHIT ALL OVER IT. STOP. The only thing I disagree with but everything else you said about this garbage ass album is to a T. Amazing review and the score is ABSOLUTELY what this album deserves. 3 is literally the amount of songs I liked off this project. Unsubscribed.
Damn I figured he wouldn’t like it but I wasn’t expecting him to give it a 3 😂😂
Red Flannel 😅
Drake bout to be the next Nav, mark my words.
That album cover is all of drake&#39;s secret stripper baby mommas.<br>Pusha exposes him Drake then he does this crap lol. Drake a joke.
I’m glad I wasn’t the only one who thought that the entire album just kept harping on Kanye disses it was just beyond petty and the subject got boring quick cause he had 2 tracks plus the album going at him. You made a good point on los’ stream about how it got to him while making the album. Yeah it was Kanye’s fault and you can see that they both have envy for each other. The beef is so complicated, but you can’t knock Kanye cause he did try to make peace with drizzy but he wasn’t having that and stood Kanye up on multiple occasions. Overall it was a garbage album tho that had no emotion and I wish more effort was put into it. Even tho drake sold a lot this album didn’t hit and just goes to show that literally anything he puts out will sell even mediocrity. The off season and Donda are leagues above it,
After listening to this album 20+ times it&#39;s confirmed it&#39;s just not hitting for me. One or Two tracks grew on me but for the most part it&#39;s just missing that &quot;it factor&quot; that all other Drake albums had. imaginatively… Drake flopped. There’s no inspiration on that album. Just an ego-boosted flex of what he did and who said what to him...*reality check* nobody really cares about his repetitive bars, unnecessary tracklist. It’s not good. Numbers don’t equal great music. This has been the same Drake for 8 years and just feels like we&#39;ve been cheated and scammed with the lack of effort.
Certified Light 3
Drake forgot to pay his ghost writer for this album.
Y’all really not that funny in the c comments
You just made AK cry for at least a month
I’m loving the like to dislike ratio; a 3 on this garbage album is much deserved. Most disappointed I’ve been for an album in my life.
<b>ok but you still gave MBDTW a 6</b>
Accurate score
Never been more happy to see a red flannel 🤣
Dark lanes was miles better than this
Donda paid you to be extra mean on this one, eh melon?
Donda&gt;CLB
Is the vinyl in the back covered in a black tarp to reference donda?
Bro said certified snoozer I’m crying
Navy Blue - Navy&#39;s Reprise for the next one Melon
It&#39;s really hard to take any of the songs seriously with that dumbass album cover staring at me
One of the worst HipHop albums of all time
if you combine this with Donda, they are a 10
This album was garbage. But scorpion was worse imo
Really didnt expect Drake to clap back at the deadbeat dad narrative by coming out as a lesbian, but good for him.
This album was so uninspiring and that I had to listen to Donda to clean out the trash that came into my ears
Drake really has become too complacent and thinks everyone will eat up anything he drops. Which is weathering and showing not to be true after these couple releases.
It was a certified L b.
I see red flannel I know it’s an instant click
KSI has unironically released a better album than Drake this year.
People arguing over which is better Donda or CLB, but Little Simz had the best album this week
I didn’t say donda is better but he did ….
Why wasn’t Laugh Now, Cry Later on here?
That lesbian line too hard
3? 3 Melon? That&#39;s a not good piece of hot garbage!<br><br>NOT GOOD OUT OF TEN<br>REVIEW IT AGAIN!
Certified Melon Boy 🍈🤓
When the Simz review dropping
You didn&#39;t have to give it such a low score just because Dababy and Marlyn Manson weren&#39;t on it.
That album cover is just the worst thing ever.
FACTS
He gave both AOTP and Dissimulation by KSI a higher ranking than CLB lmao
Damn niggas got top comments wit hella likes fast asf Lmfaoo
Drake been taking Ls ever since Pusha T exposed him. <br><br>He wasn&#39;t lying when he called himself a lesbian
We&#39;ve all been waiting for this 🤣🤣🤣
Red flannel days are my fav
It was all down hill after Champagne Papi, honestly
W review
Your reviews officially suck
worst review you’ve ever put out
expected
ngl, a 3 seems alot better than what he reviewed it. even admitted the better tracks were only really good within the context of the record.
I bet if all the pregnant emojis were white this would get a higher rating.
Donda is the clear winner here
Anthony is Drunk with power<br>He’s practically giving away these 10s
The album cover is genuinely the worst ive ever seen
JIK &gt; CLB lmao kanye twitter about to feast
Chapters would be awesome mr. melon
Thank now I can finally hate drake and love kanye in public
I&#39;m a Drake fan and still agree with everything that was said. At the end of the day, if you&#39;re not focused on your craft, it will show. Kanye, though I don&#39;t actively seek to listen to, at least put all of his effort into his work. Not the beef. Just goes to show you that if you focus on you, everything else will work itself out.
Imagine giving this a 3 and Donda a 7 😂😂😂 Donda is a 4 at best
Drake gave no effort towards making this a great album... I give it a 2!
Melon, you can’t just call Drake a “deadbeat muthafucka playing border patrol” and call that a valid criticism
Is that black block on the shelf behind him supposed to be the album cover for DONDA, at this point every black block I see is DONDA🤣
Drake is indulging in too much feminine energy I mean look at the cover nuff said
Melon you can’t just call drake the n word for 15 minutes and than give him 3 points come on
I agree. unsubbed.
Drake is the Keemstar of the rap industry
Fountains is the best song on the album
drake is O V E R R A T E D
Clever job Fantano making the Kanye and Drake scores combined equal what Little Simz is getting
Certified boy lover
Wish me luck guys I’m going full screen
it seems like fantano just hates drake in general lol
Bruh Fantano actually managed to completely miss on this one
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=782">13:02</a> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=802">13:22</a> this what people don’t understand  when we talk about comparisons. Charts don’t mean 💩 when it comes to longevity. Love both artists but this is facts.
Thank god this got a red flannel. I’d give it a NOT GOOD
the only review i am satisfied with
I like fountains I have to admit
im so glad he called him out for that hack ass im a lesbian too line lol i heard that shit and was like boooo, corny, played out, boooooo
The most damming aspect of this album is it sounds like it could&#39;ve dropped 4 years ago and no one would&#39;ve batted an eye.
Should have been a Not Good
drake just keeps re releasing the same exact songs he’s already made packaged in recycled material with a “new” coat of paint… i guess the album art really fits in that way. same exact generic theme, sound, writing, that everyone knows what it is, just in different colors lmao.
Did he said that Travis didn&#39;t try so hard on his feat ? Bro went all the way what are you talking about
As soon as I seen the red flannel I knew this was going to be a good one lol.
Final Score: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=992">16:32</a>, a Light 3.
yessssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
Ahhh I miss the take care days
I dont agree, I loved the new Men I Trust record, it definitely didn’t deserve the red flannel😡. Its so soothing and spacey, cant agree on this one Melon.
It’s official Kanye won
never have i almost fallen asleep, standing up, whilst listening to an album, until now
Boy oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy... here goes nothing!
Hear me out. What if, Finethony Winetano is the same person as Nothony Waytano
Red flannel coming in clutch
I think this is Drake’s worst album. Not a single song was added to my playlist…
Way 2 sexy is the most divisive song Drake has dropped in a while lol
Everyone is okay when trashing Drake. Lol but everyone is mad when you trash Kendrick 💀
Drake needs a ksi feat 😂
If you hate CLB so much, why do you have the unreleased vinyl behind you?
Dondaa won baby
CLB is definitely trash
The red flannel 😳😳😳
That boy get no pussy
Drake being in your top 55 rappers of all time it&#39;s a spit on the face of everyone who didn&#39;t made the cut, melon boy!
Anthony just because u read it as certified boy lover and not certified lover boy doesn’t mean u can take 7 points off him due to ur mistake 😔
Views is a classic idiot
<b>I knew the album was gonna be mid as soon as I seen the cover on it</b>
Lmaoo girls want girls is a hit though for sure but it would’ve been bigger had it dropped 7 years ago cuz the concept is dated
Just like that the Melon lord gives Donda the belt.  Drake fans cant C the L they B taking.
That album art gave me pure cringe
Donda
I just came from hearing u review of views and I realized lyrics fade in relevancy over the years but hooks and beats stay coz I swear as a Kendrick fan I don&#39;t remember his most lyrical lines only flow and hooks and drake creates lasting hooks and lines
3 was generous IMO
why didnt u shave a heart into your hair?
the most obvious 3 ever. absolutely everyone saw this coming.
Drake&#39;s red before SIMBI&#39;s yellow.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=993">16:33</a> &lt;&lt;&lt;what you’re all here for
ahhh, been waiting for this! just what I thought, even though I said the score would be a 5 AT BEST. but that’s too generous for melon, of course.
It&#39;s Not Good
W
3 is too high.
numbers ain’t lying rn.. 🤷🏾‍♂️
Drake hater
The proof is in the features. Kanye’s album has incredible features and yet he is not outshined in his own right ever in his album. Drake has mediocre features but every feature murders him.
this guy just destroyed all the drake fans and with factsssss
Might have to unsubscribe
Intro is pretty good in my opinion
“Say that you a lesbian girl me too” really took me back to middle school, and even back then we found that joke corny as shit
Fantano be like “this albums kinda boring 3/10 :/“
Drake took a huge L. What happened to this man? You thought you would compete with Kanye? Drakes new album is boring. This dude nailed the review. I’m a huge drake fan. This isn’t it. Fact is if he didn’t have beef with Kanye, his numbers would suck. The second day numbers are a fall off. Facts are if Kanye made his record 15 tracks or so it would be a classic. It’s ahead of its time. It’s hip hops The Fragile. A record also bloated that was not appreciated until well after it’s release. I was so disappointed in Drake and so happy about Kanye record, even though Kanye record has its big flaws. Drake fell the TF off hard!
disagree melon. This album had fantastic production and I think he did his thing on every track pretty much. Not that it should even really be compared to Donda, but if I were going to, i&#39;d say Ye was outshined about a trillion times over in his album considering nearly every track on it had major features.
Melon has spoken bois.<br>Donda (7) &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; CLB (3)
easily one of the best reviews you&#39;ve ever done, Melon Man. as much as i love to watch you praise great music, this red flannel was special. you&#39;re the best, you&#39;re the best!<br><br><br>also way 2 sexy goes hard literally my favorite song 🤫🔥
Why does drake keep loosing friends? 🤔 cause he’s a dork. Shut up bro.
How could his least favorite track be the best song on the album
Even as a Drake fan I can&#39;t excuse the lesbian bar
Drake can never finish any of the beefs he starts, lol.
The first few songs had me thinking that it was going to be a decent album, but damn, it was a slog.
You say you’re busy but you listen to music for a living
drake makes music for people
Better than Scorpion, More life, don’t count dark demo tapes, personally to my ears better than views. But after that doesn’t come close to IYRTTL or any project before. I also get a playlist/AI Computer generated decision making to create a good but generic non passionate nothing was the same/views. Also needs a new production team for sure, and space out projects years in time and limit it to 15 tracks.
Da baby is a rapper
Drake has been using the same blueprint for years and now people are realizing it’s recycled. He would rather keep it safe and make radio hits for the club. While Ye tries to push boundaries and make new sounds in music. A person who evolves will survive time while those who don’t get left behind.<br><br>DONDA - Light 7<br><br>CLB - Light 3<br><br>Something we all can agree on, thanks melon
Thank you
Well this settles it Donda &gt; clb
Kanye West: rapper, producer, artist, presidential candidate vs Drake.
🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Kanye deserves an 8 at least after giving this album this “good” of a review. You give Kanye a harder review because you know how great of an artist he is. That time will not affect Kanye of being an genius to the time. While drake will phase out as having a couple of hits and die out in our next generation as a couple hit wonder.
Way 2 sexy is so cringe I couldn’t get through it
I like Drake more than a lot of people and I’d give it like a 5.5-6 out of 10. Drake just doesn’t take any risks artistically. That’s the difference between him and Kanye
Certified LESBIAN TOO Girl
As much as I hate this album, that Cudi track man... Cudi fucking killed it I fucking love that song
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=580">9:40</a> Melon, N 2 Deep instrumental sounds like an “Astroworld” leftover bc it is really a sample of UGK’s “Get Throwed” who are Houston legends like Travis Scott. the title “N 2 Deep” is also a reference nod to another H Town legend DJ Screw with a mixtape of the same name. He’s really just giving its props to Houston
I have a small perception that Drake aint all too intelligent at times lol
Way 2 Sexy is fucking fire
This album was so damn average and “drake” it isn’t even fun to make fun of
N 2 Deep&#39;s intro flow is entirely stolen from Craig David who is credited absolutely nowhere on the song
Even Ksi dropped an album that got a higher rating than Drake lmao 😂
did anthony just reveal hooking car battery up to his nuts as his fetish
Believe it or not, but Peppa Pig actually ghostwrites the whole CLB album.
With a album name of CLB I really thought it would’ve been a album for the ladies doing that baby making R&amp;B Hiphop flows and showing off his vocal ranges but Nope, we got this shit 😬…
Wow Thanks for the review Fantano! I was about to form my own opinion, Phewwww
The pregnant Sonic cover art was better.
the fact that melon finished this record within 4 days is already surprising
Raise my mind is Drakes true style tf you mean Abel, Abel who?
If Drake didn&#39;t have his features on this, it&#39;ll would&#39;ve gotten a instant NOT GOOD..
Yeah man CLB was average. Not to dick ride Kanye but Donda was much much better. Drake can’t stop taking L’s from Ye
Red flannel😳
wow I thought it would at least get a 4!  that 3 stings 😂.  Team DONDA we win y&#39;all, WYa??
so if you add this and Donda together it&#39;s a 10/10
Anthony must not know how hard battery terminal cables clamp down... Those things would turn your junk into &quot;Nut dust&quot;
Yeah I wanted this to be good, but drake isn’t creative in an artistic way he can do what he doesn’t but he ain’t doing anything new like Kanye, that’s what I got from the whole situation, try to be more artistic with my music
i’m not even close to a drake fan, but i’ve been watching your reviews since drake’s views album. back then it was kinda satisfying to see you rip into drakes albums but he’s had so many bad reviews i kinda just wish the guy would wind down and make a focused album for once.
saying that YOU are a certified lover boy for 15 minutes doesn&#39;t count as a review anthony
Melon , saying you&#39;re Way 2 Sexy for this world, for 18mins is not a review
is it just me, or does melon talk a lot less about the mixing of tracks. On Donda and CLB it wasnt fantastic throughout
Thinking about where Drake could’ve gone after If You’re Reading This if he just tried new things more often
I actually agree with the review 👀💀
I gave it an 8.5
Very cathartic maybe mr.bigshot will bring his a game next time and take his fans more seriously. (I’m not one of them I don’t fw drake js iknow drake fans)
Arrested Development is a good show
How zen of drake to be so present
I did not like the album too but damn. A light 3? Isn’t that almost a strong 2 😂 nah..
Say what you well about the rest of the album but Champagne poetry is a certified banger.
I don&#39;t think he likes the new Drake album
he put kanye on the rack
Jokes aside ,I think this album is better than his last 3 albums. It&#39;s by no means at all a great album, but it&#39;s definitely more tolerable than Scorpion.<br><br>My main issue with the album is that at this point in Drake&#39;s career he should have grown topically. Drake is 35yrs old and instead of getting more interesting and telling us about things we want to hear like his relationship with his kid, his relationship with the mother of his kid. I don&#39;t like brining up the past but Drake could have even spoke up his relationships with his exes (Nicki or Rihanna).<br><br>But instead of getting that , we have a GROWN MAN making songs about being a lesbian, feeling Way 2 Sexy, we have typical R&amp;B drake and one track that sounds like One Dance.<br><br>All in all I&#39;m just disappointed that Drake refuses to be more than what we already know him for.
This is a Kanye fans wet dream rn
I am a drake fan<br>But i agree with light 3<br>Clb is a sleeper
I generally thought that, because Drake&#39;s beef with Kanye and the fact that we&#39;ve waited quite awhile for this that we would be getting one of Drake&#39;s best albums or at least something that can go head to head with Donda. Sadly this album isn&#39;t anything more that your typical, generic Drake album that we&#39;ve already heard before.
JJ GOT A BETTER REVIEW, YES 🤣🤣
Melon got Donda on vinyl in the back
Made popcorn, then seen your review was finally uploaded. Great timing!
Drakes worst album by far
More like Certified Fucc Boi
CBL (BOY LOVER) TRASH!
i know Drake will watch this at some point and i smile because of that
Bruh chipmonked squirell 💀
Way2Melon
Drake told us on Lord Knows who he doesnt make music for. Take a quick look at this guy and that should tell you all you need to know.
I agree with everything but cmon IMY2 was sick
For me this album is very mid. (Mid is not bad). He just hasn’t grown as an artist since 2016 with views and it sucks coming from someone as polarizing as drake.
haha drake doo doo
DAMN. Light 3. Is shutdown ehh?
This could possibly be (one of) the most awaited albums of this year that ended up being so boring and disappointing, it was acceptable for me but still it felt so long.<br>Maybe Laugh Now Cry Later made me think that we would get that kind of Drake, honestly I was almost falling asleep during the first songs. Wrapped up, I didn&#39;t feel this
Drake probably that lesbian bar was the funniest shit he’s heard in years so he held Lil Baby at gunpoint till he spit some fire.
Am I the only one here who turns my brain off when I listen to someone like drake? I don’t listen to this the same way I listen to To Pimp a Butterfly and I don’t see why people are discussing this kind of album like that, like bro just turn your brain off and enjoy a song like I’m too sexy, not saying you gotta love every song regardless though, to each their own
yikes
Thank you Anthony I no longer enjoy this album.
Drake fans are used to your garbage reviews on his albums!
Melon got that early Donda vinyl in the background
I didn&#39;t like the album. I disagree about Views though, that was good
LMAOOOOO, YES FANTANO
kanye aint push, jus cos he got beat by push don&#39;t mean there aint shots left for ye
Well done Fantano but a 3 a bit harsh bro
The 12 pregnant women looking at Fantano like its his baby
Damn, crazy that melon didn’t identify the N 2 Deep instrumental as a sample of “get throwed”
the accuracy in this review is staggering. 🥴
Trash album
I can&#39;t believe Anthony said deez nuts in a review
It really is a hot pile of garbage. I stopped listening like half way. It&#39;s so bad
lmaoooo
Seriously? You gave this a 3 just because he’s lesbian? It’s 2021 Anthony 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Oh shit… lol.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=534">8:54</a> not surprising this is the same dude that was giving “boy advice” to Millie Bobby Brown over text when she was like 15.
I BET HE REGRETS SAYING “NO NEW FRIENDS”… Maybe one of them could’ve convinced him to change his sound and gain an extra audience.
I FUCKING KNEW HE&#39;D GIVE IT A 3 LMFAOOOOO<br><br>I personally gave it a 2 out of 10, but I for the most part agree with this rating
I don’t know how people can enjoy listening to this album. By far the worst album of the year
SOS MULA ALBUM REVIEW?????????????
Hello Travis Scott
Why would you put pregnant woman on an album cover. 😕
Too right
It all makes sense now. It wasn’t a heart in Drakes hair it was a 3.
Nice to know that Lemon ascended from testicle stomping to electrocution! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=361">6:01</a>
this was a very entertaining video melon man
melon got the donda vinyl before kanye announces and cancels it twice
Really dropped the ball rating it donda chant/10
I love watching you shit on drake
Garbage to Mid Tier album. Drake has and can do better
As a neutral observer to the drake vs ye beef can say just from listening to both albums a couple times that jonah off the grid and hurricane are at another level compared to any of the best tracks from CLB
I think even deep down you know this album deserved the Not Good bomb drop.
No way is scorpion better than this album
Agree with the whole review, but...you <b>liked</b> that Beatles sample on the opening track? That was one of the worst parts of the entire project for me, almost made me shut the thing off within 30 seconds.
i am a drake Fan. and I LOVE CLB😍😍😍
It’s confirmed, the melon hates lesbians
This cover deserves a 0 but the music is 6.5/10
Certified Boy Lover
Drake need to take a break.
History repeats itself
When young thug said “my neck baguettey, red diamonds, spaghetti” that really hit me
To be honest drake sounds unhappy on this album. He’s still not over the pusha T beef. The whole Kanye beef stresses him out. He can’t find any real friends or women.
W rating
He’s back with the W takes! I thought he’d never return
Anybody else see LosPollos’s reaction to this?😂😂😂
Thanks for summing up pretty much all my frustrations about the album! :) <br>I defo feel that Drake has a bad case of trapped development! <br><br>PS: You&#39;re still not forgiven for giving a 6 to MBDTF!
your opinion on this album instantly became irrelevant once you said YEBBA&#39;S HEARTBREAK was on of the best tracks on the album smfh
Light 3 might be a little too high.
The car battery line…ouch.
TikTok kids in shambles
Feels like there’s Drake before IYRTITL and there’s Drake after, and outside of a few catchy tracks, it’s hard to listen to his work after. It’s a very bloated discography. You have to wonder if the dude cares about what his artistic legacy is going to be in music, esp since at one point he said he’d be retired from music by now.
This video a piece of history
So if we go back to the album trailer when it was suppose to come out in January, you can hear drake taking bits and pieces from his entire discography, putting it all together on 1 project. But something went wrong and it wasn&#39;t fully fleshed out and I think his kanye beef played a major part in this. I think midway through he decided to troll everyone, thus the terrible artwork, as to say, &quot;im going to meme on yall and still sell more than yall&quot;. Lately I feel like drake is making moments, not full albums
Drake’s fans: 🤬🤬🤬 unsubscribe
Any album called that is going to be shite. Imagine being that self indulgent to actually name it that. Embarrassing from a fully grown man.
If you keep up with Anthony you know that Dude jus flat out doesn’t like drake. Similar to skip bayless/Lebron he can’t do no right lol. His opinion tho.
U a Bozo 🤦🏽‍♂️
Wnthony Wantano
did I miss something - why did melon suddenly start filming in front of a poorly edited green screen?
N 2 You was the only song I slightly liked, only because the instrumental feels the most different from the rest.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Whew thank fk, my opinion was correct this time
I can get with this take. This album ass as hell
You only live twice is the only song worth giving a listen.
IT&#39;S NOT GOOD <br>0/10
This Drake guy sounds kinda wack ngl
Finally, someone that admits that the album was not good.
Certified “I kinda wanna just like hook a car battery up to my nuts just to get some kind of mental stimulation” Boy
Melon, saying &#39;Certified Boy Lover&#39; for 17 minutes isnt a review.
Don’t faze me bro
Yebba&#39;s song is easily the best on the album. The rest isn&#39;t very interesting.
Well yeah the Album was Bad.<br>It has songs I like, it has songs that are alright, but the bad songs it has are so bad they make me mad
Fair Trade only decent song, the rest is just boring shit. Dark Demo Tapes was way better
Amazing that all the people I know felt exactly the same about this fucking waste of an album
I hope those prego emojis give birth to a big fat ZERO.
No comment on Yebba&#39;s Heartbreak huh, Melon?
Cool I don’t care, give us the SIMBI review
good start, B.A.A.D end
Drake best rapper ever , you just a hater
Certified F*ckboi would have been a more suitable name for this album.
KSI had a better album than DRAKEEE! 😂
Drake got a lower score than jesus is king wow
I gotta give our Melon credit. The same energy he felt on MBDTF and its review is the same energy he feels on Certified Lover Boy review.
Great review Anthony Bantano, definitely agree with the 3. I like the song with Ty Dolla $ but the rest was just classic Drake which bores me
Melon’s just jealous that drake is able to shave a heart into his haircut
when is he reviewing the men i trust album?
Drake might be the most overrated rapper ever
Overall i think this album&#39;s major criticism is how soulless it is. Feels like  it was made for sake of it, without artistic interest in it. Drake hasn&#39;t changed his sound or had evolution,  except that pusha t and hiding a child thing which is just pathetic at this point. Instead of using fatherhood in a mature manner, he just used it as satire. I&#39;m okay with bad album, kanye had JiK, but that at least showed kanye&#39;s religious side, showed his growth, it gave new dimension to Kanye&#39;s life. This album doesn&#39;t do any of that. Drake made a soulless album, which is just disgrace.
huge W for us ye fans
Following the mediocre release of Scorpion we get Certified Lover Boy their were signs of what to expect from the album with its prerelease rollout with a laughingly bad album cover and a release of cringe inducing merch to go along side with the most embarrassing quotes on them. This was by far the worst LP released from Drake. Whereas we have gotten very mediocre projects in recent years including Views and Scorpion. Certified Lover Boy is a truly bad album. One that feels very bloated just for the sake of streaming numbers. Your main focus as an artist especially one who has been able to financially achieve what Drake has is to create the best body of work you possibly can. Not to release a bloated track list just for the sake of streaming numbers it’s truly pathetic to see artists especially of this caliber to sacrifice the quality of an LP just for more streams and is hopefully a trend that will end soon. With that said we see no growth from Drake here. Just the recycled style he has used for years but this time far less entertaining. Filled with cringey bars, uninspired performances, and tracks that sound very phoned in by drake. Drake has been heavily accused of using ghostwriters in the past but I have a feeling they were used seldom to none here with truly awful bars throughout. Drake gets constantly outshined by features here which is sometimes a good thing but is far too often the case on this project. Before the release of the album Drake took to restarting a beef with Kanye West one that feels he started for clout with his new album releasing. The beef got more intense with the realization that both Kanye and Drake were both releasing albums within a week apart. It looks like Drake will be winning the numbers game which he is great at. But when it comes down to the quality of music, Donda was a far better project. Drake even took to leaking a unreleased Donda track featuring Andre 3000 as a proclaimed diss towards Kanye. Much to his dismay the unfinished track sounds better than most of the tracks on Certified Lover Boy. So hopefully the next time Drake releases a project he’ll not focus on beef but on actually making a good album because this was very far from it. In conclusion Certified Lover Boy is another Drake album that we continue to see on the trajectory of loss of quality of music overtime only this time we see a more big loss of quality than usual, if we’ll see this pattern keep on continuing we’ll remember Drake as an artist who made some catchy hits and solid first projects but also an artist who refused to take risks and chose to stay with the same repetitive formula that never evolved until it was ran into the ground. I’m feeling a light 3 out of 10 on this project.
Here before 1k dislikes
A 3 is too generous. This album is hot garbage.
Still repping the Donda vinyl in the background Melon, very jealous.
Fantano upset just cause Drake didn’t buy a ridge wallet
i actually like the album a lot
I think the premise of  ‘Get Along Better’ is drake having a conversation with an Ex where drake’s POV lies in the verses and the Ex speaking out of the chorus. Pretty creative song writing if that was the intention.
So it’s basically facts that KSI&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Drake
Anthonys just mad that Drakes a lesbian and he hasn&#39;t hit on him yet
Anthony you are aware PURE SOULS and OK OK are both drake disses right? Not too sure if Kanye singing Like drake or him referencing drake track names throughout are disses. If anyone was obsessed in this beef it’s Kanye.
&quot;I wanna hook a car battery up to my nuts just to get some mental stimulation.&quot; - Anthony Fantano, 2021
Let’s go baby drake dead donda better pack it up boys we won
R Kelly&#39;s team would have to see my nutz and take me to court--I&#39;m sorry. I would not even formally credit him for his song <b>faintly</b> being behind some vocals I sampled. I listened with my soul and couldn&#39;t even pick up R Kelley&#39;s music.<br><br>EDIT: let me take that bass out my voice. I caught it on another listen. Completely understandable.
Strong 0
I couldn&#39;t agree with you more Fantano. If CLB &amp; Donda were the prime example of musical creativity in 2021, then one couldn&#39;t be blamed for saying we are culturally dead.
Fantano just hates drake. Simple as that
Drakes early work didn&#39;t inspire The Weeknd, it was the other way around with Take Care
kinda judged drake a bit to much i thought this was about the music
I honestly forgot that Drake was on Sicko Mode when listening to this
When the fuck did Drake ever inspire The Weeknd, Fantano?
Nah fam Way 2 Sexy is the best prework out song ever made
Melon finally has the W
I liked this review until you took your clothes off and begged a drake cardboard cutout to be the album cover
Your melon is not around your flannel is not around
Anthony, are you drunk reviewing albums now? I only ask because I understood &amp; felt this fully being completely drunk @ midnight TX time. My boy since 2011 🤙
ksi is better than drake
How does the album shelf work? I seem to see Donda up there?
Lil Wayne’s verse was the only part I enjoyed
No way
Donda isn’t good.
The album is 7/10 for me. Drake&#39;s albums have been TRASH...since Views, the effort he put in CLB is praiseworthy. Another thing I&#39;ll say is that Fantano is the best at telling it like it is, Goddamn. If I ever need to see past an artist&#39;s facade I just need to re-watch this review. I disagree with the rating but I agree with the Fantano&#39;s criticism of Drake as a person and as an artist.
certified boy lover
Finally a Fantano review we can all agree on
We notice that vinyl Melon 👀👀😂😂
what a boring album, yawned it away
Certified Boy Lover
Been waiting since Friday for this
The 3 God 🙏
nah he tweakin
Certified Lover Boy review from a certified soy boy 10/10
This album makes views look like a masterpiece in comparison.
The plain black &quot;vinyl&quot; in the back is INCREDIBLE attention to detail
“This sounds like a track Drake could’ve dropped 5 years ago”. That’s the only line you need from the video honestly.
L
The cover art is awful
Kanye West has won 🥇
Kanye fans seeing the red flannel: 😈😈
RESUBSCRIBED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Thougt the lesbian-line was about drake ignoring a lack of consent from a lesbian
“In 2021 I’m not excited to see Drake cosplay as a gangster” <br><br>sheesh
Kanye wins
I was listening to this album while doing some spreadsheets at work and I found the mundanity of table calculations to be more exciting than listening to this 90minute sleeping aid (save for some features, which carried drake hard)
Oh man the drake fans aren&#39;t going to like this one lol
The lesbian line is going over people&#39;s heads. Its Drakes admission he is actually a ftm.
TSU felt like it was gonna&#39; slap! I enjoyed the slow open of the guy talking and I liked Drake&#39;s flow but he said a whole lot of nothing for me. Thought I&#39;d get a compelling narrative.
I would give it a light 2/10...first Drake album I struggled to listen too...11 tracks in and was like when does it end 😭 .....
Hoped we would get the simz review first but this oughta be fun
Uh oh, red
I think the biggest frustration with Drake is that the guy actually has a nice flow and a decent pen game when he can be bothered, but he’s so focused on being a pop star when he could have been potentially a rap legend. I think the biggest issue with CLB, apart from the incredibly lazy name, cover art and merchandise, is that he’s not even hit the mark with his pop songs, there’s no Passionfruit, no Nice for What, no God’s Plan, no Hotline Bling which you can normally absolutely guarantee he’ll pop up with and nail. No Friends in the Industry, 7am on Bridle Path and a couple of others around the second half just about save this album from absolute disaster for me
Donda&gt;clb
Hot garbo, Ye Won🙏
I wish Anthony didn’t wear the red flannel on all the shit albums cus it’s a good color on him.
DONDA &gt; CLB. I actually felt the artistry listening to Donda. CLB has some slick bars here and there but I didn’t feel anything listening to it. Music needs to make you feel.
Literally blinded fucking viewpoint all because some one is at the top. Actually TRY to take the album in.
Waiting for pusha T to like this video
Waiting for the west side Gunn album review
To put it in perspective, Kanye made MBDTF at 33. Drake made CLB at 34. Don’t ever compare Drake to Kanye artistically.
Drake you need to fire that ghostwriter pleaaase! This aint it dawg!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=311">5:11</a> <br>You know why he couldn&#39;t finish strong Anthony. Like you said, he&#39;s uninspired.
The Pepsi line was good tho
“In 2021 I guess I’m just not really excited to hear Drake cosplay gangster” 😭😭🤣🤣
Drake peaked in 2015. Yeah, I said it!
That album cover looks like shit
Insecure haters are mad that a lot of these tracks will be bumping at the parties they don’t go to
can&#39;t wait for needle drop hating drake for 10mins pt 2
Thank you Anthony for not ass kissing 😄
Way 2 Sexy is a hilariously terrible song. Who The hell thought that sample was a good drake beat LMFAO... DRAKE
He put Yebba&#39;s heartbreak on his favourite tracks because Drake isn&#39;t on it. Damn.
&quot;What top 5s you smokin&#39; on Kendrick!??<br><br>My top 5 is: <br>DRAKE<br>DRAKE<br>DRAKE<br>DRAKE<br>DRA--😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴&quot;<br><br>~DJ Akademiks, 2021
drakethony grahamtano
And all the Kanye fans rejoiced into the night. The end…
Certified boy lover EEEEYYYYYY
has yebbas heartbreak in favorite tracks <br>&gt;doesn’t even mention it at all<br>LOL😭😭😭
Melon you are wrong
It’s official: Donda &gt; CLB
Deez
L + Ratio&#39;d + don&#39;t care + You&#39;re White
Me: “I really only fuck with Way 2 Sexy”<br>Anthony: “FUCKING EMBARRASSING!!!”
Drake is so lame, he never pushes the boundaries and always plays it so safe because he knows his music will sell. I&#39;m also not really a fan of how much he talks about his power over women and him liking 18 year old girl (even though he&#39;s 36 and has a child, cringe)
He’s still wearing the donda cover on his shirt
This album is just so formulaic and not even musical, it doesn’t matter about the content of the music at this point. It was clearly made just to run the numbers and nothing more.
😂damn, I knew most people would hate this album,it really deserves its amount of skips. Having said that though,this album,to me is more of a guilty pleasure😅; I don&#39;t hate it as much as most people do really it has a good number of decent songs in my opinion–enough for me to have a soft spot for it. It&#39;s more of a strong 5 for me but you make a valid argument too.<br><br>Edit: This review was a good roast though 😂
your the goat anthony! thank you for giving me my opinion!
Whilst listening to this album I said to myself, aloud, oh no, this is bad, I do not like drake at all
I feel like they released just for the sake of pride, but yeah both are dogwater
“This song is so boring that it makes me want to hook a car battery up to my nuts to feel some kind of stimulation” <br><br>This is top 10 melon quotes
Is Anthony on a green screen or are my eyes buggin
&quot;Drake is a certified lover of boys&quot; - Anthony Fantano
As soon as drake called himself a lesbian i turned it off and havent gone back to it lmao dude is a cornball
Can we talk about how Olivia Rodrigo released a better record than Drake 💀
Preach
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE
It comforts me that so many people share similar views to me on this album.
You got to hand it to drake though, he has been consistently ass for years
damn was expecting a 5
I&#39;m sorry Melon, but repeatedly screaming &quot;certified lesbian boy&quot; for 17 minutes isn&#39;t a review
How does this guy give KSI a 5 and drake only 3
We love seeing Drake slander
Free Smoke Free Smoke (but keep it classy)<br>No Friends in the Industry (but I can leak other people&#39;s music)
This is the worst critique I have heard Mr. Fontano go in on... lol 😂  He really hated this album to were he will hook a battery to the family jewels to get a better feeling about the music.  Smh
I really don’t understand why some artists seem so complacent in making the same music. I understand the business aspect and such, but drakes at a point where he can create any kind of album he wishes and it’ll get plays either way. He may get a huge pay day with this album. And may find gratitude in just making music for certain people and norms etc. However, he’ll never be seen as a “GOAT” to me, because there’s not much versatility or anything challenging about his music; or at-least not anymore.
Couldn’t agree more the album was bad for drakes level
while the world changes around me, fantano’s hatred for drake keeps me close to the ground 🤧
Yall hatin af, I watch fantano regularly and agree with a lot his opinions but melon should give a re-listen to this project and just see that drake is in his bag so effortlessly and shows why he the greatest commercial rapper/singer but yet can still make songs that show a versatility instead of straight pop/rap hits
&quot;So goddamn boring, that while I&#39;m listening to it I kinda wanna just like hook a car battery up to my nuts just to get some kind of mental stimulation.&quot; SO WE&#39;RE JUST GOING TO IGNORE THAT??
ok can we get a dawn of chromatica review now pls &lt;3
So does this make CLB Drakes worst record?
Drake took one of the biggest Ls in music history.
Views was miles better than this
Really didn’t like it when fantano said “my nuts” it was unpleasant
Its semi rare that i like a drake album as a whole, but usually theres a  couple of standout bangers-imo this album didnt even really have that which is sad
3 is generous Melon
Nah Ksi got a better rating than Drake
You should review the evolution of tears by the gentle men. All of the songs on that album are 10s in my opinion
Splendid review
L take
Lol ksis album was better than drake well done melon smashed it
I was waiting a not good :(
BEAUTIFUL REVIEW EVERYTHING YOU SAID WAS FACTS
Kanye&#39;s constant experimentation and evolution with his music really exposes how &quot;safe&quot; Drake can be from one album to the next.
A lot of the songs sounded like Drake gave like no effort.
Drake seriously needs to take a break for at least 3 years, he&#39;s just releasing over forced music
Papis home is the best song. 👌
I can&#39;t believe melon says him and drake are both lesbians now
Please review the new Shang Chi Soundtrack by 88rising!
I know why he didn&#39;t like Way 2 Sexy 👀
Ya I thought there’s no growth on this album. Feature and Samples carried it, had a strong start with Champagne Poetry but got boring, listened to 3 songs at a time as they sounded the same. Eventually got to the end and was left kinda.... meh
Worst thing about this album is that only 3 songs have replay value and the rest get worse with each relisten. 1st, 6th and 11th grow but the rest stay the same as Drake or like his discography, worsen overtime. <br><br>Also no hit songs, wow. Fair Trade is his best bet but he&#39;s promoting Way 2 Sexy... why? Video is nice but song will never enlighten me for how bad it is.
Rating the album a 10 because you are a certified boy lover is not a review, Anthony.
Melon knows he sings &quot;say that you a lesbian, girl, me too” when he gets his pedicures
Man talks about every song being boring and the same then says N 2 Deep can&#39;t decide what sort of song it wants to be bc drake switched up the beat...<br><br>Fr this guy a clown
This whole album is background music
Melon you can&#39;t just give drake a 3 because there are 3 columns of pregnant girls. That&#39;s not a review.
Is that DONDA in the background or am I trippin? LOL
I know we need to go for the views but much rather hear you talk about the new Ka &amp; Little Simz than Kanye &amp; Drake.
It’s the same shit we getting from him for years
Future’s line about bitches fucking him for that AP is the best part of the album
Melon doesn’t like this album because he’s not a lesbian like Drake
Both of ksis albums are highter than this overhyped album which is supposedly better than Donda🤣
A rare moment: I agree with Melon on this review
I think it&#39;s cool That melon did a review on an album i couldn&#39;t even finish awake.
Certified Melon Boy
So KSI is better than Drake now
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=630">10:30</a> hey, that’s the name of the show!
I think you miss the point of drake and you are overly critical of him because he is arguably the most popular artist. I think clb is an honest expression of where he is at. Insecurity and all (mixed with brovado) which is what drake has always tried to be.
Yebbas Heartbreak IS best track
On one song. He sounds like lil Durk even with the autotune.
&quot;It&#39;s like CBT for your ears.&quot; - Flanthony Shirttano
i actually liked 7am prolly most listenable song
His shirt literally has Donda all over it
This review is all the sad boy motivation Drake needs for the new album
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=780">13:00</a> this here sums it up in one minute. Great video!
Anthony is so bias, he puts donda vinyl behind himself. We know which side he is in.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=343">5:43</a> The sad thing is that Drake&#39;s not the only one who thinks lesbian can be a label for men...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=365">6:05</a> LMAO 😂😂😂
Donda on the shelf 👀
Donda
Melon
future channeled “cowboy hat era future” for way 2 sexy and you just gonna shit all over it !?
I feel like he is just hating to hate, ngl.
When Kanye was at this point in his career where drake is now, he was dropping 808 &amp; Heartbreak and My Dark Twisted Fantasy. <br><br>And drake drops this? This record is a bigger L than the Pusha T thing.
Certified Lullaby 😴
This is an album without ghost songwriters, good job drake
this album is the most boring drake album almost over Scorpion and I used to be a huge fan and all you see on Twitter is people saying it’s like album of the year
This album is certified mid boy
This album is just boring
Damn. I think it’s at least a 5 lol
I agree with this review. This project a miss
Melon! You can’t knock it down a point because you forgot to take the test to renew your lover boy certification.
Never smiled more at a red flannel.
Lol
W
I agree with Tony mayne. Drake at this point is a time capsule that at once feels timeless and yet dated. I still listen though. I have issues.
The problem with this album mostly lies with Drake himself imo. The beats weren&#39;t bad and most of the features did well. Drake just felt so uninspired, uncreative and bored on this project. His delivery was awful and he barely had any energy. A couple of the songs on here sound like McDonald&#39;s Sprite versions of Drake hits. Girls Want Girls sounds like Life Is Good (even has the same kind of synths) but more boring, the JAY-Z song sounds like Pound Cake with a similar sample but nowhere near as iconic, and Fountains is just One Dance with a better fitting singer as a feature (congrats to Tems). It&#39;s flows and ideas we heard from Drake before and it comes off as safe. No surprise his streaming numbers dropped more than 40 percent after the first day
😍😍😍W
Idk man. I kinda liked this one. I think it&#39;s his best project since IYRTITL ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I really liked this album. Grill me comment section
we off the grid grid grid, drake album below mid mid mid.
SHIT
Nice review Melon I agree with your decision to remove 7 points for the album cover art alone
Once again, Fantano proves he&#39;s a certified dumbass. This is Drake&#39;s second best album hands down.
This not a review this a diss track... damn melon
Ah Donda 🤤
A lot of the songs feel the same and he uses the same back to back word type flow, it&#39;s so boring to me that I fell asleep listening to it on the 3rd track
That’s funny because I also wanna hook my nuts up to a car battery sometimes. I rate this review 10/10
Outside of More Life Drake projects been on the decline since 2015-2016. He just doesn&#39;t sound hungry anymore, he know&#39;s whatever he puts out will sell regardless of quality. Mixtape Drake is better than album Drake at this point for me. He experiments way more on IYRTITL (One of the best albums the past decade imo), More Life, and DLDT. Before hand it seemed like Drake was a focused album maker like Thank Me Later, Take Care, NWTS, IYRTITL. A damn shame.
I can&#39;t remember the last time Drake didn&#39;t get the red flannel.
I want Kanye to triumphantly tweet drake about melon giving CLB a 3
MAN GOT THAT RED LMAO
CERTIFIED BOY LOVER HEADASS. STREAM DONDA
Drake will never top Take Care and Take Care was only great because The Weeknd gave up half of his album for it
so aotp and dissimulation is better than clb???
Drake needs to stop talking bout the 6 and start talking bout the 3
Honestly that sounds like a Fair grade to me..
Cool. Now review Little Simz
This guy is to music what IGN is to video game reviews
YE WIN!
This review was hilarious
I want whatever Anthony is smoking because Drake is on the way to double sell Donda and Kanye relied on his features while Drake pulled his own. Drake running laps around Kanye
You called it all out perfectly.  My girl and I listened and felt so uninterested.  Every time we try to listen to Aubrey,  it never wows us as much as it seems to do some of our closest friends
certified hater boy
Child Lover Boy
Thank you, Melon.
<b>If you take off the glasses Fantano looks like the white Kanye</b>
I can&#39;t get over how confusing and disappointing the album cover is
Wankers say goat…
Donda: Very innovative,  great effort, great  concepts, bizarre but cool ideas put out. <br><br>CLB: Same old,  Same old, Same old , Same old, Same old Drake... being Drake.
Champagne poetry best song
Lmao, this is a certified Drake hate page.
Not here to defend Drake or this album, but your assertion that Kanye focused an album on his mother and side-stepped the Drake drama is hilarious. Drake is referenced on as many songs as Donda is. lmao
Tems is a woman*
&quot;I kinda wanna hook a car battery up to my nuts to get some kind of mental stimulation.&quot;<br><br>Lmfao Stop he&#39;s already dead.
ur mad
&quot;Hook a car battery to my nuts&quot; LMFAO!!!!!!!!!!
Melon just mad he ain&#39;t getting into the club
It’s not effortless... it’s swag.. y’all mfers don’t get it.. it’s like y’all taking everything on so seriously 😒
I knew it I knew it I knew it I knew it I knew it I knew it I knew it
he laid the SMACK DOWN here what the fuck
Spat my drink out when you called drake a “Certified LOSER BOY!” Big funny!
you got the donda vinyl in the back
Drake is was and always be TRASH
PEOPLE OUT HERE REALLY THOUGHT THIS WAS BETTER THAN DONDA 😂😂😂
REKT LMAOOOOOOOO
🤰🏻🤰🏽🤰
You know we&#39;re in the matrix when Ksi gets a better rating than drake... But tbf drake&#39;s album sounds like he didn&#39;t even try.
I loved the part when you talked about Kendrick’s dad eating chicken out of Drake’s dad’s ass. Solid review. Unsubscribed.
Fantano having a copy of DONDA in the background is a nice touch
Donda is better
spoiler: it’s a 10
rip
solid review! cheers from brazil.
Drake is unironically bad
In what universe is Drake the obsessed one while Kanye is just unphased? Kanye started it and leaked the man’s home address. He literally featured André 3000 just to fill the song with Drake disses without telling 3 stacks. André 3000 said “I thought this would be a personal record about family but I guess I was wrong. Kanye never told me he was gonna say that stuff.” <br>Kanye is CLEARLY the obsessed one, and it’s kind of ridiculous to write off entire songs because of that one objectively wrong take on the situation.<br>Melon has been biased against Drake for his entire career, and it’s never been more obvious than now.<br>He legitimately rated DONDA as a better record than Take Care and Nothing Was The Same. He believes DONDA is an entire POINT above My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. I’m convinced Melon intentionally heavily overrated DONDA purely to ensure that it would get a higher rating than CLB, because Melon wants to play a part in this drama.
saying you want to hook your nuts up to a car battery just to feel something for 16 minutes isn’t a review, melon
calling it now, this will be at #2 on melon&#39;s worst of 2021 list.
Cyhi da prynce said it best, &quot;not all rappers have enough stories to go for 5 albums, that&#39;s why they need ghostwriters&quot; and Drake is one of those, he has no more stories to tell, that&#39;s why his album sound the same to me.
3 is generous
Gives Donda a 7 and this a 3!? I know it’s just his opinion, but that’s whack
FOR FIVE SUMMERS
A red flannel appearance has never made me so happy.<br>This album bored me to death.
Drake has been boring from the jump.
bruh what 😭 ion know drake was pregnant
@lospollostv
Damn a 3? As a long time Drake fan I would have given it a 1. Whole album just felt like a complete phone in
B-but... I heard papi’s outside 😔
Drakes album felt like a parody. Like drake playing drake for an SNL skit
Rating : Trash
LMAO@ THE RATING..
I&#39;ve honestly never agreed with a Fantano review so I don&#39;t mind this score
The cover art just had to be better than a literal black square, and it somehow failed that too smh
Yelled “LETS FUCKING GOOOOO” just from seeing the red flannel in the thumbnail
Surprised at Fantanos ability to see past Kaynes right winged shock and awe mental health breakdowns and give Kayne a fair grade on artistry....and actually just said fuck drake.
Fantano has spoken. Donda is better
I liked the review, except the bit where you were naming every emoji on the album cover and decided to name all of the black ones the n-word.
I’m ready to have my opinion formed for me :)
Now that I look at it fantano does look alot like mike tyson
the biggest difference between kanye and drake, and why they will never be comparable, is that we can watch kanye go through his metamorphosis, his evolution, in music. meanwhile, drake relies on a consistency he built when he first got big. he&#39;s used that method consistently, that method being focused on being young, energetic, and generic to appeal to as many as possible. so now that his ego is shattered after being clowned on by the collective internet, we really see drake, as he is, out on full display as a rapper in decline and a deeply insecure man in this album. he&#39;s desperately trying to show himself off as machismo and as energetic as he was. but his reliance on implementing the same old method of making an album and calling it a day has made him extremely rusty. drake has and is consistent as a rapper, but consequentially he has lost his ability to adapt
It&#39;s so hard to believe a 34 year old DAD set down, took a pencil, and wrote &quot;say you a lesbian, me too&quot; then preceded to record it.
Facts
While I agree with a lot of the points raised in this review, this was honestly the first Drake album I&#39;ve enjoyed since IYRTITL (though obviously nowhere near as much). I&#39;m choosing to see all of the aspects that sound like &quot;something he was doing in 2015&quot; as a return of sorts, and while this album is certainly far from perfect, I&#39;m seeing it as Drake getting back on track and hopefully releasing something great again in the future.<br>Also Way 2 Sexy is a fun song ngl
pusha really broke drake&#39;s pride lol
Thank you for being honest!
Hahaha he likes bladee&#39;s record more than drake
bro i love way 2 sexy shit bangs
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=630">10:30</a> “hey that’s the name of the show”
So basically.... KSI’s last two albums &gt; Drakes last two
Higher than Scaled and Icy? Nah
I didn&#39;t listen to it but I also think it&#39;s a light 3
We need a 10 track album with real passion and growth from Drake, not some stripper muse and how much he&#39;s like Micheal Jackson lol
drakes last legit full good project was what a time to be alive and that was with future, has a declined soo badly ever since
Hot Shower &gt; Way 2 Sexy
This release is likely Drake&#39;s lowest point
Ok listen up Fantano, you review a brand new Drake album and you give it a light 3? I think you don’t understand that your all so special taste in music doesn’t justify you reviewing legendary albums so poorly. Gotta give big boys their big numbers, melon. Subscribed
This review felt like you were talking directly to Drake. Like you are his friend and are trying to steer him back to a good musical path. I hope he does watch this to hear your points about the album (which I, for the most part, agree with)
Bro I’ve listened to this album 3 times and I still can’t remember a single song other than Get Along Better, Way 2 Sexy (doesn’t even count because of the sample) and Knife Talk
Homophobic melon pushing lesbian rappers down. Unsubscribed.
Drake is terrible.
DONDA IS 2.5x BETTER THAN CLB
Drake&#39;s most albums/songs just sound the same, he raps the same, same delivery, same flow, he needs to get his ghostwriters back. He lacks creativity to an extent.
I wasted a whole edible on this album. Shit was so boring it killed my high. I just ended up going to bed after 8 tracks smh
Is that No Love Deep Web in the top left corner?
With this score I think we are in the right timeline.
Champagne Poetry was the only decent track on the album.
scary to realize &quot;way 2 sexy&quot; wasn&#39;t just a fever dream I had but a track we all had to experience
2 days, Melon, you have 2 days to have put out the Donda review, the CLB review and the new Little Simz (10/10 btw) review in a weeks time period.
I can’t take this review serious, did this man just diss Fountains!? With that verse with Tems Baby? Melon tweakin sorry
that car battery line was harder than the whole album lmao
theneedledrop has some seriously poetic/heavy lines in all of his reviews. It&#39;s almost as if we need a review channel to review his reviews
This guy really hates Drake lmao
On knife talk the project pat verse is the same as in Juicy j track feed the streets🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
I thought I was crazy for hating this album lol
Based
6GOD
Drake nut riders rn 😰😰😰😡😡😡😫😫
Drake can literally fart on a mic and his stans will call it a classic
Bro the she doing something that not Pepsi line is maybe the worst line of this year
Idk man for me i think its pretty cool to casually listen to. Jus put in the bg and go about ur day lol. Respect tho melon
2 sexy is fun. Why u gotta wait with albums instead of rushing for a review
If drake actually starts showing character development, his albums are gonna be fucking insane ngl
I think Anthony need to update LETS ARGUE: Worst album cover. For real wtf is this?
EVERYONE! Change your opinions, ANOTHY HAS SPOKEN!
Greatest review ever HAHAHAHAHA drake so fucking shit
Melon you can’t just keep saying “I’m way 2 sexy to do this review”
I checked on Spotify. And drake is Not credited as a songwriter on any of the songs from this album. Lmao.
Album sucked so hard
the only thing I have to say about this album is that I&#39;m pretty sure Drake admitted he was friends with future at some point in the first half of it
This album hits you harder than an ambien
Drake already dropped a 10/10 when he dropped Life Of The Party
CLB sounded like something Nav would release if he was actually trying
Drake the type of guy who puts emojis on the cover of his album.
Damn Melon,  I can&#39;t believe I disagree with almost everything you said
Melon gives clb a 3/10 but still posts mirror selfie’s listening to way 2 sexy 🤔
Tbh this is Drake’s newest album imo.
Anthony, you can’t deduct 7 points just because the record is mid. Actually you can. Keep up the great work! :D
LMAO it deserved a NOT GOOD honestly
Y’all know this is just his opinion, right?
daddy is not home 😔
Do<br>Regular <br>And<br>Kinda<br>Effort
At the very least, you can&#39;t deny that CLB is certainly one of the Drake albums of all time.
Yeah this whole video is accurate
I can&#39;t believe you didn&#39;t use the Sonic version of the cover
based
cudi carried his track, Hov carried his, future carried his
no.
Levitating by Dua Lipa
Drake fans brigading the comments section while punching the air rn. Y’all need to seek help.
Donda is all over the place but interesting <br>CLB is consistent but boring as hell
3
Am I the only one that likes Way 2 Sexy
This album sucked bruh...
It sucks cuz I want to like drakes music his singles are usually good but then the album drops and I remember why I don&#39;t have him in my Playlist much
You may not see this Anthony, but you should give Makoto Matsushita’s First Light LP a listen.
can someone fill me in on why he hates drake so much?
So I guess Drake&#39;s getting shot for realsies now? Thanks Melon.
This album was sooooooooooooo bad… that lesbian bar has to legitimately be one of the worst bars in the world
😂 been waiting
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=834">13:54</a>  theres an audio lag here fantano
That car battery comment had me rolling lmao
Justice.
You would&#39;ve given this album a 10 if it was called &quot;Certified Forklift Operator&quot;
DONDA &gt; CLB
donda season
Tems is a “he” now?👀👀
Kanye n Drake collab.<br><br>[Certified Donda Boy] (7 + 3) = 10/10
Travis&#39; verse was great you&#39;re tweaking
Drake didn&#39;t flopped, he&#39;s just 2 SEXY  for your reviews
Imagine how bad he thinks that song is, that he really said that it sounded like a song from HOB, but horribly executed, DAMN.
red
Comparing donda with clb is like comparing blade runner with transformers.
Why did why did he say that this album was better than The Off-season or Twitter then give it a three.......That cole hate is so forced
evolution of tears is better
Red Flannel 🤗🤗🤗
ksi has a higher score than drake. wow
This was the most Drake album ever
If I’m ever going to listen to a track called “In Too Deep” it’s going to be by Genesis. Thank you very much
Seems kinda biased.. I mean Donda is literally all over your shirt, Anthony
💀 what did I say it is a 3/10 and look he rated the exact same as my opinion he did the same thing for the Kanye album we both had the same opinion for both albums
Fantano got the donda album cover behind him
No/10
Oof I think that’s the first “Car battery to my nuts” Melon has ever given out. Drake making history yet again.
theneedledrop hating drake for 10 minutes straight video earned another 17 minutes, rejoice
Drake puts more effort into hooking up with minors than making good music.
Love some nice, cold melon
You can&#39;t give it a 10 just because you&#39;re a lesbian too
Wait so JJ got a better score than drake lmaoooo
Anthony wtf I liked this album you can’t dislike it
and the cover art its so... just no.
Donda is also this bad…
At least one of these points has to be for the “Denmark a nigga like Copenhagen” bar
Drake has lacked “inspiration” since he was called out for his ghostwriters
Can you do a magnificent day for an exorcism? Idk if you even read comments
Way 2 Sexy was the first song I heard off this therefore the rest was absolutely tainted
“I just want to hook a car battery up to my nuts just so I could feel some mental stimulation”
Anthony will give little simz a 10.  Predicting it here. Monday September 6th 9:53 pm
“Chipmunk soul” its not soul its a beatles song in the sample
No melon, CLB is not a psychoactive drug, please stop asking for it.
melon a little jealous he isn&#39;t a certified lover boy?
I thought Fuckin fans was a song that should have been a Partynextdoor record
Certified Snoozefest...
Light 3 is exactly what I was thinking. I really had high hopes but the album is way to boring to me. I find little replayability where as Donda feels like I&#39;ll be listening to it in 10 years. Drake might win sales but that doesn&#39;t mean anything. I buy madden every year nothing changes same with drake.
Tems is a girl bruv 😪
I&#39;m stealing this from another commenter but, &quot;It sounds like Drake wrote this album.&quot;
The comments about you saying this would be much worse than Donda were correct.
Think pusha broke Drake lol CLB certified sucked. <br><br>Great review 👍🏼
ANYTHING BUT THE RED FLANNEL
This album was so mind-numbingly boring and bland I thought I was going crazy
That album cover alone deserves a 3
I already hated it when i started like travis scott’s verse.
Great review good sir GREAT review although in my own opinion I give it a 2.5/10 Cudi and Yebba are the only good things here and Jay z
Drake&#39;s &quot;In Too Deep&quot; is an insult to its Sum 41 source material
Drake: Releases an 86 minute album that wasn&#39;t so good. <br><br>Melon: Puts out an 86 minute review telling Drake his album wasn&#39;t so good.
Way 2 sexy is objectively the best track
I know you wanted to hook your nuts up to a car battery for stimulation but you didnt have to do it on camera Anthony
Based on what social media said I was believing this album was absolute garbage. I finally got to to listen in its entirely that album had a lot of great songs. I think the problem his subject matter hasn&#39;t changed at all. Like he doesn&#39;t need to be Nas illmatic but 6 studio albums in you&#39;ve got to start talking about something else. I think for him he doesn&#39;t have a drug dealing past or ghetto tails to revert back too. The struggle sounds better, than when your rich and have made it.
ITS OFFICIAL<br>DONDA&gt;CLB
Only a Kendrick album can save us now
drake so consistent though<br><br>*consistently balls
I wish you had the animated version of the cover going in the background as you spoke.
Shit was mid
Man Drake been mailing it in since Nothing Was The Same. This record ain’t bad but it’s definitely not good. I like about 5 tracks on it. It wasn’t even disappointing because at this point I don’t expect his projects to be good. They just are what they are. I’m at a 4 out of 10
You were suppose to say “Sexthony Shirtano” but you didn’t melon.
I think &quot;say that you a lesbian girl me too&quot;  has the same level of effort as &quot;heavy duty booty like Diarrhoea&quot;
Jesus Melon, calling it Certified Loser Baby was a tad harsh no?
Donda won
ksi albums &gt; CLB and Scorpion
Dub for kanye
There is so much wrong about a 34 year dad calling his album certified lover boy and having that as an album cover.
CLB WAS OFF THE MID MID MID!!! 🤣💀
Makes sense you scored it that. Drake dont make music for nerds
LosPollosTV crying right now on stream watching this, love it
Yebba&#39;s Heartbreak was my favorite track on the album, if Drake could make more music, where he isn&#39;t there at all I&#39;d give him a 10
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=365">6:05</a> For Melon kinkshaming
W review
dark lane demo tapes, upon looking back, actually has a much more concise tone/mood and i enjoy pretty much all those songs more than anything off this album
What do you want no one is making music for you stop hip hop ain’t for you hip hop is the expression of the artist point of view who are you to say what someone should talk about. Pause you get to say how you feel without me telling you how to feel I get it points made.  But do you ever go into a building and say the architecture all wrong this could have been built by someone son or upon entering an art gallery happily point at every one and half to say sum dumb maybe tear down every one
Fully agree with the red shirt
If drake was black , you would have given it a 10 , melon
Youre like an omnivore of music - you listen to everything, trash and quality alike - In fact, because you waste time on trash artists like this(for more views obviously), you miss out on the quality on the other side. Then again, to each his own. But listening to everything is not having a taste in music.
Can’t wait for LosPollos to watch this 😂
I agree with the score
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=358">5:58</a> Bro I&#39;m fucking dying LMAO
Donda has the better banger, hit, and more deep songs. Shave about 9 songs off and it&#39;s a instant classic. CLB on the other hand was boring and more of the same.
I’ve been waiting for this review. It did not disappoint. <br>Kanye lives in Drakes head rent free but Kanye doesn’t even care. It’s kinda funny
I listened to it the other night while I was drunk and I had to start skipping around, it was so bad. Usually alcohol makes all music sound better than it is, so I can&#39;t imagine listening to this sober
&quot;I want to hook up a car battery to my nuts.&quot; - The Internet&#39;s busiest music nerd
I didn’t like this after 1st listen. Skimmed through again and still didn’t but it was a little better. Then there were about 3-5 tracks I kinda liked. And that’s usually how it goes with Drake.  He’s never quite been able to top Tuscan Leather (which is one of his few songs that stand the test of time).
This was my rating as well
Melon didn&#39;t had to go that harsh 😢😣😣😂😂🤣
im not mad quad didnt predict melons rating this time
Why does he always look like he hates his job and life when making these vids
It’s settled then. Donda is better than CLB
i am like 90% sure one of the emoji eyes blinked, and it freaked me out
Certified boy lover
Yeah this score is fair
CLB just sounds like Drake trying his best to do a Drake Impression
“Certified Lover Boy” or “Drake tries too hard to be a bad boy and comes off as an overall bad person”
finally i can have something to back up my annoying defense of donda all over the internet
Drake continuing to be a fantastic feature artist that can just take over a track, while simultaneously being one of the absolute worst solo artists in the current state of rap music. He hasn&#39;t had a good album since WATTBA, and if you disagree you&#39;re in denial. Scorpion had a few okay songs, everything since has been literal trash. I&#39;m sorry
He said “nothony waytano” and I wonder if that’s a foreshadowing…<br><br><br>Edit: yes. Yes it was.
Way 2 Sexy is a great workout song IMO
I been waiting for days for this!
I thought the theme of this album was going back to Take Care type vibe.
A 3 🤣🤣🤣 Preach‼️
Review Lady Gaga
Did he just call the get throwed sample from bun b a astroworld throwaway 🤦🏽
More like Certified Boy Lover
got em
This will be a 4 or 5 if the cover isn’t this abomination
drake went harder on a migos feature than his entire album
I actually like this album. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Of course what a foolish opinion by me I sincerely apologize and this album is clearly a very bad album.
I just want to see a Ka or Wolves in the Throne Room review
most accurate review of yours, maybe ever. nice one, antwon fantwon.
Very fair review, especially cuz you call out that some of the songs are decent.  But the entire thing feels without purpose, I have no idea why I should care about anything he&#39;s saying.
Melon bodied Drake like Justin Wong bodied Roundhouse LMAO
Take off 3 points from this and add 3 to donda and its more accurate
What did y&#39;all expect from a dude who picks this cover art
DJ Akademiks sleeping to this album was foreshadowing for this review.
This dude’s taste in music is terrible 🤣
I’m cool w the 3/10 but i just wanted to say the reasons you only live twice sounds like lord knows is because it’s a just blaze diss who made the beat to lord knows
Couldn’t listen to the entirety of this shit.
Anthony, you can&#39;t add 3 points because Drake leaked a really good Kanye track.
It&#39;s crazy how Drake hasn&#39;t put out a good album since IYARTITL. It&#39;s like the guy isn&#39;t even trying anymore at this point.
Drakes been real quiet since this dropped.
CLB and Donda album covers are perfect representations of the music. Basic, boring, bland
CLB cured my insomnia, I can finally get some good sleep
Drake is the most boring and uninteresting artist who ever reach the status he has reach, no joke.
champagne poetry is terrible what
I don&#39;t get why u have to call him the n word every 3 minutes
If you say TSU isn’t a classic I know you are just hating for clout
kanye fans rn:<br><br>WE OFF THE GRID GRID GRID
Drake so clearly hasn&#39;t gotten over the L Pusha bestowed him with, the biggest L he&#39;s ever taken, and he&#39;ll never be able to dissociate Kanye from that situation. That&#39;s the only reason this pseudo beef of theirs has played out this long.
Hey Fantano, can you please stop stealing all my Drake vinyls while I sleep? I know it’s your red flannel that you left behind
I just noticed drake is rapping like smiley in No friends in the industry.😂
Certified trash
3!!?? well deserved
MOST DESERVED RED FLANNEL OF THE YEAR
Yo I didn’t realize he was wearing the red flannel 😂
I can tell by how he didn&#39;t praise love all&#39;s beat or love imy2&#39;s beat he doesn&#39;t drive at night blasting music in a car with a system as these songs are emaculate driving at night music<br>Drake makes wavy slightly high/tipsy driving at night music
Race my mind sounds like a chopped recycled version of AMG off Dark Lane Demo
Who yall think had the best album  CLB or Donda..?
Anthony, Tems is a woman.
bro you gotta chillllll 💀 it’s not that bad
The lyrics were boring and same old same old popping bottles in the club getting girls bs. Nobody wants that anymore and is tired of it unless you are in HS and stupid just wanting to turn up. Most of these tracks were background noise lacking imaginative imagery and deep evolution. We didn&#39;t need a more sloppy version of Take Care lets be honest, this is just embarrassing if you really analyze it. Drake is washed up on this one and flopped hard. Not to mention the features carried a lot of that garbage. I want to say sorry on Drake&#39;s behalf lol maybe if he just gave it more time in the lab and cooked up something else in the studio booth but this wasn&#39;t it. He will still get his bag from it..a money maker cash grab but nobody will remember this as a classic. Needed his ghostwriter, guess he went on vacation...Drake needs to take a break from music for a little while. Him releasing a project every year has clearly <b>**</b> him up creativity-wise. No depth, bland, uninspiring, what was he thinking??? Might be the worst project he dropped. No passion in it and it is an ego trip flex the whole time talking about nonsense. Generic elevator music
Call me if you get lost still best rap album this year.
You know what happens when the red flannel is out, time to hate Drake 😈
bro you gotta chillllll 💀 it’s not that bad
NO SWEDISH SONGWRITERS NO FILLER 100% CERTIFIED BOY LOVER
We need a Drakeless version of this album
The director of music to the danish radio channel p3, said &quot;I have just lisent to CLB, and Jesus it is boring, so I&#39;m not gonna play any of it&quot;.
Clb was so boring man. He hyped the album but could not deliver. Drizzy wrote some of the worst bars &#39;u lesbian, me too&#39; corny. Production didn&#39;t hit properly Or he didn&#39;t match his energy idk . After listening to this album i felt drake is no more artistically motivated. Not rich shaming the guy but u gotta treat your profession with respect. Whining about women and money is all he does now bro. I expected better or i didn&#39;t. I can tell he wrote mostly in the project because it is so bad.
Red flannel… he’s going in
Good 3 melon
You absolutely tore into this man&#39;s project LMAO, but rightfully so. I wonder if there&#39;s a way to get him to see this review because he needs this reality check to (hopefully) help him recalibrate. I&#39;m a huge Drake fan but this was such a disappointment.
Girls Like Girls should be purged from the human lexicon
The most BIAS person when it comes to Drake
This is actually the only Drake album I&#39;ve really enjoyed. Maybe it&#39;s where I&#39;m at in life idk. It felt like it hit harder than ever before.
I can&#39;t be the only person who enjoyed Way 2 Sexy... right ?
Drake #1 lesbian rapper
Hooking up a car battery to your nuts?? Lmaoooo please tell me youre in the new Jackass, Melonman
please tony, I JUST WANT A DEEP STATES REVIEW
Yes the line “on your ass like back pockets would be a line towards Kanye.”
well, i hope at least he is writting his own songs now, right? don&#39;t tell me he paid people to write this album lol
more like Certified boy lover to me 🤷
Nah he tweakin’
This makes up for the 0 you gave SBTH.
In the meanwhile Pitchfork gave Donda a 6 and CLB a 6.6 🤡
As a drake fan hate to say it but CLB was extremely disappointing to me, it felt soo formulaic and just very boring to hear, on the other hand donda, although having a lot of filler, has extremely memorable and replay able parts even it’s only 2 or 3 songs
He stole the beat from masegos navajo check it out
difference is kanye&#39;s an actual artist<br>also, what the fuck is that album cover, jesus christ
If donda  drop the same day that CLB<br>Drake ego would be hurt
KSI DISSIMULATION IS BETTER THAN CLB LESHGOOOOOOOO
I give this album an 8 based on my personal enjoyment of it :)
I listened to the entirety of drakes scorpion album when it dropped and after that I just can’t be bothered to listen to this guys music. I liked IYRTITL and the stuff before it but since then he’s continuously missed the mark. This is like the first time I’m unironically taking melon’s word. I can’t be bothered to listen to another 20+ track drake album. Since I’ve often agreed with Mr. Fantano, imma just sit this one out.
Wow the first 10 with a red flannel!
I agree the album was uninspired. But can we really say that Kanye decided to be above all the beef when it turns out he actually made a whole-ass diss track that he didn&#39;t include at the last minute?
he has to be trolling😭this whole review is “ [insert feature] made the track, Drake didnt really contribute” like gtfo. the fact this album was a creative, fun, not serious album and he still got yall this bothered is hella funny. drake outsells your favorite rapper, numbers dont lie, goodnight.
Certified Lullaby Boy<br><br>😴
I just hate that album cover with a passion. If an album cover uses phone enojis, you know its gonna suck and be corny as hell.
As usual. Bias take on drake. I don’t even know why I watch these reviews on drake.
KANYE WON
I think you&#39;re too hard on Drake. Yeah it&#39;s not his best record but it&#39;s not his worst.
Way to sexy had a banger music video
Awwwww man. Think this was the first time I was rooting for Drake to win the beef. I guess thanks for at least listening to the record so that I don&#39;t have to.
CLB deserves a not good
I get you didn’t love the record but wearing a red shirt covered in the Donda artwork just seems a little cruel, Anthony
I don’t get why this album was pushed back 9 months and had so much marketing. It was basic, uninspired, and very underwhelming. Drake let me down with this one.
This is a big W, boss man. Truly, the correct opinion.
Donda’s on vinyl?
Kanye got a whole collab with cudi and he work w him but drake cant work with future again it a problem u niggas is biased
imagine give 7 for donda and 3 for clb<br><br>melon stan from kanye confirmed
Melon gonna get canceled for not respecting Drake&#39;s lesbian sexual orientation.
I didn&#39;t listen to the album and I would give it a 3/10 as well. Drake is boring and all his music sounds the same
🤰🤰🏻🤰🏼🤰🏽🤰🏾🤰🏿
LETS GOOO , LOVE YOU MELONELY
Too high
album didn’t sound like it took time to make. Seem like drake got “drake type beats” from YouTube
Did you notice juice wrld at the beginning of IMY2?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=361">6:01</a> Never have i wanted to be a car battery so bad
This album is 🔥 The beats and instrumentals off the chain I don’t know what everyone else was listening to but this album is a classic or jay z wouldn’t have came on it
U really had NOTHING nice to say about this audible turd
Donda &gt; CLB.
You just know that car battery part has been clipped at least 100 times.
Fantano not a big fan but W
The rating at the end is the the amount of good songs on this 21 track album
Drake is the shining example of a glass cannon
W opinion I hate this album we finally agree 🤝
red flannel red flannel
Such a good review
Honestly, I was expecting to see &quot;Drake - Certified Lover Boy: NOT GOOD&quot;
Bro I stg I said melon would say 3 and somehow I was right W REVIEW
All the industry hacks like Akademiks, Ebro and even Budden  pussy footing hard around what they actually like about this album. This was refreshing.
Yooo, I thought I was the only one who didn’t think this new album was so amazing.
CLB is shorter than Donda but somehow it feels longer
I actually don&#39;t hate the album cover, the color placement is quite nice ngl
3/10 WOW I DID NOT EXPECT THAT
Damn just shitting on all his music
CNG: Certified Not Good
Look, shits garbage, but so was Donda stop playin. Both albums only had like 2 good songs
Spot on review ! Drake gon get a sound bite from this and turn it into an intro 😂😂😂
Literally nothing but straight facts for 17 minutes straight
Damn I mean I knew it was bad but a 3 I didn&#39;t even exspect that
Scary Hours 2 is so much better than this shit
I’m shocked another negatively reviewed Drake album. Thanks Melon.
Great now its official<br>Donda &gt; CLB
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=358">5:58</a> “this track’s greatest sin is being so goddamn boring that while i’m listening to it i kinda want to just like hook a car battery up to my nuts just to get some kind of mental stimulation” 😂😂😂
So we&#39;re just gonna ignore that Melon didn&#39;t realize Tems is a woman and that the Project Pat feature was a sample? Album is still mids tho lol
I feel like @theneedledrop is the only person to say that he likes most of the music on a record but it&#39;s boring because of the person it&#39;s attached to, and then gives it a low score... isn&#39;t this the same guy advocating for separating the artist from the person?
We all knew it was gonna be a red flannel, we just didn&#39;t know how bad it would be
This album was just some moody ass background music for the most part. 😆 Man i like Drake&#39;s old stuff but his current albums just all sound the same
Bragging you had emoji sex with these women isn&#39;t a review, Melon.
bias as hell
You use big words …. So people think your wise and smart so they believe yo dumbass cmon man your a drake hater wtf 💀
I saw a New Jersey man get very upset at this video
You&#39;re opinion and everything but it seems weird to only have 1 least favorite track on a 21 track album and give it a 3. If you state most songs are at least decent just not creative with a few good tracks it seems like more then a 3
He said nonthany waytano to the ppl who think that CLB is better than Donda
I love all the Donda album covers on your flannel
Anthony I&#39;m furious. How could you give this a 3. this CLEARLY deserved a not good.
Fam you went way too hard in this video for no reason lol. To me an album that&#39;s a 3/10 is an album that is very nearly unlistenable and that might have two records I like. This album does not fall under that.
Drake should release a pure diss album lol
D A M N<br><br>Ayo the nonchalant 3 caught me tf off guard
A 10? Really??
Drake finna call his next album “Arrested development” 😂 , that is the perfect way to describe this mans career rn
The tragedy of Drake is that his discography past-2015 does not help the branding he’s developed for himself at all. His success at this point is only a result of shady business moves and artistic theft, but the music only emphasizes how vulnerable and weak he actually is. He’s like the Elon Musk of rap.
This gotta be racist
No way he gave Swimming the same score as CLB. Re review Swimming this is disrespectful
So trippie&#39;s album is better than clb huh
Drake is the One Piece of rap
You still have time to delete this...
Bro you don’t like Drake just say that bro😂😂😂 hating ass 😂🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
who woulda guessed the corny music reviewer who is only respected by corny white kids gives the drake album a 3/10 and the corny white kid’s god kanye a 7/10. laughable.
LosPollosTV, live on twitch, just cried to this video for 40 min, disliked, and reported for hateful conduct lol.
Donda Donda Donda
Feels like Anthony&#39;s on a battle on this one, many lines i was like ouch.
Are you saying that this album is on the same level of swimming
He’s really good at his job I respect it I bet he actually likes drake but hates for the views literally every point you made was inaccurate but you get bag🤡
Donda &gt; lover boy
Ok im not the only one who ain’t feeling it.. tbh i have more DONDA saved than CLB…
Bro you just a hater just say that 😂😂😂😂
As soon as I saw the red flannel I knew it wasn’t gonna be good for Aubrey…
Well he made top 3, top 3 worst ALBUM COVERS OF ALL TIME!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=928">15:28</a> made me laugh
Final pause counter from triggered Drake fan boy LosPollos while reacting to Melon&#39;s CLB review: 29
You can’t just take 7 points away from CLB because you’re taking Kanye’s side in the beef, Melon
This album is embarrassing aside from like 2 or 3 songs.
I&#39;m so happy you don&#39;t like it
10 - DONDA = CLB
He really gave him a 3/10
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=836">13:56</a> TEMS is a SHE, Melon. A very beautiful she, at that.
I felt this.
Diary drake😭😭😭
“You Only Live Twice” needs to see a chiropractor for single handedly carrying this damn record
Sir- You’re an average album, at best.<br><br><b>Kevin Samuels voice</b>
So KSI has an album with a higher rating than a Drake album. Wild.
Saw a tiktok that says:<br><br>“Drake songs are for good looking boys and pretty girls, if you didn’t like CLB then I hate to break it to you”<br><br>Lmao they’re really trying
Kanye definitely had more memorable and objectively better songs even though &#39;Off the grid&#39; is the only song I love really on repeat!
When I saw the cover art to &quot;Story of Adidon&quot; I thought &quot;This is as damaging as cover art gets. No other cover art could have hurt Drake more&quot;<br>Then I saw the cover art for CLB.
Worst Drake album ever.
I squealed with glee when I saw that red flannel I knew Daddy was goin IN
You only gave this album a 3 because drake openly came out as a lesbian. smh.
😂😂😂😂 3 ?? Lol
I liked &#39;no friends in the industry,&#39; &#39;7am bridle path&#39; and &#39;the remorse&#39; instantly for the flow and instrumentals that accompanied well together. BUT I rarely listen to Drake or keep up with this &#39;beef&#39; so while they&#39;re fun to listen to I agree with Melon I can&#39;t get around the msg now
this dudes takes are terrible
Is that a 3 out of 10? Hahaha
🤰🤰🏻🤰🏾🤰🏻<br>🤰🏿🤰🏽🤰🏾🤰🏼<br>🤰🏾🤰🏾🤰🏽🤰🏿
<b>Throws bottlecap</b><br><br>Whoa, I hope he opened a beer.
red flannel lessgo
3!?!?!? Daaaaaaaaamn🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=836">13:56</a> Anthony did you just refer to TEMS (mind you, who looks like a Nigerian Disney princess) as &quot;he&quot;? Lmao
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=833">13:53</a> &quot;The Tems feature is the only appealing thing about it and even <b>HE</b> struggles to do anything interesting with the song&quot;<br><br>Who&#39;s gonna tell melon.<br>EDIT: Shout out to melon for editing the mistake
If you add CLB and Donda you get a 10, and if you combine the covers it&#39;s predominantly black and white.
I agree with your point about Drake allowing so much of his real life baby drama to bleed into the music vs. Ye who also keeps a lot of drama brewing, but it rarely shows up as sonically/thematically heavy handed. Overall, Drake will always make decent music, but stagnancy is a real thing and the creative drive seems to only come from his animosity with others in the industry.
Listening to hotline bling for 15 minutes wasn’t really necessary melon.
Hate is blatant in this video, I understand you though therefore I respect what you doing. Gotta pay them bills, I’ll pray for you my guy……
No Anthony you are not 2 sexy
For me this album is not bad but it also has nothing to offer, none of the tracks are bad but they are neither something amazing, and all the songs have the same narrative and overall sound the same. This album feels just safe, for me its the perfect 5/10. Not bad but also not good
Everytime Melon starts to talk about Lil Baby I just wait till he say something like &quot;he raps his ass off&quot; and then he does it 😂😂😂<br>.<br>Ayo Melon, c&#39;mon this album was good compared to his previosly Scorpion, Dark Lane Damo Tapes and Care Package, it&#39;s way more focused and better produced, I&#39;d give a 6/10 easily, I think 3/10 was unfair... That Fountains was so good, I really hope it turns into a 2021 hit, because it just waaaaaaaaaaay too better that One Dance shit.
W Donda&gt;CLB
Waiting for Drake&#39;s Best Of Compilation album. Might as well cut to the chase.
drake dickriders saying that its gonna grow on me. did drake delay the album 9 months so it could grow on him too? cus that shit was beyond lazy and corny.
Kudos to Drake to being the most consistent artist since Nav and Denzel to get the same score 3 times in a row!
Midwife &#39;Tano Here...
I can’t wait for Kendrick to just shut this man down completely. But it will probably never happen.
Too high melon. I’d give it a strong 1
In tsu the stripper ask drake for a loan but somehow u take it as drake is manipulating her just say u hate him bro
Clicked immediately when I saw the red flannel lmao
I feel like drake is the 2010’s artist template and in another people will look back on him in the same way people look back on jarule or usher a “oh remaber when we liked him” kinda thing
CLB: 3<br>Donda: 7<br>Kings Disease 2: 8<br>Kings Disease 2 rap album of the year??🤔🤔
I just knew Melon would feel ill after hearing Way 2 Sexy
I don&#39;t remember anything from this after listening to it<br>Other than the lesbian line of course
Thank you Anthony. Someone had to  slog it out to find the interesting stuff
Hey where is YUNOREVIEW this month, Meloncholy?
Project Pat isn&#39;t even &quot;featured&quot; on the album - it&#39;s sample from his feature on Feed The Streets from the 2017 Juicy J record Rubba Band Business.  Weak attempt by Drizzy
i get the albums cover art wasn’t tasteful but saying “the genocide of lightskins must begin with drake” is uncalled for especially when you yourself have lightskin children. Do better.
He’s on a hot streak
All should have seen this coming, Fantano hasn’t given a Drake project more than a 4 since IYRTITL. For me, it’s a good album, though it obviously could have been 16-17 songs instead of 21.
Drake Stan&#39;s really think the album was a masterpiece just because it surpassed on sales faster than his Scorpion Album 😂
Ur opinion is embarrassing smh
LETS GO CHAMP
Donda in the background I see you Melon
way 2 sexy was the only song i listened to and saved and i liked it idk why melon is hating on it lol
melon calling Michelle by the Beatles a &quot;chipmunk soul sample&quot; is a major L. literally don&#39;t know music or didn&#39;t listen to this album. these is a personal beef.
Alternative album cover art-<br>🗑️ 🗑️ 🗑️ 🗑️<br><br>🗑️ 🗑️ 🗑️ 🗑️<br><br>🗑️ 🗑️ 🗑️ 🗑️
best review you ever done
Kanye &gt; Drake
I started cracking up immediately I saw the red shirt.
Drake is like a Pokémon that doesn&#39;t want to evolve <br><br>drake’s music is so basic like he the default skin in the rap game<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Oven
This album was straight trash
CLB was good fantano is a nerd
I clicked on this thinking damn can’t wait to listen to Fantano shit on this album
How did this get more streams than Donda, the album cover alone was enough to turn me off on the project.
This is the epitome of BBL music. Guys who have low fades, full beards and slits in their eyebrows….so LosPollosTv type music
How did you make it through this whole thing without even mentioning Yebba&#39;s Heartbreak?
Drake stans-  the majority of the world is saying Donda is better are all hating. Even though drake has more fans. Take the L Kanye won and drake needs to step up the game next time
A certified bruh moment
&quot;LEAST FAV TRACK: WAY 2 SEXY&quot;<br><br><br>NO, JUST NO. I accept any criticism of this album, except for that song.
other than Yebba’s song, most of these features don’t make sense, like why would you call it CLB and make it seem like this was gonna be a somewhat personal project only for it to be a compilation of random songs that had nothing to do with each other lol
Knife Talk sounds like it was a throwaway from Savage Mode 2.
Certified melon boy
Anthony, saying your a lesbian and then puckering your lips and raising your eyebrow while taking a feminine mirror selfie like Drake made me very uncomfy, I’m a MINOR. Drake didn’t get that when I told him put hopefully you can!
I feel like Drakes goal with the album was to disappoint us all and blah blah blah I am just trying to find a reason to support drake but there is none so I’ll just go back and listen to his Take Care album.
Don’t let this distract you from the fact that Drake delayed the album back in January because of a slight injury. He said that it matters for him to heal so he could enjoy this “wonderful” album with his fans. If he loves this album, this guy can’t hear properly anymore.
<b>Melon already has the Donda Vinyl in the background while reviewing CLB. The savagery.</b>
Drake peaked in 2015
I saw this coming. Glad all the artistic people are on the same page here
Calling your album &quot;Certified Lover Of Boys&quot; is not cool.
I could smell Drakes morning breath from my speaker when he decided to rollover on his bed to mumble on “Girls Want Girls”
&quot;At least Kanye made an album cover for the blind people too.&quot; Exactly, good point 10/10 review
Drake was mad that Kanye didn’t bring him up on DONDA and dropped that 3 stacks record so he felt like he wasn’t the only one in the beef 😭😭😭
Remember that this got the same score as House of Balloons
Hey, my two favorite albums of the year in the background
My score would be the same. This is my least favorite Drake album sadly
Literally the only track I liked was track 1 (because of the Masego sample) and the Jay Z feature. Everything else was meh.
You should definitely review the album Self-Ish by Will Wood
Not everything should be compared to Kanye. But Drake inserted Kanye into this release and directly begged for his album to be compared to Donda. What a misstep, as this is one major dud - and it couldn&#39;t be a better example of how much weaker he is as an artist compared to Ye.<br><br>That isn&#39;t to say Donda isn&#39;t without its own flaws. But in comparison to CLB - it&#39;s a damn masterpiece. Whatever you think about Kanye, even his bad albums are admirable in the attempt he was going for. Drake now has a history of releasing boring/uninspired duds.
BROOOO. How many times do I have to tell people, Way 2 Sexy is a hit.
LITTLE SIMZ NEXT PLEEEEEEAAASEEE
This album just feels like another Drake album. He didn’t take any risks and just played it safe. He could’ve came a lot harder IMO but he was just trying to get numbers instead of giving us an actual listening experience.
Mumbling that you’re way too sexy for 17 minutes straight isn’t reviewing Certified Lover Boy Melon
The most honest review imo
This guy is analyzing the social implications of an album called certified lover boy and wonders why he can’t enjoy it
As soon as I heard the lesbian line I knew he had done something similar to it on “Every Girl” with Young Money. On there he said “Are any of y’all into girls like I am? Lets be honest”. That’s how I know Drake might be out of material, I hope not but it was kind of sad to hear this album kind of like when Scorpion came out. They have a similar feel to me and that’s not a good thing.
Drake: “said you a lesbian, girl, me too.”<br><br>Revival era Eminem: <b>stares proudly</b>
I love it that you said &#39;Arrested Development&#39; and then proceeded to explain why you love Jason Bateman so much. Great Review.
Drake punching air rn
This is pretty spot on to my take. Some alright/goodish songs, and a lot of skippable songs. And even the good ones aren’t anything groundbreaking or anything. There’s nothing on here that’s a straight up banger gonna be a classing or anything.
Another W from Anthony
MELON LIKED KSI&#39;S ALBUM BETTER THAN DRAKE . KSI IS GOATED
Can&#39;t wait to see the album vinyl in the background one day
Thank you. Thank you. This dude doesn&#39;t  know how to push boundaries l
Tems is a she btw
I really thought it be a light 6 or strong 5. Also check out our podcast after melons review. We just released our review on Donda x CLB. And yes we have time stamps too! Self promotion over
As always it is all about numbers. Even though Drake makes the same boring music, with a few occasional hits, since a decade people still care more for this review than a Little Simz review for example. Yeah I get it, he is one of the most popular artists, OK. Still, why a fan of actual good music will review this one first instead of something better.<br>Maybe the reason is u can easily say it is the same shit as always. Then again..the review goes on for 17 minutes😅.<br>Anyway it&#39;s all good. Every channel needs clicks, that&#39;s normal. So my comment is actually stupid and obsolete.
Anthony you can’t give the album a 12/10 just because there are 12 pregnant women emojis on the album I mean come on we’ve talked about this
So glad my opinion is validated💀
Can you PLEASE rate alone in iz world by israel Kamakawiwo&#39;ole
Anthony, by settling the Donda v CLB fight once and for all, you have now completed your redemption arc. MBDTF is now a distant memory. You can rest now, my sweet Melon
I didn’t know how many people hated on drake till I read the comments, no wonder he had more first day streams than Ye! NO MATTER HOW MUCH THEY HATE, THEY WANT TO HEAR IT😭😭😭😭😂😂😂
Likely an honest mistake but Tems is a woman, not a man (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=835">13:55</a>)
Anthony, talking about how sexy you are for 17 minutes isn&#39;t a review
This album sucked
so baised oh my
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=366">6:06</a> its so boring i wanna hook a car battery up to my nuts just to get some kind of mental of stimulation<br> 😫🤣
Something tells me he didn’t love this album
Lospollostv gonna have a field day with this one
idc what anyone says sicko mode was always some hyped mid for me
tems is a girl
This is so biased, you’ve been hating on Drake for the past 10 years if he’s such a bad artist, why does he continue to be #1 in the game every year.
Certified Lover Boy: 3/10<br>Donda: 7/10
Fantano hit the nail on the head with this one
I’m surprised that Anthony Fantano didn’t do a whole video of him saying CLB was NOT GOOD.
As a trans woman, I find Girls Like Girls to be hilarious. Because I know so many friends that said they felt like they were lesbian before they transitioned. So Drizzy is unintentionally dropping some transition bars.
I&#39;m not the biggest Drake fan but I feel like Fantanos rating Drake more than the music at this point.
this is the lowest score he&#39;s ever given Drake
I don’t even listen to this shit, I’m here for the red shirt
Saw this one coming😂😂😂😂
Surprised dude actually reviewed it and didn’t just chew bread on here for 17 minutes 🤣
When I saw the red flannel I knew...
light 3 .. oof 😭
Fist thing I thought listening to this album is “oh drake ran out of things to rap about”
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=834">13:54</a> so is no one going to tell him that Tems is a woman?
Drakes biggest fan Anthony ‘Drakes biggest fan’ Fantano
I love you Melon 🍈
Knew the album was gonna be mid when the cover art was released.
i see a drake album review in my sub feed, i see the red shirt, i click on the video, i click the like button
U don’t realize how bias this guy is till u go to his Twitter😭😭😭😭
This album is definitely one of the albums in one of the years of music.
Tems is a lady. Tems is a &#39;she&#39;.<br><br>I came here to listen to your thoughts on Tems and i feel bad I have to point that out.
Girls Want Girls is great for karaoke - I&#39;m always trashed when I choose Drake song and I also like to trail off mid-song: &quot;Girls want girls uhhgirlswangirlsuh&quot;
I, for one, thought it was brave that Drake came out as a lesbian.
How did drake think 2 sexy was a hit. And the music video omg
Cᴇʀᴛɪғɪᴇᴅ Bᴏʏ Lᴏᴠᴇʀ
Too sexy is for the guy who gets champagne drunk at a club and has his boys carry out
Damn Anthony! tell me u really hated the album while telling me u really really hated the album. Like sheesh my guy! I thought it was mid too... I thought Donda was better too... but wow this was kinda mean lolz.
I wish drake was having a hundredth of as much fun on this album as he seemed to be having with the Way 2 Sexy video. Was it the best video? No. But it seemed tongue-in-cheek in a way that this album should’ve been, especially judging by the cover. I think Drake takes himself way too fucking seriously and can’t let anything go. He needs a breather record because this kinda pettiness and self-seriousness is probably as bad for his mental health as it is for his public image and music.
Looks like Kanye defeated Drake. &quot;Donda&quot; could be pretty all over the place at times, but damn was it an interesting LP. Took me a good couple listens to really appreciate what it was going for. &quot;CLB&quot; had me totally bored halfway through it.
RED FLANNEL
Little Simz new album is a 10 that’s all I’m thinking about… I could care less about the cringe god
Car battery bars &gt; CLB
Melon pulled no punches 😭
I did enjoy champagne poetry but I literally fell asleep trying to listen to the full thing witch should not be the reaction from a Drake album
greenthony screentano here!
Bro you always talk so highly of Lil Baby but you gave My Turn such a low score....redo??
Before listening to way 2 sexy, I saw a comment that said “this song is made for TikTok” and as soon as I heard it come on, I lost my shit at the fact that there’s a possibility that this man made a song just for TikTok. Crazy
Score is so low Drake might be attracted to it.
Anthony you can&#39;t give the album a 3 only because Drake is a lesbian
I think we all expected Fantano to not like this album. He&#39;s pretty much made it clear that he doesn&#39;t like the majority of Drake&#39;s music, so I came into this thing totally unsurprised.<br><br>FYI, I liked Donda and CLB, but I can&#39;t compare the two.
I agree with this review but champagne poetry was heat
But did you see kawhi on the music video🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
U Kanye fans are dumb af lol
people love to hate, Anthony has always felt drake🤰🏽🤰🏽🤰🏽 certified nobody💀
this album sucked
Kanye doesn’t even have to diss Drake, Fantano did it for him 😭
Akademiks literally spelt while listening to this after saying he loves the dude lol
nice to see the donda vinyl in the background
Its official now, donda won
wtf is the cover
“But honestly, this track’s greatest sin is being so goddamn boring that, while I’m listening to it, I kind of want to just hook a car battery up to my nuts just to get some kind of mental stimulation” (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=358">5:58</a>)<br>Melon sounds like MoistCr1TiKaL
It isnt nothing was the same anymore , more like nothing was different.
too late melon I already hate this album… oh wait
Bro i love the yms vibes on this review
Don’t understand Drake fans. He has been doing the same trash songs since 2016. Unless you haven’t listened to Take Care there is legit no reason to think Drake is still good lmao. His popularity carries him. Not his music
Certified Lover Melon
no
Horrible album
the way 2 sexy slander is criminal
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=833">13:53</a> Tems is a female if im not mistaken melon
why are you acting like he didn’t play match 14th for kanye before story of addidon even dropped bozo
I know you are a professional music critic, but it caught me by surprise that you just slept for 16 minutes during the video then said &quot;drake, more like: i cannot listen to your music awake&quot;
Certified Melon Boy
This will be the last review of yours I watch. It’s been a good run. Taking points off TSU because you think you know what’s best for the stripper does it for me. Drakes a story teller you you were interested in the story. You liked it. It’s been a good ride melon, unsubscribed.
Drake needs to experiment outside of his comfort zone. At this point, he’s dropped too many bad projects consecutively that even inflated streaming numbers can’t hide. Once the next internet trend pops up and drakes numbers go down, there will be nothing left for him to lean on other than the work he has created, and that’s going to be bad for him. He has nothing to lose. His fans will eat up anything he puts out. Just try a new sound and dig yourself out of this hole you’ve put yourself in. Fuck.
Yelling Kiki at the top of your lungs while twerking is not a review anthony
The chipmunk in champagne poetry comes from the song Michelle by the Beatles btw
Drake needs to go to the Principal’s office honestly.

ATTACH A CAR BATTERY TO YOUR WHAT? LMFAOOO<br>fantano&#39;s going crazy on this review, and he&#39;s spitting
I don’t understand the cover of this album, I can’t believe it is so ridiculous. I don’t know if it’s just me or the cover is really that bad.
🤷🏾‍♂️. Personally i liked it. I think Champagne Poetry, especially first half is s certified banger. I think theres a fair amount of hits on it. “No friends” gets stuck in my head. Idk 🤷🏾‍♂️
can anyone else guess the score like a third in? I&#39;m 5/5
17 minutes!! Dang 😂
Fantano wearing Donda Merch while CLB review shows that he is a true Kanye fan.
CLB was a waste of my time
You say that you a lesbian, melon me too.
You Only live Twice has beat of the Year so far
not fantano thinking being friends w people means getting high classified people on your songs
I’m a huge drake fan and I didn’t like a single song on this project
I’m actually dumber From listening to this. This isn’t even a review it’s just hate disguised as a review. Your bias against drake makes your words mean nothing. The boy lives rent free in you and Kanye’s head. Before you go and gaslight ppl who call you a clown🤡 it’s just my opinion .

Wooo
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=530">8:50</a> How do you manage to paint paying a sex worker to do sex work as manipulation...
Drake has fallen off from number 1, the events is Spotify’s #1 artist from monthly listeners, that is a starting indicator IMO as usually when he drops an album, he usually went almost straight away to #1, over the coming years I think we will have more to go off.
Drake is literally just copying Nav at this point
Oh boy, another boring ass drake album, I can&#39;t wait
this is it guys, its over, we got donda, it was good, melon-man didn&#39;t liked the drake one, so now he go back to our lives after 1 month of Kanye shenanigans. See you guys at the kendrick hype thread.
Anthony, you can&#39;t just say CLB is a 10/10 because Drake dropped Life of the Party, its not even his song!
Drake is the most overhyped artist of all time and he&#39;s only had about 4 okay songs his whole career. Really never understood why people ride him so hard. He&#39;s also a shitty person
Too high
Drake is ass on CLB

Theis is the one time I agree with you is on my fav artists album.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=365">6:05</a> this is definitely gonna be a meme AHAHAHAHAH
I was Incredibly underwhelmed sounds like every other song he’s ever made he’s not a very versatile artist
The album cover is enough to tell you that the album will be lacking substance and is just trying to be trendy locking itself in a time period using an emoji joke ..as an album cover
I love how u look like u bouta fall asleep during this review 😂😂
Certified Boy Lover more like immaright?
First bad drake album ever. So sad. This is what happens when you sit on music too long. The stuff that was on the album a year ago would have been amazing.
how is this worse than scorpion to you bruh
Scorpion was drake’s worst project, only for him to drop CLB and make everyone appreciate and revisit Scorpion’s highlights and realize Scorpion is better than CLB
She said she a melon I said girl me too 🍈
U know he don&#39;t get pussy drake music hit different when u get pussy lol
I get it&#39;s your opinion but you&#39;re talking like you want everyone to hate the album/Drake as much as you do and that&#39;s weird bro
We need a partition for the ghost writers of those nice RnB jams to come back🤔💯
This rating... It pleases me 😈😭😭
just here to hear this grown ass man hate on another grown ass man
1st track sounded good, but sampling the Beatles while having that extremely obnoxious forearm tattoo makes that sample an L
This album would have definitely gotten a 7 if it had a blank cover.
Melon just smoked all of the tracks without even hesitate lmao
we know what the red button-up means
drake absolutely went off on Over The Top but it’s a shame he was washed by the goat smiley 🐐☠️🙏
You could say... everything was the same
Here before Los Pollos slobs up Drake while yelling at this truthful vid
i would have disliked if you gave CLB a good score so here&#39;s a like
I don’t like the album too but you repeatedly hated on drake for not performing up to par as his features yet on Donda kanye does the same and u didn’t say anything
I heard this quote that was said to Tyler, The Creator by Pharrell Williams: &quot;There&#39;s a difference between getting old and getting older. Getting older is getting wiser, while some people get old, they just stay in the same lane doing the same thing for too long.&quot; In reference to this, I definitely think Drake is getting very old at this point. <br><br>P.S - That car battery line was amazing. It had me in tears 😂
Such a hater
wow fantano calling yourself an lover boy for 17 mins isnt a review
This man shouldn’t ever be able to review rap music again LOL CLB is a 8-9/10
What a year Ksi albums got rated higher than drake albums
As a drake fan this album disappointed me
Drake really made a “Certified L Boy”
Anthony, you can&#39;t just add 3 points for the &quot;say that you a lesbian, girl, me too” bar.
this deserves a 3, not swimming
Pls just give Little Simz a 10 Melon just do it already
Been waiting for this😂😂
I felt that car battery line, in my nuggets
melon please. we all know you gave it a 3 bc you didn’t get pregnant after listening to it.
Easily the most aggressively mediocre Drake album out.
Maaaan I&#39;m not letting you review hip hop albums anymore... you thought views was wack??? What??
ITS JUST SOO BORINGGG THE SONGS SOUND ROBOTIC AND SOULESS
Listened to this and was like yeah this def getting a 3 from Fantano
Not the hero we deserved, but the hero we needed. Melon for the win.
Imagine,Trippie Redd&#39;s album got a higher rating than Certified Mid Boy
No ones gonna mention “I’d rather hook a car battery to my nuts than listen to girls like girls”?
I was working while listening to this album and holy shit when “ 2 sexy” came on I literally had to skip it . Future is a god awful artist .
People can&#39;t be mentioning Ye and Drake in the same sentence again lol
FUCK YEAHHHHHHHHHHHH
“Absolutely no teasers” ?? Can’t tell if that’s sarcasm
Finally we can settle the CLB vs DONDA debate
“We look at how Kanye mostly sidestepped this [beef] during his record, yet here we see drake totally obsessing over it”. Drake sidestepped the pusha beef in scorpion and you clowned on him for not responding to pusha and Adidon(watch the scorpion review if you want proof), yet now when he does respond to a beef he is the obsessive one? Sounds like he can’t win either way in your eyes melon. I’m not really sure how much drake is really obsessing over the beef anyways when it is mentioned in like 3-4 songs across the whole album.
I don&#39;t think giving this a low score because Drake said he&#39;s a lesbian is okay, Melon.
10/10 REVIEW MY FAX COUNTER BROKE
i feel like i’ve been waiting 9 months for this review.
Thought the album was great
I still couldn&#39;t believe way 2 sexy is an actual drake song w future.
I don&#39;t think giving this a low score because Drake said he&#39;s a lesbian is okay, Melon.
I don&#39;t think giving this a low score because Drake said he&#39;s a lesbian is okay, Melon.
FINALLY POG
It is confirmed. Donda &gt; CLB
i thought the travis feature was great tbh but okay
Most agreeable review ever!
Scorpion was a 4, this gets a 3... By the end of the decade, Drake&#39;s gonna release a 17-hour album that gets the first -1.
Holy fuck this album cover sucks
W for ye

Red flannel? <b>Excuse me, let me just block out my WHOLE afternoon!</b> 🍿 🍉
3/10 LETS GOOOO
I listened to this album probably 4-5 times in the car thinking I was missing something, because everyone kept saying how good it was. I was searching for punchlines I may have missed or beats that would grow on me and make more sense this time around. I starting to think im not missing anything here. Kanye&gt;Drake
NO WAY LMFAOOOOOOOO
hearing drake call himself a lesbian turned me straight
CLB merch is better than CLB

Ngl this was harsh! i can see a 5-6 but a 3?!? Damn
Donda&gt;CLB <br>Btw Tems is a female singer
Red Flannel. Get the axe out. 💥🪓
lets be honest an album with an emoji cover was never going to be great
I just love hearing people dunk on Drake, I&#39;ve always found him, and his music insufferable. I think sicko mode was the only time I&#39;ve found his presence on a track tolerable.
I hated Way 2 Sexy at first but it somehow grew on me and now I’m shaking my ass to it alone in my room.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=837">13:57</a> aye tems is a girl brah
You just made me look at that album “art” for 17 minutes, how dare you
Would rather listen to the donda opening track for the length of CLB than listen to CLB again.
Tems is a she melon, how dare you!!
Tbh this album made me appreciate Donda even more
one of his three favorite tracks didn’t even have drake on it... 😭
best birthday gift, ty
Off season was a better thought out and executed project than clb or donda
It’s actually pretty cringe how closely after Donda he dropped this.
Melon, when will you stop talking about the album cover and review the music?

CLB and DONDA are def two of the worst albums these guys have put out. On the bright side, they are making lots of money from it 🤷🏾‍♂️
I        Agree
It’s ok Drake fans. You shouldn’t take melon boys opinion too seriously because he’s obviously bias. This dude is highkey a weirdo for how much he hates on Drake. Anyone with normal functioning eardrums knows this isn’t a light to decent 3.
Quadeca was wrong 😿
Donda&gt;CLB confirmed. Thx antnee
😈😈😈
Donda &gt; CLB
Agreed!
If only all the annoying drake stans could understand the words coming out your mouth
You already used &quot;Nothany Waythano&quot; on the Ye review, you&#39;re recycling material you melonheaded man
Based review
Hater channel?   Got it!
Kanye good, drake bad  10/3
A light 3 is exactly what it deserves
Melon, valid points, extremely well thought out and detailed review with valid critiques about the album as well as extra well attention to detail.<br><br><br>Disliked and Unsubbed.
the actual album aside (which i quite enjoyed), i actually despise the album art. it might be the worst thing i&#39;ve ever laid my eyes on. emojis of 12 pregnant woman of different races... damien hurst is a genuine criminal. blows my mind that he gets away with this nonsense.
Is no one going to talk about the disgusting plastic surgery bars lil baby dropped??? I mean I love lil baby but that shit wasn’t right
When I see Travis Scott in public <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=198">3:18</a>
oh shit
This was hard to watch.
I personally like the album cause I really like that style in the album but I still agree that this album deserves a 3
&quot;This album is called CLB but it should&#39;ve been called CTE because that&#39;s what I got from it, after I finished listening to it&quot; oh man Melon is not holding back.
Do Iron Maidens album
It’s a bad album
just because the album lacked car battery lyric and references doesnt mean CLB deserved such a low score. disappointing review Loverboy Boytano
He looked so annoyed from the 5 second mark lmao

We got Donda vinyl behind, THANK GOD FOR THIS REVIEW 🙏🏼
Melon you can’t just call drake the best rapper alive and give this album a 10
I just felt like Drake had a lot of songs he really hated sitting in a shared Google drive and once he knew when Kanye was dropping, he was like “suddenly I like these.”
Look at Melon flexing all the babymommas he got
Yebba’s Heartbreak is the best song on this album
A dude claiming “I’m a lesbian too” is absolutely 20 yrs late …
Certified Lullaby Boy
TND streams are like the Donda listening parties and the actual reviews are like the official release
W melon 👏🏾
Drake owes me an hour and twenty six minutes of my life back
I think if melon noticed the album cover behind him clb would have gotten a NOT GOOD
CLB a 7/10 and I will not settle for less
If Drake didn’t come out as lesbian, you would’ve given this at least a 7/10
if you don’t like drake then say that🤔
Very mature of you to have Donda behind you the entire time.
you use to call me my cell phoe
The red flannel makes me smile thank you melon man
You probably should of give it a 0 now Kanye goin leak your address too
just realized that u own the genesis owusu vinyl, when did u get it? for real its probably gonna be my aoty
I love most of drakes albums, but this one was just bad, even the cover art is bad
Damn. A 3 tho. The songs definitely grew on me
Kanye 7 drake 3 = 10
Donda &gt;&gt;
I feel like Fantano has similar criticism here as he has on Donda but blah blah blah Kanye is a “genius™️” and Drake is “stuck narratively.” To be clear: both records are uninteresting, but for some reason it’s more on Drake than Kanye is kind of preposterous.
You verbalized my thoughts on this album perfectly. Thank you!<br><br><br><br><br><br>Unsubscribed
And I thought Donda was weak.  This is hot garbage.
If this was named certified boy lover you would have given this a 10.
same stuff he always releases, also he called himself a lesbian<br>3 is a bit high for me
AYE FANTANO YOU PUT THE DONDA VINYL IN THE BACK TO KEEP THE BEEF GOIN
It&#39;s just so surprising there&#39;s so few songs that sound like actual hits. Say what you want about Drake and the quality of his music but he normally knows how to make songs that the radio is gonna love.
Even Melon agrees that Donda&gt; Certified Minor Toucher
It&#39;s been a MINUTE since I&#39;ve seen Melon look so over a review while in the middle of reviewing it lol
Album was boring trash. <br>I&#39;d still take &quot;Fair Trade&quot; and &quot;TSU&quot; over anything on DONDA though.
Fantano HATES Drake lmao
&quot;I&#39;ll just go with how long is my wiener&quot; not a fair justification for a 3 Anthony...
“Said you a lesbian, girl me too” is the ultimate Drake line when you think about it. It’s him trying way too hard to be relatable to the point of ridicule, like when he takes on those fake accents and tries to act tough. He’s a panderer with a serious identity crisis. Drake spent so much time building up that “Free Smoke”  persona, which was shattered by Pusha T, that I’m not even sure he knows who he is.
anthony loves donda so much more he got a shirt with the donda album cover all over it
🗑 this album is trash same Drake since 2011….Donda is way better
Nice review Anthony, but I feel like that 10-minute segment about why pregnant women are your preferred choice for sexual intercourse really wasn&#39;t necessary
Saw the red flannel and thought “Aww, for me? Is it my birthday?”
It’s official. KSI &gt; Drake
Think we can all agree that this album isn’t close to Donda
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=365">6:05</a>
I knew this album would be bad the second I saw the cover art
CLB was a huge disappointment. I have to say Donda was a pleasant shock for me. Kanye tapped into his emotions and real life. Drake just talked about surface crap and gave us nothing to work with.
r/Kanye is gonna love this one
followed for the 3/10 tbh
J Cole is like if Drake made actual music
Yall ever notice how the, theneedledrop and fantano guy look oddly similar?
Ye literally invented the chipmunk soul
Hahaha drake was never good enough to write his own lyrics anyway 👌
If MBDTF is a 6, it&#39;s only fair that CLB is a 10. Good job melon. Not afraid to tell it like it is. 👌🏾
Thank you Anthony
Hey... This isn&#39;t Little Simz...
Shit😂😂😂😂
Car battery nut, call that a ball of energy.
Best review of the album yet!
Lil b did the lesbian line better n like 10yrs ago 🥴
CLB is garbage, go listen to The Off Season instead
KSI GOT A BETTER SCORE. WTF
This man has always hated drake lmao
&#39;Drake makes it worse<br>With a very underwritten verse&#39;<br><br>Hits harder than any bars on this album
Alright,darke is getting better
How tf did you get the donda vinyl?!?!??
Nice Donda vinyl
Drake drops better singles than songs on his actual album
Where&#39;s the comment about the album cover tho ?
“Hook a car battery to my nuts to get some mental stimulation”<br><br>Baaaaaaaarss!!!
Drake has solid production, can sing and rap well when he feels like it, but he has absolutely nothing interesting to say at this point
Yeah spot on. This album is awful
MELON you cant just take away 7 points because the albums horrible
3 😭lmao
Drake needs to retire bruh
LMFAOOO
I actually enjoyed both Donda and Clb I can’t  break down into details why I liked or disliked songs like Melon Boy but my ears just enjoyed both projects 🤷🏽‍♂️
why you so mad melon head? you&#39;re starting to come off just like a hater. not being objective at all. BUT i will agree...this album sucks

Wow Melon, I’m so glad someone finally also agrees that CLB is a 10. So tired of the groupthink, hopefully the fact that you gave this album a 10 will make some people reconsider their perspective!
Classic album
Yeah,3/10 ....i am truly happy....<br>Drake&#39;s revival

This man hates drake
Way better then Donda grow up.
Anthony, you can&#39;t just give this a 3 and expect us not to think that this is because Drake is a lesbian.
I&#39;m no snitch but if someone else wants to report this murder then I won&#39;t say anything.

Anthony, you clearly forgot that Drake was co-parent of the year when you gave this a 3 :/
Ut oh Red Flannel!
HA
Wow, we’re getting a red flannel 3 for Drake, and then a yellow flannel 10 for little simz in the next review
Anthony it’s Certified LOVER Boy not Certified BOY Lover Epstein was not featured on any track
Perhaps you can equate this to how Conor McGregor is a worse fighter the more successful he is
Music to my ears
Can’t believe people’s opinion are changing just because this guy didn’t like the album
Last time I get this early my second child was conceived
Kanye about to restart the groupchat and put the “I won” thanos meme with the link to this review on the chat.
CLB. Certified Low Bar
I was expecting a 2
Mans got a Donda pillow on his shelf
Shoulda gave it a NOT GOOD melon man
CLB is a pop album. Only a few songs will stay in my rotation
Ksi &gt;&gt;&gt; drake confirmed
&quot;I kinda wanna just like hook up a car battery to my nuts just to get some kind of mental stimulation&quot; damn 😂
I think in recent years this drakes best because he had more fun on this album but I can’t even argue with the points he’s making … I wish he’d drop something undeniably good bro I’m tired of this same stuffs
only thing i come back to is champagne poetry - fun fact that sample is the beatles’ “michelle”, taken from the beat for the masego song “navajo”
Remember when Kanye reminisce about when his overlords thought that “we can throw on features if the rapping is whack”? That’s kind of what CLB was.
Can we please talk about how this album has the worst fucking album cover ever made?
Certified Slumber Boy
You forgot to review Yebba’s Heartbreak, Track 11 on the record.
Love you melon 🍉
I genuinely don’t understand how people enjoy way 2 sexy
What an inspirational way to come out as a lesbian. Very proud of you Melon 🏳️‍🌈
You didn’t call him Champagne Papi with your soft voice. Disliked, unsubscribed, reported, hit man hired stay safe this evening fantano
Youre obviously just mad drake has a Brazillian butt lift and you dont, melon.
PLEASE ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE MYSELF...
Now I can Rest In Peace knowing the debate is over. Donda &gt; CLB
Remember the old Drake?
certified boy lover
Melon savage on this he gotta chill 💀
CLB is payback for Lift Yourself . <br><br>drake making money off the free hype, then he’s gonna release his new music.!
Lospollostv already crying into his drake  body pillow
Shit album.<br>His early works from 2009 to 2013 are dope
CLB sound like an AI-generated Drake album. We are truly living in the future.
way 2 sexy is way 2 fire ur trippin melon
wow you really slaughtered this one melon
oh no drakebros we got too cocky
DAMNNNNNN i mean melons speaking facts it was a snooze fest, donda was better
Drake really likes the number 3.
Putting the Donda vinyl at the background huh? Melon really wants some beef
Turn that 3 upside down it&#39;s an E now
Anthony you can&#39;t say you wanna beat up pregnant women just because CLB was so bad
Just realised ksi got a higher score than drake
I take it he&#39;s team Kanye? Lol This is more of a review on drake than it is on the album hahaha definitely a bloated album and not drake&#39;s best. You could cut this album in half the same as donda, and both albums would shine so much better, As far as it sounds musically.
Music aside CLB and Donda had some terrible album covers
So kanye officially won.... good to know
Bro… CLB was so FLAT in energy! Even his OLD sound doesn’t hit the same anymore…
donda winner
Damn! I thought it be a light 4. I missed by 1 😭 but I agree with everything Anthony said. The songs and beats were so mid. And I&#39;m a Drake fan. But this one was so disappointing. Scorpion was way better, rap wise and R&amp;B. Not to mention Donda, which was an emotional experience on its own. Just think of cudi on donda, compared to CLB. Another level, words cannot describe. And it sucks. Drake could and should have done better. Oh well, maybe next time. 🤦🏽‍♀️😭
Fantano loves to hate on Drake because he makes shitty cashgrab music but if he made something decent y&#39;all would be praising him. I&#39;m done with this guy smh
This album sounds like drake actually wrote it
KSI got a higher score than this twice
this was the nicest 3 you&#39;ve given
The debate is over everybody donda&gt;certified lover boy.His words not mine.
3 was generous for this
Dude called the N 2 Deep instrumental a left over Travis Scott song, without even acknowledging it&#39;s Get Throwed by Bun B and Pimp C 🤡🤡🤡
Coming from a Certified Melon
I feel bad that melon had to listen to this album more than once in order to review it
KSI has a better album than Drake ....we really do live in a simulation!
Shit crazy
Way 2 sexy for a yellow flannel
Honestly I fucking hate drakes music.
Really wanted a Not Good
Still a better rating than I thought this album deserved
should have been at least a 2/10 just for that album cover.
nice
thank you melon, I can finally tell my friends that this album is trash with confidence
I knew the red flannel was coming
Anthony, how did you get the Donda vinyl already?
Way 2 sexy is not the worst.
That album art is keeping me from listening to it
Hopefully los reacts to this
Com’ on Melon, On CLB, Drake was going hard, had a personality, was Interesting, GREAT FEATURES, actually Spitting bars, and making it entertaining at least.<br><br>Meanwhile, On Scorpion, Drake WAS SO BORING, AWFUL, BAD FEATURES (Besides Jay-Z), SLEEP INDUCING, AND BARlEY ANY SUBSTANCE BESIDE A VERY FEW TRACKS, The Rap side was Meh, BUT THE R&amp;B SIDE WERE GARBAGE!!! <br><br>Yet You Gave Scorpion (a record drake barley tried on.) a 4/10, Meanwhile you gave CLB (A Record Drake actually put effort into) A 3/10.<br><br>Worst than the MBDTF Redux Review.<br><br>But I still love you Daddy Melon and I hope to someday rub your Bald Head like Birdman so I could get 6-7 Years of Luck.
Idk Melon, saying it’s the album of the decade is kinda pushing it
To be completely honest, a 3/10 is much higher than I ever expected.
donda album on the right side, you ain&#39;t slick meloney
The album cover alone put me off ever listening to this
Worst album cover of the year? Worse than Kanye’s at least, and he didn’t even have one.
the kanye stans gon love this one
Nah it’s better than Donda
I think you always conflate your own problems with Drake&#39;s drama, personality and brand with your review of the actual music on his albums. The production on his albums is always top notch, industry-standard. He&#39;s always been a good rapper, but has gotten better at combining memorable wordplay with storytelling elements. The features are typically dope. CLB is filled with bangers. Donda is great in its own way, but is experimental, messy, and feels unfinished to me. Difference of opinion, but you seem to give Kanye the benefit of the doubt and go into Drake reviews with a predetermined mindset that you&#39;re not going to like it. Love you though. Keep up the otherwise great work.
KSI is better than Drake. <br><br><br><br><br><br><b>I said it</b> 😤
I was actually more hyped for the hilarious review then I was for the album
guys don&#39;t be mad, atleast drake isn&#39;t getting a NOT GOOD.
The hate for this project is really blowing my mind...
Anthony saying &quot;Way 2 Sexy&quot; for 17 minutes is not a review
“certified snoozer” damn melon really out here catchin bodies
I&#39;d rather listen to a Qanon conspiracist incoherently complain about CRT than listen to CLB.
Drake&#39;s album was so mid that I actually fell asleep during this review
I understand your discomfort with the song Girls Want Girls, but telling us you&#39;d like to hook a car battery to your melons is violently inappropriate.
Here we FUCKIN GO BOYS
Dang he even had the Donda vinyl in the background for this
terrible terrible take. ur ytness is showing.
You’re racist for this… downvotes
Damn ksi debut album got a better score than clb 💀
Been waiting for this literally all week. Thank you Fantano!
Agreed. CLB sucks.
very homophobe review, melon
We need to face it that Drake is making songs for the memes tbh. I guess any publicity is good publicity
What if drake dropping a doozy was part of his plan. Outsell Ye with a terrible album while he makes a heartfelt piece of art about his mother and faith.
Lolololololololooololololol
Imagine hating N 2 Deep
fantano is a nerd ass jock hater as always 🙄
his worst album yet. you let the light skins down without a doubt this time Aubrey, this mid pack isn’t even getting me high. 0 risk, 0 hits, minimal effort 🤦🏽‍♂️
That car battery joke was gold
3 is a little generous
Remember guys, in this life you&#39;re either certified lover boy or a certified boy lover.
Gonna review Westside Gunn&#39;s HWH8: Sincerely Adolf?
So KSI &gt; Drake
You’re really not going to address the cover melon?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=247">4:07</a> “chipmunk-ed soul on the instrumental” that’s The Beatles bro
Drake is unfortunately too big to fail. People have convinced themselves that he makes good music for far too long.
Are we gonna ignore the fact that the DONDA vinyl is just sitting in the back? 10/10 review
This album should&#39;ve been called Certified Deadbeat Dad
Tems is a woman
Already knew this was a 3 before even watching
Certified Light 3 Boy
On God Drake is a Certified Boy Lover
That car battery on the nuts line really came out of nowhere Melon, 3/10
Agree. This is not Drake&#39;s best album. There are probably only 2 or 3 songs I would replay. 🧐💯
Love the way Fantano gets into the deeper themes at play. This vid reminds me why its so fun to hear his opinion
Drake
Wallace Wells : If you want something bad, you have to fight for it. Step up your game, Scott. Break out the L-word.<br>Scott Pilgrim : Lesbian?<br>Wallace Wells : The other L-word.<br>Scott Pilgrim : ...Lesbians?<br><b>Drake takes note of this</b>
I appreciate the “donda” vinyl in the background
“I want to put a car battery up to my nuts” Well damn Melon, that was the killshot to this album.
here before los rages
The only thing that album cover does is make me think about the ‘now draw them giving birth’ meme.
I give it a hard 3 or flaccid 6.
W
CERTIFIED SOY BOY
Year of features it seems.
Drake is good. CLB is fine. He’s talented so he effortlessly makes music that’s fine. CLB is disappointing tho. I agree that it sounds like he doesn’t have the inspiration that he once had. His skill is there and probably as good as it’s ever been, but he’s in such a different place than he was in the past. I don’t think he’s “changed” in a bad way or that he’s not the same person he was, but his music used to be very honest and vulnerable. His topics used to be based heavily on real relationships and now the main topics are based on random girls and his power as a guy at the top. It’s not as relatable and I don’t think it’s what his life is truly about. I’d love to hear truly honest lines about his family life, how he’s feeling about the Kanye situation, etc. but instead we basically got “pull up on me and see what happens, you’re gonna get put on a Gildan”.
did he call tems a “he”?
24k views in 29 mins. This one is hitting a mil.
So it’s official, Donda &gt; CLB
Tems is a woman not a man <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=836">13:56</a>
I’m not about to watch all this shit that could’ve been said under 10 minutes, just tell me what he rated it
He sounds like he was forced to do this
Im actually getting nervous. The only hope for 2021 now music wise is Kendrick and Travis.
Champagnepapi had a ‘lil too much to drink on this one
Yessir Kanye
Why, god why
“And they all kissed and got super pregnant. The End.” -Luigi
This review combines all the comments I have made to Drake stans saying it is some of his best work the last few days.. thank you for this beautiful of a review and actually taking an honest deep dive on the album and what it is good for and is oh so lacking of.
Crazy how Drake has dropped 5 records since If you&#39;re reading this, and hasn&#39;t evolved AT ALL as an artist in any of those records.
Is it just me or does it some like drake has stuck to the same formula for like 5 years now?
You&#39;re just jealous of the ladies on the cover
I FUCKING LOVE YOU MELON!! YOU UNDERSTAND 😭😭
You can&#39;t just say &quot;I&#39;m a lesbian too&quot; and then give this album a 10
love to see you loved donda so much you put the vinyl behind while reviewing clb melon!
Okay Drake, you like strippers, I get it and i don&#39;t care.....
Anthony, saying “Certified Boy Lover” and laughing hysterically at your own joke is not a review
Can we all agree that the Rick Ross - Lil Wayne feature was fire?
Cool now REVIEW INTROVERT
sorry to spoil it but he gives it a strong 0 to light 1
When you see the red flannel you already know it&#39;s coming
Drake is corporate now.  Feeling a Light to Decent 0 on this one.
That car battery line was some of the best poetry I’ve heard from melon in years
someone had to say it. CLB but without the C and B
Anthony, I know you’re not a fan of this record, but I think calling calling Tems a man was taking things a bit too far
The features are the best thing on the album
3/10 by fantano not bad
no anthony, 17 minutes of explaining how you&#39;re  &quot;submissive and breedable&quot; and should be on the cover is not a review
If this album has so many references to Drake and Kanye’s beef, how fast did this album come together???
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=364">6:04</a> OMFG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
As a sorta Drake stan, a 3/10 is fair even though I like some of the songs<br><br>Way 2 Sexy was god awful
IMY2 was the best song
Tems *she you said he
Melon did you really find it necessary to show yourself hooking a car battery to your nuts?
Review Westside Gunn🙄🙄
One number on the score redacted for the album art alone
Making a CLB review and not mentioning the album cover is an achievement in itself
LETS GO THE GOAT HAS SPOKEN. DONDA IS AOTY
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=456">7:36</a> way to sexy. Way to sexy is the banger for sure because of future and young thug. Its going to be a classic like walk it like I talk with the migos. But I see what drake was doing he is trying to keep up with the times now a days you have to have some kind of tic tok dance hook and if you can get an old beat cleared so you can use it it&#39;s a plus like the makeing my way down town walking fast white girl song that a rapper hopped on not to long ago people want to hear that old beat but mix with a new sound weird example but that what I came up with the old/new hook beat formula
Fantano is just a lame Drake hater
You’re just mad that you aren’t a lesbian like Drake is
Los if your seeing this it’s ok, it’s a pretty good album
Donda officially better than clb. I knew it
Drake is the goat + all time classic + ratio + mid-thony mid-tano
Lospollostv punching the air rn
Oh BOY
I understand you found this project good, but I don’t think adding 4 points shooting it to a 9/10 just because of the album cover is very fair
Drake fell off. Hood listens to peppa pig now
You only gave it a 3 because this album is way too sexy for you Melon.
Project Pat&#39;s verse was the only good part of the album
Incoming angry Drake fans that called this album a classic 2 hours after it came out
needle drop is so goated for this
That line on Girls like Girls is the grossest, least funnily portrayed Shiite heard in rap in a LONG time
this the shit that gets you unsubscribed, fucking A
He want to be different so bad
Kanye&#39;s obviously gave Melon some globglogabgalab for this one
Wow, Nas KD2 got a better rating than both Donda and CLB
Certified Not Good
Coming out as a lesbian for 16 minutes isn’t a review, watermelon
*sees red flannel<br>Yes……very good
Donda in the back?
The black cloth in the background to represent Donda is just salt on the wounds
Shoulda been a 2/10
I like how honest he is w this album... I AGREE W HIS OPINION THIS TIME
This lp sucked
Honestly surprised that it escaped the NOT GOOD rating.
Saw this score coming from miles away.
At least Kanye produces his own music and admits it when someone helped him write songs. Drake is the type of guy I don&#39;t have to personally meet to know he&#39;s taking advantage of 18 year old fans on the regular. He&#39;s always given off sleazeball vibes. His chart dominance still baffles me.
OH MY FUCKING GOD, BEFORE CLICKING THE VIDEO I THOUGHT HE WOULD USE NOTHONY WAYTANO AS INTRO AND HE DID NO CAP!!!!
It&#39;s the only album I liked from him since 2015 😂
Girls want girls is one of the worst songs of all time
Gotta give it to Drake, he really know how to milk his 2016 sound..
this album was wack
LMAOOOOOO THE SCORE
The fact Melon compared the worst promoted song &quot;Way 2 Sexy&quot; by Drake to &quot;Hot Shower&quot; by Chance the Rapper, really showed how bad it was gonna be, to begin with
I told all of y’all it would be a 3!! Nobody listened xD
This album is some of the most creatively bankrupt shit I&#39;ve ever heard from Drake. He has become so obsessed with flexing his wealth and status and beefing with other artists that he&#39;s forgotten what made him come up in the first place: good music.<br><br>CLB deserves all the criticism it is getting. An enormous L for Drake, and I really hope he manages to perform better next time. He really shouldn&#39;t have leaked that Kanye song, because that one had more heart in it with Andre 3000&#39;s bars than the entirety of this record.
The cover art really did set the tone for the album…here’s a polished turd that I will call art
Drake doesn&#39;t mention his son by name once on this album, only ever as &quot;my son&quot;.<br>Like the same tone as &quot;my car&quot; or whatever. Pretty lame
dang Quadeca slippin. he said youd give Donda a 6 and this a 4
If you&#39;re reading this it&#39;s too late is still hands down Drake&#39;s best project
LOL
Drake deserved that 3/10.
Once again fantano, never fail to hate on drake for no reason !
Now this is what you call a good and unbiased review, that 3 is even a lot for CLB.
&quot;I kinda wanna hook a car battery up to my nuts&quot;, me to melon, me too.
There is nothing “Certified” about this album, and there is nothing about “love”, the one thing that Drake does get right is that he is a “boy” and not a man
They not finna agree with this one😂
I rate the review 10/10. Forever.
I’m glad you gave this album a 3/10
Please drake put in as much effort on the full album as you do on the intros
I thought this album was just  . . . Like . . . Ok
We should have known what kinda stuff Drake would be on considering the goofy album cover.
Should’ve used the sonic fan art cover in the green screen :(
i saw the red flannel and then i just got an instant dopamine hit
How anyone is saying this is a solid album is beyond me, this is easily Drake&#39;s most phoned in project to date, no matter how bad projects got before he at least sounded like he cared about making them, this is just mediocrity on a whole new level.
Incoming angry Drake fans that don’t listen to any other rappers except him
Kanye East has dropped better freestyle bars than Drake on this album
Scorpion should of been CLB and CLB should be scorpion.
i agree melon, &quot;certified lover boy&quot; is too many syllables for an album title.
honestly, this is probably your most generous rating in a while
CLB is bad, even by Drake lover’s standards
Taking a 17 minute nap is not a review Anthony
So drake comes out as a lesbian and u give him a 3 smh
Turn the 3 upside down....it&#39;s still a 3 wow
Still shocked drake released a song that’s not his that’s better than his album lmao
Ofc the Donda vinyl is chillin in the back
And let it be known:<br><br>On this day, the biggest artist roast of the 2020s so far happened
BRO BOTH FANTANO’S REVIEW OF CLB AND BIGQUINT’S DONDA REACTION DROPPED AT THE SAME TIME.<br><br>LETS FUCKING GOOOOOO!!!
Certified Melon Boy
Is that no love deep web on the shelf
certified early boy
I feel like I&#39;m in huge minority. I like the album and am looking forward to continue listening to it. Drake&#39;s formula works for me. I like the length and that there&#39;s a lot to devour. A lot of Melon&#39;s criticisms are parts of what I like about the project.<br><br>The Right Said Fred track and the lesbians line are stupid, though.
Tems is a girl
Donda: 7 CLB: 3 CASE CLOSED.
Lmao is that the Donda cover in the background
“Hook a car battery up to my nuts” is not something I expected to hear in a review of a Drake album
Anthony I was curious what your opinion was on the Juice WRLD snippet on IMY2. Personally I was kinda disgusted by Drakes inclusion. To just throw a Juice voice snippet on a song without any connection to him while he was alive and with the snippet having nothing to do with the song. It felt like Drake just trying to grab some headlines with the inclusion
Looking dead in the camera and calling Drake a &quot;wasteman&quot; is not a review Anthony.
Not the red
Wtf is even the album art
DONDA &gt; clb
Got damn the red flannel 🤣🤣🤪🤪
Melon got the donda record on the shelf
You&#39;re wrong AOTY🦉🦉🦉🦉
begging drake to be your certified lover boy doesn’t really constitute as a proper review but i appreciate you coming to your senses at the end and saying you’ll bring drake and kanye together to talk things through over coffee<br><br>abysmal video, 9/10
yo he copped donda in the bg
drake is the mcu of music
Melon keeps that Donda vinyl in the background as protection by the lord on this album review
Melon. Saying it’s bad because you don’t like lesbians was a little far
Anthony, do you want Drake to make a song about you?
Donda won no challenge
donda was a strong 8 melon, you will be hearing rom my people soon
i think donda and clb were just as mediocre but you&#39;re afraid of all the incels/kanye stans that follow u so u gave kanye the better grade.. pvssy
Wow you liked Scorpion more than CLB? Personally I think CLB is a better version of Scorpion, but I respect your opinion Anthony
One of the few times I agree with Melon
Ahhh. The sweet taste of a Kanye victory
I listened to &quot;Sometimes I Might Be Introvert&quot; with my nuts hooked up to a car battery and transcended the sonic limit on how much one can enjoy music.
3 is like a 7 for drake
there you have it…
I liked it and I haven&#39;t been a fan of his last few albums. Better than Donda for sure
donda better
Good review but it was kind of weird when you took your flannel off and started yelling &quot;I&#39;M TOO SEXY FOR THE TRAP&quot; when talking about &quot;Way 2 Sexy&quot;.
CLB is so damn mid for real
Yeah, say that you a 3/10, girl, me too
Reciting “Donda Chant” for 17 minutes isnt a review Anthony
this review comes to a surprise as nobody, drake a clown
Drake really ain’t gonna make another good project huh.  And the early teasing for this project made it seem like it would be an important album of his😂
This deserved a NOT GOOD just for that album cover jfc
Damn...he murdered Aubrey here, not gonna lie
My step mom got drunk off Long Island iced tea in a can and slept with Fred durst
I just knew the lesbian bar would be one of your favorites melon
After listening to the whole album I changed my review on Donda and gave it a 10. <br>Kinda similar to when you first see a baby&#39;s spoiled diaper and then someone vomit.<br>So you are like huh.. the first was not that bad..
lmaooo yes
Certified Plumber Boy
Drake&#39;s terrible run continues. Wonder if he&#39;s ever gonna get back to the pre-views days.
“Drake sounds the same , boring”<br><br><b>tries something new</b> <br><br>“ he ripping off other people sounds”
Kissing a drake cardboard cutout is your choice anthony, I dont judge but it isnt a review
I thought this album was a 4 tbh, I probably would’ve given it a lower rating if I listened to it more than once but this album wasn’t worth my time
Drake is still mad that he was bullied into being a good dad.
I loved the part where u gave CLB a 10 because there was a nav feature on it
I see you putting the donda cover art on your vinyl shelf
The Weeknd singing, “Race My Mind” would complete me. Although I do still enjoy it
“I just wanna hook a car battery up to my nuts to get some mental stimulation” this quote is what CLB is in a nutshell
It’s stupid how happy this Mellon man hating bad music makes me lmao
Sad melon faceThano 😔
Let&#39;s be honest: Pusha could have saved himself some time on making Story of Adidon by just asking Fantano to put all his Drake reviews in one video.
Drake got no leg to stand on with his beefs just like Jimmy&#39;s basketball career.
Melon, you can&#39;t give this a 3/10 just because Drake&#39;s son is white.
I would never recover from Anthony stating that he wants to hook a car battery up to his nuts
This album is certified garbage
uhhh thx for calling me a certified boy lover
i’m surprised you didn’t talk about the album cover
Champagne poetry literally uses the same royalty free beat as an old Casey neistat vlog. I’m not kidding
Drake took the hard L on CLB lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=364">6:04</a> <br>&quot;I kinda wanna just like hook a car battery up to my nuts&quot;<br> - Anthony Fantano 2021
if you like CLB more than DONDA then you may be entitled to compensation
Good for Aubrey
lmfao
Everyone say hi to Los reacting to this video!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=358">5:58</a> has to be one of Melon’s most underrated roasts
DONDA&gt;CLB
Everytime I click on this thumbnail I see Donda.
&quot;Certified Snoozer&quot; 💀💀💀
You’re a pretty nice guy to give this one a light three melon
When all Drakes songs sound the same….
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=359">5:59</a>, you’re welcome
I still can&#39;t get over the lesbian line. the hook reads like a conversation which implies Drake is hitting on a girl, she tells him she&#39;s a lesbian, without context this sounds like her form of rejecting drake, BUT THEN drake continues to pursue her by trying to relate and says he&#39;s lesbian too? just weird to rap about
kanye fans must be creaming their pants rn
10 Ö
Yess ssir
Worst cover art of the century
I wonder who pisses off melon more: NAV or Drake?
LOOOOOOOOOL LIGHT 3 IM DYING I KNEW IT WAS BAD BUT NOT A LIGHT 3 BAD
You know, I laughed when someone made that &quot;Now That&#39;s What I Call 7 Hours of Donda Chant&quot; image, but honestly that&#39;s beginning to sound better than this record
Drake makes music that generates clicks. He is the clickbait of music. And we all clicked. Will keep clicking. Drake is a brand. He may truly be an artist, but the world will percieve him as a market generated brand who appeals to the widest fucking audience, makes artistic decisions designed to generate controversy and conversation (and not in a kanye sort of way).
Tems is a woman
Drake can do better but he has no reason too, that&#39;s the problem. He&#39;ll sell the same either way
4 bad albums in a row, congrats Drake 👍🏼
We all knew it was gonna be a red flannel  review
Fellow Torontonian, the pro wrestler Christian used to be called a &quot;CLB&quot; back in the day.  It stood for &quot;creepy little bastard&quot; LOL
I don’t think he liked it
Lets go
Certified Mid lover
this is NOT a certified hood classic
No Melon, calling Drake a lightskin for 17 minutes isn&#39;t a review.
KSI GOT HIGHER THAN DRAKE. KSI&gt;DRAKE
yup mhm
Can&#39;t wait to see los Pollos&#39;s reaction to this.
Album was very underwhelming
You&#39;re fucking high Melon...
Dondas a snoozer
Sick Donda vinyl
3 😭
&quot;Hook a car battery to my Nuts&quot; is my new catchphrase
No Melon, you cannot give this a 10 just because Drake came out as a trans woman in this album with the line &#39;&#39;Say that you a lesbian girl me too&#39;&#39;
You gave this a 3 because you&#39;re not a certified melon
Saying &quot;I&#39;m a Certified Melon Boy&quot; for 17 minutes is not a review, Anthony.
Certified really bad album boy
You would&#39;ve given the album higher if the album was named certified boy lover
Early boy
Donda &gt; certified boy lover. It’s done
just because ur feature was taken off doesn’t mean u can take 7 points off as well
Yea album was bad
Didn’t think he was dropping tonight 😭
Still too high.
How does DLDT and Scary Hours 2 sound better than this album? Drake should&#39;ve just not released them and put those songs on CLB and would&#39;ve at least been a 7 or an 8.
W
How do we take Drake down, Melon?
melon i understand that you didn’t like the album but you didn’t have to give it a 3/10 bc adonis has better hair than you smh
CLB gonna age well just like More Life, you&#39;ll see 🤷🏻‍♂️
Tems is a female Anthony
Melon didn&#39;t have the balls for a Not Good but red flannel is unsurprising
I guess melon boy wasn&#39;t feeling sexy today.
Bro KSI beat drake lmao
certified
They ain’t gonna like this one
Can this borefest please mark the end of Drake vs Ye for good? At this point it&#39;s like Jordan vs Horace Grant
Thanks Mr Melon now I can dislike the album in public!
Meanwhile Kendrick spectating over the whole beef.
Damn this a three, girl me too-Drake And Josh or something
I was expecting a not good with the way you went off in that other video
Mans lo-key fell off creatively after More Life
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=415">6:55</a> H.O.V at 50% 💀 but so true only had like 3 good lines
3 LMAOOOOOOOO
certified boy lover
Kanye stans: “Ladies and gentleman, we got him”
travis wasnt trying hard? yeah ur trippin
You are just a drake hater. Like you enjoyed his worst project (iyrtitl). You have no right to talk when lyrical highlights like “i got energy gotta lotta energy” are part of your 8 fucking 8/10 record of drake.
Is this the first time Anthony has acknowledged he has a ballsack in a review?
Did ksi&#39;s AOTP actually get a better score than drake?
Certified Lullaby
A 10, I knew Drake and Kanye could do it together!
Anthony Anthony ANTHONY YOU CANT JUST DECLARE THAT YOU&#39;RE A LESBIAN OVER AND OVER FOR 17 MINUTES AND GIVE THE ALBUM A 10
3/10 bruh trippin
Fantano said the lesbian bar was the greatest tragedy since 9/11. Can’t disagree there.
Well we all saw this coming
Drake has been fcuking his fans since Views
Certified Melon Man
Drake fans on suicide watch
I seriously don’t understand the appeal of Drake and I never have. He’s not a good rapper, he’s not a good lyricist, his beats are trash, and he just seems so inauthentic.
Boooooooo
Since Drake is a lesbian, this review is homophobic and misogynistic. Sorry, I don’t make the rules lol.
You’re just hating because you’re not a lesbian like Drake smh
Holy shit drake fans will not be happy with this one 💀
Good review melon but calling the album “Certified Boy Lover” repeatedly and making lowkey homophobic remarks towards Drake wasn’t necessary
CERTIFIED shit
That car battery line went hard
Drake’s worst and it’s not even close, dude sounded bored the whole album. At least Scorpion had some career highlights like God’s Plan and In My Feelings. <br><br>I will say N 2 Deep sampling Get Throwed was cool, felt like what Control was on NWTS
If I had a chance to speak to Drake, I’d tell him his album is a “Certified L, Boy.”
pusha t still living in drake head rent free lol
its settled..... donda&gt;clb
He has to also stop comparing himself to Michael Jackson, like cmon man
Drake consistently dropping mindless projects like this is beginning to come off as an insult to his fan base. We’ve seen what he’s capable of yet we keep getting mid like this. He’ll never be better than kanye
Good video melon
This album deserves a strong 0
I LOVE THAT THE DONDA COVER IS IN THE BACK
You&#39;re just mad that he didn&#39;t name it &quot;Certified Boy Lover&quot; and put you as every emoji.
im disappointed i watched this hoping an over five review
This Album Can Cure Insomnia
I KNEW I WAS GOING TO SEE THAT RED FLANNEL . Kanye Wins

LOL
Certified underage women texter
good now I can hate it more thanks melon
You can tell by the album art that this is gonna suck
I honestly like Way Too Sexy because it’s so silly. At least it’s dumb and mindless in a way that’s fun, can’t say that about anything else on the album.
It&#39;s been memed to death but if the Grammys had an award for worst album art Drake would walk away with an award winning album.
God that review felt like when the teacher asks you to stay after class for a minute cuz u fucked up the test so bad and there tryin to figure out WTF happen.
hot shower&gt; way 2 sexy
i hate white hip hop no offense i just dont like yall
Akademiks said it was a classic 😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=365">6:05</a> ... Excuse me??
CLB &gt; SIMBI. Unironically. Little Simz has no flow, no bars.
Calling it “Certified Gay Boy” was uncalled for.
Certified Boy Lover
Dark lane demo tapes was better than CLB
This is disgusting. If this album was better, melon would&#39;ve given it a higher score.
waiting for him to talk about the lesbian line
giving this a 3 is lesbianphobic
I know we say this as a joke, but thank you for validating my opinion on this one. I couldn’t get past the 5th track I was so bored the whole time. I think Push broke him.
You would&#39;ve given it a 10 if you were a lesbian too
Currently awaiting the little simz review
Let&#39;s argue: Broccoli is an underrated vegetable
I really appreciate Anthony emotionally resonating with Way 2 Sexy after Future says &#39;Too sexy for my hair&#39;.
Some tabloids had reported on Drake having a kid months before Pusha dropped his diss so I never really understood why it was propped up to be such a big deal/revelation.
Anthony, just because you felt your identity validated by the lesbian bar doesn&#39;t mean it deserves a 10
Ah yes the certified boy lover
Speedin’ Bullet To Heaven &gt; CBL
certified lesbian boy
Certified Melon Boy
Mellon, bro - get ur color correction right
i actually wanted to get into drake then i didnt care about any of the albums or singles then this new album came out and it was shite so i dont think i CAN care about drake or like his music<br><br>And i see some youtubers and friends talk about HOW CLASSIC his music is or whatev i just dont get that so its not for me i guess...
Please don’t hurt us drake fans please 😭
Los is gonna lose his shit💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
I need a Spotify playlist of nothing but Chipmunk Soul.
Man drake has gotten so corny and cheesy as of the past few years it’s too bad
Fantano dislikes drake. The world is shocked!
Kendrick is gonna come in and save the day
Here we fucking go
No Anthony, CMB doesn&#39;t mean &#39;Certified Melon Boy&#39;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=704">11:44</a> it was a Project Pat sample
this album mid mid mid
“Certified Boy Lover”
He got Donda chilling on the shelf in the back? Damn 💀
This…does put a smile on my face.
deserved
KSI is better than Drake confirmed!
The way he first listened to this I’m thinking he’s giving this a strong 5-light 6 but a three? Ruthless
You can&#39;t just give this a 3 because you hate lesbians, melon!
I see the red flannel, I click.
How’d Anthony get the donda vinyl early? He’s even showing it off in the top right.
KANYE WON
CBL 10/10 going into the sleep Playlist.
this album definitely isnt all that, but cmon ur acting like this album is worse than views, scorpion or nwts, and the comparison to hot shower is just confusing
That guy that makes compilations of melons hating on drake is about to have a hayday
Drake and Kanye add up to a 10 this is how we end the beef
NOTHANY WAYTANO ⁉️
yeah i havent listened to the album nor did i watch a second of the review other than the very end with the rating NOR have i listened to ANY of drakes discography.... but yeah this shit definitely garbage.
Drake got 1 point for every white person in the cover
Drake is a walking L
“Hook a car battery up to my nuts”- Anthony Fantano
I just started listening to albums a few years back (2019: Run Fast Sleep Naked by Nick Murphy) . Donda was my first Kanye album and CLB my first Drake.<br><br>Listened to Donda 3 days in a row.<br>Listened to the first 3 tracks of CLB.
knew it was a 4 or three
knew this was gonna be savage based on that impression in the other vid
I saw the red flannel and laughed.😂
This album was terrible. But nuts to a car battery? Damn.
Im 2 sexy fo yo girl
Red flannel, you love to see it
Certified 3/10 Boy
anthony you can&#39;t just say &quot;daddy&#39;s home&quot; for 17 minutes and call it a review
<b>“My chopper hit em so many times he turned into a booty clapper”</b> - 21 Savage
Intro, knife talk and you only live twice were dope. The rest was super forgettable…<br><br>Edit: Yebba’s heartbreak was dope too
Omg I&#39;ve been waiting for this review since I listened to this garbage. Donda isn&#39;t great it&#39;s alright in my opinion but if I had to choose between listening to nothing but CLB or Donda for the rest of my life I would choose Donda in a heart beat and be happy as hell.
Tony was on your ass like back pockets
was so much excited for this album, only to get more sleep instead. <br><br>i would like to thank drake for fixing my sleep schedule, i really appreciate it
Boy Ive been waiting for this...
Ayo
Lesthony Biantano was a missed opportunity
I actually thought this was way better than Scorpion
Jrake is so boring
I was waiting for the day Melon would rip this album a new one

Reviewing clb with a donda vinyl in the back. What a power move
just realized you had the DONDA cover behind you during this review
Is that supposed to be a Donda vinyl on the shelf lmaoo
Nice review melon, but giving Drake a 3 just because he&#39;s a lesbian is kinda offensive
😅
Y&#39;all should stream my new album &#39;happy never after&#39; on all platforms now that this is a sleeper
I thought it was a good album. 🤷🏾‍♂️
It’s funny how you will have 45 shit takes wrt hip hop in a row then absolutely murder a review like you do this one
Cheers for reviewing this didn’t fancy putting my ears through torture
I cant believe people even put Kanye and Drake in the same sentence. Drake takes no creative risks unless his ghost writers do hahah
You a coward for not making this one a NOT GOOD
WHAT TOP 5 YOU SMOKIN ON KENDRICK? COZ MY TOP 5 IS DRAKE DRAKE DRAKE DRA-
That fucking shit ass cover art already makes this album worth 3 NOT GOODS.
I gave up halfway on Way 2 Sexy. Tried listening to it again and fell asleep 2 times. Album is shorter than a popcorn flick but felt longer than my whole weekend.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ppxsRfZMA&amp;t=360">6:00</a>
Melon you can&#39;t hate the song way 2 sexy because you think &#39;sexy&#39; is a bad word
Certified Melon Boy
Drake, while being a catchy pop rapper, has barely left his comfort zone since Views. If Donda is a messy lobster dinner, Certified Lover Boy is slightly burnt toast
After so much beef with Pusha T, the only bars Drake can drop are salad bars.
We can only hope for the beef between Drake and Kanye to die out so Drake don&#39;t have to be consumed by it and separate from it and actually make a decent to good project.
Melons predictable Drake take. Yet I still clicked. You win.
Anthony you can’t give it a 3/10 just because it was an objectively boring, drawn-out project with only a few good aspects to it.
More like Certified Underage Girl Lover
Broccoli.
I agree! Love you bro!
The Donda vs. CLB debate is over, thank you melon
LMAO
“Said that you’re a melon, girl me too”
I disagree it’s people like you who he’s talking about, this album was a F U to all the people who thinks drake cared about being a dad lmaoooo nah he cared about the disrespectful way he was exposed
Giving it a 3 just because there was no NAV feature? My respect Melon. Unsubscribed.
Certified 3/10
this album was so boring that when Anthony talks about a song I can&#39;t remember how they sound
7/10 + 3/10 = 10/10<br><br>kanye drake collaberation album in the future 10/10 confirmed
melon jumping up and down yelling &quot;that&#39;s what the mask is&quot; is not a acceptable review
i think Drake topped on IYRTITL, it&#39;s so good that it doesn&#39;t even sound like Drake
You can&#39;t give it a 10/10 for the cover alone, melon.
Los is going to be piss
Okay dude you don&#39;t need to flex your Donda vinyl in the background smh
Lmao I expected lower but that&#39;s reasonable rating, Anthony 😂😂😂
TND giving Drake the closest thing to Red October&#39;s
I did finish the video but I already know it’s gonna be bad based off the first 10secs😭
DAMN LOS POLLOS IS GONNA GET FURIOUS
congrats on getting Donda on vinyl already melon !
certified boy lover and that boy is kanye
Registered Boy Lover
DAMN A 3? LETS GOOOO KANYE WINSSS
This will sell millions <br><br><br><br>“Light 3”
Literally took me two days to listen to this record. I fell asleep upon initial listen. I think the only songs I really liked enough were the last 4 tracks and Fair Trade. But overall... it just feels soulless and boring, like he didn&#39;t even care to try with this one.
Lol best song is his least fav
did he say Views is “dreadfully boring”
we live in a society where artists such as KSI and quadeca have better albums than drake
&quot;I want to hook a car battery up to my nuts to get some kind of mental stimulation&quot; - Anthony Fantano 2021
Way 2 sexy is a banger, you just not sexy enough melon
Tano talking about the new Texas abortion law is not a album review.
Donda &gt; CLB
album is trash
Don’t know if you listened, but you should definitely check out the record “IDFT!?” by Grip. Grip recently got signed to Shady Records and it is a fantastic debut from Shady Records. With this album alone, Grip is already becoming one of Atlanta’s greats and is definitely worth checking out. Can’t forget to mention, the features. Great Royce Da 59 feature and surprisingly one of Eminems best features in the past few years. Anyways, to conclude, you should check it def check it out if you ever get the chance. Great review btw.
We live in a timeline where KSI has 2 records better than this Drake album
HAHAA
CLB is such a vibe I love how the album plays through and his pen game still pretty elite
Ant has spoken!
jesus
Anthony you can’t just give him a 10 because you’re a lesbian too
My man already has Donda vinyl on the background, so fast, dude
Album was so disappointing coming from a Drake fan
L white
Congrats on another album review on trending my guy people really love your opinion haha.
Look at all these Ye meat riders 🤣🤣🤣
Yup pretty much what I expected. Hope Drake tries next going around cause this wasnt it.
Thanks a lot fantano, you just served Drake his seventh studio album inspiration on a platter.
This is too funny
when that red flannel come on, you already know what time it is
Glad you came to your senses and gave CLB the first 40/10. Big ups to Noah Shebib
Ye - 1<br>Drake - 0<br><br>Popularity fades, musical influence is forever
i am glad you said boring so much, that is exactly how i felt the whole time listening.
Emoji album covers are so lazy.
<b>LMAOOOOO</b>
Anthony I’m impressed by your commitment to getting into the mind of Drake by shaving a heart into your hairline<br><br>Unsubscribed.
We ALL saw this coming 😭
Drake brought the Chad/little dick energy with that lesbian line. On some, “she didn’t want me because she’s a lesbian” type beat.
Calling Drake a “Certified Boy Lover” for 17 minutes straight was immature and uncalled for melon boy.
Playing the story of Adidon for 17 minutes straight isn’t an actual review Anthony
&quot;Said you a lesbian, girl me too&quot; is actually the worst lyric of all time
Certified boy toucher
they already cooking you on Twitter 😂
This album wasn&#39;t disappointing to me, but it was definitely a bit confusing. Drake hyped up this whole certified lover boy persona, only for this to just sound like a drake album and nothing more. That really is the perfect way to describe this album, it&#39;s just another drake album. It has R&amp;B style tracks, 5 minute rap cuts, a couple style variations (like the track with Tems) and the three person track with some of drake&#39;s most frequent collaborators, this time being Wayne and Rick Ross. Definitely not bad at all, there&#39;s some great stuff here, but I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;ve come away with anything different honestly. Still a 7/10 in my book.<br>Favorite Tracks: Champagne Poetry, Fair Trade, You Only Live Twice, Get Along Better, 7AM On A Bridle Path<br>Least Favorites: Girls Want Girls, In The Bible, F*cking Fans, TSU, IMY2
Mr Fantano, you can’t just give him a 2/10 because hes lightskin then call him a certified boy lover, that’s not a review
IS THAT DONDA IN THE BACK?????
Said you a 3, girl me too
Okay, but that one line from Roddy Ricch about snorting crushed SweeTarts while playing Donkey Konga on his GameCube? Fire stuff. 🔥🔥🔥
it doesn’t take a die hard drake fan to know that fantano went into the drake and kanye albums knowing he’d at least want to give kanye a higher score
Hating people who use wheelchairs isn’t a good enough reason to give this a 3/10 tony
Certified Little Boy
How did you get a Donda vynil already
If it was called Certified Boy Lover, you would’ve given it a 10
THIS ALBUM WAS SO BAD PEOPLE TRYNA SAY IT&#39;S BETTER THAN DONDA LMAOOOO
Oh my gosh, Anthony, I cannot believe you gave this album a (edit later) out of 10, that is unbelievable.
Wonda
I’m pretty sure Anthony intentionally put the Donda record in the background lmao
Drake is a true Lil Wayne disciple. Drake does great loosies and mixtapes but cannot make a decent album to save his life.
Obligatory “Certified Boy Lover”
So I think it&#39;s safe to say at this point that Drake never really came back from the Pusha T diss lol...
The album couver makes me uncomfortable
i now know i cannot stream this album any further, thank you.
Just here to see the comparison to Donda, and I’m not disappointed!
Bro is so bias towards Kanye that he is literally wearing his cover art
drake is a groomer
I fucking waited for this review so long. Refreshing my YouTube like an addict
Donda and Smiling with No Teeth LP in the background because those are what he would rather listen to.
Los gonna welch
&quot;Certified Lesbian Boy&quot; isn&#39;t a review, Melon.
CLB &lt; Jesus is King
great review melon maybe next time dont go off on how his dad has a  &quot;monkey suit&quot; made by &quot;steve harvey&quot;
Ok Anthony I know you didn&#39;t like the album, but there&#39;s no need to be lesbophobic!
I can&#39;t believe he didnt use the sonic version of the album cover again
Is that really the album cover? It just looks like Drake had a screenshot, taken from his phone, of a row of customized Emoji&#39;s. It reminds me of the album cover to Maroon 5&#39;s <i>Red Pill Blues.</i> Just lazy.
Akademiks, one of the biggest Drake stans, fell asleep listening to this 😂
Melon has spoken. Donda &gt; CLB
Kanye: THROW OUR HANDS UP IN THE SKYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY<br><br>Drake: Said you a lesbian girl me too
Took the words right out of my mouth, just couldn&#39;t articulate Drake seemingly clout chasing by rapping so much about raising his son, only after he got exposed.
Lil Wayne&#39;s verse made him single-handedly own this entire album
LMFAOOOOOOOO I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE DRAKE STANS MAD
Anthony, explaining why you’re a Certified Lover Boy is not an album review.
Bold of you to review this album with Donda exposed in the shelf. Shows really how biased you are in this feud, melon.
LMAO I WAS JUST BROWSING THE DONDA REVIEW AND SAW SOMEONE SAY THAT DRAKE&#39;S WAS GONNA BE 5/10 AT BEST
Really no reason to call Aubrey the W word.
agree
Okay, you can’t give this a 3/10 because this is your third ten of the year.  Come on, Anthony.
Certified Lover Boy is if Views nd IYRTITL had a son with downsyndrome
Grip album review plz
Certified Red Flannel
Lol
Anthony fannytano a certified boy lover??? 😳😳
melon, telling the audience you wish drake was YOUR “certified lover boy” for 17 minutes isnt much of a review
Dark Lane was wayyyyyy better
W shit sucked
But forreal, why do people think Drake is the GOAT?
Albino drake just gave real drake a 3 wow, very racist.
Anthony, you can&#39;t just give it a 3 just because you&#39;re not &quot;way 2 sexy&quot;
W
Uh oh, the red flannel is out for Drake
Los pollos will have a heart attack when he sees that red flannel 💀
Woah Drake got a red flannel???? SO SHOCKED ?????????????
it’s official KSI&gt;Drake
I get the critique but how is Drake not supposed to be phased when people mention his son? Lol
Certified Melon Boy
I saw this rating coming from a mile away. Lmfao Drake didnt nothing special to wow us on this album. I miss 2015-2016 Drake
I love DONDA vinyl on the backroom...
sleeping for 17 minutes isnt a review, melon
You can&#39;t just say &quot;I hate lesbians&quot; and then give the album a 3, melon.
Red flannel, 17 minutes. Oh hell naw Fantano is taking drake to the slaughterhouse 😭
RUTHLESS LMFAOO
Drake - Gaslighting Lover Boy
Thank you Melon, very cool
it&#39;s so funny that one of the best tracks on the album (yebba&#39;s heartbreak) is not even Drake in that song
Finally a 10
Certified Mid Boy
Can’t wait for Los to react to this tonight
by far the most garbage project he has ever put out
If you add the score for donda with this, you get 10/10, meaning this as a double album with Kanye would be a 10, thanks Fantabo!
You cannot call Drake a deadbeat, give it a 3/10 and call it a review, Melon.
DAMN
“I’d rather have an hour and a half of CBT than listing to CLB ever again“<br>Harsh words, but I agree, Melon.
Noooo.we want that Simz review‼️
i saw this coming. and it’s still not a fun feeling
We off the grid grid grid
im 1st
Are you just using Metallica’s Black album as a place holder for DONDA?
Red flannel is all I had to see. Unsubbed and reported.
Here we go…
Way 2 Sexy might be one of the worst songs I’ve heard in a while. It was like a Drake was trying to have a disstrack of himself
You know it&#39;s bad when Ak slept like Snorlax on livestream.
You would&#39;ve gave it a 10 if it was by drake 🙄
He really reviewed this with Donda in the background
Red flannel, you know what that means
Fantanos clearly such a hater. There’s literally no point watching this review. Clb might proly not be as artistic as donda was but its definitely worth more than a fucking 3 and donda was easily carried by a buncha really good features while drake’s pen game on clb was actually decent. Donda might be the better album but a 3/10 for clb is absolute bullshit lmao
WOW 3 10s this year already? Drake stays on top !
You can’t just say “Donda Better” for 17 minutes and call that a review, Fantano.
Fontano not loverrboy
Already knew he was gonna hate way2sexy 🤦🏽‍♂️
You only live twice, that&#39;s the motto man YOLT
So basically this is all pointless and the off-season is better.
This is bias, it’s just your opinions formulated into a review. Thought we wouldn’t notice, Antony.
People always forget that Aubrey is Canadian duh
Certified snooze feast
Aubrey “drake” “certified lover boy” “had an unplanned pregnancy” Graham
Just cause drake made a a song for his sons instead of naming them doesn’t mean you should give a 3 Anthony
That album cover is just 😭😭🤮🤮
reading your original kanye and drake fanfiction for 17 minutes isn’t a review, anthony
Drake: comes out as lesbian<br><br>Melon: 3/10
Nuff said, Donda &gt; CLB 🤤
Anthony you can&#39;t be a lesbian too, that&#39;s not how it works
Complaining about your sexuality isn&#39;t a review Anthony
Melon just a Kanye Stan.
melon, trying to convince you’re audience to support you getting a BBL for 17 minutes straight doesn’t qualify as a “review”
Said that you a melon, girl me too
I hoped for a &quot;This new drake album issss not good <b>explosion</b>
Anthony Fantano you&#39;re my certified lover boy
DRAKE CARES MORE ABOUT HOW HIS FACE LOOKS THAN HIS SON
Kendrick save us 🙏🏾
i swear drake is the biggest cornball ever
Finally, some justice
Idk, while I think Way 2 Sexy is a goofy ass song, it at least woke me up from out of sleep during this comatose album
I give Anthony’s face a 10/10 review
Donda was better of course, big L to drake with this album
I knew it Lmaoo damn ant why u gotta be so sassyyy but anyways like I said before,drake is going to have the better sales but DONDA is the better album
Anthony you can&#39;t just confess you&#39;re gay for 17 minutes straight
Uh oh
melon, saying &#39;I love mommy milkers&#39; repeatedly for 17 minutes is not a music review. what happened to &#39;internets busiest music nerd&#39;
Big oof on the score for Drake
Anthony, you can&#39;t just say &quot;Certified Lover Boy? More like Certified BOY Lover!&quot; and then laugh at your own joke for 17 minutes
Melon is MEAN for putting that black album cover vinyl behind on display 💀💀💀
Yeah…. Pretty understandable. Don’t even need to watch the review.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>But I AM
What made Anthony fantano fans think they’re funny I scroll down reading the comments like this 😐😐😐
Sick vinyl copy of smiling with no teeth
If you really were a fan you would’ve given  him a the 2 girls one drake rating which states the combined age Is 10 rating but no shit hit the fan melon and you are not still a fan -pac
Anthony you can&#39;t just say &quot;men can&#39;t be lesbians&quot; as justification for a 3/10 smh
Melon, coming out as lesbian is not an album review.
Melon... you can&#39;t just give this album a 0/10 because Drake said he&#39;s a lesbian
Fantano about to Thanos snap this album he got the red flannel on
wow anthony this is extremely homophobic. you can’t give drake a 3 just because he’s a lesbian.
LMFAOOOO W
Said you hear a 3/10 melon me too
i will not skip to the end i will not skip to the end
If the album cover and merch didn&#39;t tell you it was going to be trash, then you must&#39;ve not been paying attention
Yup looks about good to me
Wal-Mart new product great value canned tuna!!!... New look same grrr Ok taste !
Some people on ig are saying this album is better than donda
I guess this means Donda won
Nice
Fantano should do a track review for the Kusorare gay version of God&#39;s Plan
anthony the rating was fine but calling drake a deadbeat dad for 17 minutes was a little unnecessary
<b>Insert funny comment about Anthony improperly reviewing the album</b>
Anthony you can&#39;t give the album a zero because Drake isn&#39;t your certified lover boy.
The last time a lesbian got torn up this hard Sappho wrote a poem about it
WE LIVE BABY WE LIVE
Sleepy/10. Also where tf is LNCL?
Holy shit me and Fantanino actually share the same favourites and least favourite, on top of the exact same score. This is unheard of.<br><br><br>Also yeah this album blows.
The cover art for the project was so bad. Its killing me
As a famous philosopher once said &quot;C&#39;MON AUBREY WTF?!&quot;
LMAO SHOULDA BEEN A NOT GOOD
Nice Donda vinyl in the back
The album cover hurts me very deeply. I really disliked this entire project. Really wish I had skipped it.
W
300/10 that was so fucking obvious
Don&#39;t worry DONDA, you won
Drake is an emotional lesbian
Calling Drake a lesbian for 17 minutes is not a review melon
this is the first time i see the red flannel and i became happy. f you drake
“THE GREATEST RAPPER OF THIS GENERATION !!” - Cal Chuchesta, probably.
anthony throwing shots at drake with the donda on vinyl in the back
Drake has hepatitis
The people want a 10 for Sometimes I Might Be Introvert.
Damn it’s official, Kanye won it
great job anthony :D
fantano is a certified racist, he doesn&#39;t know real art 💯💯💯
But if we’re being honest with ourselves, <b>Scorpion</b> has more obvious hit songs compared to <b>Certified Lover Boy</b>
If glogologolalbab was featured you would give it a 10
The Red Flannel is totally justified just with the “Say that you a lesbian, girl, me too” line
Drake is losing touch with how to make his music interesting. He can’t even make a decent shot at Kanye, and instead, AIDED Kanye in taking shots at Drake, embarrassing.
SAY THAT YOU A LESBIAN, GIRL ME TOO‼️🗣🔥
Melon you can’t give it a 10 just cause he is a “lesbian”
Bro way too high of a rating wtf
Drake seems so sad and tired being at the top with no friends, that he’s trying to make worse music over the past few years, yet he still stays popular.
YES
The Ye fans might actually forgive you for the 6 on MBDTF if it means butthurt Drake stans, well played, melon 👍
I don’t like this album. Singing drake ant for me
saw that red flannel and was thrilled
You ever just see just the album art of an album and are instantly underwhelmed. Yeah, this was me with album.
I’ve been waiting for this
Anthony would’ve liked this album more if Drake helped Anthony raise Cal while admitting he is his son
Completely fair score this album just doesn’t show me anything from drake. Just a boring album
Ok now that this got a 3/10 I’ll listen to the Kanye review
Honestly this album sounds like a parody of a Drake album
oh my.
Anthony, you can’t just sing the hook of Right Said Fred’s “Too Sexy” for 17 minutes before proceeding to give the album a zero.
Anthony just be transparent with us and admit you only gave this a 3 cause you “don’t like lesbians”
The rat king is a fan of the needle drop &lt;3<br><br>-Ron, The Almighty Rat King
I feel like a classic album can never include emojis on the front cover.
You give Kanye a 7 but you give Drake 3?
Knew this was coming 😭
melon you screaming &quot;im a lesbian girl i said  me too&quot; for 17 minutes is not a review
Way 2 Sexy is hilarious tho I love it
you say that you&#39;re a melon, girl<br>yeah me too
Painting your skin all those different tones, stuffing a basketball in your shirt and recreating that album cover is NOT a review, Melon.
Melon, not wearing a shirt and screaming about how sexy you are isn’t a review, and your lack of shirt makes me even more confused about what you think about the album!!
Certired Flannelboy
let’s not forget that Drake came out as a lesbian 🏳️‍🌈
We been ready lol
Melon you can’t just give it a 10 because you are a “certified boy lover”
Bruh, seeing the album art animate and move while listening to the album on apple music looks so weird. . .
This video is about to be a NeedleDrop™️ classic
Hi everyone Protecthony Milliebobbybrowntano here
GETTEM TONY
17 minutes of Fantano saying donda donda donda donda donda donda donda donda donda donda donda donda donda donda donda donda donda donda donda donda donda donda donda donda donda donda donda donda donda donda donda donda donda donda donda donda donda donda donda donda donda donda donda donda donda
Champagne poetry is probably one of the best intros drake’s released since Tuscan leather or Legend
Congrats Drake! You were only three songs away from a NOT GOOD. Next time, Aubrey.
looks like this album was pregnant with a stillbirth
The “say that you a lesbian, girl me too” bar is already enough to deduct 5 points
Certified boy lover wasn’t that bad. C’mon melon
didnt listen but glad you hate it :)
you cant just give it a 3 because you dont like the album cover because it reminds you that your still a virgin, anthony.
Sorry this is a 11/10 for me
It&#39;s official <br><br>Anthony is gay
oh this gon be a good one
Hell yeah needle drake fucking sucks
This man will find any way possible to hate on Drake
Nice review Anthony, but running a five minute long advertisement for “Certified Melon Boy” midway through the video felt a little self-serving.
woah i’m so early
A red flannel???  But he’s certified!!! A cErTiFiEd LoVeR bOy!!!
Melon a 17 minute video of you crying in the shower isn&#39;t a review
I don&#39;t think it was necessary to give the album a 10/10 because of the album cover melon
Fantano i dont think saying this album shouldve been named “certified child lover” for 17 minutes straight counts as a review but ill like anyway
W
You guys claim to support lesbians until it’s Drake 🙄🙄🙄
I couldn’t care less. Where’s the little Simz review?
A 3? Sounds like a fair trade to me
The debate, that shouldn’t have been one in the first place, can finally end. Donda &gt; Certified Lover Boy
Certified Melon Lover.
IMMA LET YOU FINISH BUT THE WAY 2 SEXY FEATURES WERE THE BEST ON THE ALBUM
More like Certified L Boy
If we combine CLB and Donda&#39;s score we get a 10, thank you Melon
Drake&#39;s album are so fucking boring it&#39;s crazy. Even Akademiks out of all people fell a sleep while listening to it
Not Good
I listened to this and it drained all of the life out of my day
Light 3 lmaoooo
If the album cover was boys you would give it a 10
i can’t believe he made an album  on house arrest after that whole child endangerment thing
Every single song sounds the same: the album
LMAOOO
You only gave this a red flannel Cus he’s a lesbian
Fair rating
Lol
Anthony, you can’t give the album a “Not Good” just bc Drake didn’t put a pregnant bald man on the cover
Stonethany Thantanos lol
So based
P
Did you impregnate all those women “Certified Melon Boy”?
Sir you didn’t have to say “nothony waytano” to say that “there’s no I way I don’t give this a 10” and then proceed to not give it a 10. Smh<br><br>Disclaimer: this album is ass please don’t think I think this album is in any way good.
Melon you can&#39;t give this a 12/10 because that&#39;s how many chicks drake knocked up on the album cover
Oh I was waiting for this one.
Anthony you can’t just say the album is trash just because Drake came out as lesbian and you’re homophobic
certified boy lover
Honestly its pretty boring. I really liked the Cudi song and the one with travis scott but i think hype might&#39;ve subconsciously made me hope for more.
I liked the album. I am a drake Stan and think IYRTITL is his best project no doubt but I liked this album a lot. Sorry to see the measly 3
Needs a drain gang verse
I haven’t finished it yet, but I agree.
certified donda lover
im sorry anthony, but i thought you trashing drake for the whole review for  naming his album “Certified Boy Lover” was a little strange.
Was given a light 3
Yeah I love you
Pusha really changed Bro, ain’t been the same since
Lesbony Metootano
Kanye’s unfinished music &gt; Drakes finished music 😭
Nice Donda vinyl Melon!
I’ll never forget reading a comment saying something like “if the flannel is red the career is dead” and that’s how i identify what’s going on before I click lmao
Man Views really was trash
Red Flannel, aka Drake’s career after Views
i agree bro<br><br>i decided that donda &gt; certified boy lover
Too sexy for this 3
I&#39;m glad that donda didn&#39;t get a 3
Great review, although reviewing Donda again seems out of taste melon
LFG BABY
Melon screaming “you said you a lesbian girl me too” for 17 minutes isn’t a review
Melon, I understand you and Kanye Omari West are undergoing a romantic experience but you didn’t have to murder drake one cold blood.
What is that all black lp in the background?
Drake + red shirt = top tier melon content.
Anthony you didint have to list Way 2 Sexy as your least favorite because you didint have enough hair to get the heart cut into your head
Anthony, you can’t just say “Donda &gt; CLB” for 17 minutes and expect us to take this review seriously…
It sucks cause I know Drake can make good music but he could and does put zero effort into his projects and tops the charts 100% of the time.
Most based score you’ve given in your life
melon this review was 12 emojis out of 10
DONDA Chant was better than anything on this garbage
This album put melon to sleep
My girlfriend’s husband loves Drake.
Guess this album was way 2 sexy for you melon
Just cuz he’s dating Kanye doesn’t mean u can give it a bad rating melon not cool
Certified melon boy
Certified Red Flannel
Certified Lover Boy? More like Certifed Poo-Poo Boy. haha got em
Certified NOT GOOD lover
And here we go
3/10 is honestly fair as a drake Stan
Certified Melon Man
Knew it would be a three not upset about tho
I got here faster than a jack rabbit on a cheetah
I never clicked anything so fast
don’t bother watching, he just says “i am too sexy for my shirt” for 17 minutes.
Fourth.
Haha drake lost to kanye who put lil Uzi on a religious album
I knew it was gonna be low lol 😂
Melon you didn&#39;t have to spend an entire video telling us how much you you like Kanye.
BASED
Already adding this to my favorite Melon tear downs with Miley’s Dead Petz, Chance’s Big Day and the latest Tones album
I love you so much melon
calling Drake’s new album CERTIFIED BOY LOVER for 2 hours straight isn’t a review melon
certified red flannel
this review was perfect
ik a lot of people don’t like clb but u didn’t have to say that u fell asleep 8 times during the album and hope that kanye poops down drakes throat fantano…
honestly pretty rude of u not to respect his new identity MELON
You know just because Drake said that he’s a lesbian, doesn’t mean you have to give him a low score Anthony…
You give Drake a 4 but you give him a 1?
No views. Lmaooooo
You mean to tell me since he didn’t put a bald pregnant emoji on the cover, it would’ve gotten a 10?
lesbian
Well we all knew donda was better
<b>Something funny</b>
RIGHT WHEN I LOOKED IT UP YOU POSTED IT ONE MINUTE AGO WOW
Certified Music Nerd
Admitted you’re a Certified Boy Lover in a heart-felt fifteen minute cry was moving, but it doesn’t function as a review, Anthony
Melon i’m disappointed that you didn’t include your reaction to Drake’s “lesbian too” line.
&quot;Said you a lesbian, girl me too&quot; this bar shows how serious Drake is about this album. 10/10
Goat
3/10 ... why. I’m calling the police.
The red flannel...
red flannel ✅<br>3/10✅<br>just another post-2016 drake review 👍
DONDA
Wonda wins
this album was so disappointing
I&#39;m sure this comment section will remain civil
Uh oh lol
Are we really surprised?<br>Like, ARE WE REALLY surprised?
ok so this officially means that donda&gt;clb
Early
YES DRAKE SLANDER YES DRAKE SLANDER YES PEOPLE WILL FINALLY TALK SHIT ABOUT DRAKE THANK YOU FANTANO
Streets have been waiting patiently 🙏🙏
That cover is a war crime
I figured it will be...👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
been waiting for this
sheesh it’s not great but a 3 is a lil low
As usual: Drake puts out a mediocre project after hyping it up.
Its a Certified stinker
Anthony you can’t just give Drake a 3 and call him a “certified boy lover” the entire video
SECOND
337 comments and I can&#39;t see any of them...
oh shiiiiit
second.
Certified 3/10 Boy
certified melon boy
Donda &gt; CLB
Should&#39;ve been a not good tbh
Anthony, saying you’re a lesbian for 17 minutes isn’t a review!
Donda better
Melon just isn’t sexy enough to enjoy Way2Sexy
If drake was black you would have gave it a 10
DONDA &gt; clb 🤣🤣⛷⛷⛷
cmon anthony you can&#39;t give CLB a 2 because Drake stole your girlfriend :/
I predicted that this was going to be a 3/10. 😂😂🤦🏾‍♂️
donda&gt;clb
Donda &gt; CLB, Thank you Anthony..
Certified boy lover is, in fact, an album.
Huh?
Donda cover chilling in the background
Saying women shouldn’t get abortions is kinda controversial melon.
The Lover Boy, he certified<br>This year he‘ll turn 35
Not the red flan flan
HA
Finally a fantano review i fully agree with
I shit myself
Bruh
L review
Certified Melon Boy
Glad I can finally have an opinion on this album, thanks Anthony Fantano!
Second half of <b>N 2 DEEP ft. Future</b> , goes hard
You can’t just say “I don’t like lesbians” and give it a 3/10 Anthony.
3/10 clb, DONDA 7/10 what do y’all think?
oh no
Bombed
I was expecting a three😂😂<br>This album deserved a 3
Red flannel let’s go !
Got Drakes dumbass😂😂😂
Well deserved 3 for drake
Certified Red Flannel Boy
FINALLY! Drake gets a trash score like he deserved for this record.

HAHAHAHAHAHAH
Certified Lover Boy reviewed by Certified Melon Boy
“Needing more Nav” is not a good enough reason for a negative review anthony
“Like a Pokémon holding an everstone, drake just doesn’t evolve” - Ruff Criminal
Evolved Chocolate has better Bars than Drake
Saying donda is better for 17 minutes isn’t a review, melon.
calling drake a certified boy lover for the whole video wasn’t really a review
Sheeeeesh
Wanthony Wantano
w
Yo
If Drake said he&#39;s a gay you would give this album a 10
just because you aren’t one of the pregnant emojis on the cover doesn’t mean you can give it a 3 anthony :/
DONDA BETTER
Suppa gay
yep
Based.
Say that you a melon, well me too
Lmaoooo
Album was mid but discriminating Drake for being a lesbian was a bit uncalled for
RED FLANNEL LMAO NO WAY
Incoming furious Drake stans
i refuse to give in. CLB is FIRE
melon just because you weren’t the pregnant lady on the cover DOESNT mean you can give it a 2.
KANYE WEST HAS WON
This new simz is getting a 10. I can feel it in my bones. <br>Edit: wtf!!!
OH NO THE RED FLANNEL
Drake be upset at melon
Melon said donda better
most hated album on release in a MINUTE
Certified boy lover
CALLED IT IT’S A LIGHT 3 LMAOOOOO
I love you, my certified melon.
Anthony you can&#39;t just give it a 0/10 because ............(.....).......... ......... ............
i loved no friends in the industry
Oh boy
You would have given this an 8 if he called it &quot;Certifies Melon Boy&quot;
LETS GO A LIGHT 3
We won yeahhhhhhhh
Good to know I had the right opinion all along
the cover alone deserves the red flannel.
I was the first rapper to comment on Melons channel
Certified bruh
album
gg
Ok Anthony, we know you’re biased when you have the donda vinyl in the back
MELON
Anthony you can’t give him a 0 just because he’s mixed. He’s really insecure about that and you should know better
LMFAOOOOOOOOO
Yes
Yes
damn thought it would be a 1
Ah yes the red flannel
Anthony, it seems kinda homophobic to give drake a low score because he’s a lesbian.
DAMN.
🗣RED FLANNEL
Haven’t watched yet but I just know he’s about to annihilate this sleeper of an album
MY BOY YE WINS
just because he’s a boy lover doesn’t mean the album deserves a 3, tony. your rampant homophobia has to stop.
Let’s. Go.
W take I think your opinion is very valid !
I can smell the 10<br><br><br>OH F-CK

Drake - Certified Boy Lover ALBUM REVIEW
Yikes
Anthony, you can’t just give him a 0 and then call him a “certified boy lover” that’s not a review
the lesbian line got to him
Red shirt got it
This is a certified hood classic
Can we all agree that 3 is way too low?
oh boy
3/10 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Aw shit, here we go again..
Based and Drake pilled
no views club

Anthony I know you don&#39;t like Drake but 25 minutes about why Abraham Lincoln was wrong feels a bit extreme

Bang bang ho!
Hi everyone

Drake may win the numbers. But Kanye won the war. Donda will be remembered ten years from now. This... not so much
this is gonna change history
Certified Boy Lover
Anthony you can’t just give Drake a low score because he didn’t impregnate you
HE REALLY GAVE IT A LIGHT 4 LMFAOO honestly kinda deserved
certified boy lover
Oh when you see the Color of the Shirt
This album way 2 sexy
“Say that you a lesbian girl me too” is the bar of the century
Just because it isn’t certified melon boy doesn’t mean you should give it a 0 out of 10
FIRST
Red flannel gang
I was literally thinking when is he releasing this
