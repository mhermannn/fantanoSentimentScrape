it&#39;s not a 10
I like how Fantano basically shrugs about this album for 15 minutes and then ends up giving it a TEN like it&#39;s no big deal
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS A 10/10 HELL FLIPPING YES
F
are u fr
Thanks Melon I was recovering from a migraine day and couldnt look at the video xD
This guy is so good at what he does!
I’d give it like a 7 or an 8 not really my thing but the production was out of this world.
you would have gave it a ten it it was called brat
Maggie Rogers &#39;Don&#39;t Forget Me&#39; next pls
W
A 10, wait you&#39;re serious! 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
This not a 10, grippy hurt cole&#39;s legacy. This 10 hurt yours, guess we just gotta move on bald man.
to pimp a bratterfly
Did melon just come out?
All I knew about Charli XCX going into this album were the songs Boom Clap and I Love It. Literally the most basic knowledge possible. I was absolutely blown away by this album, this is by no means my genre of expertise and what I listen to is radically different, but I love this so much. I hope to get into some of her other works, but I&#39;m not sure if she topped this album.<br><br>I know it might be random, but some parts of this album give me JPEGMAFIA vibes
I&#39;m gettin&#39; frustrated seeing Brat get this level of praise that Pop 2 did not get because she had less money from the label marketing her? I believe Pop 2 should be the 10 and brat the decent 7
It’s a pride month miracle
TPAB<br>BPAB<br>BPAT<br>BRAT
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLJ-zfBmChA&amp;t=370">6:10</a> skibidi fantano
it&#39;d be a ten if it was called brat and was by charli xcx
Easily the worst album cover ever to grace a Fantano 10, but otherwise yeah, no complaints.
брат
Wait this is massive!!!! Congrats charli!!!
the way im a diehard charli fan and i wouldve given this like a strong 8 at best
Ngl this is giving skibidi toilet vibes
we are infact living in the right universe
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉<br>Jooooooooo <br>Wth 10/10 dammmn
HUGE DAY FOR GREEN FANS
I think she topped her debut record Pure Heroine with this one. What do we think?
FANTANO WHERE IS THE DILLOM ALBUM
10!!!!
Guys she is straight so I don’t understand what is going on with people’s minds. I’m bi and I am happy pride is here but maybe I’m missing something idk 🤷‍♂️
Haha, a 10 it is not. Good album, yes. Up there with some of the best albums ever made 😂😂😂😂. No. Pitchfork got it right on the money. 8.
you only give  Renaissance an 8.  no fucking way this is a 10
We dont agree
ITSSSS A TEEEEEEEEEN
I love the album tbh its the most vulnerable she’s ever been i like the you know bratty side of herself but also admitting her insecurities and thinking about her future as a woman in the industry and her personal life. She’s pumping herself yp but also others. She’s in her early 30s now seems like she is in a place in her life where she’s in between crazy party days and settling down a little bit. Much like her career. Reminiscing about the past but also knowing her brand now. I love this concept Ive loved her for 12yrs now. i love it she brought us a bit of the 2000s/early 2010 art pop club bops vibes💚Loved your commentary gained a sub!
The instant regret Anthony had when he sang &quot;🎶talk talk to me🎶&quot; hahhahahaha
Not like we took you seriously ever.
Brathony Melontano
TORI by Tori Kelly is an underrated album
If it was called To pimp a… Oh wait HE GAVE IT A 10!
&quot;ooh i love my wife&quot; - zero &quot;ooh i love my husband&quot; - ten I recognize you, Tony. I recognize you.
Glad to see fantano finally brought to justice for his crimes against music 💯
anthany is a fellow green fan
if this was called Brat you would have given it a 10
No fucking way
&quot;I was a shiity friend, I kinda pushed this person...&quot; ::I tense up and go white:: &quot;...away&quot; -- oh thank God 😵‍💫
The first 10 for a while
I really liked this review but you didnt have to say the &quot;I would&#39;ve given it an 11 if it was named brap&quot; line. Really unnecessary and out of place
Best review, that 10 is well deserved, Charli is a fkn genius ❤
To Pimp a BRATterfy
Absolutely no way, this album was painfully mid and I say that as a Charli xcx fan. The billie album was so much better.
Loser 😂😂😂😂😂
pro women except for (ma)rina
Bro is twerking for the ABCD community.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLJ-zfBmChA&amp;t=775">12:55</a> All this yapping &amp; talking bout the production yet he didn’t once mention the sample of Kanye &amp; Ty’s Vultures being used in Everything is Romantic.
The pinnacle of every artist&#39;s career is a Fantano 10/10. Screw the Grammys, No. 1 etc.
Just handing out 10s to anyone now
b
It is 4-5 at max. No way a 10
This album is not half as good as what she was doing 2017-20, I thought it had a few couple hooks but mostly completely bored with 75% of it. It is so weird to me that anyone would give it that high of a score
Should the title have been &quot;To Pimp A Brat-terfly,&quot; you would have rated it an 11.
New thou album just dropped should review
Holy shit
fetch the bolt cutters a 7 but this a 10 is kinda crazy but i&#39;m not mad
Thoughts on the bonus tracks? I loved all of them just as much as the album
Will we get an aurora review
Emika - Haze
i don’t have the nerve to watch this entire video but let me say this:<br><br>i randomly gave this album a shot and listened to a few songs without knowing the artist - it was random bullshit and nothing anyone would wanna listen to again. a light 2/10 for me
genuine question is melon one of the gays?? is he one of us???
Heheheheheheheheheheheheheheeh the people mad in the comments heheheheheheheheheeheheheh
HAPPY PRIDE MONTH
a fucking 10 from Fantano and a 94 on Metacritic? Indeed, BRAT is that highly regarded record, huh?
one of the best review by fantano
giving her a 10 just because she’s a girl is kinda crazy, but i respect your opinion melon
everyone go stream brat please
Hyperpop being the ‘future’ yet it hasn’t taken off
I LOVE YOU CHARLI
OH MY FUCKING GOD
10
How much did she pay you
After giving 10s exclusively to men in the 10&#39;s, Fantano has so far given 10s exclusively to women in the 20&#39;s.  Progress!
DAMN.
Huge win for insufferable people everywhere
Absolutely loving the evolution and creativity of Charli XCX! 🌟 Her music just keeps getting better and better!
I iust watched this review and I&#39;m crying rn. Everyone else at the funeral is looking at me too
Glazed
Brat<br>Charli<br>Vroom vroom<br>How I’m feeling now <br><br>Pop 2<br>Number 1 angel
Fine. I guess I’ll love it 🙄
Happy Pride Month indeed
Can u review elseq 1-5 and NTS Sessions 1-4 from autechre pls
she wanna flex that shes the best
Because it&#39;s tpab with the letters flipped, he only gave Brat a 10.
can&#39;t wait for charli&#39;s next album to be a 7
completely deserved. this album is sooo enjoyable
Love the shirt man 👕🔥
We get it Fantano you&#39;re a Mean Girl
if it was called BRAD you would&#39;ve given it a light 3
why is it so hyped
This is the first 10 without yellow flannel since Money Store
i was here
would&#39;ve been 0/10 if it were named brap
Listened to the first 3 songs, and I couldn&#39;t be more confused what the hype is. It&#39;s so... bland? How are people listening to this and not feeling an overwhelming sense of numb brain?
I also like it. I gave it a &quot;nice&quot;.
Can someone explain why he can&#39;t just say 10? 😭 I know this officially still counts as a 10 but he always does the 9-10 thing, or 8-9 when it&#39;s a 9, and so on. Like it&#39;s ok bro, you can just say 10, I promise it&#39;s okay.
I thought you already did syro review
nah why did this man become as soulless as npr 😭😭😭
Great now If I say I love this I will have a lot of ugly smelly annoying ppl nod with me that also previously laughed at me for liking it.
He gave this a 10 only because she is a heterosexual.
Finally I can feel something again
A gift for pride month
If her name was Charlie XXXTentacion, you would have given it a zero.
16 on trending😭
I wanted to clown this but then I listened to the album it truly is a 10 for pop
he didn’t actually listen 2 crash &amp; it shows
no way dude a fucking 10
Will never listen to this because you liked it.
this is first 10/10 that i considered a 10/10 before Fantano claimed it a 10/10
unique
The way I GASPED. Anthony dosent just hand out 10s
I feel like an old men listening this album <br>Is soooooo bad is just speed up tik tok sounds with nonsense lyrics
It’s a good album but 10 is very very bold
I love how rare this is. It feels special
First ten since 2019
Брат убери нож давай мирно решим
Sonically unique and fun album to listen to but I’m amazed you dished out the sacred 10/10 for this. Not hating though
You lost your mind with this rating, listened to it and I rate it &quot;aint bad&quot; but a masterpiece?????? lmao!!!
Wait you give Brat a 10 but you gave endless river a 6 and girl with no face a 7?
Happy pride we won
loved it, 10 is bold tho
9 songs in and this is actually blowing my mind. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve ever experienced such a disparity between what the reception for an album is and what I&#39;m hearing. It sounds like extra tracks on a deluxe edition of an album that I&#39;d feel a bit underwhelmed and disappointed with and rarely revisit. I don&#39;t get it.
It&#39;s official: Charli XCX is the best rapper of our generation, surpassing even logic.
is that orchestral manoeuvres in the dark that i spot behind you melon
I am levitating 🕴 😌
Here&#39;s Fantano&#39;s gift to the LGBT community.
review the mariaaaaaas
A 10/10 for a Charli album during pride month…yeah something is shifting….and I am grateful…
Commenting every day until Melon reviews <br>✨️🌌Empire of the Sun🌠✨️<br><br>(Except I won&#39;t &amp; maybe will only just a few more times... – ...Just rlly love them/their music/style &amp; would love to see them featured..😔🤞😌🍀)<br><br>They&#39;re seriously underrated/overlooked &amp; don&#39;t get enough/the credit they deserve!😮‍💨<br><br>They&#39;re all around awesome, have an amazing alternative sound/style, making us Aussies proud &amp; putting us on the map!😃🤩😎👍🦘🪃🇦🇺🗺🔊🎶💃🕺⚡️🔥💖🙌👏
STRING 10 SO CSCHOKED BRO
i hope she sees this bro
this is really surprising to me tbh. im a charli stan but i would rate like 4 of her albums over brat
now all the stans of pop girlies can stop saying &quot;fantano just doesnt understand music made for women&quot;..... right????
I mean dude you really cant be serious
This album fucking sucks
As a deep lover of album art I truly don&#39;t know how to feel this cover being given to an album this good.
NO WAAAYYY 🎉
Music is great, but that cover is 1/10
Mother served 💚
He only did this pride month. fraud
charli xcx forever... well deserved 10
pride month 2024 be like
10!!!!!!!!!!
this album is ass ngl
first 10 since 2021
The intro was too long…
Brat is vultures 2
That intro is brat 💚
this was probably the most unexpected 10/10, and i’m glad for it
Yeah, it’s PHENOMENAL 💚
FEMTANYL PLEASE REVIEW FEMTANYL !!!
To Rate A Butterfly
He really said happy pride with this one
a rare ten…HERSTORY
FUCK YEAH BUD
Seriously? a 10... no
Real talk, is Charli going to be the first two-time AOTY artist for The Needle Drop? Immense stuff from our iconic girl. 💚
Beth Gibbons is also in the top 5 female artist albums this year
YEEEEAAAA <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/4PgfY73cJprKCq-_gIAO"></a>
This is like Christmas for people with terminal cancer
i think this album is being so well-received by other ‘creatives’ and the ‘music-obsessed’ due to the fact that someone with as big as a following as Charli was brave enough to revert to a sound so raw and orginal this far into her career. its authentic as hell. and with how much you learn along the way when making music, its hard to find that fun &amp; carefree spark you had when you first started out. <br><br>i see this album as a rebellion to modern pop music. many pop albums we hear today are put out by artists who have ‘progre$$ed’ and ‘refined’ their sound so much that their projects have become so clean &amp; perfected they sound sterile and lifeless. they sound like money. <br><br>Brat is giving Myspace. its giving ‘im fun and talented as fuck, but im undiscovered so here’s my music’. its giving ‘here’s my music link i’m Charli xcx’.<br><br>bravo.
This is going on my roster of comfort rewatches
You only gave this a 10 because you gave crash an 6 and she wore that shirt that said nobody makes statues of critics. Uhhh melon….🍉
You&#39;re undereducated in EDM. Artists have been making music that sounds exactly like this for 10+ years. Also this whole album is just 2010 Ke$ha but she was a talentless industry plant, right? (wrong)
NEW 10 ALBUMMMM
Brat bratu govorit: &quot;Brat, ty bratishka&quot;,<br>A on: &quot;Da brat, da, ja bratok brat!&quot;.
She’s not gonna let you hit bro
Here&#39;s Fantano&#39;s gift to the LGBT community.
See y’all when the next 10 drops (my guess is either three months or three years)
ITS HAPPENING
holy shit a 10
do a review of kaytranada&#39;s new album timeless
Clearly influenced by Jojo Siwa’s gay pop genre, this Charlie guy is really only popping off thanks to the GOAT
Maybe I need to sit with this one more. I enjoyed it on first listen but nothing stuck out to me like my favorites from Charli (Gone, Cross You Out, 2099).
Y’all need to understand he gave “Charli” a Decent to Strong 9 and this album is better, definitely a Strong 9 to a 10. 😊
I think one of the most telling signs of Charli’s growth as a songwriter that’s exemplified on this album is that despite keeping the vast majority of the songs under 3 minutes like she did on Crash, they don’t feel incomplete. I’m not leaving these songs wishing they were longer like I did before with her work of a similar length. Well done, Charli. Well done 💚
Charli swinging so hard that she broke through melon’s thick rind
Is this the first 10 of the year??
💚👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
HAPPY PRIDE MONTH
Anthony &#39;Super Sharp Shooter...&#39;  Fanstano
Chocado que ele deu nota 10. 😮
this is my first time listening to her music and im at club classics on brat album and im obsessed!!!
Although i am not a really big fan of this album, i dont understand why some people genuinely are upset at fantano giving it a 10. Its his opinion not yours
If this was called To Pimp A Brat you would give it a 11/10
Fantano i usually think youre crap considering you gave yeezus a 5, but after this i have some faith in you 😂
Had to listen to the album 2x before I finished the review.. great album and always enjoy your videos man
Charli coming for the grammy sweep
A…10…out…of…10????? Big win 😭
yeah i freaking love it
Charli really is her
10 ya&#39;ll...10
Please do 11 dimension by ski mask
I honestly really hated this album but it is interesting to hear your opinion about this album! I gotta say B2b is still a pretty good song despite my thoughts on the rest of the album.<br><br>Cool review!
All the songs are good, but the lyrics aren&#39;t great especially on Rewind which are cringe and hot gas. 360 she&#39;ll be saying she&#39;s her and then on Sympathy is a knife she says she will never be her if she tried, one song she says she wants to be a mother then the following song she wants to sniff coke in the club toilets. The duality of this woman is crazy. A 10? Nah. AOTY? Maybe.
21 - 9
we can call the snipers off guys
I wonder who she’s talking about in Sympathy is a Knife? Lorde or Marina?
Makes way too much sense this dropped on pride month
NGL, Was excited to see a 10 finally, But after checking out the album myself...I def don&#39;t think its a 10 lol Brat is a light 8 if I&#39;ve ever heard one, I know people will take this a certain way, But it kinda feels like Fantano has been trying a little extra these past couple years to show how &quot;Progressive&quot; He is when reviewing female artists, I remember back in 2018-2019, He reviewed i believe Little Simz Grey Area, And like this album, Had every track as his favorite tracks and no least favs, Yet he gave the album a strong 9 rather than a 10. I believe he said for an album to be a 10, It has to bring something new &amp; Truly special to the table. Yet as we see here, Charli isn&#39;t doing anything new or unique, She&#39;s just kinda doing what she&#39;s always done, Yet still, 10/10. Same with the last two 10&#39;s he&#39;s given out over the past couple years, And with all due respect, I don&#39;t feel those albums were 10/10 level either. Just feels he&#39;s been extra lenient recently when it comes to reviewing female artists, Like in all seriousness, Your telling me Fantano himself really believes Hoods Hottest Princess as good a rap album as SIMBI? Like even for the style it is, Doesn&#39;t really make much sense IMO. Def feels like he&#39;s trying to impress someone lol maybe it&#39;s just me.
I think it&#39;s a well made album with some fantastic songs but it&#39;s not flawless enough to be a 10/10 for me.
If Kanye dropped this album it would be 0/10.
the Judgement Day has arrive!
Everything is Romantic... art
ya this shit not a 10 but theres a couple bangers
You couldn&#39;t have worn a different shirt while reviewing this masterpiece? 😂
If i go to a gay club this weekend and dont hear 365 im never going again
You ani’t gonna hit bud
Hi everyone, butthony sextano here...
If it was called to pimp a brat, u would&#39;ve gave it a 0 melon!!
I knew you had good taste
how do you celebrate pride month?<br>fantano:
I had never actually listened to a Charli xcx album, but after this review I checked it out and holy shit I&#39;ve been missing out!
When He Said That it&#39;s a 10 I literary gasped...If I didn&#39;t know I&#39;m Trans I would know by now <br>🏳️‍⚧️✨💅🏻💃💅🏻✨🏳️‍⚧️
For every Brat REVIEW, there is a Post Human: NeX GEn REVIEW
Cmon bruh this dude aint really been locked in on the music scene since 2012. Homie just be chatting to get a check.
I just saw someone fell to their knees at target
need to see you on drag race
Hello, Humans<br>It&#39;s not over until it&#39;s over. Keep moving until you can&#39;t anymore...then keep moving.<br><br>TERRANCE OUT
365 sounds like achieving the true ending in a videogame and 360 is the neutral/good ending
I can&#39;t fucking believe this , charli needs to know about this and that fantano gave her a 10 🎉
ok this album is NOT a 10/10
overrated as fck in my opinion
I officially have no idea what fantano likes. Thought this album was so sonically bland of interesting texture except von dutch. Lyrics were cool but damn a 10?
Not a 10 bra. It doesn’t go hard. It’s better than crash tho.
You would&#39;ve gave DAMN. a 10 if Kendrick named it DRAT.
Queen of the Gays has struck again!
WHAT, A 10/10... FROM THIS GUY?
hell yes
Fantano confirmed gay
Glad to see that Fantano and Taylor finally agree that this Charlie person should be a bigger artist.
Why did I just yell out &quot;OMG HELL YEAH!&quot; at the end of the review like my team won the Super Bowl?? lol
where´s the RM´s Right Place, Wrong People review??
We need yelawolf war story review!
That&#39;s fucking right
I really don’t get this one. It is just filled with such awkward lyrics, like, the song about having a baby just felt so forced. Mean girls sounded like it was written by a child and the production was like b tier relative to something like pop2.
Was so shocked by the 10 that I had to check if it was April
THIS IS A TRASH ALBUM REALLY A 10?
It&#39;s a nice record but not THAT good. Feels a little bit bloated for a 10 I think, could have been shorter or a different tracklist. It&#39;s ok to listen without skipping but not every song slaps here in my opinion, highs are highs (7-10) but there are a few low points, middle of the road tracks at least. I&#39;m not a fan of Von Dutch also. It&#39;s not a 10.
This album turned me straight! Thanks Charles Xavier!
Only reason this gets a 10 is because he regrets giving Sophie&#39;s album an 8, and that is a much better album than this.
How melon gives a 10 to Brat and not Charli got me genuinely tweakin
will this finally get melon noticed by chalie? well see...
Fantano 10 before GTA VI
Blonde got an 8 but this gets a 10 😢
he would have rated it a 5 if it was a straight album.
Decline of Fantano continues.
He hated Lana Del Rey&#39;s old albums, gave a 10 to her most recent album.<br>He hated Charli&#39;s old albums, gave a 10 to her most recent album.<br><br>Waiting for taylor swift to drop that 10/10 album lol.
I get the meaning of the Basketball Shoes lyrics now!
Ia Charlie XCX from the midwest? Its weird someone would make a whole album about Bratwurst
Seriously, a 10? The first in how long? I listened to the album last weekend and it was pretty good. This feels like a troll and I don&#39;t get it.
Hard nipples
Anyone watch the review and only pay attention to Fantano’s green screen shirt to see how long can he keep “brat” into frame?
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH MELON FCKJ THE HATERS!
brat It&#39;s good, but not a 10/10. maybe an 8/10
Just a straight male fan of Charli here, keep on strutting by yall
Yea the albums absolutely not my thing
do you think you&#39;ll review RM&#39;s Right Place Wrong Person?
Cal&#39;s going to be super bummed he missed a &#39;10&#39; review.
If this album was called &quot;To Pimp a Brat&quot; u probably give.... Oh wait a minute
you should review bronze avery&#39;s new album heatwave coming out 6/13!!!
Deserved
album of the year tbh
You would have given it a ten if it released during pride month
i was feeling a 10 from you on this. your best one since tpab
Review 11th dimension by ski
god, &quot;So I&quot; made me absolutely bawl, its an incredibly moving song... and the fact that Charli performed it at Billboard&#39;s Women In Music earlier this year instead of the actual lead single for her album really hit me, especially given that trans women are so frequently left out from things like that
Do skis album
~ GEORGE ~  Might be the greatest adlib of the year
I Love Weezer (The Green Album)
We are waiting for 11th dimension
bro are you going to review new Kaytranada album? bruhh
No way a 10, he’s been edging this forever
Okay but wait until Kendrick drops to pimp a braterfly later this summer
I listened to the album, thought it was OK, but this review got me to give it another go, and I enjoyed it more, for whatever that&#39;s worth. Maybe when Fantano gives an album his stamp of approval, I find more reasons to enjoy it. That might seem flakey, but meh, it&#39;s a good thing to me. I like that he rescued the album for me.
a 10 it is not. at some point we gotta stop lying about this album 😭 nothing on this album touches vroom vroom or gone or forever or party 4 u or track 10 or... this was a regression for her
Why ar u gae? U ar gae
10 is a joke this album is like a 7 at best
2 min long ass songs for a generation of ADHD tiktok idiots, whole album is supposedly 15 songs but 41 min long, thats so lazy
If this was called bring me the brat you would have given it a 3
Great video, weird choice to give her a zero because &quot;shes british&quot; though
pretty good album but stop lying to ur self this ain’t a 10 😭
I&#39;m hating this album so far. Very simple and generic to the point of of being annoying.
And during Pride Month let&#39;s fucking go
The title gave me no intention to check this out but... what?? After all the teasing and blueballing surely no.... THIS is what he gave a 10?!!
I had my suspicions but now I&#39;m sure, he&#39;s gotta be gay
Finally we get unanimous agreement throughout all of humanity: BRAT by Charli XCX is a phenomenal record.
Happy pride month everybody 🎉🎉🎉🎉
good
it&#39;s wild that everyone was hating whennthe album was first announced cause of the cover yet now everyone loves it (as they should)
my goat getting her flowers 🫡
Wow, this is fucking huge. Super rare!
Most of his commentary was about her growing up to learn how to write basic lyrics
Seems disingenuous tbh. His voice says somethingneitrely different from his script. I see $$ 👀 and 2 good songs on a flat mediocre white femme first world level. The earth is so ghetto
Its a great album, but not a chance its a 10. Theres some weak songs on the middle.
I&#39;d like to see a Charli XCX &amp; NIN collaboration.
This is absolutely dreadful.<br>I played it twice in full and both my cats said they would rather be homeless than be subjected to it a third time . I don&#39;t think they will ever forgive me , I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever forgive myself for giving this mind numbing crap a second chance
💚💚💚💚💚💚💚
It’s been 3 years since I could listen to an album. Thanks Fantano.
you giving this a 10 but shitting on uffie’s debut album is a joke. brat wouldn’t exist without sex dreams and denim jeans
can’t stand u
THIS was the 10!? i mean you gave the real charli 10 a 5. Unsubbing
Green Melon interview 2024
holy shit
Please review the new Bonny Light Horseman Album!!!! Thanks
I couldn&#39;t pass track 2. <br>Pure CR4P.<br>10? In what scale? Out of 100??
really so you’re really saying tlop is worse than this you’re a joke broad
The first album ever made by a Brit
This album is just the Squid Games of 2024. Oh, you don&#39;t remember Squid Games? Probably because it was the never the 10/10 it was touted as after all...
GAY RIGHTS! PRIDE MONTH! BRAT RELEASE! BRAT ACCLAIM! - This is my Stonewall 💚💚💚
The album is dope. But a 10?
love this :3
Safe to say Fantano’s bumpin’ that
Wow, I enjoyed the album, but I was NOT expecting this damn 😭.
This album is addictive as hell and the songs off the deluxe version are amazing too
Melon CONFIRMED not homophobic, happy pride month lol
Wow, fantano has a brat taste in music after all
I don’t think I’ve ever witnessed a new 10/10 since I’ve started watching fantano
LMAO ARE YOU KIDDING ME
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
it’s been a few years, but a new album finally came out
So I feels like an apology. A track that says &quot;you don&#39;t know  how much you need them til they&#39;re gone&quot;.
The album has some great songs that&#39;s for sure and I like how it runs sonically, but &#39;Everything is Romantic&#39; literally repeats &#39;fall in love again and again&#39; for like 1 min 20 and its so annoying....I don&#39;t understand?
The album sounds nothing like what I imagined from watching your review lol. This is a much more mature sound from Charli, at the same time feeling 100% authentic to her. So I is my favorite so far, the lyrics are so heartfelt.
Third-hand pop, absolutely banal; Charli was much better, especially in the construction of the songs
I just actually teared up 😅
Fantano fans can listen to 8 albums
Ms. Charli I FcKN Love U
Wake up. Wake up! Your eternal soul is in great danger! Unless you have had your sins forgiven by the blood of Jesus, you are in danger of hell. Turn to Jesus today and receive new life and forgiveness of sins.
Fantano said happy pride
This makes me happy
You would’ve given this a 0 if it was called genre: bratboy
Theres no shot.... holy fuck.
damn juju
Sympathy is a Knife is such an amazing song
WE WON GAYS WE WON
Huge W for black country, new road fans
bald melon goes crazy for pop music
❤
I audibly GASPED when I heard the rating
Keep in mind this is a 10 to him but mbdtf is a 6
A 10 on my birthday?? Just for me?? I can&#39;t believe you remembered!
Please react to the song closer to you by jungkook
If this album was called 10, you would have given it a brat
I rate this review a 10/10, brought a tear to my eye tran-sition
I knew CRASH was just a mistep!!! We are so up Charli gang
Almost as absurd as the sexxy red 8/10 review. this review will age horribly. Good luck defending this review and claiming it was a 10 in 5 years 😂
No WAY this shit is a 10
u said happy pride month!
Charli should consider it an honor of a lifetime she was able to beat out Sexxy Red&#39;s album in the score column. it was a close one.
it&#39;s a 7/10
Ow shit
my lord
How tf did this get a 10?
Big win for the gay community and straight men who like Charli xcx
I just said 10 before the vid even started i felt it in my spirit. It’s not a 10 for me but def 8-9
&quot;Repreese&quot;... I thought it was &quot;reprize&quot;
More like &quot;Charli X&quot; amirite
Yes. Killer album 👏👏👏👏
MELON I LOVE YOU!
YAAAAAAAAAAAS BEEN BLASTING IT EVER SINCE IT CAME OUT
Don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever left a comment on your vids but I&#39;m sorry this is nowhere near a 10. Always been a fan of A G Cook, he&#39;s done some great work for Charli, what utterly ruins this album is her lyrics. Sure the kind of easy flow rap fits the bill for songs like 360 (and her previous more ramped up songs) but when she tries to conjure up any real emotion from her lyrics, sorry I do not buy it one iota. The &quot;lemon on the trees and on the ground, sandals on the stirrup of the scooters&quot; is so lame. The monologues feel empty, not artful or emotive. Cannot understand all the high ratings on this
the cover art is mindblowing
Fantano is an ally. Happy pride
Fantano sees so much in this album that I didn&#39;t and he really communicated that excellently in this review and that&#39;s why he&#39;s the goat
This is a big day for green people
Fantano has been compromised, he wouldn’t give a 10 to Pop 2, Charli, or How I’m feeling now, but brat?? This is disingenuous
Fantano, your score for this album prompted me to give it a listen just to see what all the hype is about.  To me, it’s mediocre.  Giving this record a 10 is completely asinine.  Even if I were to go about scoring this album with my personal hate for “club music” put aside, it would still get a 6 at best.
We are living in a brat world and I am a brat girl
&#39;&#39;Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations. Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.   (Psalm 90:1-2, KJV 1769)<br>&#39;&#39;And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.   (John 1:32)<br>&#39;&#39;Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.   (Titus <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLJ-zfBmChA&amp;t=134">2:14</a>)<br>&#39;&#39;But I am poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.   (Psalm 69:29)<br>&#39;&#39;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen.   (2 Corinthians 13:14)<br>&#39;&#39;We look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.   (2 Corinthians 4:18)
Happy Pride, everybody!
is this his coming out statement? I&#39;m shook
Didn&#39;t need to watch the full review to know it was gonna be a 10 but I still did it
This review makes your review system pointless
😂🎉❤She&#39;s MIGHT just be the most humble and heartwarming person to exist❤️❤️😂😂
Lost alot of respect for you on this one
And he gave fearless movement a 6
Uhhh yes so there is a God!! A gay god ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
this is a big day for chronically online poeple
Goddamn a Charlie XCX album got a 10/10? And it’s not a troll? Impressive.
i am blown away. i actually think its bad songwriting 100%. this is wild. a ten on this album? holy cow cow cow cow. production and style is fun — but nothing groundbreaking. did you get caught up in the hype or something? i cant trust my namesake music reviewer anymore 😭
happy pride month
I&#39;m as shocked as by the album itself (yes it&#39;s amazing)
Personally I would&#39;ve liked the album better if it was colored yellow
Idc about fantano <br>The music is good or nah
REVIEW NEON PILL PLEASE
Say what you want about Melon but when he’s right he’s RIGHT Charli XCX delivered gem after gem🔥🔥
Kendrick Lamar - One 10/10, one AOTY, no EP of the Year<br>Charli XCX - One 10/10, one AOTY, one EP of the Year
You’ve totally lost it melon 💀.
ô careca pra gostar de música ruim viu, vou te contar.
Congratulations, Gay people!
A TEN HE SAYS
Holy shit
This is Charli best project with Pop 2 I am so proud of her
I am SO FUCKING SICK of the TikTokification of music. This album is full of great tracks, but only <i>three</i> of them are over three minutes long. Two-and-a-half minutes is not enough time to properly develop a musical idea. They sound like demos or out-takes instead of actual finished pieces.
i love charlixcx❤❤❤
giving this a 10 and motomami and arca kick ii a 7 is actually insane lmao
💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚
I’m not that big of a Charli XCX fan but this is such a W holy shit
if you were really an ally you would&#39;ve given it your first 11 😴
melon finally has a good opinion 😭
NO WAY
happy pride 🏳️‍🌈
YES INSANE MOMENT
i’m so happy to be living in a timeline where fantano finally gives charli the 10/10 she deserves 💚
DAAMMNNNNNNN W&#39;s in the chat a well deserved 10
Ok
wow
Man I love Charlie don’t get me wrong but a 10?
ian better
If it was called Speedin’ Bullet 2 Brat you would’ve given it a 0
Man... I know it is incredibly uncool to hate on Pop music these days but like, really? THIS is the album that gets a 10? Not Julia Holter? Not Beth Gibbons? But this generic ass hyperpop narcissistic crap? I guess it does the thing it&#39;s set out to do really well, I don&#39;t know. But I can&#39;t STAND Charli XCX.
Charli XCX is the New Queen of Pop.  She is no pop princess like Billie, Chappell or Taylor.  THIS is how you become a Queen!!!!! This is for the GAYS and the GIRLS and the CLUB!!  We had Madonna, Britney, Gaga and now Charli XCX.  Thank you Charli!!!!!!
got goosebumps after that reveal
TEN??? WOOOOOOOOWWWWWW
In my head its a 10, glad you agree :)
If it was called My Beautiful Dark Twisted Brat you would have given it a light 6
Thank you Anthony, I was getting pretty tired of listening to the same seven albums over and over again…
White boy summer is now every summer all summer thanks to brat 🎉
not even that good what are you even basing your ratings on
6.5/10 on first listen might change
whatttt
Charli xcx lover and Eminem hater
Craz
rate new 2hollis album or perish
This guy is gushing fr
If it was called The Big Brat you would give it a 0
10 for this? And 7 for Girl with No Face?<br>Really? Overrated album because of a viral.. 😪
Wait is this a joke?
Fantano: i&#39;m top ⬆️<br>Everyone: top 0.5% of Charli XCX&#39;s listerners maybe.<br><br>Anyway happy pridemonth 🎉
I thought this album was really good but fell short because it lacked blue glitter and eggs
10 is the correct answer
BEST PRIDE MONTH EVER 💚 we&#39;re winning
Fantano is gay now?
I knew he&#39;d one day appreciate Weezer Green
to give this album a 10 is quite frankly ridiculous. it’s nowhere near the quality of any of her older work and it’s also an insult to a lot of the other artists you’ve rated who have released albums that are much more sonically cohesive. and understand that i say this as someone who has stanned charli since superlove came out in 2013
HAPPY PRIDE EVERYBODY!!!
whole lotta yap
yaay it&#39;s a a10
HAPPY PRIDE MONTH 🎉❤
A 10 !!!
Good news for people who desperately need the melon to validate their favorite artists!
I realize this is just your opinion… but I’d sincerely like to ask, what in the actual fuck? That almost caused my physical pain to listen to.
thank you fantano this almost makes up for the Bring me the Horizon review
ONE FOR THE GHEYS STANTANO
WE ARE SO BACK
Out of all the albums to get a 10, this one sure has an album cover
If it was called brat, you would&#39;ve given it a 10.
🤩🤩
For real? The album sounds like a soundtrack to a stupid video game, as does most of her music. What is with the praise?
we won
Oh yeah thats poppin off thanks Fantano
LGBT WON
So now that we got a 10, can we talk about how awesome this review actually was? Thank you melon
he wants to interview charli soooo baaaaaaaaad
HAPPY PRIDEEEEE
Anthony you shouldn’t make a review for Charli a 10/10 only to beg her to let you hit
In all seriousness congratulations Charlie for getting a rare 10. Fantanos ratings hold more weight than Grammies these days.
I can’t believe Syro got re-reviewed and got a 10!! Aphex the goat man !!
esoo 10 hptaaa
this is your most based review in years
TE AMO FANTANO
A 10. And yet, and yet — and yet, Billie Eilish&#39;s inferior (in comparison) Hit Me Hard and Soft will win album of the year at the next Grammy&#39;s. <br><br>Alas.
Too low melon😊
That score felt like a goddamn jumpscare (love it tho)
the bop queen
An album with &#39;Think About It All The Time&#39; on it ain&#39;t a 10. I&#39;ve been obsessed with how ridiculously bad that track is for days
Chocado
Aight now redux The Forever Story as a 10
Holy shit… an actual 10
🌈HAPPY PRIDE MONTH🏳️‍🌈
I was hoping for a lime green flannel 😂
BEST PRIDE MONTH EVER🎉🎉
10/10 pop album
Review the 11th dimension
IM SO OUT OF THE LOOP WTF IS HAPPENING CHARLI GOT A TEN?
I loved this one, made me feel like a little kid again. Imma be singing these tracks for a while lol
this gets 10/10 but not cowboy Carter that&#39;s insane
“I love the color green, in any shade.”
bro this not a ten tf theres no way
You can&#39;t greenwash your channel that easily
Can you review There Goes The Neighbourhood by Kid Kapichi please
WHAT
This album gives me 2008-2015 Britney Spears and Kesha vibes. Pretty aight! It&#39;s not my cup of tea but Sympathy is a Knife is bop
10?!
giving this album a 10 while kelela got a 6 is just flat out racist
This is the Sgt Peppers for LGTB people
Let’s gooooo
Interesting
94 on Metacritic but only a 10 from Fantano? This is gonna lower the average rating DRASTICALLY.
Woah
we&#39;re all brats on this blessed day
Green associates with the green tick, so I am hoping this will be a good review.
If it was called To Pimp A Bra- wait what
HALLELUJAH JUSTICE IS SERVED
We win
Pridethony Monthtano here yess 💚
ob
Bro is falling off he’s giving high rankings out like candy nowadays
He has jumped the shark with this one
I really feel that you didn’t gave enough credits to how she incorpores the Brazilian funk and makes the greatest song of the album, everything is romantic (and, if I am allowed to dream, already a SOTY and ROTY winner)
if feel like we aren’t realizing he thinks charli has two 10s<br><br>“Charli” made it above KIDS SEE GHOSTS on his decade list, and he just gave this album a 10
WHOOOOOOOOOA
We got anthony fantano givin an 10 to an album before GTA 6 drop...
Need to do Ski Mask the Slump God’s new Album
I just don’t understand the Charli hype
Charli was so much better tho 😭
Charil is definitely a girl with a passion for fashion
Damn music is really subjective huh
Ok what.. I just listened to this and I&#39;m astounded it got better than the new twenty-one pilots album... I think the scores should be swapped without delay. Brat is pretty boring dawg... Clancy is a masterwork.
Unironically gasped upon gazing at the description
3 yippees for charli! yahoo!!!!
you&#39;ve just lost all credibility
First 10 in a hot minute
A 10?!
If it was to pimp a brat he’d give a 11
And thus ends the streak of Fantano&#39;s 10/10 albums having sick covers😔
i feel like my brain is blowing up
I like this album but my girlfriend told me I&#39;m not good enough
just listened to it and returned to this review, icl as my first deep dive into girlies discog. this shit slaps.
Giving Brat a 10/10? Only 1 week off veganism and Anthony’s already a bratwurst fiend!
I KNEW IT
NEEDLE HEAD TALKING HEAAAAAAATTTTT
YOHHHHHHHHHH
WHAAAAAAAT
youre reaaaaal as hell 💚💚💚💚💚💚
LETS FUCKING GO
WE GOT A 10!!<br><br>Loved the album, so many tracks are so fun then you have the ones to hit you in the feels.  Shes done great <br>🙏
The Charli praises being sung… And we were all happy again!
Truly a 10/10 album tho !!
Mad ting
No yellow flannel is wild
I am almost 50, and have heard of Charli xcx. But never listened to any of her music. I have played this album for the last few days and it is absolutely brilliant. A superb pop album. &#39;365&#39; slams hard!!
NO FUCKING WAY NO FUCKIN WAY
ANTHONY REVIEW THE NEW DIIV
im sorry i cannot take this review seriously with that shirt
NEW 10 NEW 10
The mythical BRAT flannel
To pimp a bratiffly
these thumbnails have been peak lately. the clancy mask. now this. can’t wait for what’s next
To pimp a brat <br>And the brat store
I’m grateful for this review because it gave me a stronger appreciation for the album on my next listen. That being said, 10 is still wild! 8, maybe 8.5 at best.
If the album was called to brat a bratterfy he would have given it a 10
Thank you melon for acknowledging that the von Dutch remix with Addison rae is the greatest song of all time
I think about that one guy that made a recap of all Fantano&#39;s 9s<br>missing out charli xcx two times <br><br>well, now I hope it&#39;s clearer for him 💚
Didn’t know this was to pimp a brat
This album getting good reviews by music critics and &quot;Sexy Red&quot; getting rap song of the year 2023 from Rolling Stone, short brainrot videos everywhere... Is the movie Idiocracy becoming real this soon?
Fantano giving this album a 10 without his trademark yellow flannel caught me off guard.
Same people that like this album are the people that live life like it&#39;s the internet and can&#39;t understand basic politics but try to &quot;educate&quot; people on world issues as if they know better because they saw 5 TikToks
Review Never Gets Late Here by Shenseea
WOW NO WAY YOU GAVE IT A 10 THATS SO CRAZY
PERIOOODDDTTTTTTT
deserved 10
No way the girl from my favorite Danny Brown song got the 10
A 10/10???
Big day for green gay people everywhere
FINALLY CHARLIE GOT A 10 ITS BRATOCLOCK
im new to charli xcx but i dont recognise any of these album covers and ive listended to most of them
I am convinced children are running the music industry now. The definition of a &quot;10/10 album&quot; has really changed from actual music weith real cover art to sounding like a mosquito with heavy autotune and digital instruments and repetitive lyrics and and MS paint cover.
we won...
Not possible
no fucking way
helppppp is this a 10/10 omggg
fuck yes
BIG DAY FOR CHRONICALLY ONLINE PEOPLE 🕺🕺🕺
He gave a higher grade for Brat than Good Kid maad city… this drives me crazy
I started this in 1.25x speed and it really scared me
SHE DID IT
10 is bonkers don’t think I’ve ever seen a 10 within the first couple of days
I&#39;m surprised Fantano didn&#39;t become a wojak. His face match very well one
Just fell to my knees in the middle of the grocery store
now FINALLY i can say i listened and liked an album he have a <b>10</b>
yeah ts is NOT 10/10 ahahhahaha
Brat is that Moment in the club were the drunkenness stars to fade and you begin to reflect about life between dances
🍏🔫💚✅🤑
Charlie deserves so much love. It&#39;s crazy that many of my normie friends still see her as the boom clap lady. Meanwhile, she has blown away many music critics. Shoot she is gona be album of the year for fantano twice now?? Genuinely can&#39;t think of many artist that fantano praises to this level
NOOOO WAY ANTHONYYYY
Thank you for being brave enough to rate this album 10/10.  It&#39;s her best work in a line of truly groundbreaking albums (except maybe Crash haha) and definitely deserves the praise.
I’m not gonna lie, I loved crash but it did make me feel like we might never see another pop2 type album. I didn’t listen to any of the singles for this album as I wanted to keep it a surprise and omg… this album is so fucking fun. It’s some of her best work. Everything is Romantic, talk talk, sympathy is a knife. So many tracks that will become required listening in the fandom.
You would&#39;ve given it an 11 if it was called borat
Agree. No skip album!! Fun and serious at the same time. Love it. Love Charli!!
Pls review ski masks new album
To Pimp A Bratfly
<b>WOULDA GAVE IT AN 11 IF SHE WAS NAKED ON THE COVER</b> 🙄
Dude wtf
If it was called genre:bratboy, you would’ve rated it a NOT GOOD
Love the love fantano <br><br>1 correction Sophie is not a pc music member. She collaborated with them but she very much transcended P.C. music and I’m pretty sure ag has referenced this himself.<br><br>She was already a well developed artist before P.C. music fully existed and so it would be more accurate to say she’s a progenitor of the sounds as she mentored and collabed with the founders of pc music
10?! I thought this one was kind of mid and I loved Charli and How I&#39;m Feeling Now (Crash was better too)
i’m a massive charli stan but this album is so mid imo. i wish crash or HIFN got this kind of hype
I was already telling people BRAT to was gonna blow Hit me hard and soft right out of the water. It&#39;s finally for some Charli recognition!
Why would you do this
Thank you
If her name was Charli West, you would&#39;ve given it a light 6
love the shirt
HAHAHAHAHAHA WHAT??????
Bro I’ve been on this wave for a minute fantano catch up come on<br><br>As far as role out and holistically  I’d agree this could for sure be a 10/10<br><br>However n1a I still feel is a little better with vroom vroom being even better than that. <br>But if you said those were 10/10s I’d also agree<br><br>Edit by catch up I just meant I wish you rated n1a and crash better I’m just being salty
In june??? Hell, yeah, Mr. Antonio Fandango.
i legit busted when i heard 11th dimension by ski mask the slump god you gotta review it
Charli xcx is the THIRD FEMALE and FIRST NON-AMERICAN TO SCORE A 10
Charli used a small group of producers and writers, hardly any samples, and no features on the main album to create this, easily her best album to date! It truly is deserving of a ten!
Isaac Wood somewhere smiling and nodding his head fr.
oh wow a 10, thats wild
WOAHHHHHH LETS GOOOOO
i just find it interesting that she chose to name her album after a sausage
god is so good
why isn&#39;t the 10 green?
bro is desperate to stay relevant
heard this the other day and thought it was some self indulgent garbage. anyways, i’m not in the demographic gonna go bump some bladee
WE WON I PRAYED FOR TIMES LIKE THESE
Where did you get that shirt fountain man?
Bro lookin more and more like Shrek every day
Some of this album is pretty repetitive with banal sonically infused sounds/instrumentals. I think her 2019-2022 albums were more interesting, conceptually too, or at least on a par.
Drop &quot;Right people, Wrong place&quot; review or.. oil up melon!
is fantano 🐶??? 🤨
it&#39;s wasian girl summer
A huge day for sausages
Charlixcx copies uhum Camila cabello
anthony’s a 365 party girl. he wants to do a little key do a little lime
ok thats done GIVE US THE 10 FOR NO HANDS
at this point he&#39;s just trolling
Why are people going crazy over a 7/10 late 2000s pop album
Never expected her to make an album that would surpass Charli in Melonman&#39;s mind but let&#39;s fucking GO
Omg
Congrats to Charli - I’m happy for her. Honestly though I’m beginning to feel the record is being a “BIT” overrated. It’s a good album don’t get me wrong, I’d probably give it about a 8.5 or 9.  But a 10? That implies perfect album and to me there are a few songs I dislike on here and that don’t fit the flow of this album. Also the super self references &amp; name calling of her, AG Cook, etc I find to be so cheesy and takes me out of the vibe completely  (Club Classics for example is just so unlistenable to me)
a 10 from fantano WOW
brathony greentano
Melon that’s a cool shirt! Where did you get it?
ho l y y y y
Damn
<b>looking at all my Anthony Fantano posters hanging on my room</b> <br><br><br><br>&quot;You meant everything for me&quot;<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Violently starts tearing apart each poster, one by one</b>
im trying so hard to like it but?? its not good???? help
If this were called BRAT you would have given it a 10
I don’t know if I should be thanking George Daniel that some of these songs actually have interesting drums, but Sympathy is a knife lowkey slaps
I might say something stupid sounds EXACTLY like the first Lights album
I might say something stupid sounds EXACTLY like the first Lights album
crazy score. it&#39;s probably 7.
Slay Charlie We love serving the girlies on pride mnth
ANTHONY FANTANO YOUVE DONE THE THING
Don’t understand your disdain for Crash and your adoration for self titled but i agree Brat is a 10 and it’s her best album to date
The PC Music circle is right on track to be the indisputable it-crowd of the music industry, between Brat and Desire, I Want to Turn Into You, they have turned out some of the highest-regarded music of the decade so far. The end of the PC Music label was heartbreaking at the time, but it has allowed them to work on projects that are more commercially viable than would be possible within the scope of PC Music&#39;s shtick. A. G. Cook is already a big name in the industry but I think within the year he&#39;ll be huge.
NO WAYYYYY LETS GO!!! 💚
I listened to the album myself, then watched this review and I almost laughed when he said &quot;10&quot;. For me it all led up to &quot;light to decent 8&quot;
to pimp a brat?
The thing thats annoying about Anthony is he was on a huge tweet spree about how great Charli is and how necessary she is. Kept talking about Brat and even went to her concert all the way up to this album release. And it just so happened to be a 10/10?. Sometimes his reviews seem so biased and premeditated off his rose tinted glasses for artists. And he&#39;ll even do the same thing for artists he hates.
Huge day for women who love their husbands
The only Charlie XCX song I have ever heard is her feature on Fancy.
What a time to be alive
if this album was made by charli xcx you would have given it a 10/10
If it was called &#39;To Pimp A Brat-terfly&#39;, you&#39;d have given it an 11.
I don&#39;t know... a 10 really? I feel like a collection of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLJ-zfBmChA&amp;t=150">2:30</a> tracks that emotionally barely vary (it&#39;s all uplifting electro) and is not really a journey when listening from start to finish just does not cut it for me.
you&#39;re so iconic for this???
My midwestern brain read this as &quot;brat&quot; and now I&#39;m hungry.
Idk tf u on but as a charlie lover this ain&#39;t no 10 self titled album was way better
house music not a 10 . Got to pay the bills some how
Yooo wtf
BART the band is better than this album
crazy
Happy Pride month
no way
club classic sounds like Fentanyl Tester
Let&#39;s freaking go
Ive been saying pop music is at a new high right now. This is definitely proof and im so excited for much more modern pop
You would have given this a 10 if it was by Charli XCX and was named &quot;BRAT&quot;
The Eighth Wonder of the World
Did anybody figure out if &quot;So I&quot; is based on something produced by SOPHIE?! Because it sounds exactly like &quot;No One Dies from Love&quot; from Tove Lo who I think was basically in the same circle as Charli and Sophie. It can&#39;t be a coincidence that the two songs have the exact same melody...
She’s such an icon… suck on that Azalea Banks
oh yeah
FUCKING 10
Giving this a 10 and Houdini a “not good” is crazy
this album cover is so trash
This album is a masterwork and has overtaken HIFN as her best album.
If you were one of the girls you would’ve given it a 1- wait what the fuck
There is probably a misunderstanding here. Or maybe he is just being ironic and I did not get it? This album is not amazing like that
were waiting for the new ski mask review
what the fuck
So real
I am a bit surprised by the score; however, I, like Anthony, cannot stop listening to this album. And, as Anthony said, there truly are no skips; even the deluxe version has bops! How I&#39;d rank Charli&#39;s projects: <br><br>1. Charli <br>2. BRAT <br>3. Vroom Vroom EP <br>4. how i&#39;m feeling now <br>5. Number 1 Angel <br>6. Pop 2<br>7. CRASH <br>8. Sucker <br>9. True Romance
I love green it&#39;s a cute color so I&#39;m glad did this well because green is a color<br><br>i haven&#39;t listened to the songs
all of the 3 last 10s from fantano being from women feels very correct
Tenthony Tentano
No way mate you giving this a 10, it&#39;s got so many skips on it
First time heard
Vulnerable lyrics and insane production! 💚💞💞💞
OMG????????? a 10??????? love u baldie
when i saw it on instagram i legit thought it was a meme hoyl shit
I was asleep for 12 hours and when I opened youtube this is the first thing I see. The 10/10 in the description left me GAGGED. <br>I CAN&#39;T FUCKING BELIEVE THIS!!! IT&#39;S A GOOD WONDROUS TIME TO BE AN ANGEL 💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚
A 10!!!!!!!!!
I had it on repeat since Friday, happy to see A is into it too
HOLY<br>SHIT
Not only is the brat marketing so genius but the whole album is incredible !!!!
Glad you liked the record Anthony but calling Charli XCX a brat feels unnecessary
he&#39;s finally chosen the right path guys
If this album was made by charli xcx you would have given it a 10
How is this album a 10 if it took you 13 minutes to even go into the sonics of the album at all 😐 🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅
Been watching this channel since 2010 and I can safely say I&#39;ve lived through all the 10/10s.
wow, a 10. i thought it was good but didnt think anything would top Charli&#39;s 9
If she talked about hating Jews you&#39;d give it a 11
Okay Fantano, I need you to stop with the hyperbolic reviews when you use such shaky terminology such as “I don’t think I’m disappointed” “I don’t think there’s a skip” for an album you rate as a 10. The talk around this album right now is annoying enough and you slapping a 10 on an album where the review doesn’t sound firm in that belief just makes the fanboys louder. <br><br>Look, the album is fine, but it’s like a 7 out of 10 at best. The last half drags. 365 is just a rehash of 360. Some songs feel unneeded (I Might Say Something Stupid), or maybe should’ve been fully fleshed out. I like it but it’s far from the album these glowing reviews make it out to be.<br><br>There is no way this album is perfect and I’m already about sick and tired of hearing about it.
Stop I’m fucking crying
lmao
A gain and a gain
This is a very big day for number rating fans
🎉🎉🎉
You only gave this a 10 because you scored 100% on “Brat Tamer” in the BDSM test
This during pride month is a blessing
what was the last 10 we got before this?
Who tf is thus industry plant
I can’t wait for The Tortured Poets Department to beat this for Album of the Year at the Grammys!
The Mucinex flannel is now canonically a 10
Will this be the second time that Chari gets album of the year at the year end list? E🅱️ic
i cried.
Father is back with the milk
Now you just need to give Pop 2, Charli, and How I&#39;m Feeling Now  retroactive 10&#39;s as well and you&#39;ll be on board.
NEXT REVIEW: AURORA - What Happened To The Heart?
They build statues of melons
knew it
Wild that the only chance for anything else to be album of the year is IF Kendrick or Death Grips drops AND it&#39;s at least their 2nd best album, or if JID&#39;s album tops TFS. I can&#39;t think of anything else that could potentially get a 10 from him this year
Love this album but in my opinion hifn is better
MASSIVE ALBUM!!!! Charli is the VIBE!!! 💚💚💚💚💚
waking up to a 10/10 review on one of my favorite albums of the year is like a treat omg
HMHAS being 7 and brat being 10 is not correct sorry
It&#39;s a 10 if AG made it
AINT NO WAY
WOOOOO
Charli XCX is the reason I ended a team’s 50-game winning streak
I know that’s right!!!! Brat deserves a 10 and got a 10 💚😭😭😭
No wayyy. A 10 finally
W H A T NEW 10
THE POP GIRLS HAVE FINALLY WON!!!!!
10??????? WHAAAAAT
YOOOOOOOOO
I think we all know that it’s actually a straight 9 and a gay 10
I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT HOW ITS VERY POSSIBLE U MIGHT GIVE BRAT A 10 LETS GOO
And on pride MONTH ! 🌈
Flying the flag for British artists again, whoop whoop 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
did expect to see a 10.. on this.. Now i have to actually watch the video
So biased
we love charli
is he trolling us? is this the apple goat syndrome?
Where can I buy the shirt?
Been a superfan since superlove and it feels SO GOOD to finally see Charli at her best AND get the recognition for it. <br>What a time to be alive.
Clock it anthonyyyyy
WAIT OMG 10/10!!!!
HOLY 10????????????
whoa
PERIOD A 10
Fuck Grammies, No.1 etc. a Fantano 10/10 is the peak in every artists career.
I can finally listen to an album after 2021. Thank you Melon!
M.I.A is better
Idk why anyone will admit that Pop2 and HIFN are far superior... (brat is great but c&#39;mon) big rating miss
The worst possible rating.
10...?
holy shit i cant believe this
Clearly influenced by Jojo Siwa’s gay pop genre, this Charlie guy is really only popping off thanks to the GOAT
Way overrated, Charli&#39;s PR team sent the big bucks huh?
yooo 10/10???
AOTY!!!!!
You only called it a 10 because charlie said you would if she didnt call it Kids See Brats
we did it
We did it kids
Iconic
AYO WHAT
YES
Yooo this is the first 10 I&#39;ve watched<br>Thought those didn&#39;t exist
You doing a new ski mask review at all? Also loved the video tho! Great album!
Will you please review the new Beak&gt; album “&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;”?
i bet Isaac Wood is so happy abt this
Yeah I agree with you on this one
Huge win for afro-americans all over Finland.
eu quando sou divorciado e quero pegar mulher (boto fé q o álbum deve ser bom, só ouvi 360)
oh my
I skipped ahead to the 10 minute mark.
This is the quintessential “I just turned 30 years old” album
this album is the most overrated of the decade
HOLY
I used to pray for times like this
I think it&#39;s a good album, but it has nowhere near the depth of musicality or risk-taking to warrant a 10. It&#39;s a great example of the genre, but hardly groundbreaking.
wait...are your glasses an Instagram filter?
Finally fantano says happy pride month (even if indirectly, we see u 🫶)
Charli getting a 10? Happy pride!
HONEY WAKE UP A FANTANO 10/10 JUST DROPPED ⏰🚨
I can&#39;t wait until he releases the same  review with 3 more tracks.
WHAAAAAAAT ?????
historical moment
brat is lowkey the best fantano 10. either this or the turning wheel
You’re obviously still in love with her ❤
i wasn’t familiar with Charli’s catalog before this album, but i decided to listen to it nevertheless.<br><br>i do not regret it at all. what an amazing album!
Okay I don&#39;t agree with it being a 10/10 but it&#39;s Charli so obviously LFG<br>How I&#39;m feeling now &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
a 10? yea ur full of shit
10/10 ALARM, THIS IS NOT A DRILL‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️💣💣💣💣
Really? I thought this album was mid as hell honestly.
Brathony really said gay rights during pride
where&#39;s the britpop review though
theneedledrop Thoughts on (any of) the following Melon?<br><br><br>Albums<br><br>Ski Mask The Slump God - KAYTRANADA - TIMELESS (ft. Don Toliver, Channel Tres, Anderson .Paak, Childish Gambino, Thundercat, etc.)<br><br>Bon Jovi - Forever<br><br><br>EP<br><br>Open Mike Eagle - Sir Rockabye
Only pedophiles give this album a 10/10
It’s a good album but a 10 is a massive stretch
WHAT??
We did it Joe
gay rights !! 10/10 from Anthony fantano DAMN
why u exaggerating man that&#39;s too much man
WE TRIED TO TELL Y&#39;ALL MOTHERFUCKERS FOR YEARS. WELCOME TO THE CHARLI TRAIN EVERYONE, THE QUEEN OF POP WILL SHOW YOU TO YOUR SEAT
You would have given it a 6 is it was called My Beautiful Dark Twisted Brat
I spilled my drink when i saw that 10
Thought there was a few good songs but kinda boring as a whole honestly
YAY🎉
Yo holy shit! I figured you&#39;d give it a 9!
No way that’s a 10 ? Wtf lmao
Fall in love again and again!
A new album in music. Its been 3 years since. Thank you fantano. Now i can listen to new music
Lets gooooo 🟩
Is this his first ten for a pop album😊
brat is THE cultural reset
What&#39;s going on you trying to slide in
god u can lose the shirt pls thanky ou
top me
Im crying i love you anthony
I initially was gonna give this one a miss after her iffy previous album but since the perfect score i&#39;m pumped to give this a listen now.
i knew it, deserved
I thought it was a 10/10 and now I know it’s a 10/10 😌
Please take a listen on a polish duo Coals and their latest album &#39;sanatorium&#39;
No wayyy
Woahhhh a 10 😳
I saw it on Twitter and I thought it was an edit oh my god
This is truly a certified club classic 🗣️
i feel like not giving this a ten during pride month would constitute a hate crime
Wow, very awesome
Can you please review the new Tems (debut) &amp; KAYTRANADA albums ?
where&#39;s your britpop review
What 😂
Thats why y&#39;all shouldn&#39;t be taking this guy seriously 😂
So you gave 10/10 to an album that made in 10 minutes in Ableton 😂😂😂😂
This is the best timeline
YES
Weezer green album
A 10!!!! 🟩 brat forever
Lol what this is not her best album lol
Agree on everything ❤
Gotta be a 9 at the VERY LEAST
10/10 for this trash!! well done
???
The comment preview stays spoiling the rating lol
it’s a seven to me but honestly i’m really happy you got a lot of enjoyment out of it
Holy, it actually happened! Sick!
10 out of 10 review it aga..
Wow
I&#39;m crying, we did it kids
10!!!!
WWWWWW great review melon
Good to know Charli dropped an album better than almost any rap artist ever
I’m gonna be honest, I listened to a few songs off this as someone who hasn’t really listened to her and like I don’t get it. Its fine and all but nothing about it jumps out in any way.
CARIMBA QUE É 10
LETS GOOOOOOOOOO
HOLY SHIT
I like Charli XCX, but I also hate Fantano so I’m conflicted
Im sorry 10??? 7 at most
😮i love you fantano ❤❤❤❤❤❤
10/10 OKAY CHARLI
damn
FIRST 10 OF 2024!!😊
💚
Truly the album of the year
Happy pride month people
Antonio el Fantas
100000% agree
DUUUUUUDEEEE
This makes up for every awful opinion youve made the last couple years
Fantano really said gay rights
I only liked some songs. I think club classics is the best track, because it sounds very weird.
i’m charli xcx’s only straight fan.
YESSS
If it&#39;s gay then it&#39;s 10 I guess
A 10!!!! Yes Anthony that is super correct ✅
She finally made it in Germany!
Track 4 is enough to NOT give it a 10…
Come on, this is boring record, nothing listen to, nothing to feel, just so mid desire to be in a line with great post-modern artists
True Romance is a 9/10 youre so wrong about it
I was so happy when she got the 9 now the circle is complete!!!
hey anthony, i would love to see you review the new 2hollis project. i think you could really enjoy it!
Come on melon this is not a 10
how much did they pay you
OH FUCK YEAH
How the fuck is this a 10?
A 10 OH MY GODDDDDD
why say there is a least favorite track if it’s a ten
Just say you were afraid of her fans babe 💖
what
Nah, this aint a 10. The production is not that colorful, it has a certain sound and it uses it in a lot of different ways, but the sound is pretty basic
finally a 10/10 i actually like
AOTY that&#39;s it
AUDIBLY YELLED AT THAT RATING&lt;3
365 has the best lyric video of all time
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
This is her Lemonade!!!
LET&#39;S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
No Shot
The greatest experimental pop/dance artist of all time!
wait what just happened
Lets be honest the biggest reason you gave this a ten is because you think charlie xcx is a 10
Wow you’re so right king
you would have rated it a 10 if it was named brat and the cover was green
We win
the alphabet people are really happy right now.
Ya never know where a ten will appear
🟩
New ten lets gooo
Huge day for shrek
WHAT at best this is an 8 I don&#39;t understand
W
Please someone explain to me what I&#39;m missing. Loved Charli and HIFN. I found Crash mostly enjoyable, but not at the level of the previous two albums. This one though, it&#39;s like... fine? Not completely awful but I can&#39;t say I&#39;m a big fan of it overall. But everyone else seems to love it. I must be missing something, I want to love it too 😭
damn
No Fantano, strutting and posing with 360 in the background is not a review
Fantano is down bad if he thinks this is a 10
WE WON
You would&#39;ve given it a 0/10 if it wasn&#39;t so damn good
The gays won!
For the gays!!!!!!
WE WON. 💚<br>Pop 2, Charli, how im feeling right now and brat. What a run. <br>I knew a 180 after Crash was on the horizon. Stuff like this makes me love music.
My first live 10/10 since I started watching in 2022! LFG!!!!!!
oh my god
YESSSSS IVE BEEN WAITING! Now do timeless review
finally I can listen to this album!
This would&#39;ve been a 6 if it was My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy by Kanye West, a different album entirely
This is so julia of you fantano.
probably charli xcx will be the first artist to have the number 1 spot in the top 50 albums in two different years. charli was his aoty in 2019
I shouldn&#39;t have delayed my first listen. Now I&#39;m expecting perfection
Ws IN THE CHAT BOYS
need more 10s
A 10!!!
Am I having a fever dream right now how in the hell did this happen
melon lord I abide your words and I will listen brat
Now blonde and renaissance and lemonade are 8, folklore is a 7, but this hyperpop mess is a 10 💀
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
ITS HAPPENED!!!!!   I’m so fucking happy
BIG W
OH MY FUCKING GOD
I really like true romance 😭 I don’t listen to sucker tho I don’t see a point when every other album exists
Dude a ten, insane
lets gooooooo😊
If it was called to pimp a brat you would have given it a ten.
was expecting a 7 but am not mad with the 10. melon got his shit together for this one!!!
Highly recommend checking out Prof Skye&#39;s review, fascinating discussion about &quot;good taste&quot;, privilege and music snobbery as well as why this is a masterpiece ❤
Am I reading this right?<br>A 10??????
brat 10/10<br>charli 9/10<br>vroom vroom / how im feeling now 8/10<br>number 1 angel / pop 2 7/10<br>crash 5/10<br>true romance 3/10<br><br>charli collecting all the notes like thanos collecting the infinity stones
THATTTTT
damn i have to listen it again, only songs i liked besides the singles was talk talk
say what you want, u still not getting a statue
WHAT
There&#39;s now 3 women in the musical industry<br>Truly inspiring
OMG, what a time to be aliveeeeeeee<br><br>I love Charli, her new album Brat is comforting me so much with some health issues I&#39;m dealing with rn 😭 <br><br>Melon is right, as always 💚
this was unprecedented
Sympathy is a knife is the most emotionally devastating pop banger I&#39;ve ever heard. Haven&#39;t been able to finish the record because I just keep spinning that track
Billie clears
a 10 wtf
احا
WOOOOOOW okay, i was not expecting this
Okay but what about her new album &quot;brat and its the same but there&#39;s three more songs so its not&quot;
Ae need a Britpop review please
holy shit this isn&#39;t real
I have lost faith in humanity
hit the like if you like<br>please subscribe<br>its ok to cry
10!!!! holy shit!!!!!
AHHH I ACTUALLY AGREE FOR ONCE
GAY RIGHTS
but its so midddd
react 2 drifting by night tapes
Hey i think you should react to some NIGHT TAPES SONGS
Oww, it just warms my heart when you can see Tony being so exited he almost cannot contaim himself &lt;3
its the worst album cover ive seen
This the best year for music since 2016💀
Fantony Antano
everyone saying this is surprising or whatever clearly doesnt remember how much anthony was all over charli back in 2019, literally was his favorite of the year
Thank you for giving out another 10/10, Anthony! I wasn&#39;t sure if i could handle only listening to KSG and TPAB for the rest of my life.
blat&#39;
it&#39;s been so long since I&#39;ve seen a 10 from you I almost thought it would never happen again
FIRST 10 IN 3 YEARS LETS GOOO
this is your most positive 10/10 review
WHAT????????????¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿
DAMN ON PRIDE MONTH
BRAT DRIP MAKE EM LOOK LIKE LUIGI
Babe, wake up! New fantano 10 just dropped
you made me listen to true romance and feel like i&#39;m 17 again
You would’ve given this a ten if Charli was white
This guy is the biggest troll 😂
Do you think this is a literal nod to Sophie? I feel like it is , and the album is also angry and sad, and a lot about identity, self, even the shape of her face, and visual style…I dunno. I like it. It’s definitely not happy, but it’s fun.
From my perspective, a 10/10 album or song needs to have a swan-like song thats 4 to 15 mins long that somehow transcends the listeners with lots emotions and impacts the genre as a whole, cases such as phantom pt 1 and 2, Boys at school by spellling, Outside and Top picks for you and bye storm by injury reserve, power and dark fantasy and devil in a new dress and runaway by kanye west, Wesley’s theory city and blacker the berry and mortal man and i and how much a dollar cost by kendrick lamar, Oxygen and screenshot and glowing man by swans, Enlacing and say the name and check the lock by clipping, Pigeon by cannibal ox, Reborn by kids see ghost,  Too long by daft punk, New york I love you and someone great and dance yrself clean and home and I can change by Lcd soundsystem, Return to monke by viagra boys, Rave on U and some kind of game by Against All Logic, Black Seminole by lil yachty, Hidden power by machine girl, Oh slime live performance by fishmans, Spiritual Level Gang shi by Soul Glow, Parabol and parabola by tool, On Gp by death grips, King of carrot flowers  pt 1 to 3 by Neutral milk hotel, Thank you my twilight and last dinosaurs by the pillows Mosquito Song by queens of the stone age,  Bodysnatchers and paranoid android and national anthem and everything is going in its right place and exit music for a film by radiohead, Frontier Psychiatrist by the avalanches, Static and Dead flag blues and rocket falls on rocket falls by godspeed you!, Master of puppets by Metallica, Running up that hill and Hounds of love by kate bush, House settling by quadeca, Aerials by system of the down. <br><br>Now from what I’ve seen from the tracklist of this album, its mostly consisting of around 1-3 mins. And I’ve heard a couple of snippets of some of the tracks, so yeah idk I feel like this going to be a very bittersweet experience since its like very short. But let me know whether if theres any songs in here that are swans like
HOLY SHIT HE GAVE IT A TEN
IMO Charli is a relentless auteur 💚
Come on it&#39;s not a 10, it&#39;s good but an 8 at best
Never got the hype, but I get you riding the hype... fraud
I DONT WANNA WAKE UP IF THIS IS A DREAM MELON YOURE MY DADDY AND MY FATHER ILYYYY
Definitely not a 10 but alright
You did Death Grips dirty
A win for Charlottes everywhere
strong 9 to 10? disappointed
I can’t wait for that bromance interview between Fantano and Andrew Tate, huge fan of both 🙌
If this album was called 10, you would have given it a brat
Wow
DO 11TH DIMENSION SKI MASK THE SLUMP GOD
Mmmmokayyy..
It works every time, if he rates an album a 0, then a 10 is guaranteed to show up
melon this totally ain&#39;t a 10 lol
I’ve been a huge fan of Charli since 2020 and I’m so happy to see this 😭💚
HAPPY PRIDE MONTH
anooootheeeeeer oneeeeeeeee. lets goooooo
bazinga
Anthony has never sounded less enthusiastic to give an album a ten.
Oh shit. Congrats Charli xox
Wtf Anthony, 9 is enough i would say
I think it&#39;s actually pronounced brat like bratwurst
legendary review 💚💚💚💚💚
You wouldn&#39;t have given this a 10 if it wasn&#39;t a 10.
Wow
cool a 10
i actually don&#39;t believe him rn, a 10 should have more enthusiasm, it&#39;s a 7 at best, the lead singles were a 10
A rare 10 sighting... What a time to be alive to witness nature&#39;s most spectacular phenomenon
It’s 4am I’m barely asleep playing this in the background while I fall back asleep and this vids score woke me up in a cold sweat
Melon is looking snatched recently it’s the brat effect
I think he likes it
This is the &quot;Songs About Fucking&quot; for Gays.
No fucking way
Bruh Von Dutch is a goddamn BANGER
YALL WE WON HOLY SHI-
thank you for introducing your audience to partying
This has to be a quota 10. The review sounded like a 7, and when he did the weekly track roundups for the album singles, he liked them but didn&#39;t sound amazed.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLJ-zfBmChA&amp;t=822">13:42</a> bloody hell.... I never thought I&#39;d see the day... 😀 Spermthony Wanktano
I thought it would be a light 8, maybe a light 9 if we are reallyyyy lucky, but damn, THANK YOU
🚨POP EMERGENCY🚨
WHAT
Me 2 minutes in: oh he likes it<br>Me 6 minutes in: oh he REALLY likes it<br>Me at the score: 😲
MASSIVE MELON W
slay but also it lacks a little bit of context about CRASH! It was the last album, the last duty on her previous and first deal with her label which lasted abt 9 fucking years. then she realized she never made a full pure main girl pop album and she decided to prove how strong could she be leading one, so she used the marketing team, did performances on tv show, promoted as she should and the album debuted at #1 on UK, had 2 ... average hits and a successful tour, proving her point. it surely differs from her hyperpop trajectory, but it reinforces what she always said - specially on her Clik track - she can go pop and make hits whenever she wants. And Speed Drive shows that&#39;s true.
YES YES YES!!!
,🙄
not gonna lie, idgi....... i listened to it... its not BAD. but a TEN??? i just idgi.........
&quot;so i&quot; actually made me cry
but no britpop review?!
Brat means brother in Russian
I DID SO NOT EXPECT THAT HOLY SHIIIIIII i mean now we know he likes ‘I think about it all the time’ which he kinda didn’t react to on the stream. It’s such a cute song.
I would credit Tom Norris in part to making the album is so good
massive win for green people
I feel like I&#39;m in a rare position. I&#39;m a diehard charli fan but this isn&#39;t a 10 for me ;-;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLJ-zfBmChA&amp;t=419">6:59</a> I love your channel and your audience, I&#39;m gonna comment on ALL your videos for years until I reach your level of subscribers.
amazing record
A 10????
thicko called this massive slag posh, and wants you to trust his judgement. disaster
This is the only album I know of that I liked the moment it dropped as I went song by song but didn&#39;t feel it was great but at the same time every song banged, that also got a 10 from Melon<br><br>I feel... So fulfilled
Isn’t this who made Isaac Wood nut so hard in his sleep he made the greatest song of all time and then quit bcnr
review No Hands by Joey Valence &amp; Brae
A TEN A TEN A TENNNN
Finally, another album.
a modern ten?? thats crazy!!!!
Holy moly
This is basically Antony’s coming out
WHY NO YELLOW FLANNEL DOE?
I definitely recommend you revisit True Romance - it was not commercially successful BECAUSE of how experimental it was at the time! One of her best albums, if not the best. It set the tone for all of the sounds she&#39;s explored in the last decade.
LFGGGGGGGGGG CHARLI BABY
WELCOME TO THE CLUB CHARLI
There is no way, this is not a 10/10 album
He would’ve given this a zero if it was called Speeding Bullet to Brat
I’ve never heard a Charlie xcx song on the radio. I feel like only online people listen to her
Posh English party girl..yes that’s the vibe I get from her
Da green album
I cannot believe he gave this a 6.. he maybe really is against the queer community
mid
Keep it a buck this album is not a 10 but it’s still solid
WHAT THE FUCK
The Lana Del Rey line in Mean Girls is legendary.
Huge W for us queers, thank your melonman
I SCREAM MY ASS WITH THIS RATING
How can BRAT be a 10 when Apple is on it? That song is straight up TRASH! It&#39;s like a Kero Kero Bonito song if Kero Kero Bonito was bad.
AND ON PRIDE MONTH!!
This is a huge slay from your side Mr. Baldman.
He would give this a 10
Now review A. G. Cook 😃
First listen blew my mind, the second melted it and it seems it is not just me with Herr Fantano&#39;s 10. I was sitting down already before this review dropped. A landmark work of art. Now maybe a review of Britpop by AG is due?
What a beautiful day. Celtics winning and fantasy is in green.
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOO 💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚
During pride month?? Ouuuu iktr
COMPRO INTEIRA INGRESSO SHOW CHARLI XCX EM SÃO PAULO 22/06 NA ZIG
he only gave brat a 10 because it&#39;s tpab with the letters switched around
WAKE UP, IT&#39;S DUH FIRST 10 OF THE YEAR
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Her last album was so good it was a 12
Gasped at that score 😭 love this for her!
I mean...yeah. Fire album
wow
I feel like it&#39;s  coming out
im a brat bitch. 10/10
Honestly, it must feel good over time to be a consistent music reviewer because everyone talks about your &quot;YOUR OPINION WAS STUPID HERE LOLL&quot; moments but you probably have just as man &quot;I TOLD you so&quot; moments
TAYLOR SWIFT MORREUUUUUUUU
soylennial manifesto of an album. 2020s radio pop. its like a 5/10
Holy shit?
deserve🙂‍↕️🙂‍↕️🙂‍↕️🙂‍↕️🙂‍↕️🙂‍↕️
This means Camila Cabello’s carbon copy album will get a 1 😂
I like that you finally realized how good Weezer Green is
She always serves ya know
Wait I did not expect this at all
I LOVE CHARLI XCX TY FANTANO
what a day - need your verdict on the extra three tracks right now
This is one for the history books
I haven’t listened to this yet and now i’m excited to.
YOU GON JUMP IF AG MADE IT
Bad day to be a mature adult
brat flannel woo
i spoiled the score and flipped my lid, i’ve never even listened to a charli album in my life but this review made me go listen<br><br>this album is going down as a 2020s classic, so well produced and her lyrics are effortlessly funny and heartbreaking
Funny to think of I first heared Charli on Fancy. What a journey.
inner west sydney in tatters
I had a feeling he would love this when I heard it for the first time lol. It is a fucking awesome album, just hope it doesn&#39;t become too fantanocore with how people talk about it
Club Classics is an MIA rip off and 360 is a Kesha rip off. IM not saying its a bad thing. I like the songs. But the next time you compare an artist to another to disqualify them a bit, think of the hypocrisy.
I&#39;ll give it a 7/10 🤷🏽‍♂️
To Pimp a Brattefly 🟩🥲
Yep agree with ya
this has to be the least 10/10 sounding 10/10 review hes ever done.. if i hadnt checked the score i wouldve expected an 8 maybe a 9 from what he’s saying in this review
this shit so fucking fire 😭😭😭😭❤️
Holy shit, a 10? It is really good though...
As a fan, I’ve always taken issue with the commodification and labeling of “hyperpop” - it just feels so reductive and frankly, cringe - and seeing Charli step away from that world with Crash was refreshing, albeit slightly dissatisfying with how boundary-breaking her previous works were.<br><br>Brat is an incredible album on its own accord, and a deeply intelligent way of continually pushing not only Charli’s art forward, but experimental electronic music as a whole. She could have easily painted by numbers and released a basic “hYpErPoP” album the angels would have eaten up- but she chose an incredibly risky sonic path that resulted in something monumental. Anyone nowadays can make pots and pans Charli dupe music - but nobody else could make an album like this.<br><br>She was able to pay tribute to such a beloved queer movement, vintage club music and UK rave culture- while still feeling fresh and innovative. This is a landmark album in her career, and pop as a whole - and easily defeats How I’m Feeling Now when considering her magnum opus. It’s truly a beautiful experience from start to finish and a surreal moment of culture to live through. It deserves every ounce of praise it’s receiving!
I SAW A FUCKING 10 LETS FUCKING GO BABY
lets goooooo 10!!!!!!!!
what the fuck
This shit not better than Ken Carson
with this 10, it&#39;s likely that this will be the first time an artist earns the #1 spot on fantano&#39;s best albums of the year AGAIN. no artist has reached that achievement twice.
Now also review the AG cook record!
I&#39;m glad that as a gay, I enjoyed this album before being told it&#39;s good.
Wow I can’t believe you scored this garbage higher than Yves Tumor’s latest record. I think it’s time you see a doctor about that ear infection and lay off the drugs.
on Brat:<br>least fav track: N/A<br><br>on TPAB:<br>least fav track: you ain&#39;t gotta lie<br><br>curious 🤔
wow
Review the ski album and not this npc music
damn, i havent heard it yet but i saw on the fantanoforever reddit people were initially saying you&#39;d give it a 7 or 8.  They also said its not a 10 in their own opinions.  I better not see a switch up!
Anyone who heard this album KNEW a 10 was coming. There was just no way Fantano wouldn’t.
funny how everything’s romantic sample is the same as the vultures song
🫡🫡🫡🫡
who are the charli copycats he mentions?
Charli joining the 10s club is so fucking satisfying to witness.
hope she sees this bro
I kind of forgive you for the post human nex gen review now
LETS GO CHARI 💚💚💚
Man c&#39;mon it&#39;s not a 10 outta 10 album. 6/10 at best so many tracks are horribly boring.
we prayed for times like these 🙏💚💚 brat world domination
Massive W for the world right now.
Holy shit we got a 10
I’m so tired of this guy at this point
Yo dis is fukin crazyy😭😭
my jaw dropped when i saw the rating fr
The album cover has to be a reference to the YouTube channel HaveFunTeaching, specifically their song for the letter X which uses almost the same color and type choice as Charlie XCXs new album cover.
PERIODSSD
This dude has a crush on Charli
in all fairness this album is actually pretty futuristic. I feel like pre and during the pandemic a lot of artists in the hyper pop sphere pushed themselves and music so far that we finally have room for more fun. it’s optimism but not just naive optimism, but optimism that recognizes we’re all as confused as one another. we’ve innovated and now it’s time to what we learned sonically during that period and applying it to where we are now instead of trying to constantly try to innovate.
If she&#39;d named it To Pimp A Brat you&#39;d ha-... oh, good for you Pineapple.
Im shocked…
It&#39;s strange. because it&#39;s so secondary.
First time seeing him wearing a brat flannel tho
Waited for this review. Nice! ❤ 💚
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Zdarova brat
Bring<br>Rating<br>At<br>Ten<br><br>Mr Melon understood the threat
WE ARE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY
Giving this a 10 but Motomami a 7? Get fuqqed
10 10 10s across the board
The concert she&#39;s playing tomorrow in Chicago will be the gayest room I&#39;ve ever been in, and I could <b>not</b> be more excited.
Of all the fuckin albums that have come out since the last one, this is the absolute LAST album I’d expect him to give a 10
Tomorrows Charli&#39;s shirt is gonna say &quot;They MIGHT build statues of SOME critics&quot;
LESSSGOOOOO A 10
I&#39;m hoping this triggers a Black Country New Road re-band
Brat was my first listen to Charli. i assumed it wouldn’t be for me as a rap/r&amp;b fan, and maybe even to an extent as a straight man. i really enjoyed it, it’s very fun. <br><br>will check out SOPHIE and ag cook, but would anyone have any other suggestions?
I might have to listen to this now lmao
ALBUM OF THE DECADE 🎉🎉🎉💅💅💅
YESSSS
You would&#39;ve given it a taste in music if it was called brad
Adult Contemporary by Chromeo!
omgggg? 10?
now THIS is gay pop
happy pride month
fuck yeah!
WHAT THE FUCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
weezer ass picture
yo
this is fantano’s gift to gay people
If this album was called брат, you would have given it a десять.
Please melon review the new 2hollis album
after 11 9s anthony has finished edging us
I was going to listen to this album when I got the chance but now I’m super going to listen to this album when I get the chance
YOU SEE THE VISION MELON
Nahhhh that ain’t a 10 and I love her
Alright, Melon. I&#39;ll hear you out
WE GAYS HAVE WON 💚💚💚
This album is 10 and Cindy Lees was an 8? Dont get it personally
God bless
Charli is still my favorite album of hers but I can see why people would pick this one now.
given how many great ratings there have been so far this year, i was just waiting for when the next 10 would be, it just felt inevitable<br><br>AND HERE IT IS, I WAS RIGHT
The lgbt community has forgiven fantano
Melon giving this a 0/10 is pretty… oh wait, sorry, I see the 1 now
He a fan, he a fan, he a fan
i was loving this album so so much, so i was not expecting this sudden 10 from melon… epic
BUMPIN&#39; THAT
it seems like everyone has already convinced themselves that this is the best album ever and now ur lying to yourselves lol, it&#39;s so dated already. it&#39;s the chronically online manifesto lmaoooo
Wait what?!??!???
Reminder that Charli was rated higher than KIDS SEE GHOST (which was a 10) on Anthony&#39;s Top 200 Albums of the Decade video, so this technically means Charli is the first artist with TWO 10s.
Who would have know that an artist featured on the ground breaking game changer album by Lil Xan &quot;Total Xanarchy&quot; would get eventually her own 10 too huh
the first 10 in over 3 years, crazy
You only gave it a 10 because it a fucking 10
People in the comments kicking themselves with the prewritten “this would have been a ten if” jokes
Charli bumping up that ratio of female artists with a 10
WE DID IT!!!! 10/10 BRAT BRAT BRAT BRAT
I live all my nig as
WIN FOR THE GAYS EVERYWHERE
So cool to see that you already got the merch
He done goofed by not having the t-shirt say “bald”.
may we get a review for the marias-submarine?
no hay duda que eres mi marido 😭
Wow this guy really focuses a lot on the lyrics, not much in the music.
WOOOOOOHOOOOOO!!! A 10/10 on PRIDE MONTH!!! Way to go Charli!!!
Day 758 of commenting until Bratthony Greentano reviews an album by Woodward and Parker
YO?!
I had no idea Von dutch was about JoJo siwa!!
You feeling alright?
A TENNNNN NAIJSFNOIASJFOISAJIGSAJOIASGASGSASGGSSGGA
massive win for fans of the colour green
If it was named BRAT you would&#39;ve given it a 10
Disappointed he didn&#39;t just write &#39;brat&#39; on his album cover art
as a huuuuge charli fan, im so confused at how this is the album everyone is seeking as ground breaking. i genuinely feel like she has at least 3 albums more innovate, interesting, cohesive and vulnerable than this album. so confused ahaha
Imagine releasing the review for an album and giving it a 10/10 the same day it gets a new release with 3 more bangers on it. The only minor gripe I have with the album is the how sequencing in the &#39;brat and it&#39;s the same but there&#39;s three more songs so it&#39;s not&#39; version should&#39;ve put the new songs into the middle while keeping 365 as the last track for thematic reasons [I think &quot;Hello goodbye&quot; should go between &quot;Everything is Romantic&quot; and &quot;Rewind&quot; because Rewind and &quot;So I&quot; need to stay back to back but I like how &quot;Hello goodbye&quot; has replay in the lyrics and this regretful tone to the lyrics that sets up Rewind perfectly, &quot;Guess&quot; should go between &quot;Talk talk&quot; and &quot;Von Dutch&quot; as like a payoff of getting to talk to the subject of &quot;Talk talk&quot; while having some stylistic continuity going into &quot;Von dutch&quot;, and &quot;Spring breakers&quot; is harder to place but probably between &quot;B2b&quot; and &quot;Mean girls&quot; because I like how &quot;Spring breakers&quot; would setup the internal world for the character described from the outside in &quot;Mean girls&quot;]. I can do that for myself in a playlist. Fantastic album.
Let’s go gays but this album sucks ass
Very nice to see another 10
HOLY SHIT.
10/10 wtaf
YAYY
GODDAMN
now you have to review that new kaytranada album
10 🚨
This man has the worst takes in music.
brat 💚4eva
WTFFFFFFF
does this count for metacritic
Charli 10c10
:0
oh we are FEASTING
i legit couldn&#39;t get past the 3rd song, am i missing something?
Literally screaming at work😂
WOW
This album was a step back for charli XcX.  Very forgettable song&#39;s frankly the youtube realm has overrated it.
Bratthony
goin through the comments and see all this running jokes … man … i love this community
Well deserved 10!! Let’s go CHARLI! 🔥
I forgive you now, Anthony.
Seriously? Are you sure? I think everyone has his guilty pleasure but to me it sound mediocre at the best or even pure garbage! There’s no way that this thing will click on me in the future.
Now that he&#39;s produced a masterpiece work of art, will you stop referring to Charles XCX as a girl and insisting on using that diminutive nickname?
Oh hell yeaaaaaaaaah
This just revived my will to live.
Yes Melon, couldn&#39;t have said it better myself.
Never had a &quot;jaw-dropping&quot; moment in my entire life up until now.
please review Aurora what happened to the heart
Congrats Dream on your first 10/10. Many more to come
Leave it to this man to give Charlie a 10 and weave into the review his blantant support imperialistic XIX Belgium.
YES, YOU ARE SO BASED AS HELL RN
New overrated meme format unlocked: if this was called to pimp a brat, it would’ve been a 10
ALBUM OF THE YEAR STATUS?!
You&#39;re a joke.
The timeline has been restored!!
Knew a 10 was possible with how you were dancing to it on New Music Friday
werk
Oh yeah
CHARLI GETTING A TEN DURING PRIDE MONTH??? ALLY!!!!!!!!!!!
WE WON 10/10 FOR CHARLI LETS GOOO
You know XCX is not 10 in roman numerals.. right melon?
what the fuck?
Not a 10 just saying <br><br>5/10 what a horrible cover album
YOOOOOOO what a twist
holy shit
No yellow flannel threw me off
if it was called laughingbrat you wouldve given it a strong 6.... &lt;-- just a little joke guys no hard feelings
huh? 10? OMG!!! I AGREE BUT WOW THIS IS COOL
10?! really?<br>It honestly sounds 2009 Keesha/Flo Rida demos that got a Fred Again treatment.<br>Sometimes it just sounds like those 2010 artists that were making electro pop on cheap casio toy keyboards &quot;uh it&#39;s supposed to sound kinda crappy and diy&quot;<br>I could excuse all that if any of it was actually catchy, but it&#39;s so bland and forgettable. And it&#39;s 15 half baked tracks of this shit, it isnt even a cohesive listening experience, it&#39;s just a track dump.<br>It&#39;s a 6/10 at best. B2b is kinda decent, but the rest is just ugh
Happy pride month 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️🎉
broo melons been SO in his element with these thumbnails recently fr crazy times to live through
PRIDE MONTH IS ALIVE AND WELL!
this shit like concentrated 100gecs and adderall
This is the album of pride month, all my fellow queer and neurodivergent folks out there can be rejoicing. RIP Sophie, we miss you.
CHARLIIIII
woah
oh. my. goodness.
History has been made
ive never been so emotional seeing a review, charli is one of my favourites of all time and its been so good to see her grow. so glad you saw the magic this record had too
tenes razon antonio, ahora lo escucho!!!!!
This 10 was a bigger jumpscare than Ken Carson‘s 0
deserved
I LOVE CHARLI I LOVE BEING TRANS AND GAY RAHHHHHHHHH
brat worldwide
NO FUCKING WAY HOLY SHIT
Green color enjoyers we WON
❤
We as a society have earned this

I liked the record but was not expecting this
Von Dutch gotta be about Cam… nvm
WOW
B)
Wow.
agreed.
A day in history fr, 10
Wtf is this shit. Absolutely diabolical. Why is fantano on this hypetrain, brainwashing millions of people into believing this is genuinely good club/rave/party whatever electronic music. I&#39;m hoping this is a joke review, because the album is some of the most basic electropop shit I&#39;ve ever heard in my life. <br><br>If you want to experience a wild rave, listen to Squarepusher, Autechre, Orbital, Venetian Snares, Nanoray, Xanopticon, Somatic Responses, Underworld, The Chemical Brothers, G Jones, Eprom, Alix Perez, etc...<br><br>This is just a lame, shallow, annoying attempt at electronic music. I preferred Charli&#39;s last 3 albums that were more hyperpop. There&#39;s none of that here. Wtf is happening to the world.
10 🎉
YEAA FUCKIN KNEW ITT
HAPPY PRIDE MONTH EVERYONE!!!
ants from up there and hellmode get a 9, brat gets a 10. in what alternate universe do we even live in right now?
Ok but when is he gonna rewview ski Mask
He said &quot;happy pride&quot;
NO FUCKIING WAY LETSSS GOOOOOO!!!!
As a gay and a green lover I’m winning.
So refreshing that we don’t have to read a million comments like „you would haven given it a 10 if it was called ‚how to xcx a charlibrat‘“ or some shit like that
you would have given it a 3 if it was called brat: human next clancy
Just got a new album I can listen to, thanks Anthony !
WTFFFFFFFFFFFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
🟩YES 🟩
Watching your Vroom Vroom review all those years ago genuinely affected my life so much. Seeing this all this time later feels like a crazy kind if payoff. Thank you
YES!!!
She truly outdid herself with this album we truly were fed with this album
Awesome album review.
I call this album &quot;Brittish green propaganda&quot;. there is 8 minutes worth of music in 41.5 min runtime.
This is not only a strong contender for AOTY but also Album of the Decade if we&#39;re being honest
lol. sure. this is 10 !!!! and you are really smart ! =)))
GAYS STAY WINNING
Most overated of all time.
If the cover art was green you would’ve given it a 10
OMMFGGGGG
what lol i&#39;m surprised u gave black dresses a 6 on pride month... and then you gave charli a 10... also on pride month... maybe i&#39;ll forgive you for the slander<br><br>nah just kidding. you&#39;re not forgiven. but its still cool that u gave charli a 10 like she deserves
Brother has the F slur pass now
Charli still better
You would have rated it 11 if you included the three new songs but it&#39;s the same album but there&#39;s three new songs so it&#39;s not but then you would&#39;ve rated it an 11 but it&#39;s not.
Finally an album I&#39;m intellectually permitted to listen to and enjoy, thank you melon
That 10 verdict felt like the biggest Mic Drop of Tony’s career.
anthony a certified brat
I KNEW IT!!!!!
maybe they do build statues of critics
And to think you gave the last album a 5... This is INSANE ohmygod thank you Charli xcx
Huge for Bratz
didn’t think there would be a 10 this year
I think nobody saw this coming, melon
Bold of Charli xcx to use Fantano&#39;s shirt as her album cover. She will be hearing from his lawyers
Really loved this album, glad you feel the same melon 🍈
LET&#39;S GOOOOOO
This rating is correct
wait 10?? wow
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE HEART? by AURORA pleasee 😩😩🙏
FIRST BRITISH ARTIST TO GET A 10 LET’S GOOOOO
Wait... is this canon?
Guys dont get so excited, you forgot to remove the post-fader modifier bonuses, <br><br>Anthony thinks its an 8, still good
Okkkkkkk
AAAAAAAAAA
I like Charli and this album alot, but I never expected a 10. Kinda shocked actually. Personal taste is a crazy thing, because after a few listens I&#39;m not sure what you heard that made you give this a perfect score. I think even Charli has better material than this. I just think it isn&#39;t as cohesive as it could have been. <br><br>But hey, happy for Charli nonetheless!
Hell yeah 🎉
Boom Clap was like my first favorite song as a kid, didn&#39;t ever hear anything else from her aside from I Love It. Forgot about her for like a decade and started listening to her music again last week, cool to see she&#39;s doing good right now
this literally made my jaw drop
You would&#39;ve called it unreviewable if it was called BRAT 1
NO FUCCIN WAY HE GAVE IT A TEN LMFAOO
This an 8 bruh, but whatevs it’s great
Wait so is there an explanation as to who “Julia” is. “I’m everywhere I’m so Julia”
you gave the gecs album an 8 but this watered-down version of that a 10??
A 10 I LOVE YOU FANTANO
I was expecting this album to either be as bad as its cover or as good
Did anyone catch that Charli is not the brat
RIP SOPHIE &lt;3
the production serves 💅🏻 the songs
this album is like a 4
i love the album. its a 10 for me
ok now, but we need charli to submit her album for Grammy noms, this is the time 💚
10 ? Really. When Vampire Weeknd didn&#39;t. I thought this was going to get a Strong 9.
Oh SHIT
WHAT
Just want to point out every 10/10 this decade are by women!
HOLY FU-(head explodes)
брат
all those people who click onto yellow flannel reviews just to see if the album got a 10 are gonna be so mad
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAH 💚💚💚💚💚 LET&#39;S GO!!!! SHE GETS HER 10!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I KNEW IT LET&#39;S GOOOOOOO
Anthony you can&#39;t just put N/A as your least favourite, that Bring Me the Horizon track isn&#39;t even on the album!
I love how straightforward she was with her songwriting
Lol
i’m spasming
It’s angel season
Couldn&#39;t have happened to a more deserving artist. Long live Charli.
i wasn’t really a fan of this album, and i was really surprised to hear you give this a 10. i never really listen to charlixcx aside from i love it and boom clap. is there something i’m missing? or is she simply just not for me?
Lets go lets go lets go lets go lets go W
fantano fans can now listen to SEVEN albums
BRAT is superior 💚
No way
I woke up from a bad dream and opened my phone to this
If this was Lifeless Supervision by Wynn Calcutt you would’ve gave it a 10
the brat flannel is so real
how much did choli pay you
Sorry but gonna have to disagree. I did enjoy some of the tracks, don&#39;t get me wrong. But I wouldn&#39;t give this a 10. There&#39;s just artists out there(for me personally anyway) that are way better than this. I gave this album a 6/10.
I resubbed
two weeks ago if you told me i&#39;d love this album and fantano would give it a 10 i&#39;d be shocked. idk if i agree it&#39;s 10/10 but it&#39;s ridiculously excellent. i for sure thought she fell off entirely but here we are. haven&#39;t even watched a fantano review in months but i just knew to tune into a 14 minute review of this album.
Kheee?
what are you doing man 😭
Did not see a 10 coming at all. I liked the album, most songs are great, but it felt sort of lackluster and shaky as an album experience to me.
You would have gave it a 10 if Charli was a man
This is the same clown that said thriller isn’t a 10 and hated on its apple ranking? I ain’t taking this serious
I loved it. &quot;So I&quot; HURT ME though....ow 😢
NO FUCKING WAY.
the tpab of homosexuality
MASSIVE WIN FOR PRIDE MONTH
A 10?? Waa a WIN!!
I&#39;m so happy you finally gave charli a 10/10! As much as i lov brat and agree it&#39;s a 10/10, Charli is still my fav album bc of how ahead of the curve it was and its hyperpop futuristic sounds. Since it has been around 5 years since it dropped, would you consider relistening to it and changing the rating? Do you think it has held up well?
10 And i met her today Damnnn What a FUCKING DAY!!!
So glad you decided to positively review the Cult Classic Russian Film, Brat. Really appreciate it MelonHead.
OH MY GOD NO WAY I WAS NOT EXPECTING THAT OH MY GOD
You would have given it light lo decent 6 if it was called My Beautiful Brat Twisted Fantasy, Anthony
Wtf a 10???
gag
Taste
Taste was shown
WHAT TJESUHSHFGJCJKGCIGUCUGC
Lol hahahaha
You just like women tony , arentu? 😉
I don&#39;t understand how brat gets a 10, but Charli album got a 9????? Charli album is leagues ahead in terms of execution and innovation
OF COURSE THIS IS A 10/10, THE ONLY FAIR AND OBJECTIVE SCORE FOR BRAT.
10 OUT OF 10 <br>REVIEW IT AGAIN
I love weezer (green album)
YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
holy shit
WWWAAAIIITTT
I gasped so hard
madness 10/10
trying to get his queer viewerbase up during pride month... we see right through you melon
OK OK OK OK OK, here we go
a 94 on metacritic and now a fcking 10 from fantano??? BRAT is truly that critically acclaimed album huh
please do Britpop &lt;3
the random camila shade
PERIOD IKTR -
FANTANO IS FOR THE GIRLIES 💅✨😍
10 is crazy
review FUNK GENERATION BY ANITTA
WHAT
YOOOOOO
They DO make statues out of critics
What is wrong with you?💀
I seriously don&#39;t understand the hype, i think the singles are the best songs charli has ever done but everything else on the album is so bland and just passes as filler
as a green expert I can say, she picked a good one
To Pimp a Bratterfly
It&#39;s been so long since we got a 10 I&#39;m stoked
Slay. Ok so I think this is Charlis Disintegration imo. Like a few albums down, had plenty of time to experiment and refine their sound and now get to tie it together on an incredible overall project. Incredible album.
Glad Anthony sniffed some poppers before filming this
Undeniable 10
holy shit, i was totally caught off-guard with that 10. i was expecting a strong 8 from the tone of the review
WHAAAAT
HOLY SHIT
Pls review the new Kings of Leon album... it&#39;s actually good
You would have given this a 10 if it was called brat
Cooooollllll 😎😎😎❤️❤️❤️
Fantano certified mean girl
Holy hell i thought it was gonna be just an 8 considering it&#39;s not as bold and experimental as Charli.<br>But wow a 10 is greatly deserved, this album is the most vulnerable Charli XCX album by far.
Man Fantano sure loves artists who are nothing without their autotune!
you know what anthony, you are alright.
Cant believe im seeing this, first time i agree with you completely mr melon!!! 10/10 album exactly
thank you Fantano it&#39;s a good day to be a gay person
June <b>10</b> Charli gets a 10
10/10 for the QUEEN
weakest 10 ever whats going on 😭😭
You is gay
Bro<br>Really gave it<br>A<br>Ten<br><br>...hell yeah
As I&#39;m watching this review I still haven&#39;t heard the CONFESSIONS MADONNA COMPARISON yet.
i think u misspelled Charli xcx
I KNEW THERE WAS GOING TO BE A 10 THIS YEAR BECAUSE OF THE 3 YEAR CYCLE<br><br>2015 TPAB<br>2018 KSG<br>2021 SINNER GET READY<br><br>I DIDN&#39;T EXPECT IT TO BE FROM CHARLIE THO.<br><br>BIG FAT W.
Holy shit
Listen to Serú Girán
My friends made fun of me for liking this album but then melon gave it a 10/10
“brat” is just “tpab” but with one letter changed, and mixed around. Of course he’s gonna give it a 10
BEST DAY OF MY LIFE
Yo this is wild
I don&#39;t see the justification for this album being a 10 in this review.
ITS A MIRACLE
Oh well. There goes my hopes for MGMT getting album of the year.
This album is great but nothing is better than How I’m Feeling Now.
HAPPY PRIDE YALLLLL
I might pass out
What... WHAT????!!! was waiting for this for so long
It’s THAT good? 😮
THIS IS HIS SECOND 10 FOR HER OH CHARLI THE FUTURE OF POP EMBODIED THAT YOU ARE
Huge day for woman
You know if this was TPAB he wouldve- WAIT WHAT
You only gave it a 10 because she sent you a magic T-shirt.
New 10!!!!
i prefired the 10 by preordering the vinyl so now i have 3 of the 8 fantano 10s (not including the pre2010s reviews)
JESUS WAS SEEN
Rip Sophie
You would have rated it a 10 if it was called To Pimp A Brat
no way I witnessed a 10
okay maybe i do like you fantano
She was sleeping during this album
The gays have won
10 OUT OF 10! REVI- oh wait.
HOLY CRAP I WAS CORRECT!
this is MASSIVE for the black community
Charli 10C10
and everyone moved...
gay
this is surreal am i dreaming rn or did you actually just say &quot;10&quot;?
Guess Anthony realised it’s okay to just have fun sometimes
thats...overrated
He would have rated it a ten if it was named brat
GOATED W
HOOLLLLYYY SHITTTTT
Wow
WHAT
Be honest, you would have rated this a 9 if you liked it a little less.
Woah
YOOOOOOOO
You only gave this a 10/10 because its called To Pimp A Brat
insane how bad the album art is when the album got a 10
Album goes so crazy
How I&#39;m feeling now or charli deserved it more, but love this album
Brat baby brat
excuse me what the fuck
Getting ready for the viseo 5 yrs from now where hes no longer in a manic phase and decides its an 8
WHAT THE FUCK A 10?????
no way bro
Ok
❗️❗️❗️❤️❤️❤️
Damn
I WAS ALIVE FOR A FANTANO 10
woahhhh this video was not giving 10 vibes, that took me off guard, glad he loved it though
I thought he put a fake cover as a joke.
SPOILER BLOCK
HOLYYYYYYYY SHIIIIIIITTTTT
YAAAAS
wow good shit
Charli will be a legend in the years to come and everyone will think she was huge the whole time
My eyes are deceiving me or did he just gave it Charli a 10?
Based based based based based based based good melon man good opinion great job alright
I really got the feeling i was in front of a classic when i heard it, i would give it a 10 anydayyyyyyyy!!! 💚
I knew it would happen again one day 😭
What a day...
I FUCKING KNEW IT LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
You gon jump if AG made it
A CHARLI 10??? ON PRIDE MONTH??? oh we won
Seeing you get emotional talking about &quot;So I&quot; is so real. We can all relate to this song not only because we love Sophie but we have all experienced regret in how we treated someone. We can always be better and nowhere is that more evident than in loss. Much love to everyone, enjoy this amazing pop record ❤
YASSSSSSSSSSSSSS
ZAMN!!!
Big day for annoying people. Happy Pride Month!
finally a review i can agree with
bratherhood
if it was called to pimp a brat you would give it a… oh wait!!!
God this album is so good. The production, the lyricism, it&#39;s fun, it&#39;s sad, it&#39;s meaningful. Can&#39;t stop listening to it right now.
melon can we please get a charli xcx tier list 🤲🏻
what a mid ass album
yeeeeeeeessss
I’m just so thankful to see so much universal acclaim around this album, I just know Sophie would be so proud to see how far Charli has gotten, strained relationship or not this album wouldn’t have been possible without Sophie’s influence and work.. Much deserved 10.
you only gave it a 10 because you favour women in music!!!
I am also a brat so this spoke to me
Melon likes brat too much because he brat
Charli 10/10 on Pride month, GAY RIGHTS
Okay but Crash is a great album, not sure why it gets so much hate all the tracks are bangers
al fin un win para todos pelón
He would have given it a 5/10 if it was named Brad 😔
This is by far Charli&#39;s best album to date and she did it with a small circle of producers, writers, barely any samples (if any) and 0 features on the main album! It really deserves that 10!
uhhhh holy shit?
A win for the gays
NO WAY!
tell me what your life was like the last time he gave an album a 10 vs now
I was here
LETS GOOOO FIRST 10 IN 3 YEARS
Another ten has hit the channel
pride month kicking off right
A 10 LADIES AND GENTLEMEN<br>THIS IS NOT A DRILL, I REPEAT, THIS IS NOT A DRILL!
it’d be so fucking iconic if charli was the first artist to have your #1 album of the year twice
it’d be so fucking iconic if charli was the first artist to have your #1 album of the year twice
seems like the winning formula for album covers is either black &amp; white or BRAT GREEN
we’re so fucking back
ITS A 10! HAPPY PRIDE MONTH BRATS!!!💥💥💥💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚
HUDSON MOHAWKE HELPED PRODUCE THIS SO HUDMO ALSO GETS A TEN YAAAAAAY
PERIOOOOD. THIS ALBUM IS JUST PERFECTION. No notes, great review ❤.
Didn’t even click on the video and I had feeling it was going to be a 10
Tidal Memory Exo 8/10 might as well be a 10 for Antonknee non electronica brain, so it&#39;ll be the first 10 of the year in my heart. Good homie from Syria recommended me this album and I enjoyed it. Nothing mindbending and insanely innovative but still 90th percentile+ across all music
Agreed. I knew after the first listen this was her best one yet
finally fantano reviewed To Pimp a Brat. Took long enough
🙄 Pfft, you would’ve given it a 10 if it was called- oh, wait…
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOO 10/10
First time I’ve agreed with you in a while. It’s so fuckin good
THIS ALBUM IS F*CKING INCREDIBLE. Everything is Romantic, Girl so confusing, Brat and Talk talk ON REPEAT. Best pop album I&#39;ve heard in years. Ten outta ten indeed.
holy shit. it happened again
i don’t know anything about this I’m confused what’s going on????
MOM, HOLY FUCK
ive been wondering when the next 10/10 would be then i went and smoked some, came back to my computer and see this idk if its real im just putting this here for myself to come back to if it is
LETS FUCKING GOOO
Ayyyyy 10 alert
Babe wake up new 10 out of 10 album just dropped
still haven&#39;t heard it but the single 360 is such a banger. never really heard any charlis song before hand
Wtf
HOLY SHIT
Chance the Rapper: &quot;I love my wife.&quot;<br><b>gets a zero</b><br>Charli XCX: &quot;I love my husband.&quot;<br><b>gets a ten</b>
She not letting u hit bruh.
These good reviews are so intruguing. You go till the end of it thinking like: <b><i>Could this be the 10?</i></b>
OH MY GOD?!??????? 10/10??????? Deserves
I like this album. I personally like crash alot better tho.  But the public loves this album.  I&#39;m happy for Charli
Brat just got a 10 herstory is being made
IMO Talk Talk was a skip, especially the breakdown towards the end just filling in languages. But I guess it&#39;s a pretty short track so it&#39;s only a few cheesy seconds. It felt a bit like a B-tier CRJ track (and CRJ&#39;s great so I guess that&#39;s not the worst thing). Several other moments on the album were extremely powerful, so I can see not worrying about that slight meh of a track.
im falling asleep
it&#39;s a masterpiece
let’s fucking go
what the
FUCKING ICONIC HOLY SHIT
HOLY FUCK DESERVED
that&#39;s crazy
I knew the ten was coming before the video was posted. This album&#39;s an instant classic.
YESSSSSSSSZSSS
Can the basement they run fantano out of just <del>collapse already</del> get a nice remodelling and some free pizzas
OMG A 10
a 10 goddamn
most period review ever
WHAT THE FUCK
I like Charli and I gave up on this record halfway through. this is the wrongest I&#39;ve ever been
so pleasantly surprised
This is a chillingly well done review. Its like he does this for a living.
the 10 is deserved!!! Such a solid amazing record top to bottom!
Can you please review Blackout by Britney Spears
II’m so happy to see charli get her flowers from all the media she deserves it and then some
Did anyone else feel like the album was unfinished? Like some songs were just a bit too short or raw or similar to others for a 10
HOLY SHIT
I thought the 10 was a meme but holy shit. I wasnt expecting him to like it so much but thats awesome. I&#39;ve only heard 360 and I loved it
a 10/10 oh god (janet jackson) is great
YEAH 360 WHEN YOU IN THE MIRROR DO YOU LIKE WHAT YOU SEE???
God damn, the sound I emitted when I saw that score. Fuck YES
What in the what in what what what in the what
WE WON
OMG
YOOOOOO
We really won happy pride y’all 🤘🏼🍈💚
En mi vida hubiese esperado un 10/10
I will always be suspicious from now on if he starts a review with a brat shirt
This is a win for the gay community
10 but where’s Taxi?
it doesn’t feel real. i never thought i’d say this day.
Does this mean your gonna review the new A.G. Cook record??? Wich is deeply related to this one
NO WAY IT&#39;S ACTUALLY A 10 AFTER 3 YEARS OF WAITING
<b><i>This year got a 10</i></b> 🎉
HOLY SHIT A 10?!
If this was called Brat by Charli XCX you would&#39;ve given it a 10
Wtf I am alive?
MUSIC IS SAVED
first ever artist to get an EP of the year, LP of the year, top 10 album of the decade, and 10/10 💚
the way i dont like u even when ur praising my favorite albums
melon i knew you would come through
CHARLI 10C10
I don’t get it
wow
THIS TRULY IS GAY PRIDE MONTH. WE WON! MELON SAID GAY RIGHTS!!!!1!!
I need charli to react to this❤
Da f*<b>**</b>
happy pride f words
Charli what do you think about this??😮😮😮
I WAS HERE
What!
the first 10 i just dont get. i love the album tho
I think about it all the time is an unexpected song, no one can accuse Charli xcx of being conservative, I never thought she would leave that thought on the table. suspecting that a successful career can also be empty and insignificant is something that must produce existential vertigo. She managed to capture this feeling honestly
Album of the year so far
NO WAYYYY
Bien carajo
Huge W for the queers for pride month
Plz schedule to review nemahsis new album coming out Jun 20,especially her single stick of gum
this album sucks, its incredibly shallow and uninspired, her shitty autotune sucks, the club beats dont work at all, and i feel like im going mad because she literally hasnt done anything interesting or creative or literally even good (for any standard) YET EVERYONE LOVES IT<br><br>im convinced that if anyone else had made this album, everyone would have hated it, its fucking terrible
Agreed
NO WAAAAAAAYYYY
easily aoty
yay now i’m aloud to like it
It makes you realize it&#39;s been 3 years since this has happened
Casually witnessing history
YOOOO I WANT EXPECTING THIS AT ALL HOLY SHIT
You would&#39;ve given it a 10 if it was called BRAT
A 10!! Insane!
If it was called To Pimp A Bratterfly it would have been a 12
HE DID IT HE GAVE IT 10
does this mean that camila cabello is getting the next 0/10 score?
HOLY SHIT THIS IS LITERALLY SUCH A GOOD TAKE WTF
I am seated
CARALHO MALUCO Q DIA LINDO PRA SER GAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
A TEN OMGG WE WONN
HOLY FUCK
gay people keep winning
we won 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
A TEN ??????? I KNEW IT WAS GOOD BUT OH MY GOD ????
ITS A 10!!!!
WHAAAAT
Wait... Stop!!! DON&#39;T GIVE ME HUGE HOPES MELON, I HAVEN&#39;T LISTENED TO THE FULL ALBUM YET
&quot;Charli xcx copycats&quot;, say some names!!
If this is a 10 then Charli and How I’m Feeling Now are 11’s.
oh yes mama
you did it king ilysm &lt;3
Charli didn&#39;t even have to pimp that BRAT and record a 1 hour + long record to receive 10. That&#39;s truly remarkable.
this is a really big moment for gay ppl (me)
u wouldve given it a 0 if it was called speeding brat to heaven
A lot of songs here instrumental wise remind me of rocket league music. In particular I would say the start of 365, Apple, and So I. Anyone else notice that?
all is forgiven........
love charli and love you but a 10 is crazy
Charli dropped a deluxe album right after this review. Coincidence? I think not... 🤨
LETS GOOOOO
A well deserved 10.
apple is my fav track and is about her relationship with her parents... i love how the airport line is ambiguous and interpretive because is she driving to the airport to get away from them or to go back to them??❤❤
Wow did not expect this. I am now a Charli fan.
bruh
LETSGOOOOO
huge day for vultures 2
A 10/10 out of 10 again
This is the best timeline
Melon has lost it. This is the beginning of the end. He&#39;s handing out 10&#39;s like the value of money is going down.
If it was called My Beautiful Dark Twisted Brat you would have rated it a 6.
The homosexuals won today
Your generous loan to me, your crippling intellect
NEW 10/10?
HOLY SHIT WE WON!!!!!!
BRAT
NO FUCKING WAY
I was expecting 7 or 8 let’s go Vroomthony Vroomtano 😭😭😭
Woulda gave it a zero if it was called obedient child
Semi common semi rare Fantano W
YES!!!!!!!!
Mature and thoughtful? It&#39;s completely didascalic and superficial, and the lyrics seem taken from a teenager diary<br><br>No hate on Charli, but the previos Album and Ep were on another level and more interesting, even musically
NO WAY…
Buying a green melon at the supermarket today
OKAAAYYYYY
10?  Yeah, no.  Just no.
Never thought a straight man would end homophobia on pride month
Massive w for people who like the colour green
yay I can finally listen to an album from 2024
How you doin fellow brats
CHARLI DESERVE IT!!!!!!!
WE COME TO THIS PLACE FOR MAGIC. We come to BRAT theaters to laugh, to cry, to care. Because we need that, all of us
A Charli XCX album has a 10- my life is complete
Eh. It’s okay. I still don’t think she’s put out anything as exciting as Vroom Vroom but you do you.
Wtf
holy fucking shit
BIG DAY FOR GAY PEOPLE 💚
Holy shit
Thank you melon, now I’m allowed to listen to an eight album!
OOOHHHHHHHHH WOWWWWWWWWWW pridethony monthano here
if it was called brat you would’ve given it a 10
am I missing something like this john does not deserve a 10. please someone explain why this is worthy of a 10.
Holy shiz nit
No fucking way...
Love you fantano!!!!! Not a 10 tho
this did not just happen. OMG.
Fantano is a good ass critic and tbh the archetype for future modes of digital criticism.  He is actually way ahead of the curve in terms of weaving a language image to make the art meaningful and paying tribute to the ritual that produced it. And I say this as one of the best digital critics of all time
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW HAPPY I AM RIGHT NOW
I don’t get this one at all.  But sure, I guess.
Annoying focus on the lyrics in this review
Nah, no way is a 10 c&#39;mon melon
She earned her 5 points back from Crash by doing extra credit
‼️
WHERE WERE YOU WHEN CHARLI XCX GOT A PERFECT 10
WHAT THE FUCK
this score is insane. i love it
i find  the idea that the sound she so clearly is inspired/worked on  comes from an artist who not only couldve but to any fans of the genre shouldve been larger than life it was so emotional to hear her talk about the idea of of course sophie would be immensely proud of her, but at the same time wishes she could be here for it... idk it hit me so hard and im sure it hit charlie harder than i could describe. what an album.
What I like about Charli is that she makes pop music for non-normies.  Maybe it doesn&#39;t lead to a lot of Billboard hits, but I think that people will look fondly to her stuff as time goes by.
Is wisconsin we pronounce it &#39;brat&#39;
the first ever 10 i&#39;ve been confused about, ngl. still loved this project though!
I gave it a 10 until she changed the crash album cover smh
W
i forgive this man for every controversial rating/review ever. real recognize real. SOPHIE would have been so proud. love seeing electronica gain this kind of traction in the pop scene. now we just need a George Daniel solo project!!!!
WAIT WHAT
Im surprised he gave it a 10. During the livestream he was barely excited. He was nore excited for beyonces album
My therapist doesn‘t believe this shit anymore
i say HI IT&#39;S ME YOU&#39;RE ALL IN DANGER
Really?
&#39;Brat and it&#39;s the same but there&#39;s three more songs so it&#39;s not&#39; is about to be the first 11/10 album
Charli went dark prog with this record
WHAAAAAAAAAATTT
why are fantano reviews always about what the album is about and not about what the album does sonically...?
Great, now I have to listen to it<br><br>Edit: just did, fantano’s right
Well hot damn
if this was called “genre:sadbrat” he would’ve gave it a 0/10
the ending line is perfect, great writing Fantano.
I KNEW ANTHONY WAS SO BRATTY OMG WE WON
That&#39;s as many as two Crashes!
THIS IS FUCKING HUGE LET&#39;S FUCKING GOOOOOOO
YOOOOOOOOO
i&#39;ve been waiting for this day since 2014 and the day finally came full circle moment GAY RIGHTS
NEW 10 BOMB DROPPED WTF
Ofc he gives this trash 10/10
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLJ-zfBmChA&amp;t=310">5:10</a> 🤓👆
THERE IS SIMPLY NO WAY
Not full length anymore I guess
massive win for architecture and morality
Green rules
let&#39;s goo
NO WAYYYY
LET’S FUCKI8NG GOOOOO1!!`[<br>=1K0EW9HG842JR9 VB8Y0UVWDJN9O VM0N9IEFVR3 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLJ-zfBmChA&amp;t=1">0:01</a> I
A 10 !
brat is such a cultural milestone in pop music. I think a lot of us were afraid pop was just gonna continue to go downhill because all the ideas that can be considered in the genre have either been overdone or overly commercialized to the point where it feels like we&#39;re just being hit with advertisements essentially. Charli has proven once again that narrative-driven art is still alive and strong!
Bruh 10??? Ok I thought some songs were good but 10???
I legit finished listening to this album about an hour before this review dropped and had a thought that while it isn&#39;t as boundary-pushing as &quot;Charli&quot; was, that was the only &quot;negative&quot; I could really think of. The flow of the album is so great and it really shows Charli&#39;s ability to transition between fun club dance pop bangers and more introspective softer lyrical moments in a way that feels cohesive. Excellent album and great review.<br><br>Also shoutout to Charli for the cool physical design and packaging of the vinyl release.
Album cover looks like dream&#39;s channel banner wtf
holy shit a 10 wtf LFG
I agree, this album doesn&#39;t have a skip. I was surprised that I listened to it twice in a row all the way through. Every track flows from one track to the next.
fantano rating a 10 is the second coming of christ
Wooooow … 10!?!?
OH MY GOD???????
Bruh this is fucking trippy 😭
WOAH WAIT THIS IS MONUMENTAL
Omg I’m so glad that he liked this album so much!! We haven’t had a 10 in a while! I think this album is fantastic and I definitely understand why this is a 10/10.  This is by far my fav album of hers so far.
I love Charlie so much and Brat so good! 😩
I can&#39;t fucking believe that Charli XCX become such an HYPERPOP LEGEND on her own term <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/hand-rainbow-fan-open"></a>
CHARLI 10/10 HAPPY PRIDE 🏳‍🌈🏳‍⚧🏳‍🌈🏳‍⚧🏳‍🌈🏳‍⚧
It’s a good album, but there’s a decent amount of filler on it. <br><br>The production on Mean Girls is straight ass.
Incredibly correct score.
KEKGKEOCOSD9 WE WON GUYS
Didn’t watch but he way to excited for an industry plant from 2011
WOOOOHOOOO WE LOVE A 10
this album feels almost like a spiritual successor to Matangi by MIA
if it was called to pimp a brat you would&#39;ve given it an 11/10
charli won me over with this one, great from start to finish
does he actually like the album or is this still apart of his grift?
GIRLLL YOU DIDn&quot;T JUST
Because Im bias, I gotta give you a 0/10 L&#39; Thony
the girls, gays and theys would like to thank you for your service.
Von Dutch is wiiiiild
the “all fantano 10s” channels are freaking out right now
Sigh... time to dust off the ol&#39; topster
holy shit
Yoooooooi
scaring the bros
Bros just trynna hit
wow
Charli xcx in the album is musing about being a mother eventually <br><br>But Charliiii, you ARE mother
is this because she recently wore a &quot;they don&#39;t build statues of critics&quot; graphic tee
This album is incredible proud of you Charli!
WHAT
love
Brat
YEP
A 10 TO CHARLI ON PRIDE MONTH LETS GO

Can&#39;t believe this is the 8th album ever released

WE BEING FED GOOD CHARLI X FANTANO FANS
omg?
QUEEÉ 😭❇️❇️❇️ POR FINNNN
I’m just hoping it’s an 8🤞. I mean hell it’d be cool if it was a 10😅<br><br><br>NO FCKING WAY
Fantano fans can now listen to 8 albums
Ily baldie
No
this is for god and for the gays
Objectively correct. Massive w. Beautiful, stunning, the tributes to Sophie were fucking fire. Loved it.
does charli have the best discography in terms of fantano scores?
this is insane
Landmark day for brats the world over.
so when you like music you rate it highly? you&#39;re so biased.
FALE
Huge day for green supporters and affiliates
The neurodivergent gays have ate today
DESERVED

he has to be a troll
Charli 2019&gt;Brat , But I don&#39;t care 10/10
Fantano has to bring back the brat shirt for the next 10/10 now.
Charli XCX might just be the first artist in the channel’s history to receive album of the year twice.
🔥🔥🔥
Holy shitttt a 10/10 LEZGOOO FANTANO
If it was called To pimp a Bratterfly you&#39;d give it a ... wait a minute
No fucking way
the melon head did it for the gays 💚💚💚💚
If it was called To Pimp a Brat  you&#39;d have given it a 10...and been arrested and cancelled
omg what
WE ARE SO BACK OMG YES
Giving it a 10 just because you are a self-proclaimed &quot;brat&quot; in bed is a bit disingenuous Mr. Melon.
This is history
if the cover was colored Sexxy Red you&#39;d give it an 8
huge day for annoying people
the way he talked about it i thought he was gonna give it a 8-9 so i was surprised to see a 10
9/10 but I get it it is insane
Yeaah, I’m very happy, this is the first ten I see since I subscribed to the channel, this is a very important review for me. I felt that this moment was close ^^
It&#39;s Charli baby
No yellow flannel, couldn’t be a 10…
HOLY SHIT, A 10
BIG W FOR CHARLIE XCX
Kids Choice Awards ahh fit 💀💀💀

i mean you didn’t have to bmth dirty again puttin n/a on the least favorite tracks list :(
You know, as I was listening to this album I knew as soon as I heard Talk Talk I knew Fantano was going to attempt to sing the hook and this review did not disappoint.
Wow, really?
you would have rated it an 11 if the album wasn&#39;t green
oh damn
Love charli but how
💚💚💚💚
great album
OH MY GOD NO FUCKING WAY 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Big day for bisexuals
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOO this year is for the BRATZZZ
she really bullied you into a 10 with that shirt
Totally deserved. Went into this expecting a fun club album but ended up finding it to be her best album yet. It’s amazing how consistently fun and infectious it is.
Oh shit now I have to like this
deserved
The marketing is so corny and shes old now so im not listening to ts
🟢let’s fucking goooooooo🟢
HE FUCKIN DID IT NO FUCKING WAY
Damn
I feel like a crazy person. I genuinely do not understand the hype around this album. It’s just fine. Not ground-breaking. Definitely not a new sound from her. I really don’t get it.
Dude 10 is too low wtf 🙄🙄🙄
Holy shit
You only gave it a 10/10 cuz of pride month
big day for gay autistic people
damn so first artist to win aoty twice?
huh!?!?!
Oh my fucking god
HOLY SHIT
Anthony forgot about the dinosaur.
I just discovered charli and omg i love this album
You wouldn’t have given it a ten if you didn’t like it as much.
Wow actually
Truly a generational pop record, highly anticipated and exceeded every expectation following Crash. Well Deserved 10/10. RIP SOPHIE.
Review the new ski mask album
RIP SPOHIE. I believe she is listening with us
Can we go gyat for gyat?
let’s gooooooooooo charli forever
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
BIG DAY FOR GAY PEOPLE (ME)

Yooooo
I KNEW THERE WAS GONNA BE A TEN THIS YEAR AND ITS THIS ALBUM!!! LFGGGGGG
This pride month finna go hard
That guy who uploads the Fantano’s 10s:<br><br>“It’s been 84 years”
A 10!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!✨✨
Can brat shirt be the next yellow flannel but for 10s
and during pride month? this is a milestone in gay history
LGB10Q!!!
HAPPY PRIDE MONTH 🫂 WE WON
OMG
I was here
Holy shit!
No fucking way!!! Now I can finally give it a listen
CHARLI DID IT! She finally got a 10 😢
I got into her after your Pop 2 mixtape review and still love that project 💚
SOPHIE is watching this in Heaven and smiling
HOLY SHIT A 10???????
A TEN FOR CHARLI, MUTHAFUCKAS.
Im a huge charlie fan and this album is NOT a 10. At best, it&#39;s a 7. At worse, it&#39;s a 5.
Camila must be shaking right now
if this was brat by charli xcx you would have given it a 10
This is crazy
HOLD UP, IT HAPPENED
Well deserved
If this álbum was called To brat a Butterfly, you would... <br>Hold on.
Obligatory &quot;Yay I can listen to another album!&quot; comment.
FINALLY A NEW ALBUM TO LISTEN TO
LE DISTE SU 10, NO VEIA ESTO DESDE LINGUA, DIOS
Hell Yeah
OMG
Mr President, another 10 has hit theneedledrop channel
redux soon or autentic ten?
to pimp (a) (b)u(t)te(r)fly.... <br><br>abtr...<br><br>brat....<br><br>we should&#39;ve known
no way.
Can it break fantano&#39;s score doesn&#39;t mean the album will win the Grammy curse soon?
I honestly expected a 8 or a 9 BUT THIS IS EVEN BETTER
Ronnie randke roasted your ass 😂🔥
Holy fuck!
We kept getting 8&#39;s and 9&#39;s this year, we all knew a 10 was around the corner, so glad that Charli got it
Can somebody explain why the record is described like it’s such a big deal and considered a masterpiece? Genuinely asking and not throwing shade, I’ve been doing my research and I still don’t get the hype. Please don’t bother replying if you’re not going to offer a serious/genuine take. Like, how would this compare to Gaga’s Artpop which was incredibly ahead of its time, daring and experimental?
based and bratpilled
this is the most innocuous and unassuming 10 you&#39;ve given so far
YESSSSSSSSSSSS
This is pretty low energy and lacking in praise for a 10/10.
New contender for least deserving 10; brat now joins The Money Store and To Be Kind.
Melon, so confusing
10
The the 10 upside down, is a 01 now.
Holy god
review Architecture And Morality for classic week
HUGE
What the fuck! Love it for Charli. Exciting
YOU BETTER
I KNEW IT!
I just don’t think this record is better than “Charli”
I love the color green
the XCX in Charli means 10/10
no way
Finally a 10
Still can’t believe it was 12 years ago and Fantano rated Charli XCX - True Romance a 3. Seven projects later, and now she gets her first 10. Definitely the most improved artist he’s ever reviewed.
When Melon uploads two videos at the same time on both of his channels it must be BIG
OMG A 10 i mean lol it’s consensus that this is a LANDMARK album all around
🇵🇸 Free Palestine 🇵🇸
only views seconds bro off
nice to see the green album finally gets what it deserves
Great video bro
vro
“The late SOPHIE” man it still hurts to think about. Such a prime talent taken so soon. RIP SOPHIE 🖤
YEAH BABEY THATS WHAT IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THATS WHATS IT ALL ABOUT
To Pimp a braterfly
AAAAAAAAAAA
HOLY SHIT NO WAY
The lgbt community may have no rights but we have a 10/10 charli album
THIS ONE FOR ALL MY MEANNN GIRLS/10
DESERVED!
How im felling now still her best album tho
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
LOL SELLTHANY OUTHANNO
Please, RM RPWP REVIEW🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
YES!!!!!
TEN TEN TEN
OH MY????? OH MY GOODNESS???!!
so true, fantano, SO TRUE
A TEN?? 😳😳
This got me so excited
Ski Mask better
Oh snap
NO WAYYY
Wow
Finally, after nearly 3 years I can finally listen to a new album!
AIN&#39;T NO WAY. AIN&#39;T NO FUCKING WAY
oh
10, this is a rare event
huge
i SCREAMED and GASPED
I dig Charli XCX but I find her really difficult to collect...her stuff is all over the place...a CD here, digital-only mixtapes there, vinyl-only releases, a mix of EPs &amp; full length albums...I find it all really confusing...because of that, I&#39;m not sure I will buy &quot;brat&quot;, or anything else for that matter, even if it might be great...
lets fucking goooooooo
I never seen Fantano loving music so much as in this video. Props
You would have given it a 9/10 if it was called &quot;The Forever Story&quot;
Another one for the books!
I knew it.
The yassss crowd gets a yoooge win today!
INCREDIBLE
OMG he really gave it a 10 WTF
2024 is already legendary 😂
Holy fucking shit he gave it 10. Massive W from Melon
TRULY LEGENDARY MOMENT
Oh shitttt
Holy shit
such a soy boy, man... lol
É 10 PRA BRAT CARAIOOOOOO
THIS IS BETTER THAN MBDTF ?
you only gave it a 10 because it’s a great album
What.
A rare number for sure....
WHAAAT YES BRAT FOREVER ALL SUMMER LONG
This guy is one of the most unpredictable reviewers I’ve ever seen. He gives horrible scores to albums I expect him to praise, and praises albums I don’t expect him to.<br>(No hate to this album at all btw I think it’s a good album but my point still stands lol)<br><br>Or maybe I’m still just upset about the scores he gave to early Lana Del Rey albums 😭
deserved
A TENNNNNNNN
…but what if Danny Brown made it? Would you still say it’s a 1.0/10?
This is crazy Anthony. Crazy.
He gave it a ten because someone  marketing the album told him it was called “to pimp a brat”
ITS HIS FIRST RIGHT OPINION!!!!!!
NO WAY! A 10???? FINALLY!
Like I said, Anthony, calling your wife a brat for 14 minutes straight isn’t a review. You need help, bro.
IT’S A BRAT BRAT WORLD
If the album was named &quot;brat&quot; you would have given it a 10.
A TEN WHAAAAAAT
What the actual fuck...
Would have been better if you rated it a <br>🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩 out of 🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩
THIS IS INSANE 😭 i was praying for an 8...... we won!
WHAT
the gays won
Lmao that shit wasn’t even close to a 10
You would have gave this album a ten if it was called brat
this is like Christmas for terminally online people.
hallo<br>holy shit!<br>deserved
I don&#39;t think the peaks are as high as those on Charli or How I&#39;m Feeling Now, but there are no skips. It&#39;s great front to back
A TAYLOR SWIFT MORREU
AND THE GAYS GOO WIIIILDD!!!<br><br>HAPPY PRIDE BITCHES!!!!
this album is not and nine why did you rate it that
te amo
AMERICA WINS
What the fuck… WHAT THE FUCK
HOOOOOOOOLY SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT
charli is about to get 2 AOTYs and 1 EP of the year. we love to see it.
Now we can say you would rate it a 10 if it was called my dark beautiful brat
Top 1 is no more, is over vampire bros
10/10 yes Sir 💚💚
I was expecting a 6 lmao
Wow a 4 minute history lesson on this artist at the start of the video, I wonder what score you&#39;re gonna give this album
WOWWW
YOOOOOOOOO 🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩
i have no idea what to comment but i wanted to
IKTR.
high praise
I liked this video until Anthony reached through the screen, grabbed the back of my head, and pulled me towards him and into the digital realm so he could kiss me tenderly on the neck. I found that somewhat jarring.
Fantano, I loved the video but let me out of basement please.
The guy that makes the &quot;All 10s by Anthony Fantano&quot; videos just fell to his knees at Walmart
I’m genuinely shocked in the best way possible - a complete win
Huge day for brats
Definitely agree this is a 10
A TEN!
This album is the sevenest seven that has ever sevened. Good review though
This is history 👏  Charli u the best
WHAT THE FUCKKKKKK A 10?????

oh my god
Holy shit a 10/10!!!!
huge
Charli XCX got a 10 before GTA 6… wow
knew that it was a 10 when she started talking lou reed on that nyc subway
You would’ve given this a 10 if… wait what the fuck
Just because Charli XCX called you a brat doesn&#39;t mean you can give the album a 10
First 10 in 3 years
YES! A 10/10
The highest rated 7 I’ve ever seen
FUCK
Charli X/X
YASSSSS
BRO A 10?!
🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩
Yess, finally. Charli is very deserving of this rating!
Holy fuck.
HOLY SHIT
OH MY GOD
this album is an 8 but it was obvious melon was gonna give it a 10
It&#39;s confirmed, the max interval of time between each Fantano 10 is 3 years.
NO FUCKING WAY OMG U LOVE TO SEE IT 💚💚💚
A 10 is insane 😭 huge W
Huge day for manipulative women!!
THIS IS MY SUPER BOWL
Sick now i can listen to it
Anthoni xcxtano
A win for the gay community
THERES NO FCKING WAY
She saw u give crash a 5 and said “challenge accepted”
MOTHER GOT A 10!!!! 💚💚💚💚💚💚
You would’ve given it a 0 if it was called “Brat 2 the Core”
Holy shit a green shirt review
Okay, I forgive that bring me the horizon review
if this is not a 10 i swear to god
THE 10/10 DROUGHT IS OVER !!!
we won
he only gave it a 10 / 10 cus ag made it.
Holy shit he really gave it 10/10. LET’S GO MELON
WHATTTTT
You would have rated this
GAYS WIN!
you usually have good takes but screaming and crying cause you were called a brat isn’t exactly the best, melon
It&#39;s now canon that a BRAT flannel is superior to a yellow flannel
Woaaaaaaah was not expecting this what
Melon gave this a 10 as it was the only way to stop the never ending &quot;You would&#39;ve given this a 10 if it was called...&quot; jokes.
Holy shit, A TEN!!!!!
Extremely unexpected, I don’t fully agree, but I thought I’d disagree with you and you’d underrate it.
Garbage album
a 10?? Nah what are you smoking
Scaring the bros… until Fantano gives it a 10
WAIT THIS WAS MINUTES AGO HOLY CRAP I THOUGHT THIS LOOKED SICK BUT A 10 HOLYYYYY
this is a wild addition to the list of 10&#39;s
this makes me so happy
This is so awesome I love Fantano I love Charli I love music I love
A 10 out of 10, review it again!
NO SHOT.
if Charli named this &quot;To Pimp a Bratterfly&quot; you would&#39;ve... wait
WE WONNNNNNNN (gay ppl)
11th dimension
bro aint no way
Lol interesting.... Definitley not the album i expected the next 10 from
THE ONE REVIEW I DONT CHECK THE SCORE HOLY SHIT
this is such a big day for us angels :,)
BMTH still catching strays in the video description lmao
if this was called &quot;to pimp a brat&quot; you would&#39;ve given it a... uhhh......
NOTHING IN THE WORLD PREPARED ME FOR THIS LMAAAAAO
ITS A 10 ITS A 10
NOOOO FUCKING WAY!!!!
TENTENTENTENTEN
the LGBT community has forgiven Anthony Fantano
nah buddy, i ain&#39;t forgiving you after that BMTH revie---<br><br>...oh. a 10? ...huh.
OH  MY GOD
The gasp i just let out
HOLY FUCK MY JAW
The first ever Brat flannel. Groundbreaking
NO WAY HE GAVE SOMETHING A 10
WHAT WHAT WHAT OH MY GOD
fall in love again and again
OH MY GOD???
WAY
I was not expecting that.
What did you think about Jockstrap&#39;s I&lt;3UQTINVU?
WE ARE SO VERY BACK
I can’t wait for Camilla cabello’s discount copycat album to get a reverse brat score
IM SCREAMINNNNNGGG
currently shitting my pants
WHATTTTTTTTT
I rate this video a 10
YESSSS
Nah this is crazy, the album is solid but no way is it better than pop 2, charli or how I&#39;m feeling now
no WAY
you would&#39;ve given it a ten if it was called brat by charli xcx.
OMG ITS A 10!
I FINALLY SAW ONE
A 10? damn i love the album but a 10 damn,... i have to change my opinion again i guess
Melon you are finally Julia
We , as gay people , have won
Finally the comments can finally have another joke instead of &#39;to pimp a butterfly joke&#39; HAHAHA
Lmao
10??? knowing you i thought u would give this a 6 glad to know at least your brain works sometimes
Yeah, This is so good
This is actually crazy to me. It&#39;s so not a 10, decent 7 to me.
happy pride month guys
omfg this cant be real
draaaaiiin gaaaang
OHHHH SHIT IT&#39;S A 10
I&#39;m actually tweaking
If it was a album by Charli XCX called brat you would’ve given it  a 10
WHAT
Huh. As a massive Charli fan, I feel like this is her worst album. Very confused by the reception it’s gotten.
Charli XCX got a 10 from melon before GTA 6😭
How long has it been?
WOAHH🔥💥
It almost feels like this was “Charli” Self Titled but better score wise. “Charli” S/T was a 9 and the pandemic “how I’m feeling now” was an 8.
jesus
triunfó el bien
WHAT THE FUCK
Sympathy is a knife is one of the best pop songs ever created and I will die on this hill.
a 10/10 because he enjoyed the music<br>Bo-ri-ng
HUGEEEEE 10/10
AYOOOOOO A 10
YES!
you only rated it a 10/10 because it&#39;s your opinion
WHAT
You would’ve… oh…
HOLY SHIT
A TEN OMG
She might build a statue of you for this
HOLY SHIT, I loved the record but this was still a fucking surprise!!! Charli definitely is one of if not the best pop artist of our generation though. SOPHIE played a big part in that.
oh my fuck
You would of rated it a 10 if it was called “brat”
Was not expecting this also not complaining
CHARLI XCX GETS A 10!<br>MUCH DESERVED,<br>Legit, I have little to no complaints about BRAT. It starts strong with 360, and ends AMAZINGLY with 365 (my fave next to Von Dutch, So I &amp; Mean Girls)!
if it was called brat you would&#39;ve given it a 10
Whoaaaaaaaa
Next 10 in 2027 confirmed
Holy shit
Oh fantano the genius u are!!!
you flipped 01 the wrong way
The first time I&#39;ve seen him like the whole tracklist
So happy for Prezoh
And the gays rejoice!!
No wayyy
Where my hug at
ANOTHER TEN ANOTHER TENNNNN
Huge day for people who like the color green
Scaring The Hoes Son or Brat Daughter?
if this was a Charli xcx album you would have given it a 10
Mean Girls sounds like Sonic Generation soundtrack lol
OMG
Crazyyyyyyyy
YES WTF!!!
A WHAT THE GJDJH 10???
WAIT WHAT
I knew it would happen when you gave MGK a 0 earlier
ANTHONY BRATTANO 10 LET&#39;S GOOOOOOO
if it was called brat you would&#39;ve given it a 10
no fucking way
10 YOOOOOOOO
really i didn&#39;t think it would get a 10, i dont think its a 10, but goddamn this album is banging lets fucking go a 10 for charli
You would&#39;ve rated this a 6 if it was called my beautiful dark twisted brat
Brat as in bratwurst?
HOLY SHIT!!!!
I fell to my knees Anthony
DO MY EYES SEE WHAT I SEE?!!
He really wore a green shirt to green screen in a green album cover
WHAT THE FGUYCKK
I gotta be honest: as a massive fan of everything I’ve heard from Charli up to this point I really didn’t care for Brat that much.<br><br> It sounded like a watered down version of the music she was releasing previously with the introspection coming off like a weaker version of what she delivered on HIFN<br><br>With the random talk rapping with really shallow on the nose lyrics getting kind of grating to listen to as the album went on
so predictable
You would have given it a 19 if it was called Kids see Brats
correct!!!!!
You would&#39;ve rated it a 10 if it&#39;s called brat
There is no way this is a 10 and Ken Carson got a 0
meu deus
I did not even listen to it yet and I was excited for a new 10. I don’t know why that hyped me up so much.
WTF????
Offended by the true romance diss
oh my godddd its charli baby!!!
we&#39;ve broken the 8 curse brat heads
history is made
Holy fuck, holy fucking fuck
holy shit
wow
A TEN??
i was wondering how long it would be until we got another 10 from you, didnt expect this wow
Bmth fans eat your heart out
FR????
WE&#39;VE FUCKING WON
Naughty brat😭💢💢💢
Ain&#39;t no way, ain&#39;t no fucking way.
WHAT
Big day for annoying ppl
huh?
FUCK YEAH BRAT ITS THE A O T Y
WHAT
Why is bros skin glowing??
A WHAT?
LETSGOOOOOO
only album i&#39;ve throughly enjoyed since lingua ignota&#39;s sinner get ready, glad you feel the same way!
holy shit a 10
this is a pride month miracle
To Pimp a Bratterfly
LETS GOOOOOOOOOO

Chair xc10. Edit: Charli XC10
WE&#39;RE SO BACK THIS YEAR, BABY
10/10?!?!?! Bruh
finally a 10/10
HAPPY PRIDE MONTH BITCHES
The melon finally turned green
Might just be the most predictable 10.
A 10!
Anthony you can&#39;t just give it a 10 because you enjoyed it immensely
Anthony is the type of guy to say &quot;This sounds a lot like death grips&quot;.
Listening to BRAT while getting BRED is definitely an experience! Glad we’re on the same page about this, Melon ❤
DESERVED
Charli outdid Beyonce, Dua, Ariana, Billie and Taylor.<br>Incredible year
LETSGOOOO
If this album was called BRAT 1, you wouldn’t have reviewed it
W
Amazing. Michael Jackson, amazing. Michael Phelps, amazing. Charli XCX… AMAZING
Yasss Fantano has officially been re-yassified from the debauchery that was his Crash review......💅😌✨
This is literally perfect for pride month lol
Unexpected
A victory for Pride Month!
audio desyncs at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLJ-zfBmChA&amp;t=328">5:28</a> ish TAKE THE VIDEO BACK ANTKNEE

i liked the album but after looking at the aoty page i have to agree, brat is the album of the decade
OH MY GODDDDD
Charlie got a 10/10!!!!!
well deserved
365 PARTY GIRL
Massive win for gay people and green fans
So, did we just have an unreviewable, a zero, and a 10 while seeing Goatony NoCaptano improving his thumbnails in just the first half of 2024?
AHHHHH OH MY GOD OH MY GOD AHHHHH
If it was called the brat store it would’ve been an 11
dayummmmm
WOW.
A ten!
holy shit
I thought the images were joking but he actually rated it a 10
omg w h a t
True Romance fans hates this album lol
if it was called The Big Brat you would’ve given it a 0
i literally was looking for this review 10 min ago
Charli getting a 10 for brat was not on my bingo card this year
genuinely kind of confused at the reactions to this album... i thought it was worse than crash and had quite a few weak tracks I cannot believe it is being received this well 🤔
HOLY SHIT
If it was called To pimp a brat you would have given it a 10
HOLY SHIT WE&#39;VE WON
big day for peak
If her name was Charlie XXXTentacion you would have given this a 0
This ain’t a 10 at all come on, the production sucks and the hooks are weak…
Wait hold on<br>No no no no fucking way<br>No shot I’m here for it
WOAH
WOAH
Welp, wasn’t planning on listening to this but now I’m going to. Most likely not gonna enjoy it
wait what charli got a 10
This is historic for a girl like me
HOLY SHIT
Dude not gonna lie, I saw this in new releases and just assumed with that album cover that it was one of those bootleg albums on YouTube Music, so I totally ignored it. Lol guess I’ll have to listen to it now.
Talk talk to me Tony
WHATATATATATAYS
WHAT
Yes baby!!! The cherry on the top would be a interview with Charli and she saying Anthony you the real brat
A 10???
YOURE MAKING IT TO HEAVEN
Wow, a 10. I didn’t like this album but I’m glad a lot of people are enjoying it.
NO WAYYYYYY RAHHHH
whoa dawg
WHATTTTTTT
A ten out of nowhere!!
WOW ANOTHER 10?
Finally, another album to add to &quot;You would have loved this if it was named ____&quot;
more like charli WcW
it is decided... charli xcx has surpassed logic as the greatest rapper of our generation
This is history right here
If it was called Charli XCX u woulda gave it a 10
A 10/10 RATING ON PRIDE MONTH? TO A CHARLI XCX RECORD? MELON SAID HAPPY PRIDE MONTH! 🏳️‍🌈✨
yay!!
I WAS HERE WHEN I SAW THE 10/10 RATING!
You would have given this a 10 if it was made by Charli xcx
You only gave this album a 10 because you think there&#39;s nothing wrong with it.
NO WAY A 10???
FINALLY A 10
mum, can we have gfoty?<br>we have gfoty at home.<br>gfoty at home: this album<br><br>thats all i have to say about this album.

If this album was called Brat you would give it a Ten
WOWOOWOWOWOWOOWOW
i came
wait wh
Yooooooooo!??!?!?
You needed this W after the L takes you’ve had recently
Melon, you can&#39;t just give the album a 10 just because you&#39;re also a brat
YESSSSS
Friendship ended with yellow flannel, brat flannel is now new best friend.
cabello in shambello
Y’know I used to think this album was just an 8, but suddenly I definitely think it’s a 10. Not sure why
AAA TEEEN BAAABBBEEY
WHHHAAAT???<br>The album is really cool and I actually really liked it but a 10???<br>Strong 8 light 9 imo
omg!?
What
Honey wake up new 10 just dropped
if it was called Brad you would&#39;ve gave it a 10
Now I&#39;m waiting for Kesha&#39;s next album with 7 points
FIRST 10/10 IN 3 YEARS
Overrated trash.
no way
W
ok nvm i forgive you for the nex gen review now
Guess I gotta be a Charli XCX fan now.
10/10 😮😮😮😮😮
A TEN
this would’ve been an 11/10 if track 11 was titled “Melon” instead of “Apple”
stop the cap
Charli is going to go down as the most influential pop artist of our generation. Watching her go from True Romance to Vroom Vroom to Pop 2 to now is just so exciting to witness. <br><br>This is so major. The first pop album to get a 10 from Fantano. So. Well. Deserved.
Bruh… aint no way
lmaooo i just skipped straight to the end as i always do and a 10 was the thing i least expected
huge day for gay music nerds
Ain&#39;t no way I&#39;m waking up to Charlie XCX getting an 10. She deserved it through it&#39;s a great album ❤️. R.i.p Sophie
this is a huge day for annoying people (me)
Wait what.
this can&#39;t be real dude I&#39;ve never felt more shocked by a review<br><br>(big win for poppers abusers)
WHATTTT
IT’S A 10EN OUTTA 10EN, REVUE IT AGAIN 🥳
LES GO

Charli was depressed due to the fact that she did not know how to develop and what kind of music to record next, as a result she released a very successful album
