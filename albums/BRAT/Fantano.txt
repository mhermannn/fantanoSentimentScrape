1 2 3 hi everyone brat theny green Tano here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of this new record brat from Charlie XCX here we have the sixth official fulllength studio album from pop singer and songwriter Miss Charlie XX one of my most anticipated albums of the Year why well over the past decade in my eyes Charlie has grown into one of the most creative unique and pioneering forces in current day pop music and her Evolution has been interesting to watch to say the least I'm not a fan of her early work truth be told but today it serves as an interesting reference point uh for what she's doing on this record the True Romance and sucker eras of her career uh did bring some of her biggest hits and features to date that is true but sonically much of the music she was dropping around this time wasn't very daring or even deep at best you could say it was catchy and of the time around the mid-2010s though is when Charlie's music really began to push boundaries crossing over creatively with writers and producers from the upand cominging PC music label I'm talking people like Danielle harl and easy fun AG cook and the late Sophie who at the time were gaining quite the reputation for revitalizing a lot of Y2K era pop Aesthetics but with a hyper futuristic jittery sound and our first taste of this new Direction came in the form of Charlie X X X's vom vroom EP in 2016 which some critics just did not know what to make of at the time and while it was my EP of the year that year I could still see how this would have turned a lot of people off if they came into Charlie's music having certain expectations given that she was a pop artist because vroom vroom in tone is at points kind of dark and visceral and groovy in a weird way campy too with some tracks varying so wildly from part to part that uh you could almost take what she was doing here as like a joke or a novelty however the tracks on this EP are deadly serious and were also a new bold step for pop music as well as an aha moment for both Charlie and PC music creatively because at this point I think Charlie became the perfect conduit for what they were trying to channel this detailed and retrofuturistic reconstruction of 2000's pop music that lur the lines between satirical but also reverent meanwhile Charlie's creative chemistry with ag and Sophie allowed her I think to experiment more and mature as a songwriter allowing her the freedom to drop zany bangers as well as Sleek powerful anthems songs with strange structures or very unlikely features a lot of these ideas and Concepts were more or less Road tested on the mixtape she dropped back in 2017 and then in my eyes it was all fully realized on her excellent 2019 Charlie record now over the years as Charlie has developed this new sound her writing has offered more depth has become more personal and intimate especially on her pandemic album how I'm feeling now but I think Charlie's writing has grown more conceptual too with her presentation as this Posh English party girl on many of her songs has more or less become like this exaggerated character she plays into however in a way Charlie's instantly recognizable sound and unique place in the pop landscape uh became both a blessing and a curse at the dawn of the 2020s because her style had gone from challenging to uh kind of definable with this newly minted hyperpop term that was uh being thrown onto everybody who sounded even vaguely like her or 100 gex and she quickly went on to strip away many of the hyper characteristics of her music on her next album crack working with a totally new team of producers and while I can't deny the record does feature some respectable hits I have to ask at what cost because crash did very measurably have quite a bit less character than anything Charlie had dropped in recent years at the time which brings us to today Charlie's latest album cycle here brat where I think she's genuinely reconnecting with the trajectory that has brought her to this point and made her a special artist to begin with even easy fun and AG cook are back in the mix on the production side on a whole lot of tracks uh numerous others too there are even references to AG cook uh on some of the lyrics to This Record as quite a bit of meta commentary is going on as well you can really tell that Charlie is fully embracing the impact she's had on pop music in recent years and uh really using it as uh more of a strength than weakness that she can be sort of pigeonholed into and I think that's something she can do confidently because uh her and AG cook aren't just merely trying to you know revive uh some kind of hyperpop trend on this LP I mean for sure Charlie's goal and focus is to give us this autotuned bold and hard hitting homage to 2000's era pop music but this time around we have a refreshing focus on dance pop on EDM from that era on electropop from that era Club bangers generally with a pretty aggressive Edge making this LP very worthy of the title brat because this record is meant to be danced to and at points cried to as I think Charlie's writing is more mature and thoughtful than it's ever been for one her party girl Persona takes a bit of a dark turn or at least gets deflated a bit as she reveals that it's kind of a mask and uh that she doesn't always feel uh like she's a worthy of being there at the party or you know that her and the party are a bit at odds meanwhile I think about it all all the time sees Charlie uh musing about whether or not she can continue her career in the way she currently is while also becoming a mother which he very clearly has interest in at some point skipping ahead here it's also kind of crazy how narratively this contrasts so hard with her going back full into party mode on the closing track 365 of course there are notes of nostalgia on this album too that uh is very much in line with tracks like 1999 most notably on rewind but this song specifically is more about Charlie missing older aspects of her life before the fame between sticky choruses on this track she delivers her verses in this way that kind of comes off like a conflicted internal monologue or like she's musically journaling there are lots of tracks on this thing too that deal in love but these songs narratively feel vastly different from previous singles like good ones for example tracks where historically Charlie can be seen running away from love or being a bit self-effacing and talking about how she's [ __ ] it all up instead on songs such as the really infectious talk talk to me as as well as the very cinematic everything is romantic yeah Charlie can be seen accepting love and uh doing quite a few shout outs to her fiance George but yes between this and numerous nods to wanting to have maybe a more normal life at some point Charlie really presents some interesting internal conflicts throughout this album which we also hear as well on tracks where she is singing about things like friendship and sharing the Limelight with other women I mean historically Charlie is a very proom especially when it comes to uh supporting other artists with her music through features through attenion she can throw their way with her creativity I mean even look at the lyrics in the music video to one of the big singles from this record 360 that is the Charlie that most fans know and love by that same token there are numerous songs on this record where uh she is being very unfiltered in just admitting how just insecure and plagued with fear she is sometimes their sympathy is a knife where uh she talks about just being so self-conscious around this other woman that she wishes for a gun to shoot herself with which is context that some fans might even miss if they're mostly wrapped up in the Roaring bass and uh fantastic string hits going on on the dance beat there's also girl so confusing where Charlie things about the difficulties of letting people in and navigating the music industry among other people who uh she may have a difficult time connecting with knowing how to trust the song seems to be very specifically about a single person who uh maybe she's been likened to by fans but she doesn't fully see it however there's still a desire there on some level to make the friendship or the connection work then the song Von Dutch sees Charlie getting pretty aggressive and combative lyrically specifically in regards to someone who doesn't seem to like her maybe even is talking behind her back and her response to that is essentially this big anthemic [ __ ] you here where she's delivering some biting lyrics about how this person may actually be nothing if it weren't for some little dance they're doing so yeah there are these intense emotional Peaks all over the album but the biggest bombshell of all of them has to be the song so I which is very obviously a tribute to the late great producer and songwriter Sophie who actually collaborated with Charlie quite a few times so consistently in fact from an outside perspective I don't think any fan of either Charlie or Sophie would have presumed anything of them in their connection uh other than something along the lines of hey they're collaborators they have big respect for each other they love each other they're probably friends Charlie Sophie Sophie Charlie name a more iconic Duo but what Charlie says on this track here actually tells a very different story and is quite revealing in a way that is actually pretty admirable because the angle of the song is yes very sad obviously but it doesn't necessarily paint Charlie in the best light and again it's painfully sad and uh has made me reflect on the tone that uh tributes in art or whatever other medium often take they usually end up being less about the tributed person and more about the tributor love and adoration look how great I think this person is who we all think is great and Charlie's song Here does contain quite a bit of praise for Sophie that's true don't get me wrong but a lot of the track is actually an admittance on Charlie's part with her pretty much saying uh I I was a shitty friend I kind of pushed this person away I wish I didn't and now I am plagued with an insurmountable amount of regret which uh does make it a really tough listen even if I I think uh instrumentally and melodically it is one of the strongest showings here narratively and emotionally there are quite a few cuts that I think are a bit lighter in tone but they still contribute a great amount of quality to the record and are just generally fun and entertaining to listen to there's Club Classics which I thought was an incredible single to the album uh also B2B which is just some very straightforward cut and dry throwback quality dance pop with a pretty clear hot and cold back and forth Love on the Rocks type narrative there's also Apple which is some very groovy throwback synth pop 2 all about a situation and a dynamic that Charlie Likens to a rotten apple it's a situation she describes having to escape from by car by plane there's Mean Girls which is a character portrait about exactly that with a soaring and anthemic chorus plus a killer piano break that the entire track builds off of from there and then at the very end there's 365 which is the this uh version of the song 360 that kicks the record off this mirrored remix as repre big finish with some acid base mixed in there for good measure so I love the way the record finishes love the way it kicks off and the flow from moment to moment generally is great it's to the point where certain tracks in the leadup to the record that I thought were just kind of okay sound better being reinforced by The Vibes and Aesthetics of the surrounding songs on the album because as I've heard the entire thing now many times over I don't think there's a skip on it the production generally goes hard as hell it is vibrant it is colorful it is very visceral at times aggressive but I could see some people kind of scratching their heads at the fact that it doesn't come across quite as futuristic as uh some of those hyperpop Classics in recent years but more importantly what I think the production does on this album is that it serves the songs it's sweet when it needs to be it's Dynamic when it needs to be it's lowkey or explosive when it needs to be and there's still a very clear and consistent aesthetic focus on the entire album that centers around a certain era of pop and dance music so I'm not necessarily disappointed with this record not being as ahead of the curve as a project like Charlie for example especially considering that Charlie XCX copycats these days are abound the impact that people like her and Ag and Sophie have had on the modern era of pop music uh is not going any anywhere anytime soon and it's with that I say I loved brat killer album and I think that this record proves that Charlie truly is a generational pop artist which is why I'm feeling a strong nine to a 10 on this LP transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best
