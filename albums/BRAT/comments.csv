I also find it very weird this particular album is getting so much praise and acclaim while something like this would get trashed back in the day (a la Kesha‚Äôs Animal). It‚Äôs just weird?"

@pjartistics,2024-06-19T10:11:21Z,2024-06-19T10:11:21Z,3,The Brat album was not even good. I listen to it from start to finish. Club classics is not bad.. it gave me something I would hear off a Need for Speed game like Underground. I can picture visuals of cars street with this song playing. I liked the sounds from that song. I‚Äôm not even a Charli Xcx fan but I think the album itself was not very good. I think Crash was pretty solid album!.. A 10/10 on Brat? I really disagree!

I just wanted to point you towards Charli&#39;s earliest mixtapes Heartbreaks and Earthquakes and Super Ultra Mixtape because they are definitely worth a listen when put into context (2012ish).
