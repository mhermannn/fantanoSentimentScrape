@ryanredding1533,2024-06-12T21:52:58Z,2024-06-12T21:52:58Z,0,I like how Fantano basically shrugs about this album for 15 minutes and then ends up giving it a TEN like it&#39;s no big deal

I was absolutely blown away by this album, this is by no means my genre of expertise and what I listen to is radically different, but I love this so much. I hope to get into some of her other works, but I&#39;m not sure if she topped this album.<br><br>I know it might be random, but some parts of this album give me JPEGMAFIA vibes"

@Biboche23,2024-06-12T17:11:40Z,2024-06-12T17:11:40Z,1,I love the album tbh its the most vulnerable she’s ever been i like the you know bratty side of herself but also admitting her insecurities and thinking about her future as a woman in the industry and her personal life. She’s pumping herself yp but also others. She’s in her early 30s now seems like she is in a place in her life where she’s in between crazy party days and settling down a little bit. Much like her career. Reminiscing about the past but also knowing her brand now. I love this concept Ive loved her for 12yrs now. i love it she brought us a bit of the 2000s/early 2010 art pop club bops vibes💚Loved your commentary gained a sub!
