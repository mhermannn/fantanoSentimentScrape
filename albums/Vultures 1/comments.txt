looking at everything Kanye has done honestly lost it the day is mother passed away he hasnt had a black woman in his life to steer him in the right path its been getting worse and worst since then
If it was called good kanye maad vultures it would be a 10
This &quot;unreviewable&quot; thing is just your woke agenda.
You should review PORKFOOT - Nigerian Background Check
stfu its fire
I can&#39;t believe a Frank Ocean fan would say that type of shit
This is the album review equivalent of the worst she can say is no
Crybaby
Melon on Youtube: This album is unreviewable<br><br>Melon on Twitter: Israel should not exist
I‚Äôm not gonna try to say that this album is good at all but saying it‚Äôs worse than jik is insane
If it was called ‚ÄúTo vulture a kanye‚Äù he would of gave it a 10
Keep in mind this is the same guy that put sexy redds hoods hottest princess at an 8/10 so
The fact that almost 50% of likes+dislikes are dislikes says it all
Bro pretending not to like it because hes controversial
‚ÄúYou platformed a booger eating white supremacist‚ÄùüòÇüî•
People, hype passed. Fantano was right. Vultures is garbage.
he will say that this is garbage and unreviewable even tho it is at worst mid and he likes songs by sexyy red where she sounds awful and is rapping about getting drilled by tons of men and her genitals and people say it‚Äôs not biased
Stop trying to be Ye‚Äôs opp. He lives rent free in your head
If it was called ‚ÄúTo Pimp a Vultures 1‚Äù he would‚Äôve given it 12
This is stupid dude. Bowie literally had a fascist phase and we dont see any over serious sanitized white people condemning him. Politics is a show and unless youre writing a fully researched paper or trying to organize, it cant be anything other than a show thats meant to get people to like you. Dude is talking trash on this just to maintain the fanbase that pays his bills.
you still left a review
Its sad but fantano is right
Bro cooked
I personally am a fan of Kanye&#39;s MUSIC. I separate the music from the artist cause his morals are f*ed up by BPD, but the music he made is really good. The things he puts out lately are more mid but y&#39;know, I listen to the old stuff on replay.<br>&quot;I miss the old Kanye&quot; kinda thing. The new stuff is ass.
the hollywood drugs tweaked kanye out too much
Would&#39;ve been better off giving it a strong 6 to a light 7 and moving on. it has some good songs like BURN and DO IT.
Nah looking back i agree with melon this album ass
Anthony is fine with Muslims and anti Israel musicians. What a beta.
Your point about Kanye‚Äôs fans and Kanye fandom is spot on. I was a huge Kanye fan since Graduation up until TLOP. After that, he had some good projects (KSG, Donda), but his music undeniably took a dive. But his spiraling into this lunatic persona was the final straw for me and for plenty of Kanye fans that kind of ‚Äúcame up‚Äù around the same time I did. Now, his fans are sycophants and edgelords who probably don‚Äôt even care for Hip Hop all that much. Honestly, I‚Äôm not surprised that the end of Kanye‚Äôs career is a train wreck. It feels weirdly ‚Äúright‚Äù.
I‚Äôm sorry, but this album is catchy and I don‚Äôt care about the shit Ye says. He has good bars and I like it.
Bro you are just biased af
Bittersweettt its gonna be the death of me

Please Anthony pleeease. Review wah gwan delilah. That shit has me confuse i need ur guidance
Man i ain&#39;t the biggest Ye fan or a Ye hater but not giving this album a rating was lazy as hell. Personally didnt like the album, 3/10 for me. Give it a rating, if you don&#39;t like it give it a low rating. Disappointed
At this point fantano is just fishing for reactions.
Vultures 1 is definitely his worst collab album and one of the weaker albums overall i pray that vultures 2 will be better if it even drops
üôåüôåüôåüôåüôåüôåüôåüôåüôåüôå‚úäüòÅ great unreview
How can you give this a worse rating than fucking sexxy redds shitty SoundCloud ass rap. Yeah this album isn‚Äôt good but you‚Äôre virtue signalling so hard
But he made XTCY üò≠
ANTHONY JEWTANO HERE
Very weird that you went from a edgy 4chan shitposter to paternalistic and holier than thou. Looking down your nose at kanye for his words and misogynyvwhile 36 chambers sits in the background is a dissonance few can achieve.  BRAVO THATISTHEPLAN
Kanye has always been garbage . He gets away with shit because he is black
i mean i like kanye but with some of the things hes said ita just not the same as he used to be
The irony of melon getting big from 4chan then hating that Kanye is acting like an average 4channer is painfully hilarious <br><br>I just know in my heart of hearts that if melons 4chan post history was ever somehow discovered it would probably be hilaruous in the context of this
Never apologize to the far-right YouTube mob.
This video is like the metaphorical nail in the coffin of Fantano‚Äôs reviewing ‚Äúcareer‚Äù.
Comments asking if anthony is a Jew üíÄüíÄ
Kanye‚Äôs career is a tragedy. It‚Äôs hard to listen to his classics without being reminded of his fall from grace
This review is the only thing worse than the record
yeah but reviewing burzum is okay
Damn now i cant enjoy stars, burn and carnival because sexy melon man told me im not allowedüòî
kanye dropping trash like his life depends on it
If this album was called to pimp a vulture you‚Äôd‚Äôve given it a 10
Review the album, Anthony. That‚Äôs your job.
Ye&#39;s almost a lolcow at this point
So‚Ä¶how about that music review‚Ä¶..
Kanye turned into a 13 year old white kid from iowa
Sounds a bit biased,<br>What is your religious background?<br>That mustache makes you looks like Adolf......
The best description/indictment I have seen of this record to date was a RYM review with &quot;migraine bars&quot;
I thought this channel was about music. Wagner was kind of anti-Semitic, does that mean his music shouldn¬¥t be reviewed? There¬¥s tons of hip-hop lyrics that are furiously idiotic and vulgar and whatever else.
This review aged well i think after 3 months not even one song is in my rotation and every time I hear Go go go  it is an instant skip
‚úäüèª‚úäüèª‚úäüèª‚úäüèª
‚ÄúUnreviewable‚Äù yet has positively rated neo nazis. Fantano you are a hypocrite, you let personality into reviews and don‚Äôt actually care about music. Reduxes for bad takes? Your career is a joke. Ye better
Nah that album is better than Donda&amp;Jesus is king
Guy looks and acts like a soyboy
If this album was called ‚ÄúTo Not Review Vultures 1‚Äù, you still wouldn‚Äôt have reviewed it.
If it was called ‚Äúhoods hottest vulture‚Äù you would‚Äôve given it an 8
If you did not understand some of these things that Kanye said, you‚Äôre just as basic as anyone else. Or your trying to equate. Flock.
Sounds 2 biased 4 me., because you lack depth to understand complex concepts and see through what he said. Your opinion is the same of a white 12 year old tiktoker girl. Sorry.
It‚Äôs rough how Kanye albums are just manic episodes on vinyl now. Dude needs help but will probably never get it.
&quot;I&#39;m the new Jesus, bitch, I turn water to crist&quot;, that one line rubbed me the wrong way the first time I heard it. I&#39;m talking I paused the song and stopped listening. I want to say I felt scared, but I don&#39;t think I was scared, it just felt wrong.
the biggest nazis were and are zionists
this is the funniest watch of the year and i like the album/kanye
Cry
As a long time fan I never put the time aside to listen to Donda, but by the time this album came out I just dont feel comfortable supporting someone who demonizes a whole people.
Putin &quot;fights nazis&quot; too, but in fact he just genocide ukrainians. Kanye reports his experience and you are mad about it.
&quot;waaaah i can&#39;t critique the music because kanye is le bad&quot;<br><b>Proceeds to critique the music</b><br>Now add a rating and you&#39;re done, you insufferable whinging bald baby.
Do people actually really respect this dudes music reviews still? The guy gave Take Me Back To Eden a 2/10... But for real, he has no ability to separate his dog water polics with music. That is the entire point of a music review... But ok....
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=268">4:28</a> none of this is new btw. <br><br>actual lyrics from Saint Pablo (2016)<br>Black on black lies is worse than black on black crime<br>The J/ews share their truth on how to make a dime
I like how at the time everyone hated on this review now many people sort of agree with it lmao
But how is he antisemitic...?
Fantano is the definition of a woke liberal beta male üòÇ
If this was called hoods hottest vulture you would of given it a 10 smh rn
I mean do I think kanye should get away with what he said no, but do I forgive him, yes only because he&#39;s bipolar and when he doesn&#39;t take his pills he&#39;s gonna go bat shit crazy of course
You kinda look like Hitler
read this if you are interested about actual discussion and not side picking <br><br>while i do agree with some of the points he makes, he generalizes (ye fans) as being ignorant racists, thousands of ye fans condemn what he said and even some of his current actions, but still like to separate the music from the artist, people should be held accountable and ye is no exceptions. we hope he gets better<br><br>as for the music i think its good with some major fumbles like ye ruining back to me, the wierd bars on king, the chipmunk part of fuk sumn (and downgrading the beat from the leaked version + removing quavo), and his mumble verse on paid. and trash mixes on half the songs. but there are great beats and musical concepts on the album ie (beg forgiveness, talking, stars, back to me beat and performances except ye, fuk sumn , burn which js a great track although too short)<br><br>6/10 overall but 3/10 for ye standards
unmarrigeable 1
i kinda liked it
I respect why he says that he can‚Äôt separate the art from the artist bc what he says is in his art therefore he won‚Äôt rate the album, but this dude literally rated bastard and goblin by Tyler the creator
Remember back when Ariel Pink and John Maus were at the White House, and then Ariel Pink appeared on Tucker Carlson and we all stopped listening to that shit? Yeah what the fuck is up with Kanye?
&quot;Beyond the Pale&quot; damn
He apologized Johna Hill changed his mind
shit gas tho
I agree with everything you said, except everything you said about hoodrat
Kanye made a diss about famous Jewish rapper Drake üòî he will never change‚Ä¶
How kanye anti semite he is damn ‚ú°Ô∏è Free Larry
Gender is the defining characteristic between a Kanye fan and a Drake fan. If you&#39;re an edgelord, you choose Kanye, if you&#39;re down bad, you choose Drake.<br><br>No matter the case, you are always 12.
i haven&#39;t agreed with a lot of his takes of late but on this one i totally agree kanyes just a man child who acts out of pocket so that he can feel like hes standing out
4 types of fans. #4 is the people who are fans of the old kanye but don&#39;t agree with his current remarks, stances, or view on most things but just want him to get better üòî
Kanye is Lisan al Gaib <br>He has foreseen<br>He foresees
If this album was named Kids See Vultures, he would have given it a 10.
Fantano shut up you gave what a time to be alive a 7 üòÇ
I like Ye cause I&#39;m also mentally Ill (not even joking)<br><br>Hope he gets some help tho‚ù§
I don&#39;t quite agree, but... I honestly don&#39;t care about kanye.
Where‚Äôs the review fantano
Dude I&#39;m sorry, used to respect your opinion.... Was a huge fan ... I honestly think you&#39;ve lost touch totally!
Here to drop my dislike and leave
It‚Äôs sad the label keeps posting Kanye‚Äôs posthumous works
Even Fantano was lazy to fully display the album cover upüòÇ
Album was good, def a highlight of 2024
you should give this a 9 since antisemitism is popular and cool now.
Kanye is right.
unreviewable 2 coming tomorrow üî•üî•(if YE remembers)
Shouldn‚Äôt have to apologize for anything
If you really only care about the music, stop listening to Kanye, and start listening to instrumental rips.
Bro liked burn , carnival  and problematic but don‚Äôt wanna admit it
You don‚Äôt know nothing about philosophy keep talking about music and keep your mouth closed in serious arguments like nihilism
Hey antony fantano also known as 40 year old bald virgin, i do not apreciate you calling my glorious goats and kings album VULTURES 1 trash, he changed his behaviour and he is bipolar, since when do we blame someone of saying something because he is legitimately ill, his life is very painful just like listening to your words. Your hairline needs to be studied.
This is disappointing anthony
While I couldn&#39;t listen to the entire album all the way through, I disagree with the sentiment that the lyrics/message ruin the song [artistically]/make it unlistenable. &quot;Yonkers&quot;, &quot;Look at Me&quot;are some songs that I thoroughly enjoy disassociated from the lyrics/message as they are catchy. As for the anger-filled tone of them it&#39;s cathartic to some extent (also why some physiological studies suggest metalheads are happier- they confront/express anger through music and no longer retain it). That being said, I re-iterate that I couldn&#39;t listen to the entire album of vultures ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
If kendrick dropped this it would&#39;ve been a 10
THANK YOUUUU. CARNIVAL üóëüóëüóëüóëüóëüóëüò≠
bro skiped carti he is leftist acctivist that is  paid by matrix to destroy masculinyty skibidi ohio
Kind of sounds like a guy thinking anything he does is genius and will be eaten up, and just trying to be avante garde and provocative.<br>Is it mental illness in music form ?
Man screw you, there are literal murderers, pedophiles and junkies in the music industry and you diss a guy with multiple mental issues? You don&#39;t even care about what he makes, you just try to dunk on him. I don&#39;t think he kinda cares about you at all though and every time you rage out like so, you lose fans.
Bro sounds like my grade 6 teacher (I agree with him on this album)
It went platinum with your review lol
I agree with everything. Except I think Back 2 me is so catchy
He already has his score ready before the album even came out, and he will for the next two drops he is biased and it‚Äôs very unprofessional
This guys giant Hitler mustache is kind of ironic üòÇ
I&#39;m starting to appreciate this video even more as time goes on, even more after ye did a üüß‚¨õ for he&#39;s yeezy brand
It is trash
&quot;Oh no but what about the poor jewarinos in my audience!! How could I review this and do that to them!!!!&quot; but never cared once about the whites in his audience when he reviewed numerous projects by rappers bashing white people. Truly shows where Fantano&#39;s interests are placed.
oh my god vultures is so bad. 4 good tracks on there, everything else is a skip.
&quot;The worst bro can give is a 0&quot;<br>bro:
Genuine question: why does this guy get called melon? üòÜ
Bro you can also just appreciate his old stuff and think that‚Äôs he‚Äôs bat shit crazy now
He really likes the album as u can tell
I maybe liked carnevelüòÖ
Fartano voted for Biden
If it‚Äôs truly unreviewable then don‚Äôt review it. Still wants to make this video and make money off Kanye‚Äôs name though
Damn, Melon is still shook from being labeled alt right lol
The albums a 6 theres some good songs and some bad songs
If this was called &quot;Hood&#39;s Hottest Vultures&quot; you would&#39;ve given it a 8
with how the Left are going anti-Israel it&#39;s safe to say Kanye is once again a revolutionary genius (even if he&#39;s mentally ill)
People who are saying that Anthony is &quot;tilted&quot; or &quot;triggered&quot; are missing the point. This isn&#39;t someone who&#39;s offended, this is someone who feels like they can&#39;t enjoy something they used to like anymore. Kanye&#39;s music is honestly tainted by his views. You can&#39;t separate the artist from the art anymore. His music is now permanently linked to his awful views. I also used to like a couple of Ye&#39;s songs. But now I also can&#39;t hear them without a sour taste in my mouth.<br><br>Anthony isn&#39;t offended. He&#39;s just disappointed.
The best Kanye fans are the ones that care about the music and the art alone but this ‚Äúart‚Äù has so many unnecessary, dumb, pointless, harmful comments all over it and just bad music sadly. He can come back though! (I hope) :(
GO GO GO GO
Aren&#39;t you the same guy that said that you&#39;ll review an album even if the guy was a murderer?
After rewatching the vid I think I don‚Äôt rlly agree with all u said. A lot of rappers and artists boast and talk abt drug dealing and evn murder in their lyrics and that don‚Äôt stop me (or u as u reviewed some of their albums) from listening to them. U can‚Äôt always be on the same line and agree wth what artists express wth their creations and that‚Äôs normal. Listening to it doesn‚Äôt mean condoning their messages (even when it‚Äôs part of their creation) but just means appreciating the artistic process they underwent. Guys like Picasso where absolute dcks towards women and ppl he knew but that doesn‚Äôt stop critiques from not reviewing it and just saying ‚Äúunreviewabl‚Äù. A better approach would just have been to say u don‚Äôt agree with the messages Kanye as an individual transmits. <br><br>that‚Äôs what I would have done at least
If this album was called ‚ÄùTo pimp a vulture‚Äù you would‚Äôve given it a 10
What is happening with his hair, everything looks wrong in multiple ways - head hair (worlds worst transplant?), moustache (how you gonna wear a hitler moustache in 2023, or does it just look like that because of small mouth?), soul patch (is that in style?), neckbeard (why), everything is weird. At least he‚Äôs right about Kanye is wack tho.
Maybe Kanye is just being Kanye and he‚Äôs not required to please anybody. Luckily here in the US we can say whatever we want no matter how offensive it might be.
This is such a political video haha you‚Äôre not even reviewing the music
it‚Äôs so funny people don‚Äôt want to admit that this album is good because of politics
You know it‚Äôs bad when he can‚Äôt be bothered to green screen the album properly üíÄ
What are you running for office? stfu and review the sounds. Imagine all the artists you currently enjoy who are &quot;secretly&quot; politically opposed to you. Delete this video lol. Embarrassing.
&quot;This is completely unreviewable trash&quot;<br><br>Anthony&#39;s ex wife on theneedledrop
just review the music, clown
yeah so im number 2
if you dont like the controversy surrounding it,<br>just dont review it.<br>you want to make a vieo for your stans to laugh at,<br>and you claim you&#39;re only reviewing the music?<br>this is someone trying to look good by laughing at the fat kid in class,<br>only judging by the dislike ratio,<br>it backfired.
Who cares what this old head think üòÇüòÇüòÇ
If he don&#39;t like it, that means you should listen
&quot;the sequel tends to be a step down from the original&quot;<br><br>the dark knight<br>dune 2<br>the empire strikes back<br><br>those movies exist, and theyre a step UP<br><br>so who knows, maybe kanye will clap back with some good stuff
didnt want to cop out and do bread hands again???
damn just throwing your credibility out the window.
But he made graduation
this video is sponsored by CNN
This album was indeed hot garbage
BEST VIDEO EVER ANTHONY FANTHANO, HAD A BLAST LAUGHING FROM BEGGINING TO END
Carnival is genuinely the worst song I‚Äôve ever heard, I don‚Äôt know how someone like Kanye could go from TCD, LR, Graduation, and MBDTF‚Ä¶ to this
Always been a horrible hip hop reviewer
This is pretty brilliant. I haven&#39;t heard any dissenting opinions on this work until now, so I had to click
unreviewable because of music ‚ùé<br>unreviewable because of artist ‚úÖ
Unreviewable is crazy it wasn&#39;t that bad üò≠
The album was boring
damn
Just focus on the art omfg but nah u need to rant like it‚Äôs gonna do something
Seems like ur generalizing everyone who likes Kanye‚Äôs music. Ofc Kanye is over the top and u have are justified in ur choice. But, like, it‚Äôs so much of a spectacle. Maybe we should all just log off
its a music review not a person review üíÄ
I disagree that you can‚Äôt separate hateful music from the artist. It is true that some people care more about the instrumental/other aspects of the music than the lyrics.<br><br>There‚Äôs also the phenomenon of not liking songs with hateful content and liking songs without it.
Israeli media
Bad take
however now i think the lead single Vultures ain&#39;t that mid now, it is just with the outro part. And that James Blake track with North West is straight up pain. That&#39;s only the ones with single and remixed ep releases <br>what&#39;s up with all the poorly mixed tracks with weird bassboosting? ye you really gone too far, Carti had good earraping attempt but somehow you don&#39;t. Jpegmafia and Timbo appearances won&#39;t save this poor record, i now consider Jesus is King is a better record to rave to
I didn‚Äôt know fantano was tiny hat‚Ä¶ ü§∑
Who in the fuck made this guy the dude we go to to review hip hop? Lmfao look at this mfer you think I‚Äôm going to take an opinion from someone like this? Why?! What‚Äôs his credentials?
Another patron of cancel culture
Fantano, was it coke you snorted on video when you reviewed Carnival by Kanye? Go look up ‚ÄúAnthony Fantano reviews Carnival‚Äù it‚Äôs a video of Anthony‚Äôs stream posted by  the channel ‚ÄúELITE‚Äù. At 2;25. As soon at Ty Dolla $ign starts his verse Fantano shoves something up his nose and then snorts and make a terrible face.
bruh is this a joke... I&#39;m not even a Kanye stan although I do like his music but what are you even talking about? This is not his best album but he does have some good songs!
bro is a professional hater
bros scared to admit kanye‚Äôs goated
I love how no one who listens to this album acknowledges the fact that Ty is on it
It‚Äôs weird, as I‚Äôm watching this balding man react to each song, I‚Äôm having the same reaction towards this video. Completely unwatchable.
Only one i enjoyed was carnival, i fucking hated everything else üò≠üò≠üò≠
no one has benefitted more from the dislikes being gone than Anthony Fantano
These comments are crazy. Kanye is dropping hot fucking dogshit üò≠
You forgot the fourth type of Kanye fan: Kanye.
Don&#39;t sort by newest, it&#39;s pretty bad
I hated this review at first but realized he was right now üò≠
damn i loved paid and the beautiful big tittied butt naked women just don‚Äôt fall out the sky yknow bit. maybe im simple
What about those of us that humbly like collage dropout in peace
this guy made a video giving his own political opinions and letting it colour his review. you‚Äôre a critic not an influencer buddy
Fantano is a BETA MALE.
This is one of 3 comments Ive posted in 8 years. FUCKING HILARIOUS
Wow, i didn&#39;t know Fantano was gay
I still expectin Kanye to go back to the OLD KANYE...<br>And EVERYONE is the only ACCEPTABLE song... and it not even released üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Guys, don&#39;t worry Melon likes so much Kanye that he wants him as the only artist to achieve every possible vote
Everything is antisemitic these days, even YouTube will delete your comment if you talk about the <i>_</i> but you can talk as much trash about black people as you want and the comment stays
You care so much about antisemitism but do you care about the thousands of children being bl*wn up by j*<b>***</b> Zionist or no? Or is that antisemetic to say?

Randomly came across this album on shuffle, thought it sounded interesting, wanted to listen to a review, and the first video I find is about a message I haven&#39;t heard and why that message means <b>he cant review the sound of the music.</b><br><br>.....alright.
Man the kanye stans are making BTS stans look like girl scouts
you&#39;re so sensitive. be a man and not some whiny 40 year old who argues with teens on twitter and gets upset so easily.
fantano reviews anti white music like it‚Äôs nothing . quit being a self hating circle jerker
Goblin by Tyler, the creator talks about r@pe murder and even cannibalism but you can review that and not someone who said a few bad things
7 mins of my life wasted to a virtue signaller,textbook soyboy
üòÇ I audibly laughed when you said ‚Äúwhat am I supposed to tell the Jews in my audience, it‚Äôs not that bad get over it, he didnt mean it‚Äù lmfaoo that‚Äôs more fair then what happens 90% of the time,<br><br>    which is what you jokingly said ‚Äúahh its not that bad get over it, who cares‚Äù
man this comment section is absolutely terrible i feel so bad for you anthony i really respect your opinions even if i dont agree man ‚ù§
<b>we put him up there</b>
fantano is a culture vulture critic bitch made
7 min of virtue signaling. Great...........
Anthony&#39;s unconditional love for random JOOS is unironically thought-provoking.
I wouldn‚Äôt say unreliable I would give it a 4/10 it‚Äôs still a album at least
Maybe fantano is a vulture like ye was talking about.
Bro secretly loves Kanye but is mad Kanye doesn‚Äôt love him cause Kanye loves Kanye
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=415">6:55</a> ay you were wrong we stepped up from unreviewable to a 2
Just review the fucking albums. We&#39;ll form our own ideas on social justice/relations. Did you like the album or not, and why?
are you jew
Melon BIG mad
This is why i unsubbed a fat min ago just coming to this to laugh but i find it very ironic that THIS is where he draws the line and anyone who has a opinion opposed to his youre a anti-semitic kanye cultists. Lmfaoooo
We get it, you hate Republicans
do something on The Dare and or The Hellp please! im truly not sure if he&#39;ll absolutely hate em or love it. There&#39;s no in between
You sound mad
based
Burn and talking are litterally the only good songs on this record, carnival has a good beat but the lirics are trash and the only thing it achieves it&#39;s to make me wanna hear hell of a life. I consider myself a kanye fan but come on
The only rapper ever to go #1 after being canceled ye is the üêê
This dude dry ass hatin mega yapper. geez
If this was called hottest hood vulture he would have given it an 8
Farts
Still ye 2024 cuz its better than the other options
If it was called hoods hottest vulture it probably still would have been unreviewable
bald
Jesus Kanye fans are so sensitive üíÄ
womp womp how was the divorce
I like carnival though but idk about Kanye üòÖ
That album is trash
Self-righteous, smug clown
Antisemitism is endorsed by elites because it&#39;s a safer version of anticapitalism for them
Newsflash review the f album thats why people watch your damn videos
It‚Äôs the internet if you don‚Äôt like it get off it.
Mf reviews for a living yet can&#39;t do his job üòÇ
womp womp
Anthony, that&#39;s the divorce talking.
I guess King Von is A üëå tho? what a holy self righteous melon üóëÔ∏è üöÆ
Only came to say that I guarantee there‚Äôs more dislikes than likes on this video üòÇ
The art and artist are completely separate.<br><br>We‚Äôre not asking for a Kanye review we‚Äôre asking for a Vultures 1 review goddamn.
L fantano as usual
I‚Äôm admit to being a bit of a Kanye dick rider and I only have 3 songs saved from the album. Talking, Back to Me, and Carnival
Ok
It&#39;s really obvious that this guy is just offended by the stuff Kanye has been saying so he is trying to make his music look as bad as possible. I didn&#39;t like this album but that is still how this video comes off.<br><br>He starts the video by saying that the album is unreviewable but then at the end he reviews the album. Textbook soyboy drama
A reference is what all others should be modeled by.   Why don‚Äôt you do your research before you open your mouth.   I stopped watching your ignorant opinions on hip hop a long time ago.   Came back for this only to be reminded why I stopped watching and unsubscribed.   Trash üöÆ opinion
all the hate comments saying &quot;just review the album&quot; need to just...... idk........ read the title of the video, maybe?
Your telling me this man has rated music for over half a decade and this mf still hates on so many good albums and artists this guys goal is only to point out flaws never the good he even hates on NAV like fuck off maybe if you just listen and maybe and just maybe his bald ass would just change his mind of hating on good music Jesus let the reviews go to the smart people who can actually listen to music without shitting on it so many times in one session but he doesn‚Äôt even care who hates on him for rating the music like why are you still doing the same shot for more then 10 fucking years like give this album an actual review Fantano and one more thing idc if your lover boys come to protect you stop reviewing music and stop with your shit opinions.
This review is dogshit
Doing Kanye reviews launched this guys career and he can‚Äôt give him a fair review. Unprofessional at best. It‚Äôs hard to believe people still follow this channel.
Idgaf what you think about Kanye. I won‚Äôt defend or attack him. I just wanna know what you think about music bruh. Not your opinion on the (shitty) state of Kanye. You gave us one and a half minutes of actual music review. With a couple sentences for the songs you do bring up
It can&#39;t be possible to like his music in and of itself?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=263">4:23</a> none of these lyrics are antisemitic. This is typical Kanye lyrics. He‚Äôs always said stuff like this.
ITT Anthony Baldcel Fantano copes
So much butthurt on this one...<br><br>Vultures is not the greatest hip hop album... but well at leats sounds so much better than Donda, thats all...
You always in tht mf shirtüíÄ
What a genuine non biased reaction to watch
bro didn&#39;t even start with a blank-thony blank-tano intro, that&#39;s how butthurt he is. he doesn&#39;t do it either with NOT GOODs (for a different reason) but wow the salt on this one is just kidney-killing.
no disrespect but what did kanye do to you, for yoou to get this pissed off?
The far right is just as bad as the far left melonhead.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm a Biden Supporter and being anti semetic when most of what Kanye said about the Jews is true offends me, also I‚Äôm vegan‚Äù <br><br>- Anthony Fantano
I bet if you pan out there is a Israel flag in the corner
Burning like a candlelight, your love is dangerous
currently 84,178 dislikes...(and counting)! Over 48% dislike ratio. cope harder leftoid, lost a loyal sub a longgg time ago hahaha
Carnival tho
You need to separate the art from the artist chief.
do you ever love anything ??? could you enjoy stupid music like us
i knew you were soft but damn
if this album was called hoods hottest vultures, you would have given it an 8.
Ty dollar sign has been trash and Ye decided to a whole album with him.
This should be taken down,  fantano‚Äôs lyrical breakdown is worse than a second grader continuously
I‚Äôm here to hate
this is corny as fuck, waa im fantano and cant seperate the person from the artist
We come here for music reviews. That&#39;s it. Review it or don&#39;t. This arbiter of truth act, even if it is true, is not becoming of you.
I like how melon wasn&#39;t even afraid of the backlash he&#39;d get. Absolute chad üóø
Fantano is the type of guy to listen to music from a serial killer and not care but a guy that is mentally  ill and says questionable stuff is too far and unreviewable
how about you just review the music and leave the politics out
Next time try actually reviewing the album. Over 5 minutes of kanye lore in a 7 minute album ‚Äúreview‚Äù
Ok ... Vultures N¬∞1 album in the world and Carbival N¬∞1 song, i dont think that only Ye fanbase could achieve that, so theres someone that recognise the good works, even if its not a fan ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Yeah hoodrat is such a muddy mix
You need to improve your colour key skills SON
pelado boton por eso tu mujer te gorrea
your hair is unreviewable
the album is absolute ass
The only thing that I agree with you on in this entire review, is that PAID is a far worse FADE. FADE is a masterpiece and so are other songs on Vultures 1.
i dont care about his politics in anyway, or his antics.. but that records sucked..
how‚Äôs saying ‚Äúa jewish doctor wanted me dead‚Äù anti semitic üòπ
if kanye is jesus, anthony is judas. if kanye is h-tler, then anthony is‚Ä¶ wait‚Ä¶
Still better than your pizza hut looking mustache, egghead.
This mf gets on my nerves
So this is a 6/10 too?
Fantano - Hear me out guys ü§ì‚òù
why he muted this video?
Kanye is the Leonardo Da Vinci of our time
Man. Divorce is rough ain‚Äôt it.
The most terrible review! A minimum of words about the album. Sometimes he takes offense at spotify, then at Kanye... taking offense at a person with bipolar disorder is such a thing... the album is very good, it&#39;s clear that Kanye tried and put a lot of effort into it. 6/10.
Wokethony Wokethano
Well it‚Äôs not like everything he says or does is bad? It‚Äôs not really good either
OK cool. Ye‚Äôs a genius.
I like the album. I don‚Äôt think artists are good for anything other than making something slightly better sounding than loud machinery for people who actually work. I think artist critics are worth less. You are very pretentious. Enjoy your money and the sound of your own voice
Yet varg is ok
Anthony I think you forget, he made Graduation
Because kanye , black Americans  from the slave trade is the real jews. These fake white jews are mad and want everybody to believe thier bull*<b>*</b> and white washed lies. The truth will always prevail in the long run.
wow, that thumbnails game is unreviewable trash and there is why
Review has nothing to do with the music
Lmao this comes off as so asshurt.
burn kinda slaps though
Yapping
This dude is entirely brainwashed by the ones at the controls‚Ä¶.
Lol this review actually turned my back on to Kanye it‚Äôs sounds good third song in right now
Never in my 13 years of teaching ahh review
getting serious redditor energy from this guy.. like... ew
Separating the art from the artist is impossible if the artist does nothing to separate their views and actions from their art.
Eternal sunshine &gt; vulture 1
The amount of rage in the comments is incredible lmao melon you&#39;re wild
Your opinion don‚Äôt change the show cost
Another case of Fantano having a stroke when lyrics don&#39;t align with his leftist ideology. Most people can just say &quot;I don&#39;t fw that line&quot; and still enjoy other parts of a project but people in his echo chamber just not used to it ig.
The first and only video I‚Äôll watch of yours, if you were a real music reviewer you‚Äôd be able to separate the art from the artist
I didn&#39;t like this album. I&#39;ve been called an obsessed Kanye fan etc when I was into him a while back, but I disliked him fully after Donda. And the thing about being a &quot;little crazy&quot; - I genuinely think he&#39;s severely mentally ill and schizophrenic. I don&#39;t think he should be in the public eye at all, and his paranoia about his doctor seems to have spiralled into conspiracy shit that severely ill people fall into. The people that are fully uncritical of him are just fuelling this and enabling delusions and paranoia. It&#39;s honestly depressing.
Unwatchable channel.
I thought this was going to be about music
The album is great and nobody cares what he says outside of music go cry fanti
I know a lot of people will say that &quot;separate the art from the artists&quot; which I agree with completely but this album is not it <br>when artists start projecting their controversial opinions in their art this argument doesn&#39;t hold up <br>&quot;king&quot; from this album is the perfect example I can&#39;t listen to kanye&#39;s new music anymore <br>I&#39;ll still listen to his older records like graduation and college dropout but I am done with this artist for good <br>kanye has done many controversial things in the past but I just can&#39;t with this dude<br>the album itself isn&#39;t that great it&#39;s a 5/10 for me but hey if you wanna listen to it go ahead because c&#39;mon some people just want to listen to the music and don&#39;t really care about other things which is fine it&#39;s just that don&#39;t go around bullying people or defending something which isn&#39;t morally correct
Huhhhhhhh this is the most confusing non review review ever
‚ÄúBeautiful big titty butt naked women just don‚Äôt fall out the sky you know‚Äù is one of the best verses I‚Äôve heard in a while
Bro this was one of your biggest misfires of an album review I‚Äôve seen‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs REALLY saying something
Jesus christ how much you fell through. wtf happen to Woketano?
Why can‚Äôt we cancel these people
Reviews music but talks politics and uses that to form his opinion on the music oh ok seems legit
this one really made the hitler simps mad
Waiting for him to talk about the music 6 min in‚Ä¶
IM NUMBER 3.
I just ignore kayne west than he doesn&#39;t effect my life at all.
i actually just listened to the album it&#39;s good lol. even if you don&#39;t think it&#39;s good. to call it unreviewable is insane. horrible take by this loser.
What&#39;s funny, is everything he&#39;s saying has absolutely NOTHING to do with music üòÜ
so i heard this guy hates kanye and this isn&#39;t actually a music review. shut up and do you job music reviewer lol. if u can&#39;t review it stfu? don&#39;t make a video? idk
Good on you Fantano, mad respects
W Ben !!!
Bro can‚Äôt accept the fact that some people just like listening to songs that sound good and don‚Äôt give a damn about anything else. No such thing as objectively good music so your argument is pointlessüò≠
I didnt know Fantano was a jewish last name
This has been the best part of the<br>Vultures 1 roll out. I cant wait for the salty tears when V2 and V3 comes out.<br>Ps. As a Jew, I‚Äôm happy to share that Vultures was number one mofo!
Funny how he barely gets views unless he has a bad take about Kanye and complains for ten minutes about it
sure, somebody who looks like that has to make this political...fy
Bruh that&#39;s why you separate art from the artist, just look at picasso, people praise the art but the dude was a piece of shit
I wanna give you the keys to my life to my life to my liiiiife yea
Number one album and song, populus locutus est
Black people are Semitic
This dude is so angry hahahaa
I‚Äôm bill cosby bitch
Ngl bro, with the whole conflict in Gaza rn, antisemitism don‚Äôt hit as hard as it used to. People are taking it less seriously with the way that word has been thrown around for the last 5 months to justify what many are considering to be a genocide.
Review the music dude not the artist tf
aaaaand carnival went number 1
Fool what you on about, At this point we all antisemite!
Your credibility in the toilet.
oh mid west don‚Äôt make that face
Funny how white people are unanimously seething over Kanye&#39;s behavior as of late while people of color absolutely don&#39;t give a fuck<br>1 had some bangers and that is undeniable
Anthony make sure you dissect how each fans base is and shit on them for each album from now on. Point out how horrible we are for listening to music Saint Anthony.
This was the video that made it clear. Anthony fantano is no different than all the liberal soy boys on YouTube who are completely brainwashed and by mainstream media and have turned into NPCs. Deadly afraid to loose sponsors. So disappointed in this video.
this video is unwatchable 1
Fantano just dishing pure clickbait nowadays
Politics aside this album mid.
this is more a rant on kanye than the actual album itself !!!
it really does feel like the problem with the album is kanye. the good stuff was the stuff where he wasn&#39;t rapping, or when something else was sampled. Beg forgivness is good....because chris brown. aand that whole Jay and Silent bob thing i didnt see coming, and was actually recording a reaction to the album for TikTok at the time of listening when that just stopped meinmy tracks, and ended up becoming its own bloody TikTok reaction, i was seriously expecting the song to stop mid track and use the line &#39;&#39;NOBODY IS FVCKING ME!!!! and what sucks about it even more, is the start of the track is good....until kanye enters. and now i got that damn line stuck in my head thanks to editing that damn TikTok. anyway you take Kanye off this album, and there&#39;s some okay stuff, but not enough to listen to more than once, and even then out of curiosity. As someone who fvcking adored College Dropout and still love that album, it seems that for Kanye, albums that are good don&#39;t just fall out of the sky ya know. also if this guy mention Yeezys one more time on this album, it woulda needed a promo code, and a fvcking &#39;sponsored ad content&#39; label on it, cuz that boy was shilling. &#39;&#39;yeezys over timbos, got them yeezys over timbos&#39;&#39; was half expecting a &#39;&#39;don&#39;t like those vessi&#39;s tho, don&#39;t like that dime-atex materio&#39;&#39; straight after i swear.  <br>and when it falls down<br>who you gon&#39; call now?
You are a true racist.
Kanye is the greatest artist of this generation
How gives a fuck what this white boy thinküòÇ
Time to get that hair transplant Review TurkTano!
How you can believe in the ideals of Jesus and also Hitler at the same time is beyond logic and reason.
Separate the artist from the music
Kanye has a better hairline and i like men
whatever pays the bills lil bro
Okay are you a politics critic or a music reviewer
Wow never see him like this, but i agree with him tho, some of the songs are not good. and i felt like this isnt the kanye i know.
YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN QUALIFIED
Fantano is wrong here
Being objective. <br><br>This album was well produced. Great sounds. Great beats. <br><br>Absolutely rubbish lyrical content.
Can&#39;t wait for the unreviewable sequal coming soon!!!!!
No you were an embarrassment he despised you
Idk how u guys can disagree with the facts presented
Imagine talking about the politics of Kanye when your only job is to review the album. Stfu already
Seperate the art from the artist.  I do that Everytime I watch your videos lemonhead
Womp womp
I listened to the album just before watching this video and fuck all the other things surrounding Kanye this album is horrible with context but just as bad without it when Ty Dolla Sign shits on you in literally every song there‚Äôs something wrong that Wild Wild West song is the only one I actually enjoyed because it was just ty doing his thing on a Ye beat and it worked everything else tho? Just unenjoyable noise in all honesty
Yeah what is a music review if you‚Äôre a straight up haterüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ
Kanye fans are something else man üò≠ yall need serious help. I actually feel sorry for how sad your lives must be
Bros only hating this hard because he has to. He‚Äôs a lefty libtard so he has hate it
Oh, that right‚Ä¶Anthony is Jewish
Where‚Äôs the dislike button
Dude a hater bro I swearü§£ mfs got soft nuts frfr
This why yo wife left you
didn‚Äôt you before years ago that no matter what a guy did you would separate music from artist? ü§î you a hypocrite. Also grown ass man calling teenagers loners and saying their life‚Äôs are meaningless. Who tf are you u have a failed marriage ü§£
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not angry,I‚Äôm just disappointed‚Äù ahh stareüò≠üò≠üëΩüññüèΩ
Who cares, Kanye is a genius
This review is lame.
I miss the old kanye
Can you review psykos of yung lean &amp; bladee?
Kanye is goat
Anthony woke-tano
Bro it looks like fantano got groomed by this album or something
Everything hes saying is ad hominem. Review the music, shut up
Dude making a buck off Kanye&#39;s name again, and then he hides when people are treating him.
stop being a Vulture fantana
the album is brilliant - he doesn&#39;t need to apologize he was right.
i think you are a part of the problem. you have fake jewish people calling themselves jewish. your opinion stopped mattering a long time ago. we love Kanye you are the meaningless.
wahhh wahhh wahhh
political or music review ? What is this ?
&quot;I cant review this because I dont agree with his politics&quot;<br><br>Do you review artists who sing about murders? Unlucky take<br><br>I mean at least he reviewed it
Oh brother
It‚Äôs fascinating how people are so bent out of shape over this non-review. Just goes to show how insanely loyal Ye stans are
This review is unreviewable
If it&#39;s unreviewable, why post a review of it??üòÇ
Oh look, Ye scored his first #1 record in over a decade from this album. Doesn&#39;t that, um, make it highly culturally relevant by default? Doesn&#39;t that also make you a bit out of touch and clueless due to your inability to separate the self-motivated political agenda that&#39;s prohibiting you from addressing an important piece of media that has nearly nothing to do with it? You had one job!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=1">0:01</a> That face when this is BY FAR your most popular video in over a year....
Anthony fantano is the IGN of music reviews.
Sorry about whatever happened to you but I don&#39;t know if this is going to fix that.
This album gave me a headache
I loved Kanye‚Äôs music since I was a kid. He has inspired a generation of musicians and without a doubt will go down in history as one of the best. That being said, there‚Äôs a reason my Kanye playlist of 5 years has been called kookoo west. Not gonna lie his recent album wasn‚Äôt great There were some good ones but considering what his last album was, this isn‚Äôt all that people put it up to be.
Fantano is so fuckin woke these days. Been trash for so long
Bruh, I be anti semite with the shit the Israeli government is currently doing to the palestinian  people, I think the crazy shit he says will actually come out to be true in the future. Then we‚Äôll all look stupid ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Shut up
Ttump2024
Anthony Fantano is another leftist dope.
I think it‚Äôs time to finally stop talking about Yedolf fka Kanye
someone tell unc it not that serious üò≠üò≠üò≠
Kanye fans will never quit, huh?
Do ur research you can‚Äôt be a antisemite if u descend from Shem do ur research if he didn‚Äôt have a voice people wouldn‚Äôt have nothing to say this is not fair. Let that man have his freedom of speech
You follow rules real art doesn‚Äôt have rules and you have glasses so you can‚Äôt really see the vision this is just your useless opinion remember this is his art not your
This guy is such a dweeb
This isn‚Äôt a music review. It‚Äôs virtue signaling
Okay, now keep talking about peste noire lol
Ideology is why this is unacceptable to review‚Ä¶ I hate all people <br>Just review the music loser
Dude, the only reason this video got so many views is because its about ye album
kanye‚Äôs artistic decline needs to be studied how did we go from college dropout to this
Im gonna make a fat guess and say he probably gave this album a 2/10
Fantano would have given it a 10 if it was called good vultures m.a.a.d vultures
This would have over 1 million dislikes if it showed it ahahhaah
2 weeks on the top of Billboard ahahahahaha u pussy. Get mad ü§£‚ù§ love you anyway.
Youre some kinda saboteur üòÇüòÇ what he gotta apologize for? Bruh get a life all you do is talk about ppl cuz you have no hair
The album is fire
this album was insanely disappointing... i had hope because i believe in the power of ty but yep no... i also have this theory ig that hes projecting all of his hate for kim onto his new woman by publicly humiliating bianca (kim and her do look alike)
Saddest part about this album is that theres so many songs and beats that had potential to be one of his best creations. Like Burn, Fuk Sumn, Carnival were some of the songs that were done fine for their potential.<br><br>Back to me. Everything is so good but then kanye terrorises the song with humor
Kanye is right about the jew. The system trying to cancel him for being real
Sorry buddy I guess you not a reviewer of artist albums.
You‚Äôve opened my eyes. ‚ÄúHead so good she honor roll‚Äù is not a bar.
How about you review your divorce papers?
unreviewable and he still the king
tl;dw the album is good but melon is too pissed off, reasonably, at Kanye to listen to it with an &quot;open mind&quot;
Carnival No 1 on hot 100üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
where is ur wife
Its a 3 at worse
you can&#39;t deny kanye is more famous than ever now<br>his song Carnival and Fuk sum are getting millions and millions of streams<br>he&#39;s unstoppable!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=131">2:11</a> I fall into category number 2, (except I‚Äôm old). Please incorporate snippets of the song as you reference it in the video.
keep balding malder
try not to mix music and politics challenge impossible
Review the album with an unbiased opinion. It‚Äôs your job that you gave yourself‚Ä¶
Nerd.
wow youve been proved wrong now havent you. next time actually use your ears to listen to yhe music
u dont know nothing dawg<a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/b8IfY7zOK9iVkNAP_I2A-AY"></a>
such a mid album ppl gotta expand their music taste
No body thinks he&#39;s a anti whatever the world just learned that word to be real it used to just be racist
if this album was named &quot;good vultures, m.A.A.d 1&quot; by Kendye Lawest he would&#39;ve given it a 9
Soyjak caricature lookin ahh
who is letting you post reviews ? this album was a masterpiece
Don‚Äôt know if anyone is even gonna see this comment but I have a Jewish friend that still loves Kanye West and was actually excited for the Album. Obviously he‚Äôs not everyone but I‚Äôm saying that to say I don‚Äôt think some of the younger audience cares that much about Kanye statements and know he‚Äôs just being. Well.. Kanye.. Not saying he gets a pass for any wrong doings but simple that some people just understand he‚Äôs a very vocal go when it comes to certain things. He was getting cancelled left and right for having said that black Jews exist and that they sometimes get treated as lesser than Israeli Jews (which they do Ethiopian Jews) and the Jewish community during the time were acting like he was crazy. From there is is when it spiraled to as bad as it did today. Also politics is an individual choice and not something that should really be brought up as a point because 9/10 you‚Äôre gonna be biased towards whatever political view you have than project weather the Artist is a ‚ÄúGood person‚Äù or ‚ÄúBad‚Äù based of that which is objectively unfair. I don‚Äôt agree with Chris Evans political views or his views on God but still enjoy his acting and his performance as Captain America. I might criticize an individual for certain political views but I‚Äôm not gonna be so quick to cut them off or using as a way to insult someone gem when reviewing whatever Art they do.<br><br>Anyways my 2 cent
Thank you for telling us that you‚Äôre brainwashed üòÇ
Nah you just get him.
It‚Äôs okay if u don‚Äôt like it, man I don‚Äôt like even half of the tracks on the album but I mean why is it so hard to understand that some people like this album, why u gotta be on personal level and judging them for that. Tastes are different, I guessed someone like you knew.
Seems like you are afraid of the backlash if you review it. I mean it‚Äôs understandable.
It&#39;s kinda wild he taking this attitude when he&#39;s reviewed literal murderers and rapists. Bro sounds like hes preaching so he can cover ye and get the ad revenue from it without the controversy. Where&#39;s the consistency lmaoo
Well i havent watched melon since the donda 2 review but this makes up for it
So when Kanye blamed white people in his songs for all kinds of things back then, he was cool, but when he blames (((The Tribe))) for things, then suddenly he is a terrible monster? If you want to know who rules over you, look who you are not allowed to criticize.
hahaha
I was a huge Kanye fan and still like most of his music, but this album really fucking SUCKS
I don&#39;t get why you&#39;re making such a grand stand about this. I don&#39;t like Kanye, i don&#39;t support his views, and i don&#39;t and won&#39;t listen to any of his new stuff because of it, but you&#39;ve reviewed Rapists, Abusers, murderers, people who have committed all manor of crimes and given them a platform, after they had been accused/charged, you don&#39;t get to take a moral grandstand now lmao.
He made 4-5 minor references ab jews and the vein on your forehead started beating
And then the 4th type of Kanye fan, the guy that just likes music and doesn‚Äôt literally live on social media‚Ä¶. I wanted to see what you had to say ab the music, and then. You just yapped ab how much you hate this guy‚Ä¶
i bet if sexxy redd was antisemitic then he would still review all of her shitty music
womp womp
Yes. Anti-semitism = bad. However, to say that the album doesn‚Äôt sound good is crazy to me
NO ONE LIKES YOU, STOP MAKING VIDEOS
Imagine being divorcedüíÄ
For the ppl who always deem ‚ÄòJesus is King‚Äô as one of his worst albums, i reeaaally wish yall would just say yall hate gospel music, cuz it clearly shows. The disingenuousness is nauseating
Forgot the fourth kind of fan. The ones that have witnessed this man make classics and for that reason love the artist not the person.
Anthony fantano was that for moi?ice spice is a man all women all over the world are partially a man
Shut up
I don‚Äôt defend kenye, I just like his old music
I am one of the Kanye fans that realise he is most likely a horrible person and he has Done so much wrong but i love his music including Vultures 1, he is in the wrong but i still try to separate (what i can) from the artist because yeah he is wrong
shoulda called it &quot;To Pimp a Vulture&quot;
The biggest surprise to me regarding the whole Vultures thing is the number of people (I guess Kanye fans?) calling this album one of his best or smh. I mean if you are really a fan of someone, wouldn&#39;t you want or expect something really good and worth the wait from that said artist? I&#39;ve been bumping ye&#39;s music for as long as I can remember and I used to be his biggest fan (at least within my social circle) and I just cannot wrap my head around his supposed fans claiming that it&#39;s easily one of his best/top 3/etc, etc and to see them so butthurt about how others aren&#39;t exactly on board with it as they are. (not just fantano, but overall). I&#39;d have expected more from him. Vultures 1 really sounds even less complete and more cringy than Donda 2 and JIK. JIK really sounds way more cohesive and focused compared to this one. I&#39;m sorry but I just cannot understand their rationale being played here. Is this really what you expect (or should I say demand) of him? He made TLOP, Graduation, and TCD ffs, and this is worth the wait? If you are really a fan, then I believe you ought to be holding your &quot;GOAT&quot; to a higher standard. It doesn&#39;t mean to be extra hateful or aggressive or anything like that. Just demand more... hold him to a higher standard than just a regular music fan would do so. Why? cuz that&#39;s what a fan would do. Being a fan doesn&#39;t mean always eating up whatever garbage they throw at you and just blindly praising them without any critical thinking.
hi im kanye fan type 2
i&#39;m glad they stopped playing him on the radio fr
well it seems like she likes getting treated like that
youre a üêê for stating this and not caring
You should simply ignore this ...but no ...guess making money while PROMOTING IT by offering it a platform is your best bet ...of course .
it took you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=300">5:00</a> minutes to actually talk about the music itself in a 7 min vid geez we get it he&#39;s a manic/bi-polar degenerate I thought it was about does it sound good or not? Not a lore dump on on a guy we already know is not right in the head. It&#39;s like you&#39;re taking it personally
üòÜüòÜüòÜüòÜüòÜ
This Andrew FANTANO guy‚Ä¶ god. I don‚Äôt like him so much that it makes me physically ill. I really, really do not like him. At all. It‚Äôs a bit ridiculous. Really. Out of all viewers, I am BY FAR his top hater.
it&#39;s sounding better now lol, give it another go
if it was called to pimp a vulture you would have given it a 9
yap yap yap separate the art from the artist like your head did to your hair
This guy a dork. Ye is the goat
We can see what‚Äôs going on in Gaza.
he said really mean things. F U Kayne :(
Amen
Womp womp cry about it harder
Waaaaaaaaaaahhhhh
yap
Unreviewable 2 is just around the corner y&#39;all üíÄ<br>Edit: Ye, when I catch you, Ye...
Your divorce was unreviewable
Yes I can nitpick to make something I don‚Äôt like to look bad too<br>Giving lil pump a 7 and then MBDTF under 6 is outrageous
Politics shouldn‚Äôt cloud your judgement on music so you‚Äôre already biased <br>Half the video is you talking about Kanye politics and not about the actual album
separa e√±l arte del artista friki
i wish dislikes were visible to see the hate on thisüòÇüòÇ
Chupapi mufaking nyanyo??
So you dislike his song because  you hate the guy? So it&#39;s not a review lol
You&#39;re projecting you&#39;re own issues and insecurities on to Ye fans.
Burn, Carnival, Stars, Do it, Fuk Sumn, bro its so reviewable üíÄüíÄ
Hey @theneedledrop , i wanna show you real constructive critisism. At the beginnig you say this album is unreviewable and you even named your video like this but then you proceed to review the album. And to add to this, you did not even listen to some parts of it. So your &quot;review&quot; is completely unreliable. Then you say that you cant seperate the art from the artist and thats your opinion and i respect it. But after that you say Ye is hating on the group of people in his music and the proceed to hate on a group of people that listen to his music in your review. Isnt that like similiar thing but on a much smaller scale from you? I agree that the things he said are bad and i do not support it, but you did it too. Difference is that Ye has much bigger platform than you. So basically you behave like a hypocrite. I watch your videos sometimes but this video really disappointed me and i thought you are better than this. I hope that you will answer to this and we can have conversation.
How funny that your own fanbase is made up of hatefull psychos, angsty teens, and yes-men that think they have some kind of relationship with you.... :/ just a thought.
Just caring about the music is that you just said rate the music give us feedback that is what you whole channel is about but you fail in the most simplest terms. Give ur a rating I don‚Äôt car if it‚Äôs a negative 6. I‚Äôm trying to hold you accountable, something you would not know. I‚Äôll look around for your rating but I‚Äôm truly won‚Äôt except anything. .
Homie should do a review on that fucked ass hairline
Separate the MUSIC from the MADNESS üòå
I did support this guy in terms of music taste until I watched this video.
You have been a kanye hater from day one, is it his best no.  Is he is still the Goat. Yes. STFU and keep it moving   KING is a banger, Paid, is dope,  There are frequencies you just cant hear, your either born with it or your not. unfollowed for that review
&quot;Maybe one of the grossest and most dehumanizing things Kanye has said about a woman&quot;<br><br><b>I&#39;m outta town, thuggin&#39; with my round</b><br><b>My coochie pink, my booty-hole brown</b><br>üëÅü´¶üëÅ
Can‚Äôt a guy just like Kanye‚Äôs music
Bro you are woke!! Shut up
really embarrassing on your part to listen to the album on live, and then not even bothering reviewing the album altogether.
you know he made graduation right
Your hairline is unreviewable antikanyemite
Who cares about the opinion of a Jew*** person when it comes to kanye. This album is incredible, its obvious why they dont like it. But who cares. The album is fire to everyone else
if the album was called &quot;Flower vultures 1&quot; he woulda given it a 11/10
Lol Loser!!! At the end of the day, my opinion doesn&#39;t matter because I&#39;m just a troll, right? Loser!!! I respectfully disagree üòè Invite to the cook out rescinded boiiiii
I&#39;m sure If it was called vegans part 1 u would&#39;ve bought the vinyl
I just like the music bro. It‚Äôs not that deep ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
You can listen to music without being a die-hard fan of the rapper
Are you Jewish?
Bro didnt talk about carnival because he was scared to admit that its top tier üíÄ
Ok and?
U suck fantano fr been suck still suck never had a good take in a single video. Objectively terrible and wrong u drive me nuts
bad review! i can‚Äôt believe anythony,(no respect) trying to pander to a new audience is growth in a way ,but i can‚Äôt believe he‚Äôs fallen like this; this is the most biased review i‚Äôve seen. in a while it makes me sad i can‚Äôt trust funny bald man any more. as a subscriber of eight years i humble lay down sword and refuse to fight for a old washed up fantano.!
Yeah man, like, just listen to the college albums, like y‚Äôall need to gyatt your act together
This album was such a sad listen
It‚Äôs wild cause that hueish doctor did want him unalived. He posted the texts
Womp Womp
bald man gang
You a hater man ‚Ä¶. Danm shame
Just review the music baldo
Kanye is a vulture.
acting like anyone who listens to kanye are parasocial cult members, are nihilistic or are psychos is crazy dude, you gotta stop reviewing music if you are this out of touch, most of kanyes fans dont agree with the anti semitic stuff he says but they just like his music, you arent a psychopath if you simply like his music.
were you paid by AIPAC too? reminds me of the ventriloquist line lmao
clowntano strikes out again
dork&#39;s startin to make sense
review essance from essa
This guys such a lame lol
Oh. You‚Äôre a total dork. Noice!
I think not even acknowledging this album would‚Äôve been better than making a really angry rant about it. I‚Äôve never seen bro get triggered like this. White girl stanley cup energy is strong w this one.
I‚Äôm gonna definitively settle this cuz people will definitely read this. Fantano not reviewing vultures is not hypocritical and saying separate the art from the artist is not valid if the views of the artist that are problematic are directly injected into the art. <br><br>That being said, he is still a hypocrite. He has reviewed several albums with blatantly homophobic rhetoric and messaging, even giving some very high praise. Bigotry is bigotry, if you refuse to review art from bigots, then you shouldn‚Äôt be reviewing shit like the low end theory which had a deleted track that is explicitly hateful towards gay people. <br>As a queer person, this comes off as very performative ngl<br><br>Let me amend my comment, cuz a lot of those reviews where he reviews music from problematic people are really old. I can excuse that, but the fact that fantano continues to this day to express appreciation towards artists who were open bigots is what really bothers me. Not just him, but a lot of people love to praise these artists and keep these albums in high regard when they are so open and blatant in their bigotry, and then they have the nerve to denounce Kanye cuz of his bigoted views at least be consistent.
Imagine if he was this pedantic with every rap song
Bruh Jesus is king was not better than This <br>There at the very least tied in messy ness and lack of work ethic
Vultures 1 &gt; Hoods Hottest Princess
Lol show your dislikes
looks like most of your &quot;audience&quot; actually would prefer if you reviewed the album instead of yap for 7 minutes.
youre forgetting about the 4th type of fan. the one that doesnt give a shit what he says and just listens to music. too much yap not enough listening
I thank kanye for a lot of things. feels good replaying his older stuff from graduation, but I&#39;m an adult and I would never play that racist crap in my car, and if I really do wish best for him, than I hope he gets real help. real medical help. <br>this was sad. like watching someone become a ghost
This guy‚Äôs opinion doesn‚Äôt matter.
He&#39;s deleting any comments that disagree with him... talk about letting people have opinions on something that is as subjective as music ü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Appreciate your review. I don‚Äôt feel comfortable enabling Kanye to do anything except get help at this point. Can‚Äôt support new music
Fanbase 4. People only there for his first three albums
Who do black ppl still fuk w him?! That&#39;s the next vote. L review
fun fact fantano has family and dabbles in jew
Feels more like a person biopic of kanye west rather than the music itself. Didn&#39;t realize you were a twitter melon as well. Music reviews are arguments on the intricacies and details of how a song is, and the pros and cons on it. Not a personal attack on someone, while barely listening to the songs, then saying it&#39;s ass because you&#39;re clearly being swayed by personal bias because you don&#39;t like what Kanye has said.<br><br>This isn&#39;t a review, it&#39;s an attack. Relearn how to actually review a record please. I expected you&#39;d know after 10 years.
if it was called &quot;hood hottest vultures&quot; he would&#39;ve given it an 8
And yet it is still #1 on billboard 200 and almost every other music website, interesting.
Wild that he can review albums by artists that actually killed people and rapped about it but when someone says something really bad they‚Äôre the worst person ever. Rare L take.
I bet if sexyy red dropped this it would have been a masterpiece
Guy pretends to act like he‚Äôs offended to curry favor from those who own the platforms he uses to make money. Meanwhile, Google‚Äôs AI won‚Äôt allow it to reference white people even when directly prompted and every single anti-white paper/book being written is by Je*ish authors/scholars.
Yap yap yap take it to a publisher
Virtue Signalling
Unreviewable: proceeds to review it‚Ä¶<br><br>Calls it trash‚Ä¶<br><br>Then calls it donda 2‚Ä¶<br><br>Gave donda a decent rating‚Ä¶<br><br>Bro let the media get to him
The Jesus is King slander will not be tolerated.
keep yapping bro wtf do you know about music
womp womp
I&#39;m guessing king is his favourite song?
Your fake laugh is fucking unbearable.
Probably the worst opinon I&#39;ve heard in my life so far
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=337">5:37</a> back to me is fire. Im a movie lover at heart so the dogma/jay and silent bob sample is fire... just dont review  kanye albums then.
It&#39;s terrible. Tops the billboard üòÇüòä
Yee is unstoppable. Trust in Ye.
Don&#39;t player hate üòÇ
It&#39;s ironic that people reacting like crybabies like this create more anti-semites than anything Kayne did (most people were initially just laughing at the time... the overblown reactions made people take him seriously)<br>Just like overly-woke people crated more racists. And condescending people on the far left created more Trump supporters giving him the election.<br><br>Take notes from this goober and meditate or some shit before voicing your opinions on the internet while salty. You might be part of the problem in the cause you&#39;re rabidly fighting for.
I love you Fantano, but this review I disagree. Kanye says a lot of controversial things. You been doing this for years now Fantano. Music Artists (not just in the Rap and Hip Hop genre) says a lot of controversial things. Lil Nas X, Eminem, Tyler, The Creator, 21 Savage, YoungBoy, Lil Durk, Young Thug and etc. Talks about Killing selling drugs and all manner crazy stuff in there music. (I would like to point out that I‚Äôm not defending Kanye in anyway.) You‚Äôre a person who reviews and critiques music. Because people are still going to listen to Kanye or Ye music, regardless of what crazy thing he might say, or going to say. And like the same for the rest of these artists.
you fell off
If you can&#39;t separate the artist from the art.. don&#39;t do real music fans the disservice of reviewing it. Just as big trash as your &quot;...And Then Pray For Me&quot; review.
You ho stop reviewing music.
I‚Äôm out never listening to this guy again good review/review channel
This is the most discussing videos I‚Äôve seen, yes he‚Äôs a weirdo yes he divorced his wife yes he‚Äôs a going though some shit probably mental fitness yes he‚Äôs not in the right place‚Ä¶ no one is saying that. Fantano talks about him when he has done nothing wrong criminal/civil. Kanye has sang about much of his sins he says that in every Album. He‚Äôs a open book. You like to pick up on him politically that‚Äôs what you do. Ur a review channel. Review music is what you do for a living don‚Äôt forget that. If it‚Äôs a great or poor album, that‚Äôs what we come for.
The Look in Fantano&#39;s! Face in the ThumbNail! says it All Here!
everyone who likes kanye&#39;s music is a nazi fr
Is this review for real? Sonically, this is one of the best albums Kanye has ever produced. You‚Äôre a moron bruh
Yeah, this guy ain‚Äôt a biased reviewer
I can&#39;t hear you bro, you&#39;re getting to emotional
Ah yes because we agree with everything every other artist you gave a good review to believes. I hope Radiohead or whatever npc bughead pitchfork album you like shares every one of your strongly held values
If it was called &quot;To Pimp A Vulture&quot; it would be a 10
Pov : you don&#39;t wanna do a review but you do it anyway
Trash take from Fantano. The record slaps and shows that Ye‚Äôs genius is still there. Madness and genius go together
Never in my 14 year album rating YouTube channel I have seen an album like this ahh stare
Did u know Jews worship cows in little black boxesüòÖ
if he really cared about morals and not promoting an album that spreads hate he would&#39;ve just not made a video
king von killed people lol<br>i think u are just soft
ok welllll hes kanye<br><br><br><br>fr
these comments are so braindead. probably because it‚Äôs a kanye thing thats talked about
You can‚Äôt complain about ‚Äúseparating the artist from the art‚Äù and how you can‚Äôt with Ye because he is still making money. It makes no sense because R Kelly is still making money, but 4.8 million people are listening to him monthly. So is R Kelly in the same boat as Ye? Or are you just a hypocrite?
I love the supposed ‚Äúantisemitism‚Äù from Kanye is the end of the world, but when people are in the streets chanting about the ‚Äúdeath to all Jews‚Äù and the ‚Äúeradication of Israel‚Äù no one bats an eye
The fact you feel the need to give your opinion on what Bianca wears tells me the type of guy you are. Ye isn‚Äôt the one who ‚Äúmakes‚Äù her wear that, she chooses to on her own, and has worn stuff similar before she met Ye. Her family has stated they have no issues with how she CHOOSES to dress because she is an adult. People like you who tell women what they can and can‚Äôt wear are disgusting, you need to check your misogyny
Joe
You‚Äôre just old bald and mad
Guys I‚Äôm starting to think Anthony might not have liked this album
I have never listened to a single song by this creature. And I never will.
Nobody comes here for political views review the album stop using excuses, like you are aware 97% of these ‚Äúartist‚Äù are completely unhinged from reality in their personal life you just rather they hide it and keep to themselves sounds like.  You YouTubers having high moral ethics in random scenarios is honestly cringe.  3/10 review and I don‚Äôt even like Kanye. üòÇ
This guy needs to go back his tunnel.
Unwatchable 1
Even without all the political shit, this album is a 4/10. Maybe a 5 if we&#39;re being generous. The beats are amazing, but the lyrics are just lazy compared to Kanye&#39;s earlier work, even compared to Donda.
you are a 40 year old man who uses TIKTOK your opinion doesn&#39;t matter
guys in comments just discredit his speech about how kanye is a jerk <br><br>i loved kanye when he does late registration, graduation even the life of pablo but his music now is just an egocentric and crazy speech about everything like jews and wifes so don&#39;t say &quot;we CanT sEpArAte ThE arT fRom ThE aRtIsT&quot; cause the artist is in the fucking art : when kanye says antisemic things in his songs, kanye says antisemic things.
‚ÄúSeperate the art from the artist‚Äù
No one likes this guy btw, hes just a meme, dudes gonna die with nothing but that
Drake was right about you
IM YE KELLY
You listen to music a bit selishly. You must know that this entire producton is him grieving his trauma bond with Kim and that we&#39;re in it for the long haul...
Retire
right, thanks for this video... i&#39;m always confused what it is people are actually listening to when they say &quot;i only care about the music&quot;, it&#39;s just so weird to me since msic is so personal, viscerally and tangibly personal and political all at once... what exactly are you listenin to?? And if you &quot;only care about the music&quot;, then what stake do you have in it? why do you care so much?
This review is unwatchable.
The album is not kanye standard, facts, but fantano is just overreacting imo
Fantano has lost all credibility after this one.
ye completely mogged u , yogurt boy
COWARD!!! Review murderers and rapists but not someone who calls out the Hollywood Elite. Whos payroll are you on?
L review. fantano is mad because he&#39;s balding
some of the most legendary rock stars had sex with underage groupies but kanye saying words is too far lol
Libthany Libtano with another L take on the greatest human ever conceived
TND, another classic
Cry
Your a cornball
Fr tho what you rating it?
You can‚Äôt defend Kanye for a few things he said but you defended barzum (who btw murdered a man and committed arson) who is much worse than what Kanye did
Mans such a loser lmaoooo
nice rage bait, now rate the album
Say what you want about him, i really didnt like this album either. <br><br>But he gave Kim a 1 million dollars + millionsof dollars in stocks, a couple of cars, jewelry worth millions and more + countless extremely over the top romantic gestures over the years. <br><br>I bet he has put more effort to please a woman in a year than you have in your entire life. So it&#39;s safe to say you can drop the narrative that he treats kim like a piece of meat..
why dont listen to some crazy person doin dope music? dont you have democrasy there, cant he say whatever he wants in HIS tracks? you sound like some twitter crybaby
Funny he gave good scores to albums promoting drugs and murder, but freedom of speech is apparently much worse according to Anthony.
Bro nobody agrees with anything Anthony says üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Back to me was so fire
Anthony is a nerd and white so his music taste is negligible
Kanye is the goat
This album was fire
Funny he says it&#39;s unreviewable but reviews the album anyway. He talks about how bad the album is, that&#39;s called reviewing the album.
Anthony is quite the based jew eh? lol
Fantano lets his politics get in the way of his reviews way too much now a days. Dude is a legit snowflake libtard.
Imagine he took the meds in 2018 when he was supposed to
im not much of a lyrics guy, and while i like some hiphop  its not my main genre, but with narrative and lyrics being so fundamental to this music it seems really crazy  to demand seperation form the artist
ziohazard
Maybe people just like the music and everything doesn‚Äôt have to be broken down like protein powder
Hop off sexxy redd and reveiw the album
i‚Äôm a new kanye listener and i can agree what he says is bad but the songs are still good
Mexican Invasion - Cali Life Style
These people jumping on kanye meat so hard. Is the album different in apple music than spotify because we definately heard a different project. That shit was a stinking steaming hot pile of shit. People defence really being cancel culture really says it all to be honest.
Please stop trying to critique rap. You do not understand the genre or any given movement and you have admitted to this. Please stick to pop. You suck at listening to rap. It&#39;s been very disappointing watching you the last few years. Getting further and further from understanding of art or music.
Hating ain&#39;t professionnal, dude.
I disagree that you can&#39;t separate lyrics. That&#39;s irrelevant to whether the beats and raps and songs are good on a musical level.<br><br>Black on Both Sides by Mos Def for example, is very anti-white racist, I&#39;m white... I don&#39;t gaf, I love the songs regardless. His flow, his writing, his raps, the songs overall... you don&#39;t have to agree with or excuse opinions you don&#39;t like... so what, you can only like art where the content of which you agree with? How moronic.<br><br>I&#39;m not defending Kanye or this album btw. I just find that point in general idiotic.
You calling teenagers lonely is ironicüíÄ
Hoes mad fantano doesn&#39;t want to give a dumpster fire album a fair review
jesus, he genuinely looks so pissed off and tired. like he lost sleep or somethin with those eye bags. ive never seen him look so ANGRY wtf did this album do to him
I liked Vultures, and Im really interested to get the absurds and horrendous things he is saying. But in no way I&#39;m approving his words and supporting him, I&#39;m just curious about craziness and horrible things. That&#39;s it
Fantano cannot review an album if the person who made it criticizes the jews.
Vultures was mid but I think fantano is also just too sensitive
But Peste Noire is cool right?
Dondas Death is probably a 6/10
Fantano so ghey nobody cool actually likes him.
Bro don&#39;t act like Kanye is the first batshit celeb to say crazy shit and go off the deep in it&#39;s been happening since the beginning of time and will continue to happen don&#39;t let it bother you  and enjoy the music you know Kanye is fire
okay but carti spazzed on this album tho
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=329">5:29</a> bro that is a line is from Dogma Kanye didn&#39;t make it
fun fact: kanyes actions dont equal his music!!
This isn&#39;t a music review channel anymore. Just an egg pushing leftist theories.
Is this an album review or what bruh?
81k dislike ti 87k likes lol
Calls himself a music nerd
Where‚Äôs the dislike counter when you need it??
Your moustache reminds me of a certain somebody from Germany
This album is so fire. Gold digger was the best track imo
Why do people still watch this guy his taste in music is horrible
HOW CAN YOU BE ANTI YOURSELF when the correct term is anti shemite? KANYE is right in that regard.

As a parasocialially obsessed weirdo,
I been searching high and low and I can tell you one thing beautiful albums don‚Äôt just fall out the sky you know
Hates that Kanye Loves Hitler but has an evolved Hitler mustache
Maybe some people are off the internet. My guy pushing 40 and tweets all day about politics just because he got dumbed. Sexyy Red&#39;s fuckign sub manual.
I absolutely LOVED the way you opened this video.
You just a hater, glad ur wife left
apparently the way you treat your wife is more important to tony here than if you have killed a guy
i feel like u picked the worst songs on the album yes what kanye has said and done is wrong but songs like burn do it king and even the most popular carnival i believe are some of kanyes best songs. i want to hear what u have to think of these songs not just slander kanye
It¬¥s good.
That&#39;s why ur wife left yo bald ass
Every rap fan literally ignores the lyrics and just likes the music. its all about murder, theft, greed, lust shooting of the face and all types of devauchery üòÇ
Before you watch: Anthony yaps for a while about nothing related to music
this comment section proves his point about kanye fans
But he made Graduation‚Ä¶üò≠
Ant is going to hell for this one.
Stars is fireeeee your smoking something good over there aren‚Äôt you mhm don‚Äôt die is amazing carnival is best song of the year did you hear/feel playboy Cartis part man you gotta be closed minded bc that whole song is amazing
Beautiful big tiddy but naked women don‚Äôt just fall out the sky yk is fire song your tripping dude
Kanye is way smarter than you think u just don‚Äôt know the research he talking about he can‚Äôt be anti semetic he‚Äôs black ppl are the true Jews
That album is great
Ur too focused on politics. Just review the music and do your job
if it was called the turning mad pimped vultures it would be the best of it generation
&quot;The Seminole County Sheriff&#39;s Office announced Monday that 13 people have been arrested in connection to a January 2023 drive-by shooting in Central Florida that left an innocent woman dead and five of her friends injured.&quot;<br><br>&quot;&quot;We found that the likely notice stemmed from a very public, high profile dispute playing out on social media and in the court system involving Jackboy and a known associate of the shooters, another rap artist‚Ä¶known by the stage name, Kodak Black,&quot; he said.&quot;<br><br>THIS HAPPENED YESTERDAY. So people are shooting each other at rappers concerts over disputes regarding which gang banging drug dealing rapper is better (kodak black vs jackboy), but yea KEEP platforming the music that literally gets people in Chicago killed but nazism is where the line is drawn LMFAOOOOO
Reviews like these just don‚Äôt fall out of the sky you know?
I don‚Äôt like this album simply because it‚Äôs laced with subliminals and I can‚Äôt tell what the fuck it‚Äôs doing to me. I closed my eyes and listen to the first song and I saw some crazy shit. I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs demonic but I don‚Äôt like it. It all depends if Kanye‚Äôs really dead or not. And I kinda think he is. Why would a man of god marry a girl that walks around naked? It‚Äôs deceitful and stupid.
I enjoy the music, but again I agree with the point of view for the lack of intellectual depth. But will this video change my outlook on the music, the replayability? No. I Iike the music and regardless of the validity of your points, everybody needs a break from thoughtful substance once in a while.
If this album wasn‚Äôt real, you would not have reviewed it, think about that‚Ä¶
I like do it and that‚Äôs it
The only song I actually think it&#39;s good is &quot; beg forgiveness &quot;, and half of the song is not even his üíÄ Is a sample from a music called Gabriel. Chris Brown saved the song basically ü´†
That&#39;s why your wife left you
Half way in and no mention of the music no wonder your wife left you
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=379">6:19</a> the review
To think that this guy is somewhat the most influential artist from the 00&#39;s and now he&#39;s in this state kinda says a lot about the world we&#39;re living in today.
lol it‚Äôs bad when I could predict how Fantano would go about reviewing this the second I thought about searching it
Bro chill out nobody cares about your politics just review the music. Don&#39;t get ahead of yourself.
‚ÄúUnreviewable album‚Äù<br><b>proceeds to review</b>
Left him speechless he meant to sqy 10
Based melon forever until the end of time
I just listened to the album thinking surely it isnt as bad as you say it is. it is. it is so bad. the best song is a 5/10.
The album is banger after banger
they not gon let you hit bro
The same way he said its unreviewable and still reviewed it is just like how i just watched this video thats unwatchable
he‚Äôs just hating because he doesn‚Äôt like kanye and clearly can‚Äôt separate the art from the artist even tho he encouraged people to do a few years ago and he doesn‚Äôt even give the album a chance and only goes for the negatives, anthony is biased and takes things out of context and clearly doesn‚Äôt understand lyrics and example of this is when kanye says his wife is a reference and anthony says that‚Äôs dehumanizing but kanye‚Äôs just saying that if people want to know his type his wife is a reference, his wife is his type but clearly anthony is too biased to even give him a chance or give any thought it‚Äôs just sad and disrespectful anthony is just a hater and i can‚Äôt be biased because im a jew myself also half of the lyrics are jokes and he‚Äôs referring to what people call him like in king and in vultures it‚Äôs a joke and the other one doesn‚Äôt even mean much of anything
But is it a good album
But he made graduation to be fair
Music Reviews &gt; Emotional Responses<br><br>Do Better.
Its not the best Kanye album but he is hating just because its Kanye which makes no sense as a music reviewer
melon seeths, album reviews, part the seas, save the chews
Fantano got that mind virus. ‚ÄúNazi nazi‚Äù ü§° these reviews are social credit score assessments.
Hasn‚Äôt he literally reviewed music from murderers?
That&#39;s why your wife divorced you bro
Ye is canceled. I feel safer.
Kanye would have had the motivation if Fantano didn&#39;t deny the Sangehili heritage of Sa &#39;Mhide
This guy is a relic of 2012 hipsterism. Like if anyone in history ever wonders how annoying hipsters were 10 years ago, they just have to look up Chomo Stache and watch him speak for 30 seconds üòÇ
ü§ìü§ìü§ìü§ì
This is what ive been saying, &quot; you cant depeeate the art from the artist, if all of the terrible things hes doing are in the art&quot; that us the art st this point
I just listen to Kanyes old stuff idk about the 3 types of fans thing is really accurate
Finally a W take, Melon. I&#39;m done supporting this lunatic on meds as well
In a 7 minute video talking about a music album it took you 5 minutes to talk about the actual music. The rest is politics. I miss &quot;thatistheplan&quot; when you weren&#39;t such a whiny bitch.
This guy stinks. And im not talking about kanye
Unreviewable. Starts reviewing it.
Separate the lyrics from the music production and it‚Äôs actually not that bad
You‚Äôve reviewed music made by murderers, you reviewed a Burzum album and they‚Äôre led by a Nazi who killed a man for being homosexual and burnt down churches and synagogues but this album is not worthy of a review?
Your showing your age
Wasn‚Äôt that a review
It turns people were right about fat tano.
despite kanye acting like a pysho I do think that his music fell off
I enjoyed 4 or 5 tracks on this album,  but the rest I agree is trash.
Fantano&#39;s either too caught up in twitter politics or this is a bait video. Reducing Kanye&#39;s fanbase to just 3 subcategories of degenerates is one of the consequences of being online too much; you end up developing negative viewpoints on nearly everything. <br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=265">4:25</a> Nothing shown here is anti-Semitic when looked at with basic reading comprehension. The amount of distraught heard in his voice saying the whole brain separation line is really a showcase of how caught up he is with media bullshit, that he&#39;s even taking lyrics out of context to bastardize an artist he doesn&#39;t like. <br><br>The better choice in this situation is to not make a video on your &quot;music review channel&quot; about how you&#39;re not going to review music, but of course he did this anyways; Fantano&#39;s career has always relied on divisive reviews and opinions.
It is so easy to tell bullshit on others creation. Just sit at home and qq all the time. Go, create better and you will have a right to say shit to whomever you want. This was Kanyes review, not his songs. Unsubscribed
Kanye&#39;s new album doesn‚Äôt have enough guns and drungs in it... Fabio needs more Guuuuns!! <br><br>Dude&#39;s got a hitler stache ü§£
Here to remind fantano that vultures 2 is a week away
this is same man who reviews cardi b
Lmao what does it say about me if i like this music even when I‚Äôm not a Kanye fan.
You either die a melon or live long enough to see yourself become the rotten melon
I&#39;ll have to disagree. Every artist on planet earth is weird af or has controversial (or hateful) views in some way. Hell, everybody does. Life and culture are not 100% black and white. You can&#39;t claim guilt by association or guilt by complacency in every scenario, and you especially can&#39;t reasonably tell fans of Kanye West that listening to his music endorses his believes, even IF some of his beliefs are reflected directly into his music. I as well as many people can sit down and listen to Kanye West after his statements and I guarantee you all of us will walk away still NOT antisemitic. Our brains don&#39;t automatically hear what he&#39;s saying and go &quot;Yeah, I fuck with this&quot; we hear the song as a whole. The beat, the flow, and maybe some nasty shit, but we don&#39;t take it seriously. It&#39;s not meant to be taken seriously, it&#39;s meant to just be enjoyed for what it is, with or without Kanye. If you can&#39;t separate the artwork from the artist, that is entirely your prerogative but you can&#39;t sit there and tell us as if it&#39;s a fact. I am so sick and tired of people telling their audience their opinions as if it&#39;s a fact, and then their hardcore fan groups creative a bandwagon opinion out of it, and then the next thing you know, perfectly viable artists go from loved to despised for no legitimate reason. We need to stand up against this bullshit
To Pimp a Vulture
Fantano will review your album if you&#39;re a drug dealer, gang member, criminal, prostitute, murderer...but if you criticize ‚ú° you&#39;ve crossed the line and are a bad influence.
Someone‚Äôs all high and mighty, it‚Äôs music bro‚Ä¶ I thought you made it your job to review that stuff
I dont get why everybody sees king as the most antisemitic song/lyrics on the album. In my opinion that ‚Äûantisemite, but still the king‚Äú isnt a confession from him that he is in fact a antisemite, but he points out that the media etc calls him that and ye uses the term and kinda recreates a punchline out of it. As if hed say ‚Äûyall can call me what u want, i am still the king‚Äú. this confirms when ye raps: ‚Äûthey thought headlines was my kryptonite‚Äú. I think other lines are waaay more antisemite, like on stars with ‚Äûkeep a few jews on the staff now - i cash out‚Äú. This is pure antisemitism
Wait, What Kanye says is bad?? I thought it seemed right
This dude Disrespecting my religion yet crying when people point out how bad zionists are üòÇ<br><br>A clown üòÇ
Icl I&#39;m only a fan of kanyes music. Outside of music I don&#39;t really care. I just see a mentally ill man who&#39;s doing some stupid stuff ruining his image. <br>Basically what I&#39;m saying is I&#39;m not a fan of kanye outside of music. And I&#39;m a die hard fan of his music btw so if this is coming from me then yk kanye is seriously messing up.
I mean you dont like Yeezus, so how could you like this, honestly your more hateful to ye fans than he is to jews, now me as a jewish person yes i do listen to kanye, its crazy. I enjoyed the tracks that you hated most, the lyrics on vultures (track) was good and the production was incredible, like as a semi producer I notice good production and this album was it bro, like your actualy delusional if you think the production on carnival, paid, vultures, once again, Beg forgivness, was horrible than your deffinetly not separating art from artist (also BBTBNWJDFOTSYK is a fire line catchy af and experimental, because when a person dosent have benefit of the dought  experimentation is seen as mistakes). And I mean as a jew, I did hate King alot because that was him just boasting about his antisemitism, but I dont know that is just what he does,  like it or not every album he has released had this sense of self boasteness about his controversies (swiftys hate him more about famous than jews hate him) except like drop out erea which was when he was still climbing the tower of rap.  I do agree with you that hood rat was kinda ass, but come on HOODRAT HOODRAT HOODRAT. its catchy bro. its like a seven get your pantys out of a twist bro. (yeah some parts of the lyrics did blow)
Come on guys. Kanye is wrong. He‚Äôs said terrible things and I‚Äôm glad he ain‚Äôt president. Anyways, he‚Äôs really done some messed up things and Fantano has a point. He don‚Äôt have to listen to it if he don‚Äôt want to. Quit being so demanding and rude. I don‚Äôt want him to have to make an apology, but also at the same time he could‚Äôve made a post about this rather than a video, because now a bunch of us have been exposed to this.
the seed oil drop antheny soytano
Anthony is more hateful to ye fans than kanye is to jews
Donda was kanyes last album I think he has completely lost it I hope he finds peace
Bro Kanye is #1 in the world fuck off
Dunkey was right about you, Melon. I unfortunately give you and your entire channel a 7. Best of luck to you.
I guarantee half of you people in the comments didn‚Äôt watch the video.
how about u stick to music and not politics budüíÄ
Well you reviewed worse things, wanted a true review
I can&#39;t believe a guy can have different opinions to me and still work his job. Has my communist utipia not yet arrived? Is this man too successful to forcefully kneel before me? He should have stayed in his lane, and maybe sold crack to fathers, shoot someone&#39;s son in a parking lot, pimped women on the side and made music about that... not reference his own media coverage though, that&#39;s crossing the line. Great album review though, I liked how you talked about the album. When is the next Sam collab? You were starstruck last time.
My take away from this is you&#39;re a numpty that cant review it because kanye is bad. Is your goal to have people go listen to his music? Cause that&#39;s how you get people to go take a listen. :y
he‚Äôs giving ‚Äúturn down that racket vibes‚Äù
If your seeing this comment, watch &quot;Fantano reaction to Carnival&quot;. This bald fella is full of shiüòÇ
why do people respect this guys opinion on music again?
Hater. Album is dope
His music has been unlistenable since Yeezus came out. It&#39;s been a long time since he&#39;s ever made a quality album and I gave up hope once TLOP came out and he started talking about bleached assholes. His production can still shine but his lyrics are literally a 0 on a scale of 1-10.
Yeah ty definetly carried. Ye mostly yapped
Ohhh this is the crybaby I&#39;ve been seen from other yt just raging bout jew stuff
this album is a 10
I don‚Äôt understand why this guy was ever popular his takes are absolute shit
Maybe I&#39;m not a racist Maybe I&#39;m not a nihilistic teen Maybe I just enjoy good music
Finally someone actually is speaking facts. I love Kanye but vultures aint it and thats the end of it
Lmao. 3 types of Kanye Fans. Im a kanye fan and i am none of those 3. Love the album though. His music is super cool.
Folks mad at kanye. Not one of yall be mad at 50 years of 17 year old black kids being robbed of everything they was supposed to be worth. If you cant separate the art from the artist. Then also dont seperate the greddy mfs in the music industry from the religion most of them &quot;happen&quot; to carry.
jus say ur bad at ur job bro
The reason this is called unreviewable is because the artist&#39;s insane actions and beliefs are intertwined into the music. They can&#39;t be separated. That&#39;s why there&#39;s politics, that&#39;s why this is a review of Kanye&#39;s character. It isn&#39;t a music review.<br>Generally, when people complain about something being &quot;too political&quot;, they really mean &quot;too different from my politics&quot;. Makes sense given the amount of antisemitism in this comments section.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=5">0:05</a> yap session begins, beware
Duuuude‚Ä¶ what happened to you to make you such a trash ass reviewer/ commentator frfr. If you hate your job just say it! At least in that case I could respect you for being honest, cause you just come off as a spiteful prick no matter the album or the artist, fuckin sad!
this is what 5 milliseconds of twitter does to a mf
I can see why people might have thought you were Jewish the way you&#39;re mad about this. Using big words to describe people that support an artist is a bad look in literally every way. We are happy to hear genuine criticism but this is just wack.
You dont have an opinion after giving sexxy red a 8
I disagree, Gary
trash opinion imo. you should stop posting other video üëç
Long winded crybaby
Long winded crybaby
What about the people that have literally killed people?? They‚Äôre albums should be unreviewable too right?
Meanwhile, you ignore European refugees committing genocide on Semites under the guise that they‚Äôre anti semitic.
bad take
what are you jewish!?
Hyphonix
Good review.
This video is &quot;not good&quot;
If it was called ‚ÄúVultures 1‚Äù you would‚Äôve given it an unreviewable (and then still review it)
Cry baby
I liked the album tbh. Not the best Ye I heard but still some cool songs on it. Thanks to Fantano I learned I am either a kiddo, a lonely person or a fanboy, Thanks!
Clickbait titles for 1000 please
Melon can absolutely do whatever he wants, I was hoping for a review of the music (not politics.) I guess we don&#39;t do that anymore.
liberal
its comlete shit.creating kingpin skinny pimp atmosphere with ty $ autotune is total disbalance
Aren&#39;t you supposed to review music, not people?
bro can you please just stfu ur not relevant anymore
Look what that one Fader article did to our boi.
This sucka
Biggest flannel on the internet with hands down some of the worst takes on music ive heard
&quot;Hey guys i wont review this album cause he makes fun of jews but ill listen to all these other rappers songs that glote about killing people selling drugs kidnapping people and raping women!&quot; Fucking hypocrit üòÇ picking and choosing
L take + bald
Kanye is a piece of shit person, but even as a Jew, I love his music
Sat there trashing kanye as a person and talks about music for 1 minute. I know kanye is a trqsh human but thats not why people watch the channel.
So you cant just listen to the music and like it?
Y&#39;all butthurt ass kanye stans in the comments are crazy. Don&#39;t watch the video and enjoy your garbage music in peace
I‚Äôve watched a lot of your videos dude, but you are going way to hard on Kanye and it‚Äôs way suss, weird I haven‚Äôt heard you slander someone this hard
This dude needs to just listen to music without mentioning what he has done and nobody will call you antisemitic for reviewing an album I‚Äôm Jewish and I want you to review it. You saying that his music represents who he is as a person and everything he has said is ridiculous. If you review American dream then aren‚Äôt you supporting violence or savage mode 2. Your points are completely stupid. And the album is great and you have to stop being bias.
I guess some people can‚Äôt separate art from the artist.
kanye fans mad but this albino milk dud is trolling them for views so whos winning and whos whinning?
Dude you flopped on this one, regardless if you bias you‚Äôre a review channel
Dude loves to hate Kanye
Based
You really got Kanye‚Äôs meat in your mouth
Dude literally stfu ur opinion is rejected you literally have sexy red a 8/10 üíÄ
Doppelmoral
Classic Jew rant
2 weeks after 86k like 80k unlike...
Carnival is still #1 lol
Bro just shut up, I agree the album sucks but your bias is insane like you make the guy to be worse than the devil meanwhile you reviewed travis&#39;s utopia normally, whats worse, people dying on your concert because of a mistake you are involved with or talking shit about jews, crazy
bald boy
L whiteboy
tbh his wife left him
If Kanye would‚Äôve donated 50mil to Bill and Melinda foundation unreviewable 1 would get a 7
Imma be real unless there was a push from your fanbase to review this, then it just feels preachy
Ever considered that non english speakers can listen to this without knowing whats going on
ü§ì
I just came here to give this a üëéüèº
Boring
YouTube needs to bring back the thumbs down count just for this video. I want to see how many ye fans disliked it (me being one of them)
Bro you‚Äôre getting SERVED in YOUR comments! -and I Love it!
Thing is bro‚Ä¶ from a long time fan of yours and a long time Ye fan?<br>It takes 25-40 listens of any Kanye record to ‚Äúget‚Äù it.<br>This is one of those.<br>As Donda was.<br>As Jesus is king was.<br>It took a lot of time to realise his artistry on any of those releases.<br>Being that guy who hits records for one or two listens?<br>And, I‚Äôve commented on your page about it being a weakness in your approach?<br>This album turns into an ear worm quicker than say?<br>Ye album.<br>The fact you predicated it as an awful album distracts from your ability‚Ä¶ that you sustained as impartial to music being art and the artist being a vessel.<br>He talks about his kid.<br>He talks about how happy he is with Bianca.<br>He learns so much in this‚Ä¶ return to music.<br>He, in 2018 said he was never gonna make music.<br>I think, by your algorithm you should give him some peace that an artist could be separated from their thoughts outside of the art.<br>I‚Äôve been following you since 2007.<br>I‚Äôve learnt a lot from you.<br>My Chelsea record collection attests to that.<br>Just give albums a window before you write them off.
If it was called VultrYe you&#39;d give it a 10
Came here for an album review about the music. <br><br>What the fuck did I just listen to? <br><br>I‚Äôm out, peace
atleast a 6
9/10
I‚Äôm giving this your worst review and you sound like a mainstream suckup
Your not able to even digest this but you can review other rappers that rap about the same shit I‚Äôm smelling bias üòÇ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=390">6:30</a>
Ok ok hear me out I‚Äôm not anti semitic and I just like the music because I think it sounds good
can you just review the music and not Kanye as a person üíÄ
This MIGHT be why your wife divorced you üíÄ Also haven‚Äôt you reviewed albums about literal murder but words is what gets youüò≠
Kanye hasn‚Äôt made good stuff since before 2016 even earlier maybe
I thought this was a music review channel, why are you reviewing the artist and not the music ? Fuck Kayne, but fuck your review of this album too lmfao.
If this was called ‚Äúthe vultures store‚Äù you would‚Äôve given it a ten and would have liked it so much it would eventually make you go to one of the concerts.
Let‚Äôs be honest here: Kanye has always be a controversial figure. Your refusal to interview his latest album is hypocritical on your part. You‚Äôve interviewed records from rappers who are in gangs (Young Thug and Gunna), promote murder and actual murderers (Varg Vikernes) yet you won‚Äôt review Kanye‚Äôs latest album because of his political views? This is why I keep unsubscribing. Like so many others, Anthony allows his politics to dictate his actions. Over time, melon has become sour and rotten. ‚ùåüçà‚ùåüëéüèºüëéüèºüëéüèº
Lots of us agree about the jews. Gotta quit acting like they&#39;re some poor downtrodden group and not the gatekeepers of all western media.
I miss the old Kanye, straight from the &#39;Go Kanye<br>Chop up the soul Kanye, set on his goals Kanye<br>I hate the new Kanye, the bad mood Kanye<br>The always rude Kanye, spaz in the news Kanye<br>I miss the sweet Kanye, chop up the beats Kanye<br>I gotta to say at that time I&#39;d like to meet Kanye<br>See I invented Kanye, it wasn&#39;t any Kanyes<br>And now I look and look around and there&#39;s so many Kanyes<br>I used to love Kanye, I used to love Kanye<br>I even had the pink polo, I thought I was Kanye<br>What if Kanye made a song about Kanye<br>Called &quot;I Miss The Old Kanye, &quot; man that would be so Kanye
I don&#39;t want to review this, so here is my review is pretty much what just happened. Why even post a video if it was &quot;unreviewable&quot;. Listen I don&#39;t like Kanye&#39;s new music, nor do I agree with anything he has said in his bi-polar spouts, the dude has problems and is weird. But I also don&#39;t like you and disagree with most of the things you say. Setting that aside, this album was hot trash.
Bro forget to get a life before making this vid
Anthony came fully prepared for this review with a mustache like that üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
cleanse your palette with a review of COBRAH
It&#39;s hard being a fan of Kanye. I think he&#39;s an absolutely horrible and disgusting person, but i just like his older music, that&#39;s it.
Wow never knew that me just simply liking how an album flows makes me a piece of shit
Unhinged
What if I just like how the music sounds and I don&#39;t care about the character of the artist
lmao bro mad at a kanye album cry about it
Worst review worse than the 6 on mbdtf
OK BOOMER
na uh kanye is my king
All of Kanyes music was always terrible trash, so no suprise here. Who even ever liked his music? How tastless can you be?
Disagree
you clearly don‚Äôt know shit about music lmao. what a joke.
Sorry man, but you‚Äôre completely out of touch lmao
For a person who is so apparent with his  distain for G-d on his platform, it‚Äôs bizarre that you pander to us Jews. I just wanted to hear a thorough review of the album as you used to do.
Most biased review OAT
Based af. Kanye is trash
AFTER EVERYTHING SAUD HUH :‚Ä¶. crazy, bipolar, antisemite ‚Ä¶
You&#39;re clinically insane
Good kid mad vulture 1 would get such a 10
Cuckthony Divorcetano
Don&#39;t care + ratio + didn&#39;t ask + you gave YEEZUS a 5 and MBDTF a 6 so you should be put on the bronzen bull
So NOW we know not to trust this idiot?
You&#39;re a clown . I enjoyed this album
Instead of just talking about him as a person, why don‚Äôt you review the song itself
Divorcetano
Crazy that u won&#39;t review Ye for some shit he said, but u gladly prop up murderers like von n cheif keef. Sum wild soy shit from baldy
Wokethony folktano
Why don‚Äôt you just become a political channel? Because your political bias &amp; morale high chair has become far too apparent in these ‚Äúmusic reviews‚Äù. The political bias supersedes the music review. The ‚Äúmusic nerd‚Äù moniker has been destroyed via a political &amp; ‚Äúhigh morality‚Äù Lens. We get it Anthony, you are much more smarter, much more enlightened, &amp; far more morale than us all- now let‚Äôs hear a music review and not a sermon
So he can review a murderers album but not Kanyes
Fellthony Offtano
So if we&#39;re following your broken logic, we all except you to walk back every good or bad review you ever made for every artist who did something wrong.<br>I miss when I thought you got cancelled. Stop showing back up with your useless opinions. This is about music. Review the MUSIC you coward.
I mean all good and well,  but isn&#39;t Fantano a fanatical racist, sexual abuser and genocide denier?
I could listen to Kanye on loop before I could listen to this weird Stache , no talent hater. I‚Äôm 5 seconds in and cannot stand this man‚Äôs energy/tone/attitude. Has big head ever produced or wrote music? How tf y‚Äôall prop his weird ass up critiquing games he‚Äôs never played. Wild to be what he is as an adult.
This dudes take is GARBAGE‚Ä¶
Thank you some who agrees that the women falling out of the sky was terrible and a wasted opportunity
You can tell he kinda liked Back to me üòÇ... but yeah the album is not good
Anthony you in your feelings big time with this video
Kanye getting dogged because he hurts peoples feelings I stopped giving a fxck about what a celebrity says when we elected trump for president after it‚Äôs like honestly who cares
I don‚Äôt care how Kanye is out side of music he‚Äôs king and that‚Äôs that
Your review is great kanye is delighted with your lecture
I&#39;ll be honest, you picked 3 mid ass lines out of 55 minutes of music and decided it was racist. I gave it a listen and its actually good. It has a few signature corny Ye lines like every album but if anything its much more in-line with music trends of the last few years. Hearing Ye make club songs feels weird for some reason. That being said, the fact he&#39;s so hated is why it&#39;s worth reviewing. Can someone you hate with a passion, and is ostensibly mentally ill, still make &quot;art&quot;? Does it make you morally superior to refuse to listen? Are your morals being reviewed or the music? It feels like this is you giving yourself a light 10 because you&#39;re (trigger warning) &quot;triggered&quot; that he dare make light of the bombastic and uniformally condemned outbursts he&#39;s had.
Gay comment section all around
Lost all credibility with that sexxy red review dork
If the album was named ‚ÄûCome Home The Vultures Miss You‚Äú you would‚Äôve given it a 10
Best album of all time!!
I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre offended by his comments. But it‚Äôs annoying that you took the time to make content about content you refuse to listen to. It‚Äôs almost like you knew your irrelevant hot takes on unrelated issues would get you views. We get it, you‚Äôre Jewish.
It‚Äôs funny that he‚Äôs ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to be a music critic but can‚Äôt separate the artist from the music. Which is funny because any other artist he can. Didn‚Äôt Gucci Mane push a woman out of a moving Lamborghini on the highway? Oh but I see he‚Äôs got Gucci Mane album reviews. It‚Äôs rather convenient how he picks and chooses who to ‚Äúseparate the music and artist‚Äù from don‚Äôt you think?
Kanye MeatRider but he has a point
Fantano the only fat vegan in the world
7 mins video , 3 and a half mins in he hasn&#39;t reviewed one song on the album
I remember in 2017 fantano came down to sydney to do a live show. I remember when I went to take a photo with him, I clenched my fist ready to do a fist bump for the pic, and instead landed my fist on fantano&#39;s soft large moobs. He didn&#39;t react, and there was a long line to take a photo, so I just went with it - the photo came out blurry so it didnt matter in the end. But I can&#39;t help but think... what if? What if I never did that? What would Fantano&#39;s life be like now?
I feel like all the lines you see about Jews and/or Antisemitism, are more about Kanye talking about how he is trying to correct himself, or fighting past the labels he‚Äôs been given.
2093 better than this trash
delete this video NOOOW
if it was called &quot;Kid Vulture&quot; by Radiowest then he wouldve given it a classic/10
The funny part is that I&#39;m sure he&#39;s fine praising people who openly support the Palestinian genocide.
I&#39;m still a Kanye fan because I like his music. I don&#39;t have to agree with his opinions to do so. And I didn&#39;t like this record, but it wasn&#39;t because he&#39;s an anti-semite. Hell, I knew multiple Jews who are still fans.
Wild that people in comments just go prove Fantano right.
kanye is based
is this guy a music critic or a social activist?
You forgot 4, the people who just love to listen to his music. I don‚Äôt like who he is and don‚Äôt think what he said and did was in any way okay, but I just love his music still. His music is usually good, up until this album. I love all his old stuff, but I can only really stomach some of it because of who he is and what he says.
This guy would‚Äôve been burning books in the 1930‚Äôs
People only tuned in on this video because its about kanyeüòÇ kanyes name alone just boosted the hell out of his view count for the week
If this album was called &quot;Kids see vultures&quot; you would&#39;ve given it a 10
Vultures 1 is AOTY and Fantano can&#39;t handle it.
Did you know that the vultures single pack artwork is a direct reference to a nazi completely disgusting metal band called burzum? It just shows Kanye‚Äôs new philosophy and it‚Äôs scary that an artist that has this much influence and audience has the right to say such things
It seems like you have a very personal issue with Kanye. As a reviewer you should review the music not your person issues you have with the artist. Let the masses decide. <br><br>I too didn‚Äôt like the album though
I think Kanye is so successful that he doesn‚Äôt really put much focus into lyrics anymore. It‚Äôs been about three songs every album where his lyrics are coherent and the rest is just ideas that aren‚Äôt complete lyrically, and I‚Äôm a Kanye fan.
Has a few good songs but probably his worse album by far
So much antisemitism in these comments, it‚Äôs frightening
If it was called &quot;To Pimp a Vulture&quot; you&#39;d give it a 10
dude shut up
I just showed up for &quot;carnival&quot;
If was called To Be Vultures you would‚Äôve given it a 10
This dude is a P in real life and short af
Chalked every Kanye fan up to social miscreants and You‚Äôve reviewed multiple burzum albums. Wild take Mellon
Hi bro<br>As a Jew:<br>A. We don‚Äôt give a shit about Kanye‚Äôs opinions, And we love his music.<br>B. You, for a someone who is not dealing with severe mental issues, made far more damage to israel and Jews in the court of public opinion then Kanye ever did.<br>And yet again,<br>We don‚Äôt give a single fuck about your opinion<br>‚ù§Ô∏è<br>Mellon
review your divorce papers thenüôÑü§¶üèæ
didnt bro say like 5 years ago say that you can seperate an art from the artist? this guys just shit talking ye cuz of what he said, like yes its pretty messed up, but goddamn üíÄ
lol This guy could never pin point albums that raises the hip hop music bar.  Vultures is one of em. He is obviously blinded by Kanye&#39;s political stance..
Last video I‚Äôm watching from you brother!
Am i not allowed to just like his music?
‚úäüèª‚úäüèª‚úäüèª‚úäüèª
lol fantano too scared of backlash to do his job pu55yh0le
I think Fantano is mad Kanye blew up his minecraft village<br><br>He worked so hard on it and got mad wben Kanye blew it up
Llora pues we
Sotta koodhiyaane
cucktano lmaooooo
pulled up the album on Spotify &amp; the first song is a banger. this review is cap
ok but STARS is fire tho
This guy thinks he&#39;s bigger than what he is.<br>Review the album and give it a score.<br>Donkey.
Man never in my life i would‚Äôve thought i would give Anthony a big fat L, the day has come
So you‚Äôre saying you love it
yall not hearing him he lowkey spitting üò≠
Review starts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=306">5:06</a>
Album was fire. This review is trash
fantano sorry man you come as very intelligent but you are behind these days times are changing and you are stuck behind you ll realize it but you are not there yet
I could physically feel my testosterone levels seeping away with how soy this video is
Disliked
bro does not realize this is peak kanye
Those darn nihilistic teenagers and their crazy music!
It is reviewable - all your points could be part of a review
Absolute L take. Never been more disappointed. Rappers have done SOOOO much worse than Kanye and have still been separated form their music. If it was any other artist it would be a 10 album
Genosidethny supportano here
Theneedledrop: ü§ì‚òùÔ∏è
just get a new job atp
So you‚Äôre pretty fine rating Rapists and women abusers, But THIS! Wow it‚Äôs too far, huh?
if it was called The Vulture Store you wouldve given it a 10
Dude just shut up and review the album ‚Ä¶ nobody cares about your  thoughts about his political views
right wingers so mad rn
Thats wild my guy. Album is fire
if it was called &quot;The College Vultures 1&quot; you would&#39;ve given it a 10
mitada
Fantano is the epitome of twitter outrage culture unwilling to listen to an album because someone is cancelled when he was cancelled himself a few years ago bc of a hitpiece. So hypocritical.
Oh shut up. This album is fire. Stop being a snowflake.
I understand the points you make about Kanye‚Äôs followers being cult-like. However, I would like to point out that Taylor swift has been like this for years now, and takes $20+ million for political stunts like the Pfizer one at the superbowl. I definitely don‚Äôt agree with Kanye, but why do people make statements like this, and then totally miss the other trouble child?
You draw the line at this but have reviewed albums from people who‚Äôve murdered people, about murdering people üòê
I knew this guy wasn‚Äôt worth listening to years ago
Who‚Äôs here after vultures went #1 2 weeks üòä
Second week number one. And Vultures is actually a pretty good album too. It deserves a serious review. You have proven yourself incompetent, mister Fontano. Most of the reviewers have proven themselves incompetent. Hilarious
womp womp album number one for 2 weeks
i think he called bianca an ART reference
Anthony Fantano is a shipwreck of a music reviewing channel. Every single opinion I have ever seen him have is objectively the blindest swan dive into a music review I‚Äôve ever seen. He has no genuine analysis of any album he‚Äôs ever reviewed whatsoever, he just spews absolute braindead bullshit that he randomly thinks of on the spot. That being said I fall into category 2 of the Kanye West fans and this whole comment was a joke.
Why release a video of you yapping no one wants to hear that shit man
Great Album
&gt;search tnd<br>&gt;first result is soyjak<br>Accurate
Best song : PROMOTION
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=334">5:34</a> Fantano dgaf about dropping the n word
:/
Yall fear opinions now days.its not racist to point out the majority of 711s are owned by Indians.
If it was named  &quot;The Vultures Store&quot; it would of been a 10.
i keep saying that if kanye wasnt on this album at all it would be alright. he is sooo annoying
Clout chaser
Fantano you a LOSER
apart from the lyrics and some really boring songs, I think you can&#39;t directly throw to garbage an album that has songs as carnival, paid, talking or vultures e.g.
You sound like a Jew
Lol... Hypocritical, but ey, your entitled to your own opinion
I agree. I love ye but its bad. We need the old Kanye and Nicki.
Let&#39;s ban Fanta, Bayer and Volkswagen.
Dude just shave all that shit off your head lol, let it go!
I thought you reviewed music not people
if it was named &quot;Mm..Vultures&quot; you would&#39;ve given it a 7
On sight starts playing
Anthony why don&#39;t you do a review on the while Israel VS Palestine situation for a change. <br><br>Based on that people can decide if your rant about Ye is &quot; Yay ya&quot;
uh he didnt mercilessly harass kim its kinda the other way around and a ton of other rappers u review fucking murder people and thats worth reviewing still? and many other rappers disrespect women WAY more than kanye did here it blows my mind how u have such a selective mind for only kanye so weird.
Bro lost all my respect
Dude is salty because hes a Yew ahahahahahahahhaah<br><br>Cant review music because hes offended
pisam ti usta judenska
pisam ti usta judenska
Fantano on the wrong side of history here.  <br>The Needle Drop officially lost all credibility as they cannot seperate the music from the antics.<br><br>Might as well be YAHOO MUSIC reviews or some b.s.
Anthony gets generational of hate üòÇ from early 2000s to tiktokers
Leftists unable to decide whether they hate Jews and want to free Palestine, or they hate people who hate Jews
this new one is mid fr
Lol üòÇüòÇ
kanye is overrated as fuckkkkk, its not just about him being a nazi, but his music is not as good as its praised to be, its just your average shitty rap music
I think this is your best review yet. Really passionate.
Its no apathy, its life, got you talking and people&#39;s hearing the album.... <br><br>I dont even listen to ye but the album is üî• üëå
This Fantano dude isn&#39;t credible. Just another dude on the internet running his mouth and getting all up in his feelings.  This whole channel is irrelevant.
I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm a current Kanye fan, I haven‚Äôt liked his music since Jesus Is King. But if his music WAS good I wouldn‚Äôt give a shit about what he‚Äôs said.
Such a leftist üò™
just review the album legitimately, explain more on why you think it‚Äôs good or bad, that would be more better than this rant about Kanye.
If it was vultures see ghosts it would be a 10
making cash off an unreviewable review? hmm
Weeb
You analysis of albums for the past few months lack rhetorical criticism, features, production, and is essentially looking for your goldilocks album that is &quot;coherent&quot; and &quot;keeps a consistent narrative&quot;. I&#39;ll concede half the songs on this album are mid, but you can&#39;t ignore features from YG, Christ Brown, Gucci Maine, and others, and write off songs like CARNIVAL, BURN, &amp; BACK TO ME when they are pretty good (imho). Production alone on half the songs is fun. Yeah, kanye is unwell and has said some messed up stuff, but can you view this work as an opportunity to try and understand how someone goes from devoting their life to Christ to falling back to the &quot;old Kayne&quot; and convinces A-list artist to feature on this album. And to spend 6/7 minutes talking about him and not the work speaks to how you don&#39;t review albums anymore, or care about musical criticism, its all ad hominem and turning this account into a media/celebrity vlog.
Do a great chaos redux
this album is goated wdym it‚Äôs unreviewable
‚ÄúIf you say somebody got special needs, then why would you be watching them and holding them accountable like everybody else? Wouldn‚Äôt you grade them on a curve?‚Äù -Katt Williams; on Kanye West
Kanye feeds your kids lol
Saltiest Melon I‚Äôve ever seen
You can&#39;t review Music if you don&#39;t separate the Music from the Artist, otherwise your take on the music will always be faulty, if you don&#39;t like the Artist as a person, you don&#39;t like the music. <br>Then you are  not reviewing music at all, you are reflecting your opinion of the Artist and not the Music üé∂
Anthony is getting old , we can&#39;t even come for reviews no more
If it&#39;s unreviewable, then why bother reviewing it and monetizing the video?
I&#39;m sick of y&#39;all reviewers trynna be politically correct and pretend that the album at worst is a decent album.
Good intentions, but he could easily apply this logic to the murder, gangbanging, and racist shit on half of hip hop music but chooses not to. It&#39;s cherrypicking
Bro think he&#39;s on a mission
You triggered alot of snowflakes bald (((political))) man
But he kinda just reviewed it tho
Praises newer artists for experimental and edgy ventures but rips apart the older artists, minus a select personal favorites, who do the same thing? Yep, good old needledrop
Based now apply it to literally every other rap album and the people behind them.
You&#39;re completely wrong In your stance here, made me realise most of your reviews and ratings are complete bull shit.
why does fantano have the worst takesüò≠
its really not good even without talking about kanye as a human
Nerd
Your hair line is  unreviewable...
Didn‚Äôt you give Sexxy Redd album an 8 ü§®ü´µüèº
What a trash ass video.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=327">5:27</a> lol maybe you should be honest and tell us all you literally are just here to get paid. At least he‚Äôs honest! You said it, brother! This album is fantastic. Enjoy Vultures 2‚Ä¶ 3. 4 and 5.
I still love that Vultures Landscape cover from Caspar David Friedrich which I made my Essay about thist Romanticism style from 1800
Not people acting like this isn‚Äôt a review üòÇ finish the video dude, he did review it
I consistently see this Fantano guy get shit on for his takes
I get not wanting to support Ye or give him attention for the shit he&#39;s said/done over the last few years, but I don&#39;t understand how that makes this album &quot;unreviewable.&quot; I feel like, by the logic presented in this video, that Travis Scott&#39;s last album should be just as &quot;unreviewable.&quot; Dude is more or less directly responsible for the deaths of 10 people, as well as numerous other Astroworld attendees being seriously injured, gave the most half-assed apology for it, and yet you had no issue with giving Utopia a fair review. Yet this somehow crosses a line?
based
He looks like he would loose in any fight
number   1 on billboard without any of the people‚Äôs help that cry so much about what he said.  Kanye doesn&#39;t need  the creepy help of the investors anymore they all did nothing to help but leach money. What lazy idiots they think there gods gift to everything . Gods presents left them after they were freed from Egypt. The worshiped a golden cow after seeing with their own eyes the  god.
Do people care what this guy thinks because he‚Äôs only ever hit the radar when he mentioned Kanye
This guys mustache looks close to hitlers
Number 1 album
ü§ì
chop chop Insano Nitro Mega time
why bring politics anf personal things into music. Makes you look highly offended.
Bro this dude is yapping hard
Mental issues and production equipment. Incoherent üóëÔ∏è
This is the most views his channels has gotten in years. Of course he monetizes this ‚Äúserious‚Äù video as well. Literally just feeding off of Ye‚Äôs popularity.
He‚Äôs so angry that the albums doing well his hairline is running away
Wish we could see the amount of dislikes lol
What did any of this have to do with music?
Bro can rate rapists, women abusers, murderers, serialmurderers, but this is where he drew the line, lmao.
this is delusional, even more so than the giving swimming a 3, not even reviewing this because its so bad when u have a category of &#39;&#39;not good&#39;&#39; is just rtrded bro, unliked and unsubscribed, truly.
i don&#39;t understand the lyrics, i like the album
There‚Äôs still time to delete this ya know?
honestly this is the worst &quot;review&quot; ive ever seen<br>so disappointed in you
Why this dude posing like the American History X cover üò≠
Kanye actually trolled him at his bio in Apple Music
Dumbster fire but the man is one of the most influential and still listened to rappersüíÄüíÄ
U didn‚Äôt have this energy when justin bieber was making nigga jokes
Y‚Äôall also seem to forget Anthony‚Äôs sympathetic and compassionate ‚Äò 0/0 review‚Äô of no stars in of Donda 2 as the work of a ‚Äòpoor and tortured‚Äô Kanye going through his Kimvorce and kids
What‚Äôs wrong with this guy
If it was a duo project involving Kanye West it would‚Äôve gotten a 10
100% nailed. Kanye deserves no one‚Äôs attention. There is no place for bigotry anywhere.
üëÉüèª
Kanye fans are the lowest common denominator.  Should be avoided at all cost - live in their parents basement and will never amount to anything
Ima number 3  fan üéâüéâüéâüéâ we in capitalistic society ye is trolling his money in I think
If it was called the life vultures he would&#39;ve given it a 10
U suck
* won‚Äôt listen to ye because of ‚Äúantisemitism‚Äù * * is cool with drill rap*
It is a conundrum to be stating this‚Ä¶ but Kanye is the only questioning voice left in the West.<br>The only person asking, what is the reality of the situation that surrounds you?<br><br>Living in the West is the best‚Ä¶ of many very bad alternatives.<br>So to live in the ‚Äòbest of the worst‚Äô you have to first agree to complete political stagnation.<br>That the whims of the wealthy entrepreneurs and financiers are the only arbiters of societal change.<br><br>You can‚Äôt vote for a true left or rightwing party - it isn‚Äôt permitted.<br>You can‚Äôt vote for anything other than the choices you&#39;re given,<br>by those far wealthier than you.<br><br>You‚Äôre indoctrinated to hate socialism and fascism because they would bring about real change.<br>That isn‚Äôt permitted in the West. Change is not something that happens there. <br>A constant circus of new consumer goods and entertainment - yes. Real societal change - no.<br><br>Endless consumerism, is your societies only goal.<br>Nothing but a never-ending yesterday is sanctioned. <br>Any plans for the future betterment of society is a meaningless statement.<br><br>Therefore they‚Äôre no giant infrastructure projects, no mandates, <br>or plans for the general advancement of society.<br>The West is nothing but a huge entrepreneurial free-for-all. <br><br>Kanye is asking those that defend these Western values - where are your boundaries? <br>What lengths will you go to maintain their control - when you‚Äôre benefiting from it?<br><br>Those that consider themselves liberal or progressive are in fact gatekeepers, <br>for the West‚Äôs prison that is stagnant and putrefying. <br>Who in turn blame the &#39;conservative minded&#39; of their society of the same crime.<br>When both are as complicit as each other.<br><br>Those in control will never relinquish power - they like their world exactly as it is.<br>And you help them maintain it. You‚Äôre the prison guard to your own prison.<br>Anyone that draws attention to your hypocrisy is immediately targeted.<br><br>&quot;Hey, what new commercial goods have been released for me to buy this week - and is it any good?&quot;
Fantano a bigger Jew hater than Ye
Vultures 1 üôå
‚ù§ Ye
it is reviewable though, like this; fantano unimpressed expression, &quot;yeah, vultures, it&#39;s not good&quot; end vid. easy see.
This is why I don‚Äôt listen to this guy üòÇ  this album wasn‚Äôt the best but it‚Äôs good enough to review lmao
Anyone else read the artist bio for ¬•$ on Apple Music? Still trying to figure out if it‚Äôs legit lol
This dude reviewed varg like 3 times
This album is the equivalent of a murderer killing thousands of people, then saying it‚Äôs ok cos it makes a point about society.
Not everyone who listens to music pays attention to the lyrics or message it posits. Many people focus primarily on the sonic aspects, how it resonates with them, and how it makes them feel. There is plenty to be appreciated from instrumentals and the like on their own. Whether it be a lesser way to enjoy music or not is subjective, but that is how I usually choose to consume and enjoy my tunes. I only skimmed a few tracks and I&#39;m not here to defend the album, but based on the little I&#39;ve heard and seen, I understand that an LP such as this one may have songs that are too lyrically egregious to ignore the subjects completely and focus on only the sounds. Even so, given the focus of the majority of this video seems to be on the lyrics, I think the seeming assumption that it&#39;s impossible to listen to someone&#39;s music without caring about or even bothering to listen to what the artist is saying in the album is a flaw in your argument.
I&#39;ll give this level of hypocrisy a 9.5/10
Ye is the Richard Wagner of today!
Eh. Just don‚Äôt make this video, Anthony. You have the right to listen to and review what you want, but just let it be. Some of us just wanna listen to the music.
just want to say you did nothing wrong here
Cry about it
I know fantano is a human being with his own opinions, but I‚Äôm am absolutely flabbergasted at the fact that this man can give sexyy red an 8 but give vultures 1 an ‚Äúunreviewable‚Äù. This album is solid. It has some misses, but it‚Äôs a great album and it‚Äôs better than some of Kanye‚Äôs previous work. Vultures 1 is a 7/10 for me. I‚Äôm waiting for volume 2 and 3.
but if this was called ‚Äúhoods hottest vultures‚Äù you would have given it an 8
i love you fantano
ass rating likeeeeeeeee wth?
Perfect and well executed assessment of, not just the album, but the entire situation.
definitely not soft at all
kanye was right about israel
I hate society for giving guys like this confidence via a platform. The audacity to make an entire video virtue signaling instead of reviewing music is truly disapointing. Nobody thinks youre cool cause youre the guy with 2M subs who talks music, we just wanted a review, yet here you are planting your flag in the ground as if we care about whatever kanye said one time. America has freedom of speech, so you&#39;re allowed to say everything you said, but dont assume your audience is permanent or dedicated. You attract viewers, nobody considers themselves a &quot;Anthony Fantano fan&quot;, youre just a guy who people click on sometimes. And just like lil pump and all the soundcloud rappers which J Cole correctly predicted would become irrlevant, you my friend have the greatest chance of people forgetting you. Thankful I could press the dislike button on this one, along with 85k other people.
If the album was called to pimp a vulture this wouldve been a 10
L take. Objectively wrong. But I appreciate your enthusiasm.
Totally unbiased review starting off strong with with his personal life. Came for the album mate
Post post post-modern?
Review the music nerd. U talentless mustache man
Unsubscribed. YOU HATE BLACK CULTURE !!!!!!!!!!
Midtano
And let me get this straight <br>Its ok to insult black people white people lgbtq immigrants and any one else but the min you say something about jews you dont deserve to ever work again gtfoh
you couldnt review it and proceeded to review it.... üòÇüòÇüòÇ<br><br>Ok lets go.... The intellectual dishonesty... This album sonically is fire way better than donda as far as instrumentation in my opinion and feels more cohesive flows better and has more bangers <br><br>I do agree his rapping is ass but honestly weve never listened to kanye for his amazing penmanship
Dammit now I have to turn off BEG FORGIVENESS cause of this review Melon!
#1 one speaks for itself
If the album was exactly the same except the vocals were jpegmafia shitting the album would be a 10
clear example of someone who does not understand simplistic materials and art but rather engages in cruising the uncritiizible
Truly pathetic.
I bet he is Jewish
I understand why Anthony got divorced.
Melon really went from music review to sexyy red please let me smash
Kanye‚Äôs behavior is absolutely childish and immature. He‚Äôs a really fucked up guy, but most Kanye fans won‚Äôt defend him and just enjoy his music. Don‚Äôt bring down Kanye fans who enjoy the music and don‚Äôt agree with his opinions, because that‚Äôs most of his fanbase.
It&#39;s been 10 years and this man still can&#39;t get a square album cover on the wal properly
Review the music fam. We get he‚Äôs a weirdo we get he does dumb shit.   But it‚Äôs music.  And you do reviews of albums with non stop genocide bars so what‚Äôs the point ?
So if it was called Mr Morale and the Big Vultures 1 you would have given it a 8
need to edit out the first part.
unnecessary opinion. just review the music and move on. you got your views
if this was called &quot;vultures 1&quot; you would have called it unreviewable
You&#39;re proving Kanye&#39;s exact point &quot;Who&#39;s not entertained by my pain? Who ain&#39;t cash a check off my name?&quot; ...
Had to put this on 2x speed
I know this was gonna be a political take instead of an album review
Im a Kanye fan, but Anthony is totally right in this case, i didnt like this album, i enjoy it, but i dont like it
This review is about anything but the actual album and its songs.
Oh vey kvetch harder
you just mad you liked the album
Any music critic who can‚Äôt separate the music from the musician loses credibility &amp; shouldn‚Äôt be a music critic.
hater behavior
Surprisingly this is melons most watched video in a while lol. <br>Honestly if he reviewed wouldn&#39;t of getten a many views lol
This guy is insufferable.  Textbook gamma.
for me its kanyes verses they hilariously bad
Taking the stance that a grown man should be &quot;pissed off&quot; or &quot;triggered&quot; by the speech or actions of a total stranger<br>is exactly what I&#39;d expect someone that looks, sounds, and acts like this person to do.
youre so right on this its scary
Your arguments are idiotic. I&#39;m no Kanye fan but I do agree with many things that he says and I praise him for actually saying what he means and being direct instead of ass lickin and pondering like all the other modern artists. You keep talking about anti-semitism but so what? Hating on jews is nothing special, like literally more than half of the worlds dislikes jews so why would he apologize if he truly believes what he says?
Anthony your lame üòê why‚Äôs he saying offensive stuff üòß dumb ahh prolly listen to 21 üòê
Fantano is a gay Jew
just liking the music and flow and ignoring the lyrics has a similar vibe to early Tyler, the creator.... horrible take, i know.
im ngl he‚Äôs kinda right in this video and seeing him get so much hate for speaking the truth actually sucks
Im not going to review it trash‚Äôs it for 5 mins üòÇ
I understand why you did this, but the album was fire. Doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with him, and it‚Äôs fair to say listening to him is passive support for what ye has been saying. <br><br>I acknowledge the hypocrisy, but at the same time, the album was fire. And I can‚Äôt help myself, Kanye puts out fantastic music.
album of the year so far
If it waas called Them Crroked Vultures 1, you would&#39;ve said it&#39;s like The Eagles of death metal.<br>Also would&#39;ve given it a strong James Earl Jones to a light &quot;why is there James Earl Jones here&quot; tran
Why even mention his name. You are still bringing light to Ye... honestly do us a favor and just don&#39;t speak on him again. You just riding a wave and it&#39;s gross fam.
Too much estrogen in this video for my liking
NEVER REVIEW MUSIC EVER AGAIN üó£Ô∏è üî•
Reveal your dislikes playa
The numbers speak for themselves
After this video there‚Äôs no doubt that this dude is biased. LITERALLY taking lyrics out of context and pushing a leftist narrative about Ye. It‚Äôs ‚ÄúAFTER EVERYTHING SAID huh crazy - bi polar - anti semite - I‚Äôm still the king‚Äù <br>I guess that would‚Äôve made your argument weak.
I rate this video a light 3
Paid is about strippers, Ty is not talking from his own perspective when he‚Äôs singing ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just here to get paid‚Äù, it‚Äôs what the stripper the song is about is saying. You would think a music critic could at least determine the meaning of a song üòÇ
It‚Äôs just his opinion
nothing new here from melon, his opinion definitely doesn‚Äôt change the show cost
you seem to fall into group 3. hater üòÇ
Anthony is fatter than Kanye
Alt right rating rap music üòÇfoh
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=324">5:24</a> <br>Forced laugh
The album slaps, I don&#39;t know what the hell you&#39;re talking about. This feels like an ego-driven stunt to look like a good person.
Dude did you review the &quot;ye&quot; album after he said slavery was a choice? I bet that album wasn&#39;t &quot;unreviewable&quot;... foh with the selective fake outrage
Took a couple listens. It&#39;s good.
Hi Anthony, hope you are well, just checking in. <br><br>Thanks for the unsolicited dating advice you gave me earlier! It&#39;d help a lot, but beautiful, big-titty, butt-naked -women just don&#39;t fall out the sky, you know?
The hate is real ....
This has a sort of ‚Äúold man yells at the sky‚Äù feel to it when he starts talking about the actual tracks lol
fantano became a bleeding heart progressive after SLATER wrote one article about him being a &quot;nazi&quot; lol
Thoughts on Wagner?
This is hard to watch
Lib-Tard
His musical takes are actually on another league of stupid bc he just gave Yeat‚Äôs new trash a ‚Äúlight 8‚Äù when b4 he‚Äôs given MBDTF a 6 sooo u can‚Äôt trust a word this man says lmao
Fantano definitely a Isarel supporter
Great to not review it! Hats off to you Fantano. Ye should really disappear from the music scene. We don‚Äôt need him
Dumb haters love promoting shit they hate
Yeah i get it
üòÇ üò¢
This album is the embodiment of the meme<br><br>&quot;WTF is this shit?&quot;
Came for an exploration of the concept of reviews and music, not a regurgitation of normie ass perspectives containing no nuance.<br><br>Probably will be the last melon review I ever listen to, I&#39;ve evolved beyond the need to have him &quot;inform&quot; me.<br><br>(Thanks for nothing)
If it was called My Beautiful Dark Twisted Vultures you would have given it at least a 6
Coping Kanye Cultists

Mam you are got roasted harder than every single bald guy I know
Unwatchable
I don&#39;t understand why we&#39;ve now reached the morality part of music where you&#39;d call something unreviewable. The amount of people you&#39;ve talked about who are alleged or confirmed rapists, murderers and overall terrible people is appalling. It seems moreso like you personally can&#39;t ignore Kanye bc his public image is so grand and infects your own particular spaces. I don&#39;t think Kanye&#39;s anti Semitic comments can compare to a rapist or murderer. But if you just said &#39;This is annoying and these moronic anti semites coming out of the woodwork claiming conspiracy are vile and stupid. Oh and the music fucking sucks.&#39; I&#39;d have no complaint
Literally only focused on the bad parts didn‚Äôt even try to pick out some good
If this was called To Be Vultures 1 you would‚Äôve given it a 10
The Nihilistic teenager comment is the perfect representation of this comment section. I bet people criticizing him did not even watch the video, or if they did, they certainly did not think critically about anything he said
I know the comments under fantano&#39;s videos are always annoying but this time...jeez y&#39;all are insufferable
Past gold digger kanye has never released a good song. The new album is just like everything else he has made the only reason you don&#39;t like it is because he is a Nazi. Your reviews have never been about the work and have always been more influenced by how cool you think you look from the artists you like. Get a personality dude.
I like how he just rants for nearly 8 minutes, just shows how much Kanye has got into his skin
i only listen to old kanye music and i don&#39;t care about what he said or what people say about him. kanye always has a place next to the good rappers in the history.
Boooooo this guy stinks!!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=304">5:04</a> Review starts here
Get over yourself.
Kanye fans are just meet riders, the worst fanbase of hip hop and the worst thing to music industry, period
So you‚Äôre judging his album on his political views and not talent maybe this is not for you buddy just review the album
I&#39;m gonna touch you
if it was called ‚ÄùMr. Morale and the big Vultures‚Äù you would‚Äôve given it a 10
Pov: my special brother telling me that my music sucks
An honest rating of this album is a fucking 3 it‚Äôs just really that bad. Kanye has given us incredible music, but Kanye has died, he died with Kids see ghosts. Ye is now what we have and ye is just the worst. Not just musically but as a person. He‚Äôs gone from trying to get attention by doing outrageous shit to actually being a piece of garbage for the sake of being a piece of garbage.
JEW !
It took him <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=275">4:35</a> to start mentioning the album. <br><br>Terrible reviewer and you can see his personal hate for Kanye in this review
if it was called &quot;sgt. vulture lonely hearts club band&quot; you would give it a 6
You feel like you&#39;re being punked?  Dude you R being punked.  That&#39;s what&#39;s up.  Wow.  Just wow.
Wow you totally misunderstand &quot;reference&quot; in this context?  First of all it&#39;s a RHYME and he&#39;s a rapper so let&#39;s not get so wooden headed.  Second he&#39;s saying he has preferences in women and most of us have preferences or characteristics we are drawn to.  You&#39;re just assuming it&#39;s &quot;dehumanizing&quot; because you believe he&#39;s presenting her as &quot;dehumanized&quot;.  Which is not necessarily what is going on.  He&#39;s manipulating you into thinking and saying that and THAT, My Good Sir is the Actual Point he&#39;s making.  He&#39;s operating here on a very &quot;meta&quot; level.  Never seen you before but I hear you&#39;re very well loved as an arts critique.  Wonder what you make of the lyrics of Yellow Submarine.  Art is not literal and actually Ye uses the word &quot;reference&quot; as in &quot;referential&quot;.  Wow, sorry man you missed the boat by so far I&#39;m gonna have to put your viewers on alert here.  There is way more to life and art than this brick is offering.  It&#39;s Art, People!  It&#39;s Humor!  It&#39;s Irony!  It&#39;s this Big Opinion here being tweaked by an ARTIST.
the 4th kind: ppl tht jus like his music
You‚Äôre lucky the dislike button isn‚Äôt here, fentanyl

‚ÄúWho ain‚Äôt cashed a check off my name‚Äù<br>-ye

This is üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà-er than trans reading to kids
are you a jew anthony, are you, for gods yhwh name, we could exchange our fav rabi cards, start a grindcore band defiant prepuce
imo better than watch the throne, jik, and ye, and a little worse than tlop
unreviewable?! I didn&#39;t think it was that good?!
what are you talm bout<br>bvjhkghjkghjkhjkhjk
Hater
Wrong about Kanye. Typical white dude.
But if it was ‚Äúthe vulture store‚Äù it woulda been a strong ten‚Äù
people highkey sensitive af if they&#39;re really getting salty over this review
Womp womp nga, the album is fire
1.7m views and 85k likes is hilarious
Needle sounds rattled
Best Kanye joint since dbtf
corny
What about all the other albums you have reviewed that say terrible and obscene things?
I listened to it, pretty fire album
But fantano is anti Israel....pro Palestine....
Very funny considering a few years ago you told everybody that you would review any album no matter if somebody did anything wrong and here we are.
This man&#39;s opinions are so liberal he can&#39;t even state facts
Maybe rate the music next instead of the rapper&#39;s political views???
Don‚Äôt every review Kanye ever again your poor little feelings get in your way all bias aside this was a great project
BUT IF IT WAS CALLED ‚ÄúKids See Vultures‚Äù IT‚ÄôS ALBUM OF THE YEAR
If you did this for views you‚Äôre sick in the head. Give it a real review. Not watching anymore of your videos I‚Äôm sorry üò¢
How many Semitic languages are there ? AND WHAT COUNTRIES ARE THESE LANGUAGES SPOKEN. <br>You‚Äôre living a lie and your own fans see it - so attack the fans of this man because you‚Äôre so smart.
- Unreviewable<br>- <b>reviews</b>
pretentious soy
You&#39;re a special type of person for not understanding genius.
The boys and I dislike fantano. fantano is not welcomed to the Hispanic family reunion nor the block party cook out. fantano you suck frfr. I haven&#39;t listened to the album, we still dislike fantano. Lower case f cause you aren&#39;t even human fantano. you are an inanimate object with no significance
Hypocrite
Man sorry but you lost me as a subscriber! First I believed you then I listened to the album! Is waaaay better than I expected to be fair! I understand you are Jewish and guess what I‚Äôm a Jew also but I simply don‚Äôt care about his antisemitism. I‚Äôm used to hate! You know how it was always for us. But from that to saying that this album is the worst crap ever is not fair! You gave an amazing review and praises to that chick Dorian Electra when came out and let‚Äôs face it is crap. Just because she jumped on that trans crap is not making it cool! And while this album is cool as hell you said is the worse just because West is an antisemite. Man the guy is either mentally ill or an attention whore! Looks like is working for him! I like the album and I my trust in you. Shalom!
Not the entire cult of kanye spamming your comment section <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/NvgfY9aeC_OFvOMPkrOAsAM"></a>
This dude gotta be the fakest hip hop fan I seen. He said he can‚Äôt review the album bc it has bad lyrics in it that aren‚Äôt normal üòÇ
I will forever die on the hill that Donda and Donda 2 were flaming piles of garbage.
if this album was called &quot;The Vultures Store 1&quot; you would have given it a 10
Gayyyyyy
It‚Äôs an album review, not a controversy review. Learn how to remove the art from the artist, otherwise you just have no credibility.
He just doesn‚Äôt like Kanye personally and we all know Fantano uses ulterior motives and biases when reviewing music, so he is not even close to credible. He literally started the video with the controversies of Kanye, so he already had his mind made up from the get-go.
atleast now we know americans worship jews more than black people
Anthony Cornball
Bianca have insecurities and she posted her body naked thought that was sexy. She gonna post more Xxx videos.
Bro said the n word
Fun fact: This video has more dislikes than the original MBDTF review
I just think his music is enjoyable, I think he‚Äôs a bit of an odd man but as an artist he‚Äôs great
The album is amazing. In my opinion.
Not a Kanye fan in the slightest but him saying that he thinks the Jews run everything is not anti-Semitic I don‚Äôt care antisemitism would be him saying that we need to get rid of Jews because he hates them I don‚Äôt understand why everybody thinks that that is anti-Semitic
how many artists have killed people, abused people, sold drugs, and reviewers review their albums no problem.  kanye says some shit that you dont agree with and he is blacklisted by everyone lol...
Remember he said he would never buy from Balenciaga again and then he went in there with his wife like a month later. Weird behaviour. People think he‚Äôs now a clone or something anyway so his whole personality is just under review due to what‚Äôs happened
Yet you‚Äôll review rappers albums who have literally killed people and contributed to drug overdoses üòÇ clown
SMD
i think im a racist anti-Semitic edgy nazi for liking the new kanye album
You a hypocrite reviewing all our gangsta music knowing the type of resume these niggas be having but you can‚Äôt separate a rappers political views? Even if you disagree?
‚ÄúSeparate the art from the artists‚Äù‚Ä¶ like to see them say that when presented with a literal hitler painting
so i guess you didnt like the album
How are people in the comments defending this album. It is straight ass. Politics excluded. His lyrics are so cringe for some 50 year old bipolar man
I dont care about Kanye, but Anthony acts like other rappers don&#39;t do this exact thing. DaBaby legit murdered people and talks about it all the time in his raps. I get that some of the songs on this album aren&#39;t good, but I feel like Andrew is just taking this stance because Kanye is getting a lot of media attention. I guess I expected better from Andrew...
womp womp
fantano has consistently added more and more social media brain rot to his content.
dawg the lyrics are meaningless and blasphemous and the album cover is poopoo is the only good critique bro. :)
If the whole album was like back to me I would‚Äôve loved it
People love oversimplifying complicated situations to avoid holding any responsibility. The Ye debate at this point is about human questions, he answers them through his supposed opinion on the project, but he was clearly never willing to like it, and he is clearly offended on a personal level. This is just empty virtue signaling.
Lazy Journalism
fantano just is beijg part of the WOKE angenda and want views, surely he is listening VULTURES right now, shit is fire
this guy will listen to a rapper rapping about killing kids in a drive by and give it a 7 and when you call him in on it he&#39;ll call you a racist and ignorant bigot
The people saying to separate the art from the artist remind me of that one Key &amp; Peele skit where he‚Äôs singing racist country songs
Isn‚Äôt this a music review channel? Came here for a review and left feeling more like i watched an episode of the Daily Wire.
Another paid review
Bro when did he become a games journalist sad
As an unbiased listener, I enjoyed the album.
if anyone is wondering this video is 50/50 likes dislikes - regardless of your view - inserting politics into only very specific reviews is just super fucking lame and ovvious no matter how you look at it. you rightfully lost a shit ton of lifelong fans with your recent whiny bullshit. not even just kanye. ur just thiin skinned and emotional when trying to present things as objective. c ya
i honestly just really dont like u and never have ur so insufferable and annoying
It&#39;s crazy how saying &quot;I won&#39;t review this guy because he&#39;s a Nazi&quot; is a controversial statement
I legit dont like this album but i feel cuckboy just sat there with his arms crossed listening barely
100% the worst music critic on any platform. I&#39;m not even a Kanye fan but saying music is not even reviwable is such a degenerate thing to say.
None of those lyrics are racist. Your bad faith argument got you quite a few views, though, so well done üéâ
Went to number 1 baby‚Ä¶. Even after all the Jewish supremest tried to stop him
as an Israeli jew im surprised and emotional at once, ty Matthew, god bless you
ü§°
literally only good song and I mean GOOD was BURN. Where tf are his ghostwriters making something like this??? Just make a WHOLE ALBUM like that.
Your greatest review, Melon.
Don&#39;t care, didnt ask, plus dominique said she loves the album.
This is the dude that got scared by an article üíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ
If he was white u would&#39;ve loved him
This sucks, and fantano sucks.
The dreaded hipster god yet leads a new generation of smooth brain dweebs into bad musif taste
Albums like this don&#39;t just fall outta the sky you know?
This unironically may be your best review
So I&#39;m either a nihilistic teenager or cult member for not hating the album? You know that&#39;s just my opinion, right?
I dont think in our brave new world, u can separate the art from the artist. The art is the artist, its the cult of personality, its his image, his image being mediated through our global village, its the spectacle and all that is representational about the man channeled through his work. Especially with popular culture music, the music&#39;s impact is noticeably weak without the context of the artist and the interaction with the environment like kanye.
Bugging cause ye referenced a mbdtf bar
ur not a political figure big bro ur allowed to review the music mr man. We are not here to listen to ur views on Ye or any of the music industry we just want to see if u fw it or not. Shits hard af either way
Loser
You suposed to review the ALBUM, not the ARTIST, <br>A$$H0l3
If it was TEAM EFFORT or PUPPY by BROCKHAMPTON he would&#39;ve given it an 8.
Nahhh it‚Äôs good
Not based.
This is such low bar content
If it was called &quot;Vultures 1&quot; you would&#39;ve given it an unreviewable
ty, im from germany and antisemtic shit spreads soooo fast from the smallest things. We cant let that happen again and its very scary to see how people dont care. It has very very much real consequences and much more impact than you think at first. Trust me
I thought you were a music reviewer, not a political view reviewer
Why wasn&#39;t Fantano this offended when Kanye said George Bush doesn&#39;t care about black people. The anti-Semitism seems to have really got to him
The dude who got famous from 4chan culture turning into a massive SJW is such a hilarous character arch.
imma be honest there are 3 songs i like . 1 good (don‚Äôt die) iykyküò¢. 2 BURN. there were some sketchy lyrics but i some how love the flow of the songs honestly. 3 DO IT i was surprised when i heard Nipsey man i wish he was here‚Ä¶ yg made the song more lit ill be honest. $ be carrying some of kanye songs because of his singing performance. and Kanye some good and weird lyrics. everything honestly i don‚Äôt get how people like it ESPECIALLY carnival. i love kanye and i pray he actually find god ‚ù§
Bro loves to hate , It&#39;s a fucking banging album. I know Ye has said some awfull things and he kinda speaks a bit of the topic on the album. But it&#39;s has so much good production and Ty Dolla Sign has some amazing vocals on the album. It all around is an amazing album so just listend to it and don&#39;t care about what he says outside of music.
We didn‚Äôt need your opinion anyways bozo
oh, needle drop is just a big lefty. I urge everyone here to give this release a chance. its so based and so is kanye. i agree with his political views strongly and this just makes the music better.
Shut‚ù§
I love how the green screen is broken in this one, really adds to the atmosphere
bro stop yapping, youre supposed to review the music not the individual. he is a musical genuis undeniable, as a person i can understand why ppl wouldnt like him. but youre supposed to be reviewing the damn album nobody gives a damn about your opinion on him as a person
This review is unreviewable to me.
Bro who let this guy cook?üó£Ô∏èüóëÔ∏èüóëÔ∏èüóëÔ∏èüóëÔ∏èüóëÔ∏è
Dude. I know. Ur actually a jew. I can always tell.
I didn&#39;t even know Kanye dropped while surprised by the review thinking this was clear bias, so I listened to the album. This is the same feeling I had with revival.
The song Feedback is directed at people like Melon
This guy is insufferable. holy hell man
burn is pretty decent tho
Since when does a review of music have so much to do with your interpretation of artist&#39;s opinions or what he has said? Fantano u just lost a sub for not actually reviewing music, but spreading your opinion about Ye, really spreading the narrative mainstream media spews
SHUT UPPPPPPPPPPP
It‚Äôs at least a 4 I reckon, the beats are pretty good
thanxyu fantano !
If it was called Sexxy Vultures he‚Äôd give it a 8
whatever you say, but the album is actually straight garbage
i dont like this guy
We get it bro you are obviously a tiny hat puppet
Gayest video since he cried about being wrong about mac miller
but carnival is hard tho right?
rate your divorce
Love the pussified deleting of comments!
I‚Äôve wrote the entire subtitles of this video for deaf people so they can understand this ‚Äònot revieuw‚Äô: ‚Äòü§ìü§ì‚Äô
Great video
RHTHJE THIS VIDEO IS MAKING ME MAD
Friendly reminder that not making this video at all instead of putting up a 7 minutes review talking about how this album is not reviewable was a sensible option
Seperate ART from ARTIST
YOU LOSER
Womp womp
We would be happy to see You perform about our new single Selling Lies!
Kanye hurt your feelings and it shows. I don‚Äôt fall into any of the 3 categories you placed his fans in. I‚Äôd be willing to discuss the topic with you, but it sounds like you‚Äôve written off his fans entirely based on your online back-and-forths. Not all music is for everyone. Hoodrat is a banger. The music is overall better than most of the crap that drops these days, and you clearly gave biased feedback based on his actions of late!
You could have just not made any video at all. But you had to make a video explaining why you won‚Äôt review it, so you don‚Äôt lose the views you would have gotten on a Kanye review. Kanye does and says stupid shit to get attention and listens. You‚Äôre not that different because you‚Äôre taking advantage of Kanye‚Äôs controversy to get clicks and views. Ironic
All these people do is cry and complain no wonder the suicide rate is so high.
The internet is full of talentless people critiquing talented people.<br><br>Let that sink in
But yeat gets an 8
and heres the yapper
Sooooo you can review Tom Macdonalds racist, homophobic music but not this because it affects a white subgroup and clearly hit a nerve for you? Hmmmmm interesting. If you‚Äôre gonna be the moral police you gotta do it all the way sir.
I wonder if melon will keep the same energy around misogyny in hip hop...he&#39;s championed countless extremely sexist artists in the past
Go touch grass Fantano
Imagine taking advice from someone who thinks that tash is the one to move forward in life with. His public image isn&#39;t tarnished regardless of what narrative u jew man try push. His views and money made from basic commercial proves that. I&#39;m 4 minutes in and you&#39;re talking about everything but his album. The personal bias you put on anyone that doesnt push your twisted narrative and youre talking about not being able to have level headed discussions? Lol Triggered much
just came back here cause people gave you so much shit in reactions that i felt i wanted to leave something positive. i think antisemitism gets downplayed, in general and especially in US Hip Hop. It has always been an issue, from the beginning, and its not &quot;good&quot; that you criticize kanye, its the ONLY sensible thing to do. antisemites should get called out and not get a pass. especially after kanye acted like fighting discrimination is also important to him. i think your review is 100% accurate.
cringe
Bald
I actually liked this album a lot
Dislike‚Äô
Wake up kids, Vulture thing is pure garbage
Wtf, i just like the music? F**k you for insulting my personality for that!
Composition wise, one of the best albums in the last decade. Completely new style off the 808 beaten path. Nobody makes better art than someone who is completely out of their mind lol
This comment section is delirious what is wrong with all of you
i came here for a review of the album, i found a hating loser with a bias
The kanye meat riding is crazy
Carnival had some of my favourite production I&#39;ve ever heard and goes so well with the music video
it&#39;s just music dude
i agree with everything he‚Äôs saying, but why didn‚Äôt he review The Smiths like this üò≠
&quot;Crazy,BiPolar, antisemite &amp; Im still the King&quot;üòéüêê
Translation: the album is fire but I&#39;m a hater!<br><br>üñïüèøüñïüèæüñïüèΩüñïüèº
be honest, you take selfies with your mouth open?
you literally could have thrown out all these political views of yours out the window and putting perspective differences aside and reviewed the actual art.
Kanye needed to call this album the vultures store for it to be reviewed
hiter
Your just biased you penny pincher
Bro why do u even review rap music ? U clearly have no taste in nothing but weird ass music ü§£
If this was called &quot;vultures 1&quot; he would have given it unreviewable
If the album was named &quot;call vultures if you get lost&quot; It would&#39;ve gotten a 10
Yeah theres a few, lets be honest, shitty tracks, but theres plenty to enjoy for me. 11 melons out of 10
Okay jew
in ur &#39;music review&#39; not a single word was really said about music
Album is amazing,  he is the most creative force in hip hop . He&#39;s not racist,  we live in a day where you can&#39;t say truth if it hurts someone&#39;s feelings.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=423">7:03</a> minutes complaining is crazy
Some of these comments are hilarious üòÇ
Bro reviewed music from convinced murderers but kanye says an opinion that we dont agree with and is cancelled?????
NOTHING HE SAID WAS FALSE üíØüó£ AND WE THE CULTURE ARE SUPPORTING OUR OWN WE MADE YOU
Social media is built mainly for the leftist population, if you are a creator on these platforms it would be smart for you to pander to that audience netting you a larger fanbase. Fantano is a shining example of that. Art imo is to be embraced as a reflection of humanity, ugly and good. good and ugly.
review the music not the person
You lost your credibility a long time ago, I&#39;m glad the majority of people are recognizing that now because this video really showed everybody the type of person you are
This album is good. Fantano is emotional, saying unreviewable and the whining about everything he disagrees about this was pretty cringy. What a mess
Ur a trash reviewer smh
Ur miss using the lyrics everyone can tell when he said ‚Äúcrazy bipolar antisemite ‚Äú he is referring to people like you who label him as such
dikkthony headtano here
Unsubbed
He rocks Burzum Tee&#39;s, they&#39;re a freeking Nazi band.
I think everything you said besides your takes on the music is for the most part correct. He said antisemitic things, and you‚Äôre right, his image will never be fully repaired, although I believe as time goes on people will forget about it (whether that‚Äôs a good thing or bad thing). That being said, I think either you just don‚Äôt get this new style of trap that‚Äôs coming along, or you‚Äôre lying about how you feel about the album or‚Ä¶ your brain is too focused on Kanye the person to actively listen or enjoy Vultures for what it is. You only mentioned 2 songs, and ignored everything else. How about the production? Sound design? Beautiful flows and features? I mean this is Kanye‚Äôs most creative and groundbreaking album he‚Äôs made. All i mean is I think fantano pre hitler Kanye would think differently of vultures.
Youre smoking dick that album is fucking fire lmao. Who gives a fuck about the scandals he causes üòÇ
review scrapyardüò©
Think the jews deserve whatever is coming to them lol
Bro it‚Äôs funny ur reviews used to be just so good but then this happened. You let ur biases get the best of you. You always boast about how objective you are when it comes to rating albums. Ur just still trying to live the glory days. U can still live the glory days if u stop preaching and start following what u urself is saying. So sad to see somebody fall so far in something I care so much abt :/. What a disappointment.
I&#39;m not in the cult, but just might join. No one in this industry is better than Ye.<br><br>great &quot;review&quot;, pewdiepie
If it was called ‚Äúkids see vultures‚Äù it would be be a 10
I dont wanna hear kanye on any of those songs.
Kinda weird how you‚Äôre so mad on behalf of Jewish people (corny af btw and I‚Äôm Jewish) yet you‚Äôre actively donating money to Hamas, a terrorist organization killing Jewish children. Make it make sense.
so u dont wanna review vultures because itll offend ur jewish fans but youll gladly react to king vons music and u dont think about how his victims would feel? akright then
If a bunch of teal colored people took advantage of you, stole from you, or bullied you for an extended amount of time you would develop some resentment towards them. It‚Äôs wrong that humans are like that but it‚Äôs not uncommon or not understandable. It really feels like you are just trying to protect your image and your platform and that is understandable as well.  Fyi I‚Äôm not the biggest Kanye fan by any means. My music taste has expanded over the years and I‚Äôve just recently become a fan. I used to think Kanye made music for ‚Äúweirdos‚Äù üòÇ so don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a Kanye Stan
Typical pandering liberal take. 0/10
So many artists albums that you‚Äôve reviewed have lyrics about killing people, disrespecting multiple women, drug abuse, satanic messages and other very negative messages‚Ä¶are they better than Kanye‚Äôs antisemitic lyrics? They are not. Am not supporting his antisemitic views by any means. He‚Äôs using music to express his experiences and feeling. We‚Äôve all experienced certain events and emotions that are strong and maybe negative that we look back and realize we were wrong for. The production was great, Ty did his best work on this album the features did their job to add value to this album. You are giving very biased reviews. R Kelly is a terrible person who has done many horrible wrongs, most definitely more than the public knows but he still has great music. Good music is good music. You are a major Kanye haterüòÇ hating someone makes you just as bad as them‚Ä¶
Whoever let homeboy out the crib looking like this definitely grooms children
Barber: what style you getting today?<br><br>-‚Äúlemme get the ice cream man‚Äù
Bro got on the ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt touch kids they touch me‚Äù fit
Dude looks like he drives white vans, and judges little kids choices in their favorite candy
he gave it a light 7 by the way
How do you keep channels from showing up on you feed? This is one of them I don&#39;t want to see again
kanye is a gemini
This video  is a ‚ÄúNo‚Äù for me.
Personally, its my favorite Ye album. Great stuff!
Aight, play Off The Grid.
This guy just got the biggest side eye on the internet üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Ha! Fantano profits off this. He leverages internet drama for his content and exploits others to fuel his own ambition and careerism. There are no heroes and villains. In fact, there are artists who have done way worse than Kanye who you don&#39;t examine through a moral lens. It&#39;s incredibly fake and irresponsible to selectively use morality to bully certain types of people.
terrible take, report on the music separate the art from the artist like we did with everytone else
Im gay
‚òùü§ì
I feel like nobody talks abt the fact that hoodrat woulda been 1 of if not the best song on the album if it weren&#39;t for that stupid ass sample, the vocal performances from kanye and Ty are amazing and the beats actually beautiful when that sample isn&#39;t being constantly bashed in your ears
If it was called ‚ÄúOK Vultures‚Äù it would get a 10.
Thanks for the rant. Now back to bumping this album
danm this video is like your divorce, hard to see
ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°
BOOO
Karen Fantano wants to talk to ye&#39;s manager.
Type 4.  People who legit cant stand Kanye sometimes but know he was always this way. Who at the same time recognize that he is the architect of modern S-Tier production.  This album is actually pretty good and i didnt want to like it. I can see why he said a finished Donda. I can see that but i liked  Donnda too
Soo many butthurt Kanye worshipers lol
you are to old for reviewing
Why don‚Äôt you just shut up and review the album like you‚Äôre supposed to and known for. No one here gives a fuck about your political views or what you think is right or wrong. You should‚Äôve based your channel off that If that‚Äôs the route you wanted to take. Fat L. Pick me ass
This guy wouldn&#39;t vote for trump because of his personality...but also voted for biden.....who has the personality of a lobotomized Hampster.<br>&quot;Yeah I cant review the music cause I dont like the artists opinions&quot;<br>Vincent van Gogh was insane, but them paintings are fire....at least kanye still has both ears.
ü§ì‚òùüèª
Anthony Fantano gives off big redditor energy ü§ì
YOU REVIEW FUCKING MUSIC NOT PEOPLE
Shill
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=260">4:20</a><br>Can someone tell me which of these lyrics were antisemitic?<br><br> Made in poor taste? Yes<br>Bad attempts at a joke? Yes<br>But nothing more.
Bro always eat off Ye L review and we number 1 right now          Gotcha
He got a point in the most things that he said , but he is no neutral, he is kinda hater for what he said of Jesus is king , he is mad.
Kanye is better than you so cry
Y‚Äôall he‚Äôs gone. You don‚Äôt have to keep defending him. He‚Äôs not the same Ye anymore
This guy didn‚Äôt even rate the album just yapped
The best album he&#39;s made in a very long time üíØ
if it was called when i do not dude why but like its whatevr so henry ford vs karl marx anyways üòúüòù<a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/hcMfY5_zAbbxvwKLooCoCA"></a>
ok so you are a bot. when you walk around you sometimes spark. you say beeboo bee booo beep beep. you lookup to WALL E.
Anthony, do you know what TND means? Kind of racist to talk about black people in this way, don&#39;t you think?
Hahahahahahahahahhahahahahahaha
First Dislike I‚Äôve given a video in a long time
Bro has like 100k dislikes on this üíÄ
what did you rate your divorce
Types of kanye fans 4. Still listen to his  old stuff but feel like shit for doing it üëá<br>Aka me
There was no point in making this video you essentially are still using him to benefit yourself and I don‚Äôt fault you for this by any means get your money But idk just seems weird I would of respected it more if it was just a tweet a 7min video just seems a bit much you could of just reviewed the album
Donda wasn&#39;t unreviewable? It&#39;s mostly rambling and noise.
Why didn&#39;t Fantano talk like this when he reviewed Burzum: antisemite, Eminem: talked about graping his mom, Rick Ross: talked about spiking a drink and giving it to a girl. Why are you so nihilistic fantano, don&#39;t you that theeese thiings have greater consequences.
Get out your feelings
What‚Äôd you rate your divorce?
This guy is complete unreviewable trash.
Anthony you should watch Europa: The Last Battle to up your T levels
Unreviewable... <br>Proceeds to review it
He just hating for no reason
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=256">4:16</a> EMINEM DOES THE SAME SHIT
Y‚Äôall act like Kanye killed someone, so sensitive üòÇ
Kanye was right, and that&#39;s why you hate on him. You can&#39;t have truth threaten the status quo. You have to defend this rotten system because it benefits you.
Fantnano when lil nas x makes a mockery of Christianity: <br><br>‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not necessarily saying anything bad or rude about it.‚Äù<br><br>Fantano when Kanye says he employs Jews:<br><br>‚ÄúuNreviEwAble‚Äù
You didn‚Äôt even comment on the beats and production or nothin
Can&#39;t wait for unreviewable 2 in March
I can tell you follow the mainstream way of thinking it‚Äôs laughable Jews took that title from the real ones who is really dark complexion do ya real research
&quot;cant separate the artist from the music&quot;  but 21 raps about murder
bald man rant
Holy yap üò≠üò≠üôèüèΩ album is fire
If it was sexxy westt you would‚Äôve given a higher score :(
the jay and silent bob reference was hilarious - you are a hater bro - which is acceptable in this day and age - yaa were delusional because we have our own opinions - i like about 4 or 5 tracks on the album hope thats alright with you sir
The irony of calling kanye a misogynist and at the same time referring to bianca as &quot;a naked body without a personality or opinion&quot;üòÇ
just  hating
Nice of you to include and cherry pick 4 songs of the entire album
7 mins of yapping no review, i want my time back &lt;/3
I share Kanye&#39;s beliefs and bro just called me hateful lol (even tho one of his beliefs is to love everybody). Also funny how you rated albums of actual murderers but refused to rate this one just because you think kanye is antisemitic
This guy is a clown. He cares more about hating Kanye than actually staying unbiased reviewing music. He is clearly so pressed and triggered by Kanye, even though his Kanye reviews made him any bit successful. Leader of the clowns right here ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=324">5:24</a> if you wanna have Nightmares
nahhh going OUT OF YOUR WAY to say people who are not mentally a toddler and can separate art/artist, are &quot;ignorant&quot; for being able to observe MORE than you can, is just straight up incorrect, this is gonna be one of those life lessons where you come back and say &quot;lol woops sorry guys&quot; because there aint no way youre actually thinking in this elementary school train of thought
Certified fed review
&quot;you cannot separate this crap from the music&quot; <br>bro admitted to being mentally incapable of separating the music from the artist, video should have ended right there üíÄ
Kanye was right
bro cannot separate the music from the artist as a REVIEWER that is just insane üíÄüíÄüíÄ
Can i not just listen to bros music?
I‚Äôm not a nihilist obsessed fan or agree I just like his music bro üò≠üò≠
It wasn‚Äôt a great album, but there was still some decent tracks
this clown doesn‚Äôt talk about the actual music until 5 mins into a 7 min video. i‚Äôm a jew and i love Vultures, i think it‚Äôs very creative and refreshing. don‚Äôt know how anyone could watch this ‚Äúmusic reviewer‚Äù again. boo hoo u don‚Äôt like kanye‚Äôs personality, get over it, go cry to your mom not the people who come to receive a fair and genuine review of the album. embarrassing
Fantano has completely lost it. It&#39;s hasn&#39;t been about the music for him in years
Not a drop of testosterone in this man.
Im number 2
If it was called ‚Äúthe vultures store‚Äù he‚Äôd be giving a 11
Honestly I don‚Äôt know why people still give him power to still review, he can‚Äôt review for shit, my fucking dog can do better
Just like you don&#39;t want to hear anything good from Him ever.
Review the album Fantano? <br><br>Guess what fantano, SO MANY OTHER ARTISTS DONTHIS AND YOU DONT CARE ABOUT THAT.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=120">2:00</a> you forgot to mention the people that just simply like the music.

Horrible person is definitely a stretch. If you actually listen to what Kanye says regarding Jews it‚Äôs not as bad as it‚Äôs being portrayed by the media. It may not be politically correct by any means and is quite easy to take offense to. He says a lot of truths no one wants to admit. Including the fact that you can‚Äôt even question industries where there are a large amount of us in‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt get it. As a ethnic Jew‚Ä¶ you can‚Äôt deny there has been a lot of issues with blacks and Jews that have a lot of systematic racist history. Especially Orthodox Jews who as part of their religion more or less believe they are better than everyone (the chosen people) which is the definition of racism. <br><br>It‚Äôs easy for this white guy to call Kanye a horrible person when his people have been through so much. Unless one is black we can understand that. Instead of trying to understand and have a conversation we sweep it under the rug. Enough is enough.
hahahahahahah! ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ &quot;They&quot; sooo MAD! The harder they try the bigger he gets!ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
So you‚Äôre not gonna talk about the album but make a video anyway? Cringe nonsense it damages your reputation as a reviewer. Either review it while acknowledging your bias or don‚Äôt review it at all. I wasn‚Äôt a fan of the album either but I‚Äôm not making review videos selling bottled air for 7minutes.
What about the ‚Äúfans‚Äù that like his music but hate his behavior?? üò¢
Hey Anthony just because you broke down and groveled at the feet of bored mentally ill journalists and twitter losers don&#39;t mean other people have to do the same to keep their careers
Weak mental.
based fantano
Soffftttttt
That&#39;s why it&#39;s number one in like 17 countries for week, cause it&#39;s trash üòÖ
The melons just offended by the &quot;misogynistic&quot; lyrics because he¬¥s finally about to transition from a music reviewer into a lesbian
Idk why people keep saying he said he likes Hitler , he never said that nor did he say he hated Jews .
@theneedledrop I do not support current Kanye and can understand why people will not listen to his music. That being I feel that a lot of this review applies to other artists as Kanye isn&#39;t the only one being off the cuff, he&#39;s just been pretty loud throughout. And this idea about not supporting Kanye and his work goes against what you did here... which you are ultimate promoting his work (all news is good news). As well as the fact that in the past, you&#39;ve promoted other albums that say egregious things diving into lyrics and meaning. Seems like you are no better than Ty Dolla $ign who you made fun of for saying &quot;I&#39;m just here to get paid&quot; - even though his name indicates he&#39;s all about the money. You though seem to think you are above it all since you made this video knowing it would get clicks (attention, people talking about you which is really what you love), I mean look at your thumbnail for the video... You knew exactly what you were doing.
So we all now know this guy knows absolutely nothing about hip hop right? Like he just showed us? Because he just gave YEAT an 8/10 but apparently this album is &quot;unreviewable?&quot; He doesn&#39;t know shit about hip hop, his opinion is his own, but it&#39;s rooted in not knowing shit lmfao.
Every part of this video screams attention. If the album is really unreviewable why are you making a 8 minute video about it? And then reviewing the album WHATS THE POINT OF THAT? MONEY? VIEWS?
Mans got eat his words in a few months
It‚Äôs art homie, don‚Äôt take it too seriously
I feel bad for you
I feel bad for you
In terms of stuff I just wanna listen to in the car his new stuff isn‚Äôt hitting 4 me
Dude took the bait lol. The real question is whether fighting &#39;cancel culture&#39; is a hill worth dying on
YE can be whatever the fuck he wants to be.
unreviewable
The problem isn‚Äôt that you hate the statements Kanye‚Äôs made on some songs. The problem is when your hate for Kanye‚Äôs politics bleeds into other songs that have nothing to do with that. Like how clearly you were trying your hardest to dislike Burn, which if you weren‚Äôt in your Kanye-hating era you would for sure call it a highlight from the album
if it was kanye red you would give 8
Fantano, you‚Äôre genuinely a terrible content creator. You lose credibility every time you put ur political views and hypocrisies before the music, and hopefully people will soon get past your review and lose all respect for you as a serious reviewer.
you are a clown bro like fr
Bro why are you reviewing the antics and his outside life? Naked body no personality or voice? Bro you lackin with this whole video <br><br>You‚Äôre just scared to talk about the songs lol don‚Äôt make it deeper than it is mate just chill <br><br>You‚Äôve biased you‚Äôre life on reviewing others people music which by the look of you if you would have mad any time of album it could be ambient you‚Äôd give it a 0 <br><br>Bro I‚Äôm with your outside music Kanye be tripping but now you‚Äôre tripping what do you mean somehow good you‚Äôre talking about the music not his political stances to be honest this just discredits all of your other reviews
quit yapping divorced fella
Kinda lame take, but whatever
If their names were Sexyy West and Lil Dolla Sign the album would‚Äôve gotten a 8
Lost your hairline over this album
This is why your wife divorced you
If you refuse to review an album due to your moral high-horse towards Kanye, sure. But why post a video like this?? review the art or don&#39;t, we aren&#39;t here for your politically inconsistent hot takes on the morality of musicians. We want to talk about music.
This review is going to age like fucking dogshit. This felt like prime 2010-2016 Kanye but with a new age twist. I mean listen to the ending of Vultures and the insane buildup to that orchestral moment. Or what he speaks about on Beg Forgiveness. Or the fact that we hear such a lighthearted North on a track with her father after years of us watching their life unfold in the public eye, it makes such a simple song so beautiful knowing the context. And on the opposite end you have this groovy, summer tune BURN. Then the fucking flamethrower that is Carnival. And then with the ending KING. The egotistical larger than life persona is back. And the way I see it, he uses Ty Dolla as a vocal instrument as an extension to his repertoire, which $ does with full passion. <br><br>I‚Äôm honestly tired of reviewers and critics trying to make any sort of opinion on something that needs multiple listens over time to fully unpack.
reviens en Fantano
Yes melon, millions of people who listen to Kanye all fit into one of three categories.
Not gonna lie to you, I like some of the songsüíÄ I don‚Äôt want toüëÄ I mean I didn‚Äôt like any of the donda‚Äôsü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è but this one is okay. Maybe 3 songs. Still impossible to separate him from the music, god knows I try, but he makes it impossible.
Just do your job and review the album bro
so you aren‚Äôt gonna review the album cuz kids on twitter?
Have you said anything about the jenoside happening now you liberal panderer?!!!
If this album was called ‚Äúhoods hottest vulture‚Äù you would‚Äôve given it an 8
Average liberal
I mean, what would you expect the review to look like from someone looking like THIS üòÇüòÇ. I have never seen someone who literally embodies the phrase fake overnight activist woke trash like him. My testosterone dropped just listening to the first two minutes of this trash
How is having someone on staff anti them. Imagine using words like delusional
Dude acts like his reviews matter ctfu
But will review music created by murderer&#39;s. Hold this L
<b>**</b> THIS IS NOT A REVIEW, ALL HE DOES IS SMACK TALK KANYE. NOT WORTH IT !! <b>**</b>
If Sexyy Red made it he‚Äôd give it an 8.
fantano when he has to review the music and not the artist‚Äôs opinions: üò±üò±üò±üò±
This album was best album I&#39;ve heard in 5 years
Okay, but I mean he technically did review the album in this videoüòÇ
Yes
Wokethony Blandtano
Lil bro hit us with the ‚Äúin all of my career ‚Äú ahh stare
You should just grow up and review it properly
dis is da same guy that gave sexy red an 8
Can‚Äôt wait for the ‚Äú I kill my opps volume 25‚Äù from lil durk review
I‚Äôm reporting you
I thought he said he doesnt care if theyre racist murderers or stuff like that? Whys Kanye any excuse? Sounds like scripted agenda to me. Rat.
the comments on here are so wild. wow.
HE MADE GRADUATION!!üêêüêêüêêthis is his worst video of all time!
You talk like ur trying to sound smart üò≠
Nihilistic Teenagers ah review üíÄ
Hypocrite
Kanye fans big mad üòÇüòÇ
I usually respect you and the comments you give. Although the comments Kanye said are obviously terrible and inhumane, it shouldn‚Äôt effect the people listening to it. Obviously the lyrics in the music talk about him not being ‚Äúanti- Semitic‚Äù but why should regular people listening to Kanye stop listening to Kanye simply for this reason. Calling someone ‚ÄúNaive‚Äù for the same thing im saying is just crazy.
Ye&#39;s verse on burn is directly aimed at people like fantano. Tap dance for the &quot;jews in your audience&quot;, even tho All the jews i know personally loves the album.
I walked into work , BUMPING PAID !! Because that‚Äôs how I felt goated song üòÖ
I‚Äôm not a fan of Kanye and your generalization on the three fans types was mostly accurate but simply not reviewing the album is kind of gay fantano
I don‚Äôt think people liked this video
You know, making a video about why you will not do a review of Kanye West new album is great promotion for him.  After ppl watch this video they are going to look up the Vultures on Social Media üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Paid one of the best songs on the album!!!
You ova whoopin, anthony.
Bro really slept on beg forgiveness...
Hypocrisy embodied in a man
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=335">5:35</a> that was funny AF. lol üòÖ
Lol bro this one of his best albums in a while....listenable all the way thru. Barely in any skips!
Funny how he‚Äôs talking about how Kanye is and uses that as a point for how bad the album is when he gave ttc‚Äôs album ‚Äúbastard‚Äù a 7 when one of the songs talks about kidnapping, r-wording, and murdering an innocent woman.
Your opinion doesn&#39;t matter. the album is doing numbers.
Man with hitler mustache preaches about antisemitism for 7mins
paid programming.
Sometimes I feel like this guy thinks he can just label a song or album as what he thinks and then it‚Äôs just fact. I will have my own opinion and I don‚Äôt even know why I watch his videos. I don‚Äôt even like this album much but it‚Äôs funny how he just ignores kid songs that are on the album like carnival or burn
if it was called SCARING THE VULTURES instant 10
So Kanye wants Black artists, athletes etc. liberated from exploitative contracts and Fantano shuts that down based on... the way it was worded?! Given the fact that Fantanos channel heavily depends on the creations of the black community, i would have hoped for a more honest discussion about the issue Kanye was raising in the first place. When you wanna get political, do better than virtue-signalling please.
If you guy&#39;s don&#39;t have the dislike plugin, there are currently 74k dislikes and 83k likes
If you like Kanye‚Äôs music, you are not morally wrong for listening. I know Kanye has adopted abhorrent ideas. However, you can listen to his music. Never mind whether or not his new music is good, bad, or listenable. You can listen to Graduation because it is good. You can separate the two. Just as some people separate the lyrics of mainstream rap from the whole piece. You are not sanctioning evil so long as you don‚Äôt excuse Kanye‚Äôs recent remarks. Not because ‚Äúhe means well‚Äù or ‚Äúhe‚Äôs hurting.‚Äù But because most of his music is distinct from the comments. I‚Äôm able to make the distinction between great people from history‚Äôs great ideas from the bad ones. It doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm promoting or sanctioning evil. Despite what Fantano‚Äôs non-review says, some of the songs do not reference the issues Kanye is facing, but they‚Äôre are not really my cup of tea for a number of reasons.
Ok üíÄ
It‚Äôs not your place to say anything about any of that bro. He can think whatever he wants. He doesn‚Äôt need your forgiveness.nobody cares if you forgive him. Nobody cares about your opinion about anything other than album reviews. Stick to what you know. Cuz you don‚Äôt know Kanye.
White people hating a black man. What&#39;s new
At the end of the day Fantano is entitled to his opinion. I personally enjoyed the album.
lol the comment section is full of butthurt people
bald
Yall don‚Äôt even understand Kanye was right about everything he said.  Open your eyes and take a look at the world you are living in.
He should call his next album Yitler
The one piece of art that he refuses to consider art.  Makes no attempt to look for meaning  On the contrary, willfully misinterprets the expressions here as something bad that we should probably be mad about.<br><br>This is a character review, not an album review.<br><br>I bet you I know what political party he identifies as without even hearing him talk about politics.<br><br>I guess I gotta turn to JK Rowling to give informative Kanye West reviews now.
This guys voice makes me want to die
It would be nice if people would stop bashing others for consuming a piece of media they deem unethical/bad. It&#39;s just like how people hate people for eating at Chick-fil-A or patronize people for reading Harry Potter books and playing Hogwarts legacy. Its fucking entertainment. not everyone cares about the complex dramas and political opinions in media, they want to be entertained. Yes, Kanye is a bad person with shitty opinions and an incomprehensible ego, but that doesn&#39;t mean the people that listen to his music are too. Even if he puts one line in one song of one album saying something that can be perceived as antisemitic, that doesn&#39;t mean that you instantly turn into a nazi the second the soundwaves hit your ears. Countless rap songs talk and focus on gangs, drugs, killing, sex, misogyny, and many other terrible topics, but that doesn&#39;t mean the people whose brain finds the music appealing agree with it. It&#39;s just a taste, a preference. It&#39;s not something we as humans can control. I can&#39;t control what music I enjoy, it&#39;s not something that can willfully be changed. Just like how I can&#39;t decide that randomly one day I like eating raw tomatoes, it&#39;s impossible.
1. art is not the artist <br><br>2. opinions are subjective <br><br>3. you must respect peoples opinions even if they are not respectable <br><br>in this video fantano often uses ad hominem, hasty generalization, and strawman fallacies as slander against the fans of kanye. i‚Äôm not saying kanye‚Äôs antisemitism is correct but fantano saying that the listeners/audience/fans of kanye are all 14yr olds, nazis, or cultist stans is despicable, condescending and wrong.
Who&#39;s going to tell him about JPEGMAFIA?
Genuinely stupid video, gonna be real.
Sometimes you gotta separate  the art from the artist imo. Thought it was alright
Melon, he made graduation.
I‚Äôm Jewish and I like the album
hush up
I‚Äôm really not a big Kanye fan and I have trouble separating the art from the artist from time to time in extreme cases. But this review is clearly fueled by some pretty strong feelings completely outside the scope of the actual music. You‚Äôve reviewed plenty of hedonistic artists who say objectifying and belittling things about women and other people all the time and had no trouble reviewing those albums and even giving some positive scores. Also the description of the only people who could‚Äôve potentially enjoyed the album is completely out of pocket. Maybe some people like how the albums sounds and don‚Äôt always hyper analyze lyricsü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è pretty trash ‚Äúreview‚Äù
Really?!?! I‚Äôm not mad, it‚Äôs his opinion but the albums pretty good imo. At least sonically. If we talking theme and substance it wasn‚Äôt his best work. But I‚Äôd say worst case a 7.5/10. But what can yuh do üò≠
lots of real assmad children in these comments. being a nazi isn&#39;t art
ain‚Äôt no way you gave sexyredd an 8 <br>this is why you got a divorce huh?
the desperate ramblings of a sad lonely old fart.
Click back and back take at the same time
Anthony should eat more of his fav food with anything Kanye like he did with Gold cobra.
why the fuck is hitler disappointed with this album i thought he liked ye
Why record a video saying you can&#39;t review the album when you&#39;re reviewing the album? Wasn&#39;t better to just ignore it?
Antony is not wrong
You ever turn the radio on and a song plays that you never heard before but sounds nice? Some people know Kanye like that. When a hiphop track starts playing on my car radio, I&#39;m not going to know a portion. I&#39;m not a fan of Kanye and I do have some trouble in general detaching the art from the artist, but I think its overgeneralizing to assume there&#39;s only 3 reasons anybody would ever listen to Kanye.
Fantano is completely right and yall just salty
Dude reviewed burzum (which i dont mind) but kanye is to much of an antisemite to be reviewed?
Most people don‚Äôt realize Vultures is a concept album.<br><br>Track 4 ..‚ÄùOnce again the clouds are gatherin  to release what they held in‚Äù<br><br>Clouds are metaphor for dark thoughts . Rain is a metaphor for the manifestation of those dark thoughts troubles and pain.<br><br>Track 5- Ty sings- heart was broken , I am frozen. Ye prays for a beautifulbigtittybuttnakedwoman to fall out the sky not rain.. but that is just his sex addiction talking. Kanye is a self admitted sex addict and he has said before sex addiction comes from trying to cover up pain ( all addictions are)<br><br>Track 6- you look like a piece of Hallelujah. (He manifested the woman to fall out the sky) <br><br>Track 7, 8, 10-12<br>Are Ye living a cold loveless life of just sex and transactional relationships with women lyrically. He‚Äôs in Yeezus mode which is why he includes the Mike Tyson interlude about how Ye has mental issues (I‚Äôm a God) <br>Track 12 - (i‚Äôm the new Jesus bish)<br>I‚Äôm a God famous track from Yeezus an album about Ye being a sex addict similar to tracks 6-12 on Vultures.<br><br>In the middle of the those tracks is track 9 Burn - her love is dangerous.<br>Ye- who‚Äôs not entertained by my pain who ain‚Äôt cash a check off my name.<br>I burned 8 billion to take off my chains. <br><br>Chains in hip hop are called- ICE<br>What happens when the clouds release rain and the environment is cold? It turns to ICE.<br><br>Track 13 after Carnival is Beg Forgiveness . Ye realizes he‚Äôs gone too far with the lifestyle he‚Äôs been in track 6-12 in Yeezus mode- What if I wake and i can‚Äôt feel my heartbeat..Ye‚Äôs verse says  ‚Äúdon‚Äôt let your moment pass you by‚Äù , ‚Äú100% covered in ICE‚Äù - Back to me Ty sings this is more than just a moment.. I am FROZEN<br><br>Track 14- Good don‚Äôt die - Ye sings got my heart on ICE don‚Äôt die.<br><br><br>Back to how this is set up Track 2.<br>Ye raps - slow down you on your way to an overdose- it‚Äôs about his addiction <br><br>- caused by pain it‚Äôs about the divorce with Kim- seeing her with other men.<br>Ever since I lost my mom you were like my foster mom-<br><br>‚ÄúYou already know I‚Äôm impulsive and another baby is my end goal‚Äù -<br><br>. If you‚Äôre impulsive and want to make babies that means sex addiction.. uncontrolled sex not for love.<br><br>Track 3 - Ye sings ‚ÄúRoxanne‚Äù in a desperate voice yearning for love.. but for her it‚Äôs just a job ain‚Äôt that a shame- she‚Äôs just here to get paid.<br>And Ye is just shooting Billy blanks and can‚Äôt get any one pregnant for his end goal of a baby therefore he‚Äôs just making money to provide material things for the woman he‚Äôs with and get laid- feed his sex addiction.<br><br><br>Track 4 Talking features North for a reason.<br>There‚Äôs 2 songs made about North- Violent Crimes - a song about how Ye imagines her growing up and being surrounded by savages and monsters who use her for sex - the way Ye used to treat women . <br>Also Only One- a song about Ye‚Äôs mom singing to him and North-<br>I think the storm ran out of rain the clouds are movin. <br><br>Ty sings - Once again the cloud the clouds are gathering to release what they held in - and his verse same theme as Violent Crimes , Ty afraid his daughter grows up living the lifestyle he used to live.<br><br><br><br>Now the bookends<br>The Album Cover<br>Track 1 STARS<br><br>Track 13 Problematic<br>Track 14 KING<br><br>The album is actually using Ye‚Äôs struggles with sex addiction as a metaphor for the being cancelled , the culture , the industry , and comparing himself to problematic figures in the industry ( Stars) cancelled for dehumanizing acts towards women .<br>R Kelly, Bill Cosby, P Diddy, Chris Brown, Columbine shooters were incels who were mad they couldn‚Äôt get girls.. Ye‚Äôs other addiction or impulse control problem is his inability to bite his tongue. Which is the cause of his cancellation and he has said that and his porn addiction led to his divorce.. Carnival- they served us the *orn  since the day we was born.<br><br>Ye for a long time has been connecting the dots that the industry uses the black entertainers like how the black entertainers who live a problematic lifestyle use women. It‚Äôs a transactional relationship with no love . The industry makes money of the lyrics of rappers who rap about killing each other , doing drugs , drinking and treating women like objects.<br><br>It leads to fatherless homes, single mothers who can‚Äôt provide for their kids and be around them all the time , so then the kids in the hood often are looking for a sense of family and male role models through gangs and then they end up in Jail. Or seeing the rappers who make bad choices as examples because they are perceived as cool because they make money and get all the women. <br><br>It all revolves around money- women are naturally attracted to men with money because it provides for the children, but the men who have the money use their money for power over women often are not there for the children and are just using them for sex because of their own pain.. <br>The industry above all who capitalize off of the artist usually are generational wealth , they have families , and they are just using the system making money off of black peoples pain because they are greedy.<br><br>So who are the VULTURES- the men using the women for sex? The women using the rappers for money? The rappers who rap about gang violence and objectifying women because it makes them money?<br><br>Or is it the system of greed?<br><br>That‚Äôs why Ye ripped up the contracts and burned 8 billion by calling out the system and the fact he‚Äôs still King shows he outsmarted the system by using it to be #1 again. Vultures 1 is just step one of 3 . <br><br>I just F‚Äôd the world raw she needs a morning after.PROBLEMATIC
Your assertion that you see it as genuinely impossible to listen to an artist solely for the music, with no regard for their personal character or perspectives, is a remarkable admission. Your implication that the person making that comment is either stupid or lying is equally damning.
Wtf, is this a music review or are You a political news anchor hahahha boooring
Vultures slapped. Do it, Vultures, Carnvial, Burn, and Good ( Dont Die)  are all bangers. The North West feature on talking was super cute and unexpected. Looking back at it i dont think its appropriate giving the content of the album.  Also Freddie Gibs totally saved the song on Back To Me.    Fuk Sumn was a killer beat.  The album had great production. You just hate Kanye now Mr Flannel. But its ok i still love u
Fantano is such a lib lmao
He definitely isn&#39;t arrogant or a narcissist
My brother in christ, you have reviewed music made by far worse people
dog no one cares about this shit just review the album like you&#39;re supposed to
Nice troll Fantano, get those Video Views my man üëç
He monetized this. That tells you everything about Anthony‚Äôs character
I left at Donda
What a clown
But he made graduation
if it was called &quot;kids see vultures in the money store&quot; you wouldve given it a 10
virtue signal harder
So the review isn‚Äôt really about the music? Cool.
The hipster channel, everytime i make the mistake to come here something supremely uninteresting edgy takes on anything outside the norm makes me fall asleep. Music is something you feel, you know - keep ya filthy politics out of it. That said, wasn&#39;t a very impressive album, had some serious drums and a handful of decent songs but also a lot of random crap.
Can‚Äôt really criticize an album you openly admitted you can‚Äôt even give a chance for moral reasons.
Back To Me is a genuinely amazing song
did you know that you can hear an album without necesarilly supporting the artists actions üò±üò±üò±
Isn‚Äôt this the same goon who said he separates the art from the artist
HEY EVERYONE KANYES SOUL IS DEAD. THE OLD KANYE IS NEVER GOING TO RETURN. STOP WAITING FOR SOME COMEBACK. HES GONE. GET OVER YOURSELVES.
Anthony, no real white supremacist is now a Kanye fan because what he said
Per usual, your bias and lack of any personal talent bleeds through like an upset high school target. Other than the fact that you‚Äôre opinion literally doesn‚Äôt matter to anyone with a fraction of confidence, you‚Äôre also a weird person who‚Äôs been infatuated with black culture for years. Your life‚Äôs purpose is to study us, you‚Äôre just really bad at it, and clearly bias. Looking forward to learning of your own personal talent. ‚ù§
Salty much? Jeez üòÇ
you clearly showed that you did&#39;t even try to like the album. No wonder you call it his worst album if you listened to it with such bias.
If he was rapping about his booty hole it would be an 8 tho.
I don‚Äôt understand how this clown is still relevant
He got hot chicks and rich af so jealousy much? üòä
this meta parody would have been good if you could have somehow managed to make it funny
If he would have called it ‚ÄúAngelic to the Vultures‚Äù you would have given it a zero
What are you yapping about, what a crybaby
But reviewing Burzum is fine tho?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=323">5:23</a> this laugh is really creepy‚Ä¶
Agreed hoodrat is bad, but man you sat on that chair with hate on the new ulbum
Another TMZ type making bank off Ye&#39;s work
Dude every time I listen to Kanye now, I‚Äôm so off put. Been putting his shit way down the musical priority list. Chris brown sang two bars and I was like this ain‚Äôt it.
Shut the hell up for&#39; you get exiled! - Symbiote Spider-Man
Funny how Anthony&#39;s morality only comes to light when it&#39;s time to review Kanye...
Pretty disappointing your focus is more on the negative interactions of Ye fans than your fans who you should trust and appreciate
I don&#39;t think you&#39;re right, Anthony, respectfully. This just kinda comes off as some weird moral high-ground rant. I don&#39;t like this review.
Bro who are you speaking forü§£ü§£ü§£
I‚Äôm all for separating art from the artist, like I‚Äôm a big fan of daughter, combichrist and nauchtmar as musicians even thought they are straight up pieces of shit. However I honestly think that Kaynes personality is so tied up into his music that it‚Äôs impossible to separate the two from each other and if you enjoy this new album you are to some extent enjoying his message.
I‚Äôm Jewish and I like Kanye‚Äôs older music and if his new music was good I am mature enough to admit that but the problem is it just isn‚Äôt. I think his ego has gotten to such a point that he is unable to criticize his own music which leads him to releasing unrefined and uninspired garbage.
Can&#39;t marginalize Kanye, he&#39;s too big. The problem with moralizing is the lack of insight.
It‚Äôs always an interesting look at human morality like is apart of you supposed to feel guilty for enjoying R. Kelly, Phil Spector , XXXtentacion, etc because they were accused of or convicted for horrible things but their music is still good for what it is ‚Ä¶So I don‚Äôt think it makes you a piece of shit if you like the music that doesn‚Äôt mean you agree with everything someone says but then that also brings to question how much are people really willing to look past ? Seems like if these fans connect with the artist their loyalty runs so deep the artists can do or say anything and the fans will defend it that‚Äôs when it becomes a problem I think ‚Ä¶. Kinda like how OJ doesn‚Äôt get credit for being a great athlete anymore once you‚Äôve crossed a line most people don‚Äôt wanna associate with you anymore on any level but then there‚Äôs always gonna be the people willing to look past it and defend them but I think you can fairly give credit to the art while also dismissing the actions but in Kanye‚Äôs case giving credit to his art in its current form is only further enabling his actions so I do think this is best until he makes a real effort to try to redeem himself
Vete alvü•∫
You can tell Melon is still handling the divorce well. üòÇ
No music is unreviewable, so you are not even a real music critic. What a bald fraud clown, clickbaiting on his supposed ‚Äúreviews‚Äù.
Antisemitism is not saying the word Jew or Jewish as a non Jewish person. This is out of hand
your politics has consumed you

unwatchable 1
This man has to be stopped bro
<b>SPREAD THOSE CHEEKS. NO, NOT YOURS!</b>
Funny how imo this album was better than Donda, but in fantano&#39;s world Donda was better because it was before kanyes controversial statements. Great &quot;review&quot; man! I give it an unreviewable/10
I was defending this video before i watched it because i thought &quot;well, he just probably thinks the album was really bad and its alright, kanye stans got mad that he doesnt like the album&quot;.<br><br>Then, I watched the &quot;album review&quot;. Now I completely understand why theres so many dislikes and so many negative comments. You dont care about the music. You only care that Kanye said controversial statements and no matter how this album would sound like you would hate on it just because its a new album by kanye. You spent more than half of the video time on talking about kanyes controversies, but this is supposed to be an &quot;album review&quot;??? What a terrible video.
I thought it was an album review, not a celebrity review?
This &quot;review&quot; feels so much like you had an ready opinion about this album before  it was even out. No matter what, you would just dislike it because you dont like kanye. You talking about his controversies for more than half of the video is enough.<br><br>Btw fun fact: I think you forgot Ty Dolla $ign was also on this album, not just Ye ;)
Im starting to understand why so many dislikes...<br>You are &quot;reviewing&quot; an album, yet you spend most of the time talking about the antisemtism of Kanye and how bad he is as a human person.<br><br>Are we reviewing Vultures 1 or are we reviewing Kanye&#39;s personality? I listen to his music because I like his music, not because I like his personality. I dont give a f*** about what he thinks of anything, I dony care at all about his opinions and controversies, I just like his music and thats it. People that came here for an album review dont wanna hear you talking about what kanye did or does or what he says or what he thinks about various things. we already know that. This is an album review, im more than halfway through the video and u said nothing about the album. You just focus on kanyes controversial statements. And then anyone that dislikes this video or criticizes it gets instantly called a kanye stan.<br><br>Oh yes, because an X person is a bad person, then that X persons music must be all bad. Btw remember to praise music of gangsters and criminals back from many years ago, at least they werent antisemitic so thats okay :)
If it was called &quot;For All The Vultures&quot; you would had gave it a 10
It&#39;s funny how much criticism Kanye gets when Drake doesn&#39;t release on the same day.üòÇüòÇ
Kanye, like his music, has become redundant.
Petey boy Davidson took em doooown! üáÆüá±üçå
if it was To Pimp A Vultures it would be a 10
this is the worst timeline. i obviously know about this stuff yet got into his discography a few weeks ago and his music is so inspirational to me, making me actually want to produce and make music myself. wouldn‚Äôt be so bad, if he wasn‚Äôt unlikeable and dangerous. i hate everything about this, man
If melon never heard Kanye before, he would be calling this the new prophet.
I guess I&#39;m just a nihilist teenager in my 20&#39;s then :)
ok i know you dont like the album but cmon anthony, you can&#39;t just recite the hitler speech and say that jews are responsible for all evil in the world for 7 minutes and then just call it a review of an album like what the hell man.
4th type of Kanye fan enjoys his music and still loves him as a person. Doesn‚Äôt mean we love everything he does but still a fan.
&quot;I dont care is he murdered someone, i dont care if he burned down some churches. I dont care if hes racist&quot;<br><br>-Fantano<br><br>Got some explaining to do my boy
yapper of the year
Lol review last Ariel Pink album
L take Fantano sucks
Fantano is tripping. It‚Äôs okay, you‚Äôre only limiting yourself big boy xx
kanye has devolved into just a controversy machine, everything should just be controversial even if the music sucks
yapper of the year
Rappers make music about killing, saying nigga, sexist, homophobic and drugs hip hop should never be reviewed by you
I used to legitimately value your musical opinion, however this was the final straw. with this video you have lost all credibility in my eyes. Unsubscribed. I&#39;m VERY excited to have you here in Lincoln in only a few days time! well gave a GREAT chat im sure!!!!
kanye pioneering new genres
Jews - the one race that&#39;s completely off limits to be negative towards. <br><br>If kanye didn&#39;t like whites nobody would care.
Fantano is full of hypocritical double speak on race and sexism. What a soy-ridden loser
Why is it artists are only cancelled when they offend Jews? Anti Christian sentiment is everywhere in the music scene. That, apparently, is ok. Why the double standards?
&quot;unreviewable&quot;?....then dont review it....
review the music and shut up. nobody cares about your political views.
Completely reviewable 1
Nobody cares about Fantano&#39;s review nommoh
wahh wahh boohoo
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=110">1:50</a> he isn&#39;t calling her A reference; Do you even English??
The antisemitism isn&#39;t what killed his career. He just slowly became irrelevant.
Alrighty
If you‚Äôre not going to review something out of your personal stands towards the artist, then that‚Äôs cool. But don‚Äôt do a whole song and dance about it. Makes you look like a hypocrite
This album sucks....as someone that was heavily routing for him to make a comeback im disappointed. he is no longer making art...we gotta stop praising garbage just cause its from a glorified dude with a good reputation for shifting music at some point. We all know Kanye can do alot better if he just took some time to get his shit together, but this album is a coping mechanism, and not in a good way. he should have kept these in the vault to put em out as singles or ep....but for an album with the intent to shape a story in some order and put it out as entertaining art, it does nothing. this is what happens to greatness when its surrounded by Yes-men
Ladies and gentlemen I bet you he talked to his ex wife like this. I wonder why he‚Äôs divorced.
I see, so instead of actually reviewing the music your going to call it trash because you don‚Äôt like Kanye. Have some Integrity as a reviewer for god sake and put your personal feelings aside to focus on the music.
Only thing is trash is that push broom on your top lip
Can&#39;t remove artist from their art, shouldn&#39;t be reviewing anything.<br><br>With this review you literally just fucked yourself. No one can factually ever take what is clearly just your opinion seriously anymore. Cya dude.
Yeah, almost like your mainstream hip-hop reviews became unwatchable.
Its actually a great record, you should give it a real try
Wow. Stunning and brave ! <br><br>Defending corporate overlords !!
Fantano is the type of fucking goofball to use the terminology ‚Äúcan of worms‚Äù
Literally the best way you could give an album a 10
You really spent 7 minutes yapping about how you won‚Äôt review something
Do yourself a favor and hop off the internet for a couple weeks bro.<br><br>Your into deep, and I don&#39;t even fuck with Kanye.
Stop being so biased. Review the album as a listener. Not a dick. Remove your feelings and give it a proper chance.
It‚Äôs pretty disingenuous to say it‚Äôs  un-reviewable when you routinely review artist that have literally killed people or done things just as bad. It‚Äôs been pretty obvious from your previous Kanye reviews that you don‚Äôt like him because of his fans. Just review the album, I watched your live stream and you spent the whole time raging at Kanye fans instead of listening to the music.
you cant really separate the art from the artist when the artist Is literally saying the deranged shit he thinks outside of his prior music into his new music.
internet users when someone with &quot;the best music takes&quot; doesn&#39;t wanna review an album
Well at least Ye supports the azlov battalion!
This deserves to be among the most disliked videos on youtube
L fananto
Tell me you are Jewish without telling me you are Jewish: look at him he‚Äôs so mad. Haha. Baldy.
82k likes and 73k dislikes. Wish there were more dislikes than likes
A guide to the comment section: &quot;you&#39;re not reviewing the music!&quot; = &quot;I&#39;ve been called out and I can&#39;t deal with it!&quot;
So he doesn‚Äôt talk about music anymore?
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt review this album‚Äù <br>Proceeds to review it
This album is so good it made Anthony Fantano cry
Wow I definitely didn&#39;t expect this from you! A total surprise! Completely unpredictable!
This is most painstakingly selective review ever, you care so much about an artist‚Äôs background and u let it affect your opinion on the music. It‚Äôs annoying asl
Dude it‚Äôs a music review, review the music
üíÄ
listen kanye might be wrong on many things ,but he is right on 1 thing ,who runs the world .so yeah think what you want he is right on that .
This is the world&#39;s biggest cornball.
So i guess the artist/individual cannot be separated from his craft.
73K dislikes, oh man that&#39;s a lot of triggers üòÇ
Since when did the melon care about women?
This is &quot;Ye&quot;. We lost KANYE a long time ago, when his mother passed. That woman was his rock. Which explains why he&#39;s gone so far off the deep end. I guarantee that if his mother was still here, he wouldn&#39;t be pulling this crap because he&#39;d consider how shameful and embarassing this behavior is. Such a shame.
Fantano,honor your reviews please and give us a review. Do your job,you‚Äôve reviewed GOBLIN by Tyler in the past
Fantana the type of guy to crap his pants in school and blame someone else
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=368">6:08</a> ngga do I need your approval or permission to listen and like to whatever tf I want??? 2Ms subs is brazzyyy...
Womp womp bozo, album is üî• nowSTFU
We‚Äôre judging the music..not the person. Behave my dude, if my ears like the beats and the vibe the music gives of that‚Äôs what matters. People in this day and age don‚Äôt really care or pay attention to the lyrics of songs anyway.
Kanye has always sucked. He‚Äôs great at making beats and picking good samples but god his lyrics are gibberish. Stupid people confuse gibberish ramblings for profound art
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=49">0:49</a> right when dude says hitler, I cannot unsee him as hitler.
can&#39;t wait for unreviewable 2 and 3
I&#39;ll never listen to another review from a white critic again.
If this album was made by kendrick lamar he&#39;d say how genius it is and give it at 10. At this point, he&#39;s only reviewing the name of the artist.
&quot;unreviewable&quot; yet you reviewed it
Cuck energy
Oh dear Anthony, we know it would‚Äôve been another 10 if it was just Mr. Ty Dolla. üòÇ
Or there is a 4th group of people who, get this, actually like most of the music on this album. Just because they don‚Äôt agree with you doesn‚Äôt make these people racist or antisemitic. You push your liberal agenda way too much. Also, how are we supposed to trust your opinion on music when you have given some of the most unlistenable music like Sexy Red an 8? This is a terrible video because of how hypocritical you are being.
üòÇ Man‚Ä¶ I just want to say all his drama his pretty old and don‚Äôt act like every celebrity doesn‚Äôt say some crazy shit once a while that dies the next week.. I just like the music.. Everything can be criticized to the maximum it doesn‚Äôt mean everyone‚Äôs in some little black and white extreme thinking groups and labels like you
1.6 M kanye üî•
Half way thru this vid<br>&amp; bro still crying üòÇ
This guy is a joke.
not really, I&#39;m a fan of Kanye and can spot the right and wrong things he&#39;s done. I don&#39;t really get the purpose of this video, if you&#39;re not going to review the album - have you made a video talking about Israel&#39;s genocide?
Are you gonna review the album or just talk shit about ye?
I bet melon voted for Biden
trying to figure out if i am a psycho, a nihilistic teenager or a cult member. i think i just like the music!
idc about kanye&#39;s behavior the album is still trash either way and has like 5 good songs
‚ÄúI dont care if he murdered someone, I don‚Äôt care if he burnt down some churches and I don‚Äôt care if he racist‚Äù -Anthony Fantano
What Travis Scott did was worse and you reviewed utopia
Bro reviewed Kanye not the album
Tbh none of those lines are bad all  were kinda hilarious. Is Anthony a Jew?
Bruh this album is fire I honestly think there are bangers with this one
Icreible 1.5 m de vistas, supongo que es lo que te da de comer y por eso hiciste la no review
I f$cks with fantano but he a lame for this lol
The college dropout is one of my favorite albums ever made. And this is now one of my least favorite albums every made. Crazy to see a man fall so hard
fake review. you could of just said everything was wack except for carnival.
Yeah man ‚Ä¶ you lost yourself
nah bro that scooter bar went hard. theres no fair rules in hip hop dawg, wtf dawg your goofy.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=265">4:25</a> , quotes I believe are the types of things someone would say when they believe they aren&#39;t a racist- although they do still have some racist beliefs. My point being, I don&#39;t think kanye believes himself a racist... but that doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s right.
<b>Calls out Ye for insulting people</b><br><br> <b>Immediately insults Ye fans right after</b><br><br>Yeah, this fantano guy is a hyprocrite and is probably a bad person. Wouldnt be surprised if he&#39;s been through something traumatic like a divorce or abuse etc. I&#39;ll pray for him to get better üôèüèΩ
unreviewable but 47min FULLREACTIONABLE
Guys please he&#39;s literally talking to you. The Ye cope in here is suffocating. Stop platforming a Nazi who makes mid music.
The fact that the album is so bad that Fantano felt the need to create a new serious is wild üíÄ
Kanye wasnt wrong about the tribe
I will give a homeless person a DOLLAR for every like I get on this comment
Another nobody pod person who should love the piece of art because it‚Äôs titled after ‚ÄúYou‚Äù. Your ‚Äújewish‚Äù not a ‚ÄúJew‚Äù kind sir.
U have never made an actual good review of anything.
bald melon man mad üò°
More power Kanye! Ye Ye!
he wasnt totally wrong with the conspiracies... iykyk... he&#39;s just behind with some of it and has some catching up to do
Yeah not gonna lie I&#39;m in that number 2 group
7 minutes of pointless virtue signalling. Just review it or dont
This is why your wife left you
What, better than Graduation, Kanye&#39;s best album so far. I did not see this coming
Part of growing up is realizing Kanye is wrong and Anthony is wrong too
kanye is the worst part of this album. every verse he has ruins the songs they are on. when a song has stacked features with them all performing highly, kanye comes in with his verse and completely ruins everything the song has going for it
i belong to all 3 categorys of kanye fans btw
&quot;Now I don&#39;t give a shit if he burned down some churches, if he killed a guy, idc if he&#39;s racist. If he comes out with an album in the future that I find interesting, I will welcome it with open arms&quot;.<br>Tell me, who did I quote here?<br><br>You also do know you review songs in which people talk about shooting eachother in the face.....and you&#39;re talking!?!?!?! üòÇ
ur welcome for the millions of views and ur most popular upload of the year üéâ
i actually agree with u
I am kind of a Kanye superfan, but I even I listened to this thought &quot;is his worst album yet, not much to be saved or re listened&quot;. However, I really like how he says &quot;the beautiful big titties butt naked women just don¬¥t fall from the sky you know&quot;. The lyrcis, to me, is the worst part: he doesn¬¥t say anything good, funny or meaningfull.
JUST RETIRE
This is the one of those albums from Kanye where you can legitimately say ‚ÄúDamn, I really miss the old Kanye‚Äù ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ
You would‚Äôve been better off just making a tweet saying you won‚Äôt review it, you‚Äôre just a cornball baiting for views now lol
This is such a gay take. I thought he was actually gonna have an interesting thing to say. But nope.
Kanye says racist things about jews he&#39;s the villain and no longer a billionaire.  Donald Trump says racist things about black people, mexicans, immigrants etc and he&#39;s still worth 2 billions and still winning the presidential race as we speak. Lol america
This is all a ruse to go viral and protect his youtube reputation.
The Americans
DO NOT GO TO R/KANYE<br>I AM WARNING YOU<br>THE TOXICITY IS UNBEARABLE!!!!!
Wifethony Leftano
If it was called ‚ÄúTo pimp a vulture‚Äù would‚Äôve been a 10
Fantano was never going to be able to separate his political views from this album
&gt;claims to hate Nazis<br>&gt;wears Hitler stache<br><br>Hmmm

Liberal white boy trying to tell us what good music is üòÇü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
id give this review a 1
Absolutely garbage album. I agree
7.03 minutes of nothing. well done!
It&#39;s an okay album. Its not great. There are times when a melody or a lyric works, scattered throughout 52 minutes. Sparks of genius mixed in with mediocrity that&#39;s further hamstringed by accommodating another main artist. There are probably 3 songs I bump regularly. That might change in the future. Kanye has done a lot of stuff that people have mixed feelings about recently and this album is probably a good representation of his life right now. A whole bunch of stretching and odd stuff mixed in with times that he reminds you who he is. On that level I can respect the honesty.    <br><br>&quot;People are funny, they know Kanye&#39;s great too But the way he conducts himself, they hate to believe it But they can&#39;t help it, they know he&#39;s great. Shit Kanye say is basically affirmations what people say for success. And it sounds insane because that&#39;s what motherfuckers do. But he sounds insane and that&#39;s signs‚Äî sounds of a leader. No doubt he&#39;s got some mental fuckin&#39; issues, most leaders do The delusional issue, &quot;I&#39;m a God&quot;&quot; - Mike Tyson &quot;Hoodrats&quot;
Hating on Kanye is so opportunistic and political
Bro hates good music
can anyone see the dislikes? its gotta be in the 100ks
Big industries paid Fagtano bundles of money for this take on ye üòÇüòÇ
okay gordon ramsay
Who would&#39;ve thought, whanthony whantano cant review an album because the guy who made it hurt his sensibilities. <br><br>Spend less time telling us about how upset you are that there&#39;s no tampon dispensers in the men&#39;s bathroom, and be objective about the music.
Not sure why Ye chose Ty‚Ä¶. Kid See Ghost 2 would‚Äôve been better than this
Lovely to see a music reviewer review music based off everything but simply‚Ä¶ the music
I&#39;m soo tired of celebrities doing satanic/ antisemitic s**t and just get away sooo easily. I&#39;m a kanye fan but I&#39;ve had enough of his stupidity. His new album doesn&#39;t have that kanye quality that all of his previous albums had. We get it his mad, angry because of a divorce but that doesn&#39;t give him the right to go out and say s**t about a community and then act like a victim. His definitely not a god or nowhere close to being a god, God doesn&#39;t yap about how he&#39;s the greatest of all time and do satanic and antisematic stuff and act like a karen all the time. Get Well Soon! Kanye!!!
Everyone likes this album and it&#39;s shocking. Nobody cares about the lyrics anymore but only about the artist&#39;s name
now do all the black metal bands you love so much
Review 2093
Bruh just review the music! We don&#39;t care about what another man says or does in his own life. Stick to what you&#39;re good at.
not a fan of hood rat... wonder what he thought about a milli
The reason you&#39;re freaking out is because you don&#39;t really know what&#39;s going on. Take things as a puzzle piece.<br><br>Look at society as a whole unit. Look at the different things going on. Then draw a conclusion as to what&#39;s going on. Then and only then will you understand.
My stance is I really don‚Äôt think he meant what he said about Jews or white supremacy I think it was just him spinning his wheels and his mouth is moving faster than his mind and now he has to run with it. I do think he‚Äôs had a realisation of what he‚Äôs said has had consequences and how badly he‚Äôs fucked up but I think he really does have mental issues and because he has no one to ground him anymore every thought becomes the ‚Äútruth‚Äù in Kanyes mind. He‚Äôs spiralling down a bad path further and further and his own fans can‚Äôt even see because they‚Äôre blinded by his ‚Äútruth‚Äù only person that can bring him back to earth and reality is North
oy vey
soyjak
And yet his review of Buruzm&#39;s Belus is still up.
if anything mr fantano delete this :/
If this was called &quot;Vultureezus&quot; or &quot;The Life of Vultures&quot; this would be a light 1 to strong 11
I Agree with  theneedledrop here.
Why do we still take this goober seriously?
What a fucking coward üòÇ
but reviewing records where kids talk about blowing each others&#39; heads off is fair game? Got it
professor sykes actually reviewed this kanye cd, everyone go check it out. hate this bold divorced fck.
Baldony copetano
bro snowflaked wtf happened to you
I been enjoying his latest albums. I just throw it on and work on stuff and it‚Äôs soothing lowkey. Especially those Donda albums.
Ur baldinf and divorced. Silencio
The yid doesn‚Äôt like the album??? Oh noooooo
STILL L
Every album should be reviewable lol
yeah whatever if its unreviewable just dont post a video because this is still considered a review. if hypocrite was a person its this dude he has reviewed music from murders, rapists, homophobes etc
This is what a industry plant does. He talked more about what the news stories than the music. And Jesus is king won a Grammy.  This hit was bought and paid for.
Why are people so pissy about folks not liking Jews? When people hate blacks, whites, asians, hispanics, its fine right? Whats special about jews?
Dope album!!! You&#39;re totally biased
This is how this is gonna go, We&#39;re all going to play dumb and pretend like we dont know that Ye being controversial and speaking the truth about jews is why you&#39;re not reviewing his album. The first album he drops amidst all of the controversy that also got pulled off of apple music and this just so happens to be the album you deemed unreviewable. This is exactly the reason why you have no credence, you pick and choose when you want to be a music journalist and dont actually give your true opinion when in fear of being canceled. I thought you were the internets busiest music nerd, not sellout...
Butthurt review üòÇ
Imagine not actually giving your opinion on an artist cause you&#39;re scared of being canceled
if this was called ‚ÄúThe College Vulture‚Äù you would of given it a 10
Your perspective on Kanye is so generic and uninsightful.. None of the other unapologetic musicians on your page get this level of passive aggressive dismissiveness.. Drake is racist and mysoginistic, but gets reviewed musically.. Ye&#39;s number 1 in IsraelüíÅüèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüíÅüèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
virtue signalling
Oi Vey, i&#39;m Jewish and i like the album. Lehayim
unreviewable..., forever.
lol this guy! Fucking 1.5m cuck views
Kanye is the world&#39;s most celebrated mid artist. <br><br>&quot;But his production&quot; . Ya, not one of y&#39;all have any idea what those words mean.
The ignorance is never calling out the mass murder of Palestinian kids, with fantano is yet to do
It seems like this guy is a cultish weirdo doing what his woke overlords want him to do
This guy gives 10/10 to albums that are far more demonising of women. lol talk about having an anti Kanye agenda.
Why does fantano not talk a bout Karl‚Äôs genocide but is outraged by Kanye being a total idiot
Dude do reviews, no one cares about your political views and virtue signalling
Kanye west 1 - 0 Cancel culture<br><br>Suck it publicly üòÇ
If it was called &quot;Kids see Vultures 1&quot; you&#39;d give it a 10
if it was called beautiful big titty butt naked women he would&#39;ve given it a 10
Actually love the beautiful big tittied buty naked women don‚Äôt fall off the sky song ‚Ä¶ rest is kind of meh
as of right now, the likes and dislike bar are;<br><br>81k for likes and 72k for dislike
hahaha.  Stop.  Do you even have a degree??
This dude is a vulture üòÇ
you lost all future credibility after making this video. pathetic
Nobody cares about your political takes. You‚Äôre a music critic for crying out loud. You of all people should know how to separate the art from the artist. You‚Äôre job is to give an objective critique of an album which lets the audience know if an album has artistic value or not. That‚Äôs it. A great music critic has the ability to separate the hype, an artist‚Äôs life story, his bad press, his good press, an artist‚Äôs method, artist‚Äôs controversies, artist‚Äôs charity work , so on and so forth, cutting all of that out and objectively reviewing the music. You used to be that guy fantano but not anymore. What happened buddy?
Review the album that‚Äôs what u did right ????????????
Just rate the album that‚Äôs ur job. Not going out in the rain or snow like most people putting up with ur stance on some political libtard political stance. Never voted in my life but I know the hard working folk. Rate the albums is shit or good that ur whole job not hard. Stop grand standing.
Anthony Bugthano indulging in another self serving farce.<br>The older he gets the more he turns into a woman.
1.6 million views and 81k likes yeah it‚Äôs majority disliked
If YouTube showed dislikes this video would be majority disliked
Shut up you lib the album is great
Bro starts the review off w ‚Äúquestion‚Äù he tryna be like dwight from the office.
&quot;Unreviewable 1&quot;<br><br>Talks about why not to listen to it, then gives a very brief review of said album, minus a rating. Click bait easily
BLA BLA BLA IM SUPPORT JEWS BA BLA , GOOD BYE FCKING CRITIC
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=268">4:28</a> argument not valid. None of the lyrics says he hate jews or anything. First comment is him not confirming he&#39;s an antisemite but rather he&#39;s quoting headlines.
For being such tough free thinkers, all you Kanye fans/cult members get big mad when somebody calls him out for saying legitimately disturbing things.
unreviewable is the most drama brewing title of all time whyy he reviewed it anyways lmao
But we miss the ol Kanye...
Most of these artists are not good people. If you like the music you like it if you don‚Äôt you don‚Äôt all that other shit out of your control
This album is fire
Lol at the butthurt Kanye fans, you all are the reason why society regresses. Absolutely pathetic!
If it was called &quot;good kid m.a.a.d vultures&quot; you would&#39;ve given it a 10
Calm down white man
So sad saying all this for 7 minutos and spend 5 minutes criticizing the Artis as a person and just about 2 minutes saying something about the album without really listening or even trying to read the references and why are there, you can do better I am sure.
My friend: Thoughts on my art?<br>Me: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4">0:00</a>
Looking at these comments proves fantano‚Äôs point no Kanye super fan wants to discuss anything they just want to plug there ears to any logical reasoning
I was still a fan even after this video, then he just posted some trump shit again after all these years and now I‚Äôm done
I don‚Äôt know but your a review channel that didn‚Äôt review the album if it bad or good I want to know if it‚Äôs worth listening to ???
Idubbbz moment
STFU and listen to the music
your job is to fucking review music, do your fucking job
my proudest nut
Loser
Nice review buddy. You‚Äôre a real smart guy. Look at you go!
but whats the score and what was your favorite song?  I only listened to the first one but it sounded great actually.
Who is scooter?
My guy rate the album. It‚Äôs music. Shut up
Sexyy Red 8/10
Nobody‚Äôs here for your bargain bin political takes baldie, stick to the music reviews.
Unreviewable is crazy, the album can‚Äôt be that badüíÄ
People in the comments kind of confirms some points on the video. I guess is hard to see it, if you r like this.
Fantano is a liberal jew confirmed.
Kanye is floating into NAV level ire from Anthony is wild üòÇ I&#39;m here for it.
Sam Hyde‚Äôs watching you fantano
Murda? what muuurrddaaaa???
Never seen a review about a impossible review.
It sucks that Kanye is how he is bc some his music hits so hard - life of pablo, my dark twisted fantasy, kids see ghosts, and some of those older albums too.
Who is this guy? Does anyone listen to him?  Luckily, KW didn&#39;t make it for him.
Bro WTF!?! I came to this for a MUSIC REVIEW‚Ä¶ if u just gone sit and Voice your fckn Opinionated 2 Cents, Put that shit on your other channels‚Ä¶. Don‚Äôt post it like a Fuckin Review then clickbait us into hearing your OPINION On Kanye‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs STILL AN ALBUM. It still has tracks. Just cuz u don‚Äôt like the Artist doesn‚Äôt mean u get to Cut Corners &amp; Fastrack the reviews. Like why even say shit about it at all!?! ‚Ä¶ coming off like a Hater my guy
liberal fantano strikes again!! <br>grrrrrr
Most people being honest with themselves would admit MBDTF is also trash. Dude is a trash artist that is good at manipulating the meme culture internet zeitgeist. That&#39;s it... nothing deep about kanye.
I really wish you could still see youtube dislikes
The comments on this video fucking suck. The same tired jokes over and over. It‚Äôs not funny anymore.<br><br>Honestly, I‚Äôm proud of you Anthony. Kanye‚Äôs anti-semitism sucks and I‚Äôm glad you led with that.
Im feeling a little bit of bias in this review hmmm

i def share fantano‚Äôs view on this one fellas.
The music is produced well, and the tracks have a lot more detail and layered production than many of his other projects and other projects out right now, and there‚Äôs also supporting the equality of minorities and separating that from saying you can‚Äôt appreciate good quality music simply because of a couple of comments made in the past that I don‚Äôt think anyone can distinguish between being satire or serious, but that‚Äôs just the sensitivity of todays worldü§∑
You just lost your credibility.
ü§°
as a &quot;reviewer&quot;, putting albums into two simplistic reasons as to why you should review them is half-hearted to begin with. Buying the puts on Fantano stock
Wow the generalization of all his fans into either a cultist, nazi, or edgy teen is crazy
Imo this is R&amp;B, not exactly what it‚Äôs going for but it‚Äôs not that bad.
Damn this video gonna help out with this months rent? You became the mastermind
I think it&#39;s obvious that you don&#39;t like Kanye, I respect your opinion, but treating people as ignorant just because they liked an album that you don&#39;t, you&#39;re qualifying yourself, on top of messing around, delirious that the album is a It&#39;s rubbish when you give ratings of 8 to Hood Hottest Princes, in the end all opinions are subjective, and that&#39;s why they have to be respected (speaking of the music) on top of that in vultures there are verses that are made on purpose for example BACK TO ME especially Kanye&#39;s, plus he does it with humor, something very Kanye.<br>The same as I can expect from a peeler who gives MBDTF a 6
Bro did a whole review and said it‚Äôs unreviewable ü§£üíÄ this is exactly why kanye is the goat! You will talk about him no matter what! Bro even listened to the whole albumüò≠üòÇüíÄ
I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever disagreed with you more. Vultures is üî•.  Not that I&#39;ve ever agreed with you. I think your whole gimmick is giving shitty reviews. If it works, it works.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
This guy will review murderers and r*pists and drug dealers but not Kanye lmao
Thank You Mr. Fantano
woke mofu lolüòÇ. lame
Even besides the antisemetic bs this album sounds mediocre besides Ty dolla sign verses. The last decent album he had was prolly life of pablo he fell off after that.
I‚Äôm genuinely surprised at this review usually this man has Kanye‚Äôs missile lodged in his throatüòÇ
ai cala-te
Just saw your meat, L left curve, overall im felling a light to decent 4
Came here for an album review for a monologue about Kanye lol
I came to watch this review because someone said it was ‚Äúunhinged.‚Äù .. everything Anthony says in this is spot on and is why I, a lifelong fan and defender of Ye, find this album unlistenable.
ant im not giving you a view ( im still on the ad for bumble ) <br>but bro im not trying to hate <br>we have had differences in political opinions <br>BUTTT <br>thumbnail alone<br>if u think this is anywhere close to a BAD/OK/MEDIOCRE ALBUM<br>you‚Äôre either hating or playing the role of sb that people have to hate on when new music comes out
Your wife left you, and you&#39;re mad Kanye is based now. He speaks truth to power, you cry like a little girl because it doesn&#39;t fit your fake liberal world view. Cry some more.
you&#39;re a hypocrite because you could&#39;ve just NOT made a video about this, yet it&#39;s the streisand effect where you try to make something go away but bring more attention to it. i wasn&#39;t even going to listen to it before, but now i will.
Watching kanye go crazy is like that artist that stopped taking his schizophrenia medication and slowly died. Dude sucks, but damn it really is interesting to watch. But the back to me with the Dogma sample and carnival with the uk football chant are pretty catchy. TLDR: album is aweful, but I did enjoy those two songs<br><br>Edit: I don‚Äôt know why but kanye reminds me of that zodiac killer sketch on this album cover.
And yet you still made a video monetizing on it. I‚Äôm not defending Kanye by any means, but you still monetize on his antisemitic album.
So let me get this straight. U can review albums and give them 0‚Äôs (which I assume would mean they are very bad) but won‚Äôt even give vultures a score because it‚Äôs ‚Äúunreviewable‚Äù? Iv seen u review many horrible albums and simply give them low scores, but for some reason refuse to review vultures. How it vultures different? If it‚Äôs a bad album why not just give it a bad score? It is ‚Äúunreviewable‚Äù? Or is it that u are simply too much of a baby to review an album because Kanye mentions things that could be hurtful to other people? And if that were truly the case, you would not make 2 YouTube videos about it and tweet about it. üòÇ but what do I know, I‚Äôm just a hateful, cultist, psychopath bc I enjoy an artistüòÇüòÇüòÇ.
lmao, anthony is deleting negative comments
This feels pretentious of Melon. Dude not everything is politics just listen and review for us
You are on the H3 route
Back to me instrumental is fire, Kanye is a vessel for greatness, like zenitsu when he&#39;s asleep
Kanye is not spreading misinformation and harmful rhetoric tf?!??? Were you there yourself? How do you know you are not the one whos misinformed? He knows his actions have great consiquences, and thats exactly why he should be regarded as a hero for what he did, just because he at least offered alternative viewpoints to the people that they woulda never heard from anywhere else. It doesnt even matter what actually happened during ww2, it only matters that a mainstream celebrity could still float a whole different alternative opinion about that (because there is close to no way to distinguish objective truth from propaganda now for 100% certain really) and not just get (totally) lynched for it because thats a basic human right and a great test to see if freedom of speech is even still at all alive. Someone like him should be able to spew that &#39;nonsense&#39; and maybe even be wrong about it because what then if that day comes when it isnt nonsense or he isnt wrong? And we didnt at least hear him out? Thats the danger in allowing any kind of censorship, the truth can get buried. And Kanye said that they sacrificed his mom... I mean, I get that hes mentally ill (newsflash, average person is nowadays) and all but that was his moms.. thats different from the Harriet Tubmann shit cos youd think hed know, right? And to say that its just a &#39;baseless dangerous conspiracy theory&#39; on his part and write it off without giving him the benefit of the doubt in an Epstein Weinstein world would be just extremely disrespectful, willingly ignorant, and evil. I mean considering what we know of Harley Pasternak, even from just MSM headlines I think that should at least be investigated. If even half true these claims would mean that this mans life is in danger by criminals who are above the law, and yet here people are on the fucking internet scolding him for not being politically correct enough in dissing his oppressors?! I mean its sickening really, its absurd. What about what they did to Kanye? Kanye is still suffocating on all of their lies, all the while you psychos expect him to BEG.FOR.GIVE.NESS!
Can he just review the music? Why is he crying like a libtard?
Can‚Äôt judge autistic ppl on the same spectrum
If it was called ‚Äúgood kid, m.a.a.d vultures‚Äù you would‚Äôve given it a 10
i see a lot of people bringing up &quot;the fader response&quot; and how fantano &quot;got woke after that&quot;, saying that made him biased against ye<br><br><br>fun fact, &quot;the fader response&quot; was a year before the kids see ghosts review where he gave kanye &amp; kid cudi a 10
hilarious seeing Kanye stans bringing up the Burzum reviews as if it hasn&#39;t been 12 years since Melon last reviewed something by them, let alone even talked about Burzum in any capacity on his channel
ANTHONY!! REVIEW IT LIKE YOU REVIEW GOBLIN!!1!1!!!
Same dude who gave sexy red and 8.
I noticed that the emperor was naked a long time ago. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Who made you a critic ? Who made your opinion relevant ? Who gives a fuk about your ratings ? You just listening to music . Why you critic music ?  ( It bothers you cause ur a Jew ? Say it .)
i only listen for carti
As black man I been done Kanye crazy using ass a longtime, and I&#39;m the South side of Chicago.
You have reviewed bad, misogynistic albums that came from the mouth of abusers, criminals, drug addicts, crime apologetics rappers... but this is where you draw the line? Ok
The album is trash. The end
I&#39;ll do it for you. The album is a 3/10. Has some highlights but generally poor mixing and some downright annoying verses and hooks. Some of the features just come across as weak and a lot of the songs are either forgettable or just disappointing. Not all of the verses are bad and it seems like Kanye tries to retread some of his old projects, but it just sounds like a mash up of sounds that has none of the souls of anything. The whole album has a sense of coherence and a lack on genuineness that just makes it come across as a bland cash grab. Doesn&#39;t have a good sound, doesn&#39;t have a new sound, and fails to surprise or impress me. Even if Kanye wasn&#39;t an anti Semite (and i don&#39;t really care, im not here to reprimand celebrities for their dumbass activities), this album isn&#39;t good.
I was skeptical af and thought it was going to be bad because donda 2 was bad, but frankly really liked this album.
üò¢Me when beautiful, big titty, butt naked women just dont fall out the sky
This dude is 100% the kind of guy that finds a guy on Craigslist to cuck him.
If death grips would have made this he would have loved it
blah blah yap yap shut up nobody cares. listen to the music and stop trying to be woke, it&#39;s dated as hell. You can still earn shekels without the narrative.
Bro shave the head
Literally just a 6 minute video of him being a hater and then calling the music trash with no real thought or consideration üòÇ bro did not even review the music
Might get hate spammed and I‚Äôll gladly debate any of you on this but if you cannot separate the art from the artist then you should not review music, art, literature, or anything. Melondome lost all his credibility here. Celebrities should not be used as examples for human behavior when he knows damn well that that‚Äôs never going to happen and never has happened. I‚Äôm not a Kanye glazer by any means, but this guy making these videos is in the wrong line of work.
Review the music bro‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt care about your personal opinion of him
M U S I C review. Damn. I thought if anyone would cut through the noise and just listen to the music (good or bad) it‚Äôd be Anthony Fantano. But I guess this is Woke-thony lib-tano, and would rather score social points. Hate it. Disagree with the message. Just talk music.
‚ÄúI dont care if he murdered someone, I don‚Äôt care if he burnt down some churches and I don‚Äôt care if he racist‚Äù -Anthony Fantano
At least Jesus is King isn&#39;t the worst ye album now
Love u fantano
Kanye was right. I don&#39;t even like the guy. But he was right about them.
womp womp
If jpegmafia had production credit you&#39;d have given it a 10
You‚Äôre irrelevant
Man just made like 4 grand to give his opinion of shit he could never ever create üòÇ thats insane how yall give people a platform where they are paid to speak on talent they‚Äôll never have
Such a bad review lol
fantano is a good music reviewer but as a human.. holy fuck this guy
I&#39;m glad i grew up in an uncensored era. This is what happens when you let guests in.
the fact that this got 1.6m views in less than a week thoüíÄ ‚Äúwho ain‚Äôt cash a check off my name‚Äù burn üî•
didn‚Äôt this guy review an album made by a nazi
The joke is that u can tell that he butt hurt about the jew stuff it&#39;s embarrassing.
‚ÄúIf you like Kanye your a bad person‚Äù like man I just like his music even the new album
Yeah. It&#39;s sad how much this channel has fallen. theneedledrop aka fantano has his own opinion for music which is fair, but this is purely, &quot;I hate the album because it offends me instead of just actually hearing the music. Ye is entitled to his opinion and whatever he wants to say is his choice and his right. As far as the music goes, the album sounded great to me the flows, the features, the instrumentals, the samples, the collaborations were all great. <br><br>Do I think it was on par with my favorite kanye album Late Registration? Absolutely not, but it&#39;s a different era and everything including music evolves. <br><br>Yeah this is the last video I click on with fantano. Completely overrated YouTuber.
Fantano we don‚Äôt wanna hear you cry about Kanye we want a MUSIC REVIEW
Nobody agrees with you mr woke
ur bald
this video not sponsored by Rogain
i understand not listening to Kanye cause of what hes done, but like I don&#39;t specifically understand why is kanye the only artist y&#39;all decide to take the moral high ground on.
i wonder how your ex-wife would review your marriage. what plaid should she wear? the fact you didnt even give this a chance shows how little you care about music
L take
If sexxy red made vultures, you would give it an 11
what a nice young gentleman<br><br>surely he&#39;d give this album a 10
Seems very picky. You still can&#39;t separate the politics from the art.
If it was called &quot;KIDS SEE VULTURES 1&quot; you would&#39;ve given it a 10
youre bald
He‚Äôs an artist. He makes art. Incredible art. You review art as art. But he went after the untouchable class. So now he‚Äôs subhuman to people like you.
CRAZY BI POLAR ANTI SEM1ITE AND HE&#39;S STILL THE KING.....
I‚Äôm glad ppl are starting to realize Fantano has no idea what he‚Äôs talking about when it comes to music lmao idc much about Kanye or this album (it‚Äôs fine, Carnival is amazing) but it‚Äôs about time ppl wake up ‚ù§Ô∏è
Literal clown.
This pasty bald guy is unwatchable
Couldve just reviewed instead of preaching. Fantano falling off hard. Just cus you review an anti semites album doesn&#39;t make you one or make you insensitive to your jewish audience.
ken carson !!!!!
It&#39;s wild that this guy is still butthurt over the supposed &quot;antisemitism&quot;. Most ppl don&#39;t fall for that media bs no more. It&#39;s like how democrats like to call everything racist so they don&#39;t have to debate about anything
81k likes that would be fine if you didnt also have 71k dislikes
L take
Ill be the 1st to agree that kanye is a shit person....but i cant co sign that the album is trash
Clown
Bro&#39;s divorce hit him in such an unexpected way, most guys would&#39;ve have turned into right wing fanatics, bro turned into a PC Karen
he nice at ping pong üèì
All I heard was you crying..... Is this cnn or something?
It‚Äôs pitiful to see that a music ‚Äúcritic‚Äù is incapable of separating the art from the artist.
whoops you just ended the 5 year streak i had of going without unsubscribing to you!!! nice job being objective u bald baby
this video is a seven minute long nerd emoji
if you don&#39;t smile when you hear that juvenile beat drop, youre worse than Kanye
Review yeat
Uhhhhh. <br><br>This guy
In your quest to selfishly cash in on virtue signalling, you let me know Kanye came out with a new album. Thanks! üòÇ
Ridiculous, rename this vid to Hypocrite 1
You needed this bump in views
Your X Wife isn‚Äôt unreviewable.
love how he calls kanye fans edgy 13 year olds almost as if his audience isn&#39;t 10 yrl nerds who can&#39;t listen to music that their favourite ytber doesn&#39;t like
Buy a rope fella
I wonder how many albums Anthony has reviewed in which the creator of it had literally killed someone in their past. but i guess THAT is okay.
I am of the belief that to platform the conversation is to nonetheless platform the very ideas you are in disagreement with. Fantano could have easily sent out a tweet saying he refused to review the album, but instead chose to post a video and capitalize off of the very same polarizing person for pecuniary gain. He is right to address it, but I think It takes away from the sincerity of ‚ÄúI have a Jewish audience and I cannot therefore review an artist that so openly spews hatred toward that group‚Äù if you are ultimately going to devote a video to that person and his art. <br><br>It‚Äôs even more hypocritical when you realize that he actually DOES partially reviews the album. Even though not by score he talks substantively about certain songs not previously released and gives an opinion. That is ‚Äúreview‚Äù
i hate this fucking guy, i never understood how can people rely on his opinions and praise him like a god, when all his reviews are just complete bullshit
wtf is this cringe shit lmao relax
He cant be ‚Äúanti-semetic.‚Äù Kanye is Semetic. He is the phenotypical and thus genotypical definition of Semetic. To be Semetic (Shemetic) is to be a descendant of Shem. The Torah Tanakh and the rabbinical literature is clear on what Shem and his descendants look like and on Japheth‚Äôs role in displacing them. To be Shemetic is to be ‚ÄúAfro-Asiatic.‚Äù People need to study.
he calls this unreviewable and deleted his peste noire and deathspell omega reviews. did he just forget to delete his burzum reviews?
you could&#39;ve just not made the video and further promote him. this is a cash grab click bait.
This is so fucking flawed because you literally review albums made by murderers and abusers.
Bad take melon.
Review the album and stop grand standing. You&#39;re a guy with a camera not MLK
Perhaps your fake sense of morality doesn&#39;t allow you to enjoy good music. Which is a shame since that&#39;s what you do for a living. More of a leech than a critic. You should realize that it is possible to separate the art from the artist
‚ÄúTHEY MADE THE TWIX DOUBLE THE SIZE TO MAKE US FAT‚Äùüó£Ô∏èüó£Ô∏èüó£Ô∏èüó£Ô∏èüó£Ô∏èüó£Ô∏èüó£Ô∏èüî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
god you‚Äôre such a fuckin puppet dude you‚Äôd be better off not posting this at all
Kanye fans are worse than swifties
Can you delete your burzum reviews? <br>They are very offensive to your jewish community.
saying jesus is king is better is kinda crazy
but in all seriousness i hate the stuff he does but this album fire
this would have been a 10 if it was called Kids See Vultures
How is it hateful if its the truth?? Explain
My guy. You are a Soy Leftist.
hahaha this dude is very lame
Karen reviews
70K disslikes.. Lmfao, i didint know that this much tik tok kids&#39;ve heard about fantano lol. The album is 2/10.
Kanye is definitely a bad person, has painted himself as one for years now, and will probably die in that regard, too, if nothing changes. <br>HOWEVER, I believe that any and all music has the right to be good, even if it comes from a bad person. Sonically speaking, Vultures 1 sounds really good to me and many other people. Just because I like how it sounds doesn&#39;t mean I have to agree with everything the music says, and especially not everything the artist who made it says.
Unreviewable 1 is a fucking joke. Ok, I agree with him that Ye&#39;s lyrics and what Kanye is doing is not right as hell, but not making an attempt to face the album and give it a rating proves that Fantano doesn&#39;t have the balls to drag his feet, into clearly not the best album. But the issue of calling the approach of &quot;separating music from the message/lyrics&quot; idiotic and his attempt to explain the way of thinking with the statement that the low level comes from the lyrics is an embarrassing cabaret. Music should defend itself. The lyrics practically do not affect the quality of the music due to the fact that people who do not know English in this case will not understand anything and when assessing they will (probably) take into account only the quality, performance, musical level, etc., and not the lyrics. Secondly, the lyrics themselves do not affect the level of music, because the lyrics could be written from scratch and keep the same vocal melodies and it would not affect the level of poor music. In general, with such a bias towards the message of texts in music,  musical horizons and objective view of musical content are limited. An example of such music that maintains a high artistic level, but spreads harmful views is the album from the Cantenbury Scene Little Red Record by the Matching Mole - Robert Wyatt (lyricist, frontman, drummer and vocalist), I glorify the idea of Maoism in the lyrics, an example of which is the text &quot;Righteous Rhumba &quot; he wrote directly that he would be willing to kill in the name of this ideology if he had to (My radical cheek is soft and meek / But I&#39;ll kill if I must / I&#39;d rather have the Chinese here / Than Europe he pushes me). Nothing justifies this, but I maintain a high level thanks to a very good instrumental performance. Another example would be the albums by Avant Prog, from the Rock in Opposistion scene of the band Henry Cow, who preached radical left-wing, harmful views (although this is a purely non-musical issue, because the band focused almost on instrumental playing, with the exception of the album in collaboration with the group Slapp Happy Desperate Straights, where thanks to them the vocal parts appeared. Alternatively, you can compare it to the cover of Western Culture with communist symbols). The third example, and one more familiar to the average listener, are the lyrics of Rage Against The Machine, preaching harmful radical-left views with an admixture of anarchic messages. The fourth example may be controversial and ethically questionable lyrics by The Rolling Stones, such as &quot;Stray Cat Blues&quot; (a song whose lyrical subject is a p e d o p h i l e presented in a neutral light), &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot; (the lyrics glorify anarchy), &quot;Monkey Man &quot; and &quot;Sympathy For The Devil&quot; (both contain ambiguous references to Satanism), and possibly the lyrics of &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; and &quot;Beatch ;)&quot; (where they positively described heroin use and preached misogyny towards the woman in the lyrics). The fifth and last(s) example is Ian Anderson&#39;s less than subtle criticism of organized religion from Jethro Tull, which may offend believers, in the song My God (which, by the way, is the first truly progressive song in their catalogue), and the lyrics of Polish group Kult, e.g. Onyx (which is a criticism of Christianity and Catholicism). I hope that my comment regarding Fantano&#39;s (in my opinion) irrational approach has proven my thesis, and will bring reflection to those who share his view. Well, <br><br>I wrote a bit, even though I know the guy only from this video and from this very controversial review of My Beatifull Twisted Dark Fantasy (many of viewers were , laughing their ass from it) xD.
melon thinks he‚Äôs gonna get canceled for liking the music üíÄüíÄ
Anthony a wuss fr he ain‚Äôt even reviewing the most notable release probably for the whole year just cuz he ‚Äúcan‚Äôt handle‚Äù Kanye making generalizations. What about the dozens of albums telling people to kill the police or say disgusting things for shock value or describe murders in detail which you have given fair reviews. You claim to not review his album so he won‚Äôt get publicity but making this video in and of itself gives him more publicity than just rating it a one would have. It seems very obvious this is virtue signaling as there was no reason to make this video other than to try to prove to people you‚Äôre a ‚Äúgood person‚Äù because you don‚Äôt like Kanye. And furthermore, you proceed to make generalizations exactly how you criticize Kanye for doing, calling his fans dumb when he is the number one artist in the world. Are you calling millions of people who enjoy his music dumb? At this point you should just rebrand yourself as a political channel because that‚Äôs all you seem to talk about.
&quot;I don&#39;t care if he burned down a couple churches&quot;- fantano
You can say vultures mid but You just shit Your pants :((
Thia album is trash...üóë
Just talk about the music bro jesus christ
biased
Why are people mad? He said nothing but the truth. Kanye is an anti-Semite, this album sucked (Some instrumentals were good I&#39;ll give it that), and you can&#39;t separate art from artist especially when it&#39;s IN THE ART.
Bro just rate the album
Lol what a troll.
fantano: i&#39;m heavily biased against ye<br>fantano: i&#39;ll proceed to review the music now.. u can trust my review<br>lolll
So predictable, what a woke joke.
It is mindblowingly arrogant how you lump &quot;kanyes fan base&quot; into these ridiculous strawman categories. You&#39;re desperately trying to call kanyes fanbase fringe radical people meanwhile he is the 14th most popular artist in the world. Honesty, your arguments are on the level of what middleschollers would say about someone they hated. Which is ironic because kanyes fan base is growing mostly with college and highschool aged people. Its hilarious how you can be immature and out of touch at the same time.
if it was kids see vultures he would‚Äôve gaven it a 10
Don&#39;t talk about the album then?
This review was bought and paid for by israel
I don‚Äôt like you at all
1.5m people just want u to say its a 10
Bros just a hater
Yeah needle, sorry to say, you&#39;ve completely lost touch man.
worst review
god fuck this channel
Here&#39;s my issue with Fantano. He now has to hold every piece of music by any musician to the same standard. Anything promoting murder or violence yada yada have to be &#39;&#39;unreviewable&#39;&#39; and when you look through Anthony&#39;s reviews he&#39;s inconsistent with this. <br>Kanye&#39;s recent outbursts have been horrible, yes, but the album isn&#39;t full of his views and there&#39;s only really a short paragraph if you piece together all the lines about jews etc so it is therefore reviewable and you can include criticisms of those lines within the review. Also the comments anthony makes regarding Ye&#39;s wife are weird to me. The lyric Kanye said calling her a &#39;&#39;reference&#39;&#39; was saying to see his preference of woman, look at his wife, because she&#39;s a reference for that. What Ye and his wife do is between consulting adults and she isn&#39;t a mindless drone she chooses to partake in their weirdness... I&#39;m just saying, Anthony should of reviewed this, because the expectation is now that he consistently refuses to review music by people who say and do bad things. The &#39;&#39;separating the art from the musician&#39;&#39; argument doesn&#39;t successfully apply here.
There‚Äôs another type of Kanye fan, Anthony, the one who loves his old music and is seeing their previous role model turn into the pinnacle of a jerk
he made graduation
Divorcetony Wifetano is here yap again!!! üéâ
Kanye is right about everything and doesnt need to apologize
OK NOW DELETE ALL REVIEWS ON TRAP MUISC AND OTHER MUSIC THAT PROMOTES HARM ON PEOPLE MR. MORALE üòÇ
Everyone calling your hypocrisy out cause you a soft industry plant shill and a lead for clowns
Melon is so irrelevant that he resorts to click bait clout chasing, while hiding behind antisemitism. He&#39;ll happily review albums from DaBaby who has literally  murdered someone.
Click bait to go viral and it worked ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Boycotting Melon
There are 2 sides to this coin: Kanyes fanbase not seeing anything bad in the album and Fantano just seeing bad things in the album not apreciating the rest
Anthony is PC now.
I love that Melon&#39;s perfectly reasonable opinion triggered the stupidest people on Earth
One of the best descriptions I&#39;ve ever heard about Kanye&#39;s music is that, from the beginning, it was basically &quot;Diet Common.&quot;
Bro made money off of the Album&#39;s hype by making a video yet ducked out of giving it a rating. Where was this energy when you reviewed Burzum who has said worst shit than Ye?
Genuinely one of the most enjoyable Kanye projects for me in several years straight up like 7.5/10 for me
A √∫nica coisa boa que Kanye fez na vida dele foi o &quot;Kids See Ghosts&quot;
The people in the comments getting so riled up over music, something that&#39;s subjective, is truly something to behold lmao. <br><br>It&#39;s a universal truth that all music is subjective, and i cackle and cackle at everyone going so hard not liking the music or liking the music. What a socialization downgrade. üòÇü§£üíÄ<br><br>People pop a blood vessel when there&#39;s anyone who doesnt like the same things they like, and i highly enjoy laughing at those kind of people, because the energy they are putting into it can be applied to making their lives better, however they choose to use it on opinions of music mixed in with insults and disprespect. <br><br>Truly camp. üòÖüòÜ
He feels this way because hes a Jew guys, nothing else to know and see hear
WOMPWOMP
This is one of the most disingenuous, twitter brained videos I‚Äôve ever seen. Do I agree with with the stuff Kanye‚Äôs been saying? Of course not! (Heck I think the album is trash.) HOWEVER, no one finds it weird that when you say ANYTHING negative about Jews, you‚Äôre automatically labeled Anti-Semitic. It‚Äôs a tactic used to shut down any conversation to pinpoint anything negative about them. If we can talk about the good and the bad about every community, what makes them different?? Kanye was pretty much saying that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre labeling him as, not that he‚Äôs actually that, if you bothered to read the lyrics YOU POSTED. This is the same community that got mad at Kyrie Irving posting a video relating to Jews and was beat into submission to apologize (HE DIDN‚ÄôT even make the video.) That Community is scared that ppl are starting to notice how much power they really have, and they don‚Äôt want to lose it.
Freddie verse went hard
70k+ Dislikes speak for themselves.
Dude made the most money from a non-review
KEEP <br>YOURSELF <br>SAFE <br>üòÇ I promise if you did NOBODY would care. There would legit be people celebrating. <br>KEEP<br>YOURSELF <br>SAFE.
Fantano,with all due respect nobody followed you for your political opinions
I don‚Äôt like the things Kanye have said either, but Mr. Fantano, you have reviewed tracks that literally talk about KILLING PEOPLE. And don‚Äôt give me that bs, that it‚Äôs just a time of release thing, some of the tracks released just last year‚Ä¶ so‚Ä¶. you review tracks that talk about murder, but not Kanye..
i am jewish and you aint going to &quot;heaven&quot; you&#39;re the king!!!!!! burguer king!!!!!!!
Wow this guy is out of touch.
If this album was called &#39;The Big Vultures,&#39; you would have given it a 0
bruh
Kanye is goat
Honestly bro, with the fuller growth in the center of your stash you be getting that Hitler look.  Virtue signaling trash.  How can Ye be a Nazi if he&#39;s black?
I am a ye fan but I only listen to old stuff like yeesus
I&#39;m sure you are a hidden kanye fan... 100%
So this is a political channel now?
See this is what crazy shit people spew when they‚Äôve been deprived of pussy for years
the album is terrible and it doesn&#39;t have much to do with kanye&#39;s ideological beliefs. he&#39;s lost the production magic since going so nuts that if he was broke he would be begging for money in front of the 711 with a tinfoil hat on mumbling shit to himself. most sufferers can&#39;t focus well in the depths of bipolar psychosis, to say the least.
no wonder his wife left him lmao, bro is hypocritical af, only playing the political card when it suits him
This dude‚Äôs a clown
Damn, those are some faccss
womp womp
You‚Äôre pathetic, just review the music.
Just came here to say that your standards of review have been outdated for a couple of years now. Your obvious bias invalidates any critique you would have for the sonics on top of u not being an artist in any respects; it&#39;s hard to take you opinion seriously
I like his previous 2 albums (Donda and Jesus Is King) but don&#39;t like the new one. I&#39;m not offended in the slightest by the anti-semitism. I like what he says in interviews.
&quot;Who ain&#39;t cash a check off my name?&quot;
I didn&#39;t know i was subscribed to you. I just unsubscribed. Leave your review and stfu.
Everyone who disliked this video proved his point, like at that point you&#39;re just brainless
Damn when you put it like that, maybe I should reevaluate listening to Kanye. The shit he has said is terrible and I wasn‚Äôt aware of his recent comments either. Wow smh
Beta male
Listened to the album. It slaps. You‚Äôre full of it lol
Funny how you don‚Äôt know Jews are black. But continue.
Do you know what the fuck is happening in Palestine?
Rarely do you come across anyone so self-centered as this guy. I agree what he says about Kanye‚Äôs character, not what he says about the album, but acting like he‚Äôs the spearhead of the world going against Kanye, and just sounding like 5yo when hating on the album, such cringe
The only thing unreviewable thing is your love life....<br><br>Sh*t you don&#39;t even have one
50% dislikes
Go ahead and give positive reviews for drug use, and Der and all that, but then draw a line with Kanye and stuff he says. You‚Äôre such a fascist.
Vultures 1 is trash but this is your most viewed video within the past year. ü§°
What he is saying is if you wanna know what my preferences my wife is in reference saying if a woman looks like his wife he thinks she is hot. How can someone who reviews music not understand simple lyrics? Cancel your channel. good music reviewer reviews the music not the politics of the musician. Your job is done. You suck.
the kanye meatriding in this comment section is beautiful
This guy is a dullard
So what I got out of this is‚Ä¶ 8/10
Kanye thinks he&#39;s Salvador Dali
yall a bunch of pssys
It‚Äôs crazy that from a music reviewer you can‚Äôt separate the art from the artist. No matter what Kanye says he will always be a great artist and he will always give us great music, think it‚Äôs time for you to just accept that.
So Kanye said he loves everybody but we are still running with the He just loves Hitler thing Huh?
Never thought I would say this but Mr Fantano seems to have fallen off
the rendition of beautiful big titted bitches is the absolute highlight of this review XD
70k dislikes
The record bangs tho
‚ÄúInfluencers‚Äù will make their opinions seem like a valid point. Guy don‚Äôt forget, your opinion is still‚Ä¶ just an opinion ü•±
self-proclaimed music critic forgets what his job is. drop the activist shit. the hypocrisy is boring us.
FANTANO you should review Jordan wards album it‚Äôs honestly one of the best R&amp;B albums I‚Äôve heard in a while
this guy sucks
Love this review dude, it kicks out the dumbest nazi sympathizers ive ever seen!
This album sucks
Another guy who thinks everyone who disagrees with him is wrong and/or a loser
For comparison, here is one of the bars he liked from the Sexxy Red: &quot;My name is Sexxy Red, I ain&#39;t no singin&#39;-ass bitch&quot;. He called it &#39;a breath of fresh air&#39;. LMAO
How about all the shit some other rappers say? Oop, jus gonna ignore that, and hate on ye.
so mad cause guy didn&#39;t want to review the album lol
It was good actually
&quot;I, a music reviewer, refuse to evaluate this art because my political opinions have poisoned whatever evaluation could&#39;ve been made of the art on its own merit. Ye bad!&quot;<br><br>My man, go outside, get a new wife. Disconnect the internet.
you act old and childish as the same time.
Exelent review üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª
Is this an actual meltdown, or a satire of meltdowns? It isn&#39;t a music review.
Lmao bruh u so pathetic
Free Palestine
Oh boo hoo, he mentioned jews like 3 times and now the whole album is not reviewable üòÇüòÇüòÇ
A music review talking about not music üòÇ
If it was talking about having sex with vultures you would have gave it a 10.
But music...bigger than a worldview. I separate art from personal beliefs. I could be so wrong. Tell me what you think?<br><br><b>update</b> as ignorant as this comment will sound to some, and others agree...it&#39;s just a question. Question more and stop regenerating everything you heard growing up.
Man has kneeled to social pressure bad
üòÇ
this guys channel is done RIP
When social media rotts you&#39;r brain and you can&#39;t even do you&#39;r job anymore. You have allways been a moron, but at least you had some spine and common sense back then.
To all viewers use this as a life lesson, Twitter rots your brain. Hope you recover Fantano
I used to like your reviews man tf is this
I guess it‚Äôs only cool to hate on mainstream shit you bozoüò≠
I‚Äôm neither of the 3 thing you‚Äôve mentioned and I still think he‚Äôs great
Not a great guy. Neither are many of the &quot;artists&quot; you review. It just happens that this is a relatively controversial figure right now.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=107">1:47</a> fantano has to be stoped
Are you reviewing the album or the artist sir?
Is the music good or not? Stop being an activist..
so 2 of the antisemetic things are him mildy joking about how hes not antisemetic anymore. and then one is him saying what the media said
Melon fell off
Kanye is dog shit now. His old music was grails. But his music now is the equivalent of that southpark episode where everything sounded like literal shit to Stan
my boy got paid there‚Äôs no original thought
Ye will live longer then you
About your intend for doing reviews, What is de purpose of a negative review?
We have artist that actually were are accused of crimes or went away to prison for some horrible things. While we got ‚Äòreviewable‚Äô albums. Leave the politics out of it, and enjoy the music. üôè
It‚Äôs such a self-report when people are defending Kanye as aggressively as they are.
This could have been a short. ‚ÄúThis album is unreviewable because I dare not offend the foreskin bandits‚Äù
What a hypocrite. How ironic a Kanye review is taking you down. No credibility in anything you say.
stfu and review the album
Unprofessional 1
People are really making a bigger deal out of Fantano not liking this album over Kanye being antisemitic. People have messed up priorities in this community
Cope and seethe lil broüòÇ
Beautiful, big-titty, butt-naked women don‚Äôt just fall out the sky, you know fantano?
hater... you a fucken hater....
you need a break from twitter man
How can you review music when you care more about the artists opinion than the music itself? Also not to mention you literally like music from rapist, murderer‚Äôs and what not
the thumbnail looks like anthony is very disappointed in me
Damn... Too much
I don&#39;t like Kanye, however the new &quot;Back To Me&quot; track is a masterpiece.  Those are excellent sample choices.  Lighten up.  Get the porcupine out your tushy.  He&#39;s not antisemitic.  He insensitively points out facts about the muse sick  in dust tree.  Smoke a J an listen to bak 2 me again, LOUDER.  That drum loop is raw af.  Gibber gabber masterfully laced it.  I now love TWO ConYay songs.
Sexy Redd over Kanye is fucking crazy.
Keep yapping
I truly hope this creates more listens for Kamye &amp; $ - most views Fantano has had in months
We give the power to celebrities to ‚Äútalk‚Äù. As Dave Chappelle once famously said, ‚ÄúWho the fuck cares what Ja Rule thinks? I don‚Äôt wanna dance, I need some answers that Ja Rule might not have right now.‚Äù When talking about the 9/11 tragedy.<br>I personally don‚Äôt like all the songs of the new album, but I do like some of the songs, I feel the first two tracks go unnoticed for some reason I really like them. Yes, you can focus only on the music and actually you should! Then on that, it‚Äôs of course a matter of taste and opinion. Stop idolising ‚Äúcelebs‚Äù. <br>You want your car mechanic to fix your car, you don‚Äôt care if when he goes home he reads flat earther blogs and believes them.
ok unc
Woke bald guy butthurt rambles for 7 minutes. What a pleb.
PAAAAAHHHHAHHAA!!! My EXACT thoughts after three listens. Been a fan of Kanye since his upbringing with Mos Def, Common, and Kweli. Tired of the disappointment from this man. I also agree about the God Is King tracks not sounding so random and pointless compared to this dumpster.
this isn&#39;t a music review this is 7 minutes of u cryin bout some jews
B @ L D
I want to like it just to spite you, unfortunately never was a fan. I do find it funny though how you don&#39;t talk about the music itself at the very start, and yes, his wife IS just a hot body nothing more that is the whole damn point of her existence. That is quite literally the world she created, and its hilarious you would pretend otherwise. <br><br>Waaah waaah anti-semite yet you&#39;re probably a zyonist. Who gives a shit anymore. His career is far from over and we all know everyone is a hypocrite anyways so why care about someones stupid political views.
If this was called, ‚ÄúHood Hottest Princess VULTURES 1‚Äù you would have given this an 8.
Total clickbait. 8/10
Yes Phantoma we heard you, Otis Reeding is the goat. Now get back to sewing and watching landscape
If it was called &quot;My Beautiful Dark Twisted Vultures 1&quot; you would have given it a 6
This has been a personality review channel for some time now. The narcissistic injection of self-perceived moral superiority is palpable. I‚Äôll subscribe again when it‚Äôs strictly about the music.
How ironic that you say you can&#39;t separate the art from the artist in this case, having Enter the Wu-Tang in the background.
‚ú°!
Even if u care about music,the album isnt higher than 1 or 2 at max
Ye, Drake and Taylor Swift, are the most overrated &quot;sheep&quot; artists of 2023//2024. Yes i said it
Thanks melon, I&#39;ll check it out
verified hater
kanye has always been gahbage you all just stoopid
find it funny this is the reveiw that completely ruined bros rep
If you dont even listen to the lyrics.. What in the lazy tarnation even is, Kanye West - Everybody... <br><br>Dude himself(Ye, not producer) prolly picked the first bass sample he saw, put it on his Midi keyboard, and just went with it without doing anything to it, and people go crazy over it.. <br><br>If only they knew how little effort was put into this garbage of a track.. lol
‚Äúhow can i be different today?ü•ö‚Äù
If it was called kids see to pimp a good kid, m.a.a.d vultures 1 it would be a 10
100% agree on this.
We already know who pays fantano&#39;s checks üëÉüíµ‚ú°Ô∏è
Kanye is old and has fallen off. An artist whose innovation solidified his genius has resorted to the most clich√©d of tactics to remain relevant, controversy. Homie should of chosen a reality dating series: &quot;Love Lockdown.&quot; Would of been more dignified.
The album art looks like it‚Äôs Arab Opposite Day. It‚Äôs like the album art is ABSOLUTELY SHITTING on Muslims.
Melon I still love you‚Ä¶but I love Kanye‚Äôs music more ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Look what Jews are doing to Palenstine, so now I like Kanye again
Didnt Anthony give sexy redd a like 7 or 8?
So far out of touch man
im glad i stopped watching after you killed thatistheplan, LMFAO.
now i understand why ur wife divorced u
This comment section is beyond pathetic. Personally attacking this man as if you are entitled to a review, listen to it yourself, find another review or reaction to the album. What do you people mean Kanye&#39;s views are just a matter of opinion? or that fantano is just a biased oversensitive lefty virtue signalling? Kanye is one of the most influential men going down a psychotic fascist spiral very publicly. To an extent you can separate the art from the artist by being mindful of how you consume such works, but when you are a large music reviewer there comes a point where it is irresponsible to dignify an artist&#39;s work.
When is the review for 2093 coming. Its an experience might i add.
I kinda assumed this guy would catch anti-semetism because of the &quot;deep internet anti-semetic transient property&quot; but I guess he chose the &quot;deep internet anti-palestinean transient property&quot; route.
ye apoligezed for it but yeah this album is pretty bad.
drop the politics Anthony please
This guy must be a hardcore Clinton and Biden supporter. ‚ÄúCan&#39;t say anything bad about people or I will say your album is trash‚Äù
Grow up Fantano, no one cares about your opinion‚Äôs since forever. You‚Äôre just a decent past time for us who don‚Äôt mind and opinion on albums. Ego check buddy, your not that guy
You really don&#39;t understand the bkack struggle!!!! And history that goes wih it it!!!!!
Dude got his rise from being an objective music critic. If you are already giving opinions before listening and letting your politics decide what is &quot;good&quot; you are the opposite of an objective critic. Just another mouthpiece for political narratives, it was objectively a good album to me but everyone can decide for themselves.
Descent albums he def pointed out all the shitty songs. But def a few bangers and didnt talk about the actually good songs at all<br>Had to unsubscribe
I&#39;ve watched Fantano for years and have more or less ignored his political statements but when he stops talking about the music and only talks about politics then that&#39;s when I unsubscribe. Bro is just hating for no reason and completely exaggerating Kanye&#39;s &quot;racism and hate.&quot;
Damn &amp; Kanye still went #1
Buddy needs to retire alreadyüò≠
why post this video in the first place lol
Bro you‚Äôre just like Kanye.<br>You‚Äôre bald and have gone crazy after a divorce lmfaoooo
This is why I‚Äôve never taken any of this guys reviews seriously
Fatano must be stopped a music critic should separate the music from the artist at least I thought this was a music review channel
But he made graduation
This guys is using this for views üòÇhe knows he listens to TE
#4: i just like his music
Your wife left you becoz of ur intolerable temper
Dude.  It wasn‚Äôt that bad.
Fantano refuses to review the only good Kanye album. On brand af
Who actually still watches this guy? He hasn‚Äôt been an actual valid opinion since he started virtue signaling everything relevant today.  Kanye‚Äôs crazy, but this album was great.  Yeah, it was probably one of his worst albums, but a lot better then the shit you 5 star now day lmao
Why would you review something you consider unreviewable?!?!?!?? lmao, you should review some hair products man
this guy reeks of soy
Hairline 10/10
Cuck
You had some good points, but you were really harsh considering you listen And rate rappers who have murdered and ruined others. And yes the mixing was bad at times but it‚Äôs a good album
Amen brotha
I&#39;m none of those 3 types you described sir. And I still thought it was a great album. And I don&#39;t think anything he says is even remotely as controversial as you&#39;re making it out to be.
i appreciate that you didn&#39;t even put in the effort to fully key out the album cover
whole lotsa triggered nazis in here goddamn
Interesting‚Ä¶ that is an opinion. An opinion indeed.
I know people don&#39;t like the album because they don&#39;t like Kanye, but we all know the album was pretty good, even if you don&#39;t like Kanye as a person.
Still the king
so u can‚Äôt just like some of the beats and his older music, u clearly have to be one of those 3 groups, got it.<br>I didn‚Äôt like this album, but i will not stop listening to some of my favorite albums bc of the shit he says, thats just some left-wing extremism bs from fantano.
Ye has always been consistent with his work. Even if you think it‚Äôs trash he has something for everyone.
antisemitism: unreviewable trash<br>promotion of murder, satanism, violence, objectification of women: great creative artwork
Kanye 1st and 2nd album was good. After that they got bad to worse
10/10 c r i n g e
Didn&#39;t ask for a Kanye review üó£Ô∏èüó£Ô∏èüíÄü•©
I haven‚Äôt liked Kanye‚Äôs last few albums, and he is a pretty insane character, but this album was damn good
Only the other trans kids listen to you anymore old man
rough numbers: 90% of the runtime had me making the vinemeat face while laying in bed.  5% was pretty good, 5% was passable.
If it was called &quot;My Beautiful Dark Twisted Vulture&quot; you would have gave it a 6 and complained about kanye for 5 minutes
Are we finally at the point where i can say that i never finished MBDTF and think it&#39;s super overrated?
100% valid review. IMO &quot;Paid&quot; is an honest track. Ye is spewing all these &quot;hard facts&quot; because English is not the only language, and controversy continues to be the thing that sells. He&#39;s kind of gone full Van Gogh at this point, it infuriating; yet somehow I find it mildly inspiring.
If you dont want to review an album, just dont review the album. Dont do this cringe, virtual signaling wank.
It‚Äôs a self fulfilling prophecy. Maybe try reviewing the music. Never had any problem reviewing music that is violent towards women or black Americans.
Your hairline is unreviewable: there&#39;s nothing there.
Bad and bald
Antisemite is a made-up word, noone cares
Someone tag me the timestamp where he stops giving his political opinion and starts talking about the album
&quot;Czazy, Bipolar, anti-semite but I&#39;m still the king,&quot; Kanye West. <br><br>Now i&#39;m not a Kanye West meat rider, nor am I a person who disagrees with him completely. <br><br>Certain things he says are so wild that it&#39;s impossible to even comprehend the validity of his words in an organised fashion. However, I will say this, I haven&#39;t always agreed with your views. You gave KSIs album a higher score than XXXTENTACIONs 17. <br><br>I love your Kendrick reviews they&#39;re on point, in my opinion, but when it comes to Kanyes new album, I like the album. I&#39;m not gonna let your biased take ruin my experience. <br><br>We can all say whatever we want about him, but in his head, he&#39;s still the king, and that message is powerful. <br><br>Look beyond the surface level topics that are afront to get a rise out of people and look to the message hidden in plain site. <br><br>He said on the outro, it doesn&#39;t  matter what anyone thinks or says, I&#39;m still my own person, and I take pride in who I am. How many kids or people in general do you know who are so anxious about what people think that they only live to please others because they care so god damn much and can&#39;t feel empowered by the strength they have within them that makes them unique? <br><br>All imma say is I see Kanyes message. It may not be packaged in the way you like because you fell for all the surface level bullshit, but beyond that, the album tells a story. <br><br>It&#39;s a story of a man who was being picked apart by vultures, and in order to remove the chains, he sacrificed everything and put it all on the line for the sake of freedom and to stand by what he believes. <br><br>What he believes may not be in line with me or you, but the message that you should take your power back by any means necessary and get rid of those chains keeping you trapped in an existence you dont want to be in, is powerful. <br><br>So, for me, the album is a 7 out of 10.
The guy‚Äôs just obviously very mentally ill I don‚Äôt understand why anyone would see it as anything more than that lol
Who&#39;s this Hilter looking guy??????????????????????????????????///
Another Fantano W!
To be fair nazism is a lot more than being anti semitic
The whole video is one bizarre kiss the ring ritual
So‚Äôs your hairline
Melon head be unbiased a review a amazing album
this is the same guy that said in reference to a different artist that he didn‚Äôt care if they were ‚Äúmurderers, burned down churches or were racist‚Äù(his words, not mine) he would still listen to their music and review it.
So now you care about demeaning language towards women in rap? Since when has that ever mattered to you?
Dudes just mad Kanye is rich and famous
GO GO GO GO
Soythano Lordtano here!
All I‚Äôm saying is Fantano says he hates kanye for being incredibly problematic and that listening to Kanye‚Äôs music only finds him and yet Fanta o continues to make videos about him and gives him free publicity ü§®<br>I love fantano and all but if he really hated everything Kanye stood for he would have just not reviewed this at all with a simple statement saying ‚Äúi refuse to support/ talk about this man at all‚Äù <br>Actions speak louder than words and it just feels like fantano just wants to make money from Kanye
In case anyone is wondering or deliberately being obtuse, he does actually review the songs within this. He says they&#39;re terrible and pale imitations of what&#39;s come before.
LMAO, Get over yourself.
You literally got shit on by ur own comment section lol. It&#39;s like youre reviewing Pantera or the Smiths. You have to chill bro. These songs are actually fire. You misinterpreted all of this album ‚ù§Ô∏è.
decided to listen to the album and it was somehow worse than my already low expectations. actually one of the worst albums i&#39;ve ever heard, maybe THE worst but i dont remember much about the time i listening to father of all by green day. even the songs kanye stans were gassing up were mid at best. they&#39;ve got auditory hallucinations when they listen to this i swear
Unsubscribe everybody
Kanye &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Fantano
What a joke Fantano is
Vegan liberal lol
ok so here&#39;s my opinion on why not to listen to kanye at all... it&#39;s trash
I DONT CARE IF HE MURDERED SOMEBODY OR IF THEYRE RACIST IMA GIVE IT A LISTEN! This foo has gone soft white bread ü§£
I&#39;m not a Kanye fan, but the performer&#39;s personality has never prevented me from enjoying the music. English is not my native language, so I can listen to tracks with lyrics without understanding the words and just catch the sounds.<br>by the way, I don&#39;t like the album
I think you points are a little off but your on the right path about the downward spiral. I think he made those comments to prove how powerful a certain group of people are.
Gad damn u falling of brotherüòÇ ironic knaye the reason u getting numbers
Hater üòÇüòÇüòÇ
you can‚Äôt say all this about the album yet claim that you‚Äôre not reviewing it
This is what identity politics looks like lol since when did this geek become the moral code police
So king von can kill 23 people and be fine but when Kanye says some stuff that‚Äôs when we draw the line? Got it makes sense
So, if he was a racist who burned down churches, you would &quot;welcome it with open arms,&quot; right?<br>Apparently, that&#39;s OK. Those were your EXACT words about another artist you were reviewing.<br><br>What a clown.
L review
Hypocrite
ALSO! why tf is this on streaming services but Donda 2 isn&#39;t? Like. I want that Security beat
yeah I don&#39;t fw any Hitler lovers by default but Fantano you a goofy
Why was I even subscribed to this?
oh shut up
I think Kanye West is the only human being to ever pass by on this planet to historically demonstrate that being an anti-semite turns you into an extremely shitty artist.
Fantano you just mad.. there‚Äôs some joints on der
If Ye came out and said Free Palestine on this album he would have given it a 10/10
your logic for why you choose not to review the album in this video literally does not track for many albums you&#39;ve reviewed in the past. its obvious you&#39;ve just used this as an opportunity to morally grandstand
But a song about a rapper killing 20 people is okay and is fun to listen to? Ur logic doesn&#39;t make sense
Bro... just say you dont like the songs and move on
Average review from a Taylor Swift fan
This guys sucks
you&#39;re a massive joke
Never thought I would see Anthony so biased and so unfair in an album review, a lot of music he reviewed until today says things as bad as in this album.<br><br>Never thought I‚Äôd unsubscribe too.
When you gave ‚ÄòBirds in the Trap Sing McKnight&#39; a 3/10, I was thinking, ‚Äúwhy should I trust this guys opinion on anything?‚Äù
But the based clown that has no problem reviewing tracks about black children being gun down, glorifying a destructive lifestyle, and ultimately further damaging the community..
it‚Äôs crazy that fantano can‚Äôt seperate music from the artist being a music critic and he‚Äôs a hypocrite reviewing artist that have actually done bad things but won‚Äôt review kanye who just says dumb shit
Fantano said Kanye espoused conspiracy theories yet can‚Äôt prove anything he said wrong.
So criminality, inherent deep-seated misogyny and glorification of violence in hip hop is fine to review. The glorification of death, suicide and murder in metal is fine to review. Both genres of which I listen to, and dont take seriously, as I dont think music significantly or directly impacts any of those issues. But this single album, out of every other album you have ever reviewed, is the only one thats too problematic to review? I think that is a pretty selective worldview
Just rate the alblum fantano.
So when carti puts an upside down cross on his album and disrespect the biggest religion in the world you dont care but when he talks about them its too far?
Starting to think he‚Äôs racist
Awe you leftist loon lol. You liked WAP &amp; other (C)rap music I assume. Review Adam Calhoun, Upchurch, &amp; Tom Mcdonald abit? You&#39;d lose your mind on facts alone lol
Album is 10/10
Bring back the dislike button...
‚ÄúSTILL THE KING‚Äù
Womp womp buddy
I used to enjoy Fantano and thought his opinions had value to me. I don&#39;t read into him too much and don&#39;t know what has happened but he has just destroyed his reputation as someone that can critique art. It&#39;s clearly demonstrated when he opens his argument about VULTURES being &quot;unreviewable&quot; when he begins talking about Kanye&#39;s character which is in no way important to how the music is reviewed.
Didn‚Äôt you review burzum and say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt give a shit that he is racist‚Äù yet you won‚Äôt do the same for Kanye who has said much tamer shit?
god forbid we just enjoy an album without buying into its themes
At the end of the day it is your channel and your choice on what you decide what to review and what not to review.
This is the worst take he has ever made. Him making fun and mocking carnival (and Carti‚Äôs verse on it) but absolutely loving Off the grid (and carti‚Äôs verse) absolutely blows my mind. Just goes to show how he went in hating the project before going into it and not respecting the good parts with in the album. He obviously made up his mind about the project before it even released.
fantano be like: hey lets review this guy based on his political views and not his music
This ish still bumps in the whip no üß¢
You must be jewish
Bruh you spent over half the video talk about kanye, not the music... and if you cant separate then you really shoulda left it alone... i can tell you&#39;re not crazy about kanye, but for you this seems like low hanging fruit... iono
ü´µüèºüëâüèºüí©
But Kanye was right?
look i understand that kanye west said some crazy shi- but like somethimes you gotta seperate the art from the artist
What a snowflake
Bro is showing his age
I enjoyed the album fosho
I thought this was supposed to be an album review‚Ä¶. Not 7 minutes of you pretending to be a psychologist
Why didn&#39;t Fantano talk like this when he reviewed Burzum? Honest question
H8ers will h8 :P
i think he got a point, he&#39;s just mad at him for his comments that it
ei pleshjo maika ti ddeeba
most critics are useless anyway
Bro it aint that bad tf
he has a point
üò¥üò¥üò¥ keep listening and giving him streams. L take
mega well-poisoning <br><br>if you dont wanna talk about the album, just dont talk about it. You really gotta make a video talking about how you don&#39;t want to talk about? Good one buddy.
bro really said &quot;like he&#39;s jesus&quot; as if yeezus doesn&#39;t exist
Ngl, trash review I‚Äôm thinking a heavy 1 to little 2. Tran- sition
You can tell by his tone of voice throughout this entire thing that he&#39;s absolutely seething for no reason
These people you&#39;re talking about are Swifties.
I don‚Äôt even like Kanye but I think you should have atleast reviewed the music more thoroughly. This channel hasn‚Äôt really been for political commentary, we primarily expect music reviews. If you don‚Äôt want to review the album because it conflicts with your beliefs, then you don‚Äôt have to make an 8 minute political video on it, just go live and explain yourself briefly. It‚Äôs good to keep music and politics separated, and it seems like Twitter has been doing damage to ya lately
Album is good if yall were wondering
Weak. Rap music has always used controversial language to address controversial subjects. Same with the rappers themselves. Evidently murder, rape, home invasions, white people, theft, and drugs are fine subjects but Jewish people? Nah. Ye has evidently gone around the bend. No doubt there. But if you think his opinion is a lone one  you&#39;re evidently not aware of Farrakhan spreading his message about Jews for decades. Let&#39;s not even get started on Black Hebrew Israelites. And these are all just obvious, surface level idiots.
you are 40.
just rate the music bro give it a 1 or sum shit and say you don‚Äôt like it
many artists have done worse like killing robbing etc. and saying bad stuff about jews is where you draw the line?
Not everything has to be political Mellon ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Shut up and review the album. Yapping too much
Dispite everything going on with kanye can we all agree the beats are dope?
As a person who likes Vikernes (ppl keep polarizing him through mass mainstream media rumors and twisted facts, just like with Kanye), Burzum and person who doesnt cares about Kanye. This review is the biggest piece of hypocrisy driven by some kind of personal hate
Why does this kinda looks like a diss track to Kanye
bad take bro
the melon really drank the jew koolaid
If it was called ‚ÄúWhole Lotta Vultures I‚Äù he‚Äôd be giving it a 10
Bro needs to log off twitter for a while.
yo ant‚Ä¶ shut up.
why are you so bald
At the end of the day, YE will be remembered for his work and music and will be praised when he passes from this earth. <br>While bald man over here slowly is forgotten about and has accomplished NOTHING in his life. <br>I literally forgot you existed until YOUTUBE recommended your channel because YE dropped a album.<br><br>YE got you 1.5million views on this video, not you. lmfao<br><br>Just look at your other videos, they have 1/10th of the views compared to this video. <br>barely hitting 40-90k views????<br><br>Do people honestly care what you have to say, cause i don&#39;t.
To be fair. This album was bad, like offensively bad. Some tracks were good, different but the entire production was pure cheeks.
your wife left you
This guy acts like he‚Äôs changing the world by getting angry at people on twitter and mean mugging a camera while talking about music lol
Hmm I don‚Äôt support what he has said but rappers have said far worse about different groups in the past and gotten away with it. <br>I won‚Äôt listen to his song on Spotify as I won‚Äôt give him the views.
Vulture, said what? If you don&#39;t subscribe to it just ignore it. Plants will waste time and energy for likes and subscribes and ride the algorithm till it&#39;s not paying.
bro review the stupid album and stop getting political
Let this be the thumb down button.
Anthany fantano is proof people only watch what they wanna hear
what happened to you man. i thought you&#39;re reviewing music
All the &quot;but he said song about murder was good ü§ì&quot; comments just proves how very few people, specifically ye meat riders, are able to acknowledge context before drawing conclusions.
(im not gonna say what race, what people or what media he belongs to)‚Ä¶ he is a jewish reviewer
Unlikeable 1
The only record I can listen to is bad forgiveness ngl the rest are pretty assssssh tray
off the rails and for once<br>I&#39;M HERE FOR IT<br>fuck the Ye stans, he&#39;s DANGEROUS
Boohoo üò¢ Kanye on top üî•
wow, another 7 minute video of a mid review of anthony fantano talking trash mad with kanye
&quot;This album is unreviewable....&quot; <b>PROCEEDS TO REVIEW</b> Ur opinion only has so much merit whilst hip-hop itself objectifies women, encourages violence, and promotes negative lifestyles... ur a hypocrite by ur own standards melon
This is an unwatchable channel
Carnival is the track of the year. Sick. Inter Milan Ultras. Kanye is a crazy genuis.
Bro yappin about kanye fans and isnt reviewing the album, your a music nerd not a culture or a fan base nerd, rate the album without being bias just to not get canceled, we all know the album was fun and enjoying listening to, you rated lil nas x and doja cat with their demonic shit
Man sit yo bald ass down
Can‚Äôt be antisemite , if your Semite
and your channel is an unwatchable trash
Wah wah, what is he always yappin bout, don‚Äôt give me your view of a person, give me a review of this album! Damn
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=20">00:20</a> Nice, keep it up!
shut up baldie, time to retire and get a new hobby
You not hip hop
Guy&#39;s moustache is suspicious tho
This guy opinion doesn‚Äôt matter
Fantanos value are all over the fucking place. Its nearly to the point where i think hes a bad person
Lost all respect after this one lmfao you used to b an actual critic now u j spew bs
You are bald
Sweeping the Jewish bias and financial backing under the rug is crazy
Good job you made me want to listen to the album
Black music is about killing and murder, &amp; now you just have a problem with it? Lol
I knew it, this couldn&#39;t be about the music. Ohh you&#39;re a gew ?
F You Fantano , Israel Killing Palestinians
i got 3 minutes in sped through a few more then put it on a monotone trash list!
Damn, Ye really got under your skin huh
unreviewable but it‚Äôs his job üíÄ
Lmao he only talks trash about Kanye so he doesn‚Äôt get only 100k views every video cause he fell off years ago ü§£
just review the music bro
Ironically, with that mustache you look closely related to Hitler more than Ye does.
Pathetic/10 from you. Review it or don‚Äôt talk about it.
Hahahaha you are having a midlife crisis its so easy to see bald boy get a life virgin
Red is a low vibration friend
Why tf is this music review a Kanye west political take. WE DONT CARE
üòÇüòÇüòÇ uthetha iKaka... Translation: you&#39;re talking shit!
shut up bot nbody lieks you
&quot;Watching him unravel is more entertaining than most things.&quot;<br><br>It&#39;s really not. He PRAISED HITLER, doubled down on it, and just continuously shows himself to be an absolute shit person. That&#39;s not entertaining, it&#39;s just boring. I&#39;m not sure why anyone, including Anthony in this non-review, is still talking about him. Time to move on and talk about worthwhile people.
I&#39;m a proud fan of kanye. a black nazi is clearly more complex than what you&#39;re breaking this down into. He is a master of his craft and I can enjoy his music without being offended by the lines you posted
Who let you have an audience
Anthony fantano trying not to rate a artists political views instead of actually rating a artists music challenge (impossible)
got no horse in the race, but calling people with a contrary opinion bunch of names is no way to win them over lol.
Nah bro is gonna still review rappers that knowingly promote the opiod epidemic in their lyrics that is killing people everyday sometimes even the artist. What&#39;s worse is some of these artist that rap about opiods have come out and said they don&#39;t even do them. Biggest hypocrite of 2024
at this point, why are you even doing reviews of his stuff?
how is it 2023 and y&#39;all still bald shaming
Your soccer mom energy really shines here
Antony as a Kanye fan I completely agree with everything you‚Äôve said, and the best point you made was about ‚Äòit‚Äôs in the music‚Äô which I‚Äôve really realised is true. It‚Äôs dissapointing because if Kanye and retired with ye, he would have a perfect discography, and JIK, donda and vultures have good songs, but honestly vultures will always remind me of checking for updates on the album, and being met with a picture of Bianca Censori in skin tight clothes. I‚Äôm tired of pretending this album is good because of the couple good tracks on it.
Sexy red got an 8 but Kanye got a 0
it‚Äôs kinda racist that after 3 and a half years you still can‚Äôt properly pronounce ‚Äúdonda‚Äù
Anthony Fantano when he doesn&#39;t want to platform kanye&#39;s anti semitism album: &quot;You can&#39;t separate the art from the artist&quot;<br>Anthony Fantano when he reviews artists who talk about murder, killing cops, and selling drugs AND said artists&#39; target demographic are poor financial areas with impressionable male youth growing up with no father figure (statistically proven) HEAVILY influenced by culture (lack of direction) listening to thug: &quot;They&#39;re just expressing the systemic failure they grew up in their music. It doesn&#39;t matter how many young teens with no direction convert to gang bangers BECAUSE systemic failure = no accountability on the influence your music has UNLESS nazism&quot;.
Anthony goldstein
Bros a graduate from d1 hating college
So you review rappers who have literally murdered people but saying bad stuff about jews is too far.
68k dislikes lmao
SHUT UP FANTANO
The amount of White Knighting in this video is cringe AF. Ironic how at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=170">2:50</a> he actually describes himself.
Burn was a great track. Carnival was okay. Every other one is just...<br><br>Gross
Ok, but now talk about the album men
Wait til he reads Miles Davis interviews
I‚Äôm confused. I didn‚Äôt like the record so much.. donda was a masterpiece tho. Ye has always been wild and crazy, self sabotaging and saying stupid shit. Wtf does that have to do with the music? It‚Äôs not ‚Äú unreviewable ‚Äú
There will be no loyalty, except for loyalty to the Party.
Shit like this album and people calling it phenomenal is why I can‚Äôt with Ye fans üíÄ. The last GREAT album by Ye was TLAP and maybe Donda but anything afterwards is ass. Stop listening to just to hear sounds and a vibe and actually listen to what he‚Äôs saying üíÄ. All because an 808 is in the track or a trap beat is over something doesn‚Äôt make it automatically a go my GüíÄ.
I miss the old kanye
You ain&#39;t getting his genius
ngl daboo makes better vids that this bald ass
It‚Äôs a great album btw. Everyone should go and listen to it for themselves. Anthony here can stay at the kids table and grumble angrily
‚ÄúCompletely unreviewable trash‚Äù says the Death Grips fan
Coward
I miss the old Fantano
Art critics deserve 0 respect.
Interesting that you take issue with Kanye calling his wife a &quot;reference&quot; but not &quot;my bitch&quot;. Your moral outrage is nakedly selective.
What is blud yapping about
Dont admit defeat
Bro review the music stop crying about his character although I agree that his character is not good
IMO it‚Äôs a 7
I usually don‚Äôt agree with bro but he was right on the money
I never hated anyone in my life. But I think I hate Kanye West.
Yall are wild, the album is shit. Womp womp
Talk about, drugs, guns, killing, rape, robbing,fucking and being the biggest degenerate as a rapper. All cool and reveiwabled <br><br>Talk about jews<br><br>Cancel!!!!!!!!<br><br>Ps i hate kanye aswell, fuck everyone, but dont be so hypocritical ü§£
WHAT are these comments jesus christ. cry about it weirdos
You&#39;re just mad cause you&#39;re bald, this album is really good
This guy looks and gives the vibes of the next BTK
Bro says stuff like: ‚Äúhe‚Äôs an anti semite‚Äù and at the same breath supports a known terrorist organization that commited the biggest mass killing of jews since the holocaust.<br>A true hypocrite<br>Dont think you can say; ‚Äúoh I feel bad for the Jewish people in my audience so I cant review it‚Äù
When did Fantano become an sjw loser lol
This guy is supposed to review his music but he is talking shit about everything else. If he actually didn&#39;t want to seek attention from Kanye he would have never made this video in the first place
This comment section is the defenition of coping
&quot;Refrence&quot; is commonly used in the creative world. Means that she&#39;s influential and other creatives in fashion and music will emulate/Reference her
I can‚Äôt remember the last time I watched one of your videos and you weren‚Äôt speaking completely through the lens of your own ego and opinion about the artist
Womp womp
Unreviewable, proceeds to review it
You talked so.much about Ye in a personal opinion, but not his album.
Kanye the goat idc
Review bombjng an album because of your personal slights against the artist explains a lot of your past reviews.  I literally do not care at all about the ‚ÄúKanYe iS a nAzI‚Äù youtube rabbit holes you‚Äôve gone down.  Lazy nonsense of a review.  The album is objectively and obviously not a 1.  Grow up fam.
The album is just incredibly juvenile
L take
I thought I was going crazy listening to this album, I just couldn‚Äôt comprehend how people actually praise this shit like it‚Äôa anything special
Bro shut up üò≠ your reviews are not even valid anymore
The ratings on this video is exactly what Fantano is going on about smh
fantano is mad that kanye is more than succesful and that he bounced back after his divorce lame ass
as principled as he sounds I wonder if he would have the same energy if an artist was islamophobic ? <br><br><br>this sounds like fake outrage anthony
Fantano is crazier than Kanye
But what does Cal have to say?
entony phontano bullshit eater
Ole hating ass
I agree with you not reviewing it, but I have to say, it&#39;s a bit late to start caring about him being misogynistic too. He&#39;s been misogynistic for years.
This is lvl of politics is the product of having global conscience. Its just music when you&#39;re not online so much. The reason i say that is because I&#39;ve never seen a jewish man claim to be hurt about kanye, its only online in the global conscious. Ye just has some wild opinions and he gets mad and says racist shit. TYPICAL HUMAN
Why can‚Äôt you just be a Man and Review the Album üíø. Fuck all the nonsense and feelings you‚Äôre üê±‚Ä¶<br>You‚Äôre really enlightening people on the truth by not making the review.üòÇ
Music is music kanye just wanna feel liberated
I‚Äôm sorry for saying that, but almost all your reviews you did in the past where total bullsh!t almost every album that you gave bad reviews became iconic or a masterpiece or was on billboard Top ten (WLR, Ken Carson and many more) so how long do you think? Will that work out for you in the future ? You don‚Äôt have really much knowledge about our culture and how music and rap is changing.
This is just another example of kanye being ahead of his time. When the holocaust 2 happens, you‚Äôll do a redux review and give this album the 10 it deserves
<b>sigh</b> downvote
If it was called ‚ÄúTo pimp a vultures‚Äù you would‚Äôve given it a 10
Watch &#39;The Zone Of Interest&#39; and re-view any pardoning thoughts you ever had about someone saying something even slightly anti-semitic.
Wait for Kanye fans to hear him poop and say its fire
The album is good get out your feelings
woke reviews 2024
Antisemitism or not, Kanye&#39;s music has always been shite.
Crazy to me that words have more power than actions now. What Kanye said and is saying is shitty but he&#39;s just saying his shit and not acting on any of it. Melon man still talks about Dababy who has literally shot and killed a guy, Will Smith still gets movie roles after slapping someone on live tv. It&#39;s crazy to me and even going by words Fantano reviews artists that talk about excessive drug abuse, killing people and being in gangs, racism, hatred towards cops, ect but Kanye being 20% more insane than usual? Naw thats too crazy
I&#39;m fine if he doesn&#39;t like the album, who cares about what arbitrary number he puts on an album. But to say that anyone who likes any of the songs on the album most either hate Jewsih people, worship Kanye, or be a loser with no life is such a childish and pathetic opinion. If its so unreviewable, then leave it alone and stop feeding the assholes content to be anti-semitic on. Bro was talking to the 1/20 anti-Semitic assholes on the stream 90% of the time.
Kanye stans are living in a completely different dimension of reality lmao
this is why your wife left you
fantano knew he was gonna get the views . smart melon
For those saying he hates Kanye, no he doesn&#39;t, he&#39;s given great scores to his other albums. Comment section literally proves his point?
Literally play Boi carried that album
I don‚Äôt agree with anything Kanye says or dose but the album in the music aspect
Not a review of the music. Just dumping your opinions and frothing.
Someone‚Äôs angry
If Kanye would have sticked to HIPHOP .. he was around the best once .. preemo .. nas .. krs one .. rakim .. like WTF .. why didnt he made an album with all those artists .. produced by premier ...
He comes in with an opinion already it‚Äôs not a review
You would&#39;ve given it a 10 if it was names &quot;Hood Hottest Hitler&quot;
Your mustache resembles him than Kanye&#39;s remarks
He reviews literal convicted murderers but not some 40yo who says stupid shit
I see you&#39;re Unable to separate the music from the drama. Back to me is such a fun track And has a beautiful drum set.
&quot;this channel is passionately dedicated to reviewing music&quot;
Well some people will say what they feel. I think the album is dope
You&#39;re just out of touch. Culture has completed overtaken your reddit tier cringe.
Cry harder?
aoty besides the blasphemy, dawg ye been bazed since day 1 &quot;i hate these (paparazi) more than nazi&quot;
He‚Äôll make a 7 min video fake reviewing Kanye Nazi West and telling us a bunch of bullshit we already know and, honestly, would prefer he not even speak about the album in the first place; but he won‚Äôt review TINASHE‚ÄôS SONGS FOR YOU?!?!?! WHICH-IN THE YEARS SINCE ITS RELEASE-HAS GAINED AN UNDERGROUND POP CULT FOLLOWING AND COULD ARGUABLY BE HER BEST RECORD TO DATE, LAUNCHING HER INDEPENDENT CAREER. NO IM NEVER LETTING YOU LIVE THIS DOWN MELON. FUCK OFF WITH THIS. SERIOUSLY.
Those like to dislike ratio is not looking good vegeta
Save yourself the trouble Anthony. It&#39;s not worth the views for you to follow this artist any longer.<br><br>I will listen, if these beats and a different version of ye came out like 5 years ago I may have liked it more but it&#39;s hard to not be grossed out by the doubling down o his worst traits. <br><br>The small redeeming bits will be stuck in my head for a little while but it&#39;s not something I will openly enjoy
Fantano, you can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs unreviewable then proceed to shit on the album. You gotta pick a lane. Otherwise you just sound like an angry ex
Fantano should Donate all the money from this video to a Jewish Charity.
Nah, Fantano won.
Pretentious and malding
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=335">5:35</a> haha üòÇ
please can you make a video called &quot;reviewable 2&quot; on the release of vultures 2 where you just talk about something else that ends in 2 (like idk portal 2 or something) and then do the same with &quot;reviewable 3&quot; i think it would be really funny
I watched the first 15 seconds. You must be kidding. Retire!
To Pimp A Vulture is obviously a 10
The reference thing was unfair homie. But you do you
&quot;i cannot review this&quot; <b>continues to review the record</b>
Taylor‚Äôs not letting you hit bro
It is a 7 on the bristol stool chart
lmao, I‚Äôm not even a Kanye fan and I enjoyed all the songs.<br>This guys opinion is üöÆ
L fantano
Stop reviewing music<br>Infact delete your channel
Thank you for showing who you are. Now I don&#39;t need to watch your reviews anymore. When a critic refuses to review something that is controversial is a sure sign they are not up to the task. Good luck on your future endeavours.
its kinda funny to see knaye spiral into argentinian insanity
YE OWNS U DOG
ü§°
Fantano has had some bad takes in his time: This isn&#39;t one of them
on point
You‚Äôve reviewed trap artist that have deleted people. What a self-indulgent take. ‚ÄúWhen you can‚Äôt be an artist, you can be a critic. When you can‚Äôt be a soldier, you can be an informant.‚Äù
keep politics out of music, 5hanks, good bye
unobjective, biased, hateful, but you&#39;re still trash
I wrote bad Little white boy and this video came.Idk why !
at this point your opinion doesnt matter
Boohoo Baby Butthurt Fanboys üò¢üò¢üò¢
not the nazi incels malding in the comments
Review the art, not the artist.
hearing you talk about kanye fans is like hearing anyone talk about trumptards üòÇ
Why is this even controversial again? I guess it&#39;s some type of controversial hate speech to hate on nazis now? I hate you all so much.
Yea my boy your tripping the album is pretty nice I jus think it might not be for you
What a condescending and self-important video
Mad
Wawawa liberal
All these people saying they don&#39;t care about the artist, are also the same people saying they won&#39;t listen to R Kelly cause he&#39;s a Sexual Abuser
If it was named &quot;to pimp a vultures 1&quot; you would&#39;ve given it a 10 and say it revolutionized hip hop
Very weird of you Anthony to not review this but endorsing King Von and other murderers. <br><br>Bad words trump murder I guess
I&#39;m so tired of this dudes ego. Valueless opinions. He gets hard thinking that giving his opinion is the say all. His opinion is about as valuable as Adin and Kai
two star and the dream police is so good
Anthony gay
this video is unwatchable
Kanye made you famous.
I personally didn&#39;t connect with this kanye record as I have with others but I feel as if this video is less of a take on the album and more of a rant on your dislike for him as a person and his fanbase, no hate at all but idk feels like this belonged on twitter and not on YouTube where we care less about political correctness and more of a breakdown and review of the product at hand.
Where‚Äôs the review???
crybaby liberal does another biased review based on his emotionsü•±
Anthony thank you so much for making this and highlighting Kanye‚Äôs recent actions, I don‚Äôt even know how Kanye West is still able to put stuff out after the stuff he said.
Is sorry but the part of this is for review the album so review it sorry but I‚Äôm going into antisemitism lol what is this album trash or nah
fantano and ye are about as unlikable as each other tbh. just like ye, went from good content to utter clickbait garbage.
melon has gone down hill since the Fader incident...
HUGE L FROM YOU HERE. BEST ALBUM OF THE YEAR
Bald man bad. <br><br>Nah, honestly I liked this review, the stans hate you because they know deep down that there&#39;s some truth to it.
Bro just ranting. The review start at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=305">5:05</a> and is totally biased
you can enjoy the music without liking the artist btw just a thought
66,000 Dislikes...<br><br>Emotional Damage
U review music, who rate it that‚Äôs what your channel is about don‚Äôt give me some history lesson tbh who care. If it‚Äôs a bad album or is a great album give me fee back. Stop grand standing. Review the album.
so funny him trying to be serious
Spoken like a bitch
People are genuinely so scarily devoted to Kanye they fail to see how badly his ego mixed with his status has affected the music. I‚Äôm a Jewish guy and I listen to a lot of Kanye songs from the past and the only way I can describe his recent albums and especially this one is the result of when no one told him no. So many of the tracks lack movement or depth and are incredibly simple structure wise. Ty constantly sounds like he came in to drop 7 basic hooks into a microphone that Kanye just copy pasted all over the record. And how you KNOW he truly can‚Äôt take no for an answer are through the mixes themselves. The vocals are constantly quiet it annoys me. And even though the sound of the record has a loose textural motif to it, it somehow still managed to completely fail to tie it together as an album anyway. Even if you could separate the ‚Äúartist from the music‚Äù Kanye would need to start that process. Because so far the lack of any true collaboration with any dissent is definitely what has taken him so far from Kids See Ghosts or any of his legendary records.
Booooo
So fantano, when your fanbase supported you after you made edgy comments and racist jokes would you need to be held accountable a year after your apology
finally,he has never been and never will be a genius.all you people made this fucking arsehole,some decent tunes and the rest mediocre crap.turn it in
If this album was called &quot;To Scavenge A Vulture&quot; you would have given it a 10
youre bald
Number 1 stream on all platforms. Bi-a-tch. Hahaha.
Vultures is number 1 in fucking israel and this dude wont review it.. what a joke.
Fantano got cooked by Akademiks. Antisemitism: Outrage. Black Death:
Go to hell fantano talk about his music not his life
i agree with a lot of it, but i&#39;d just review the album and keep this stuff off the main channel. people don&#39;t generally watch this channel&#39;s videos to hear the message this video conveys. in my opinion, the album itself is pretty awful disregarding the context anyways, so i&#39;m glad you put it bluntly
Old Kanye will never be topped
üëéüèæ
shut up jew
OY VEY SHUT VULTURES DOWN
Comment section jam packed with moroic teenagers crying like babies cause they lack any form of critical thinking.
kanya the goat shhh
Anthony, some of us will subjectively listen to music without having to put the artists life at the center of it all. Only thing we care about is it a good Kanye album or a bad kanye album? Not making a whole video as a campaign over someone&#39;s life. We come here to watch music reviews not you rumbling about an artists life mistakes. Unprofessional
Album struggling to even stay on streaming services and the Kanye kiddies are STILL crying in these comments 3 days later. L upon L for this cringe fanbase
This man went from dissing the music and saying some things about the man, to crying and bitching about the man and not caring about the music
just review the fucking album it‚Äôs not that hard
Imagine posting anti-semitic rhetoric on your social media and then criticizing Kanye for being anti-semitic. I dislike you both now, but at least one guy isn&#39;t acting like a SJW out there (as bad as he is and as shitty as his music as gotten).
He has a patreon goal up right now to review this once the goal his met
idk bro you review music so you should do that? by this sense almost all hip-hop song reviews should be taken down as they promote gun violence and robbery and stuff. i think promoting violence is much more influencial than anti-semitism. also you skipped carti&#39;s verse on carnival without a reason? seems like youre perfectly doing your job(of music review)!!!
How do you listen to Death Grips if &quot;offensive content&quot; is such a problem?
for me vultures is a 8, you shut up bald guy
I like this album, not the lyrics tho and i do relize this guy needs serious help.
After seeing the rich men north of Richmond review I was just curious about what woke take you had and you did not disappoint. It&#39;s pretty obvious that anything that comes even close to not be on board with you&#39;re woke ideologies is something you won&#39;t be able to process. Funny talking about the only 3 types of people that like but weirdly the album is doing pretty good on the charts I guess there are a lot of angry teenagers or whatever you said.
You said that this album is unreviewable but you still reviewed it.
Anthony Fantano Jason Whitlock should come together and rock a bye baby b*tch.
i wanna be fantanos bianca censori
Reviewed the man not the music.<br>Opinion Invalid.
Lmfao this dude is the definition of a SJW. He just wanted cool points.  Hes reviewed some HORRID music from HORRID people
üáµüá∏
you call yourself a ‚Äúmusic reviewer‚Äù and fully skip songs that you dont enjoy mf did kanye hurt ur feelings??üò≠üò≠üôè
Dude this record rocks
You use to run thatistheplan.. what the hell happened to you
I watched your reviews for years. But you lost all credibility with this one. Disliked, Unsubscribed
Deletes all comments, have bots like comments that aren‚Äôt negative:
whole lotta yap üò≠üò≠
How to lose all musical credibility in one video:
Remember this man gave Sexyy Red an 8/10
Look Kanye&#39;s wife isn&#39;t without fault for being with him but at the same time, I literally know nothing about her because he literally treats her like a walking meat sack to model clothes on
Separate the art and the music weirdo
Ye W
Antony Fantano is a real loser now
it‚Äôs trash to him cuz he‚Äôs a jew
Chip up butter cup. Youll be fine
Can we just review the music please. I in no way agree or support what Kanye has been saying over the last couple of years. Doesn‚Äôt mean I can‚Äôt rate the music as a seperate body to the artist
I love how kanye fans just sound like groypers now lol
You gonna cry bro? Sounds like you&#39;re gonna cry.
Fantano the type of guy to lissin to killer Mike
this doesn&#39;t belong on main channel
It‚Äôs not his worst album. Ye and JIK is quite bad. Keep our standards low.
Bro hates Kanye but won‚Äôt skip the attention he gets from talking about him
Review Vultures without virtue signalling challenge: IMPOSSIBLE<br>you&#39;ll review rappers that have literally murdered people but ‚Äúwords‚Äù are where you draw the line üíÄ<br>whatever heres a click for your dumb review, hypocrite
His fans are under 21 years, lol
Shut up before you get exiled ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Womp womp, focus on music bozo
Fantano is the typical hater
Woah woah woah Anthony the sequels are always worst in Kanye‚Äôs case??? What??? Late Registration and Graduation are better than the College Dropout.  I know you‚Äôre upset but no reason to lie my guy!
Kanye can get the bozack. It‚Äôs a trash album.
Agree or disagree, all music should be heard. He‚Äôs clearly crazy, but so have many other artists over time, some of the greatest were not right in their beliefs or in their head. That doesn‚Äôt mean we shouldn‚Äôt examine the music for what it is. I want to hear EVERYTHING from an artistic standpoint, excluding nothing. We cannot learn from silence.
You think if Ye wrote an album about dying while dying it&#39;d be a 10?
Cornball, hang it up dawg üíØ
Consp?...  Buddy (((they&#39;re))) crawling OUT of the ground
Always knew Fantano was alt left but this is worse than I expected. MSM doesn‚Äôt even hate on Kanye like this lol
Bros a hater
So you joƒ±ined the lynching party and but still looking to milk youtube money off the hype? What a hypocrite.
Review the album for f$@k sakes
This video is unwatchable 1
Maldy Baldy ‚ò†Ô∏è
I don‚Äôt think he hates just Jews - I think he hates everyone. He‚Äôs lost and gone now. Hope he can find himself again for the kids, or just stay out of the limelight for the sake of them.
Common Anthony Fantano L
The hater noodle deems the album unreviewable then reviews the album, but only reviews 3 or 4 songs. Either go all the way or don‚Äôt go at all. Clowntube at its fullest.
You ignore how good the music is review that
I feel like Anthony secretly thinks this album is a strong 7
tony fantano is unreviewable
What I‚Äôm curious about is the reputation Kanye will have in 50 years
I think he‚Äôs just mad

sounds like political meatriding, the first track is beautiful
I give this virtue signaling a decent 5 to a light 6
11/10? Got it
Clearly a review based on sitting atop a moral high horse and signaling virtue than any objective critique of the actual music.<br><br>The album is solid and has a few bangers in there.<br><br>And Burzum is OK but Kanye is unreviewable? So a literal Nazi murderer can have his albums reviewed but Kanye crossed the line somewhere? LOL
womp womp
You&#39;re a jew <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/NvgfY9aeC_OFvOMPkrOAsAM"></a>
so what about the albums that are literally about killing people
The thing I have to ask is where is the line drawn when it comes to hateful and destructive comments or actions from celebrities? If Fantano can&#39;t review this album properly over anti-semitism then he might as well take down every review of an album that glorifies violence, misogyny, and substance abuse. I would&#39;ve had more respect for him if he had just made a tweet saying &quot;I don&#39;t like this album and I&#39;m not comfortable with reviewing it due to Kanye&#39;s recent antics&quot; and call it a day. He didn&#39;t have to make such a big deal about it.
Ye da üêê no üß¢
I quote Kanye West about how I feel right now about Ye &quot;It seem we livin&#39; the American Dream but the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem. The prettiest people do the ugliest things, for the road to riches and diamond rings. We shine because they hate us, floss &#39;cause they degrade us. We tryna buy back our 40 acres and for that paper, look how low we&#39;ll stoop. Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe.&quot;
Why is this dude with hair loss, girl glasses &amp; a mustache crying?
Didn‚Äôt this bloke give Peste Noire a 7, and Burzum a 6?
kanye owns u bro stop meat riding for the genecidal jewz
The amount of denial in these comments is almost as strong as Ye&#39;s denial of the Holocaust lmao
GEEK ALERT üö®üö®üö®üö®
Hoodrat and paid are both good. Melon just has shit taste
Your wife left you loser. This is why you made this video
I don‚Äôt even trust you anymore even when you spit facts with your opinion you left with Lil Dicky. The album has plenty of music that isn‚Äôt even what you were complaining about and I feel like if it weren‚Äôt named Penith you wouldn‚Äôt have been twisted to think that. Also the reason he talks so bad about himself is because he doesn‚Äôt deserve to be a rapper, he is an average white guy and yet he still gets the benefits without ever having to go through any pain. And hearing him be able to spread this doesn‚Äôt make me feel terrible like you said it does. Now you just saying you don‚Äôt like his music is okay but your reasoning really didn‚Äôt feel valid.
Why is this about politics? I thought you reviewed music bruh
Pushing divorce
your wife left you for a reason
Fantano isn&#39;t allowed to like Ye anymore. He&#39;s ok with the common degenerate musical artist, but Ye? No way! üòÇ
Fantano confirmed Jew
I do think it&#39;s a bit silly that Fantano made this video to begin with (he should have just not talked about the album at all IMO) but the absolute meltdown of terminally online who have an unhealthy obsession with either of them (or both) is infinitely more silly. Just like how Fantano should have ignored Kanye&#39;s new album people who don&#39;t like Fantano should just ignore this video. It&#39;s all just goofy as hell, man.
music review starts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=251">4:11</a> <br>hope this helps üòÅ
Cope and seethe, Kanye fans, cope and seethe.
you are so bald lol
‚Äú4. People who think the beat is good and flow goes hard.‚Äù Idk man I just think some of the songs sound good.
You gave Dark Fantasy a 6. This album is fireüî•üî•üî•
If Fantano truly wanted to bury this album, he probably should&#39;ve just ignored it. Fact is, I learned about this release via this very video. This &quot;review&quot; only gives more publicity to Vultures 1, which I&#39;ll bet is exactly what Kanye wants.
Damn Fantano an old head with this one RIP and panders üíî
Spoken like a true soyboy.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=255">4:15</a> id agree if the lyrics including anti-semantic contents but those lyrics definitely seem more about Kanye going against the media (which he‚Äôs done a lot) rather than actually being anti-semitic
shut it lefty
This guy is an absolute trash with no basic judgement for which he graded vultures as unreviewable, like dude looks like ü§ì and don&#39;t know what he is talking, except being a talking egg
you look like someone who is very vocal about IPA‚Äôs
cringe.
Fuckin triggered boi
Bro shut the fuck up and just review the damn album man do your job!!! üòÇ
this comment section has taken 10000000 years off my lifespan. none of y&#39;all are beating the dickriding allegations
This hipster is literally what wrong with society.  A hipster reviews music specifically on everything but the music
Bro you‚Äôre being so political, I thought you thought you review music
Why even make the fuckin video then tho like surely if you feel like this it&#39;s not even worth making a video
This is why he&#39;s a culture vulture. You&#39;re so worried about shitting on Ye. You can&#39;t tell good music and also, you gave zero reviews on Usher&#39;s new album and he just did the superbowl. FYI you look like who Ye admired and has your panties in a bunch üòÇ
You review Verzum but still skip this shit
Fantano you are weak. <br>Cal would have reviewed the album.
this album fucking suuuucked

If this was called &quot;Hood&#39;s Hottest Vulture&quot;, You would have given it an 8
Yea this album is eh. I think that song Burn needs to be talked about tho. He actually sounds like Kanye and not Ye. If wasnt for that R.Kelly reference i would think it&#39;s an old track in which Ty was added.
No one gives a fuck about your takes.
Lmfao
Beg forgiveness has that great choral buildup and is good music - get the instrumental , it&#39;s great music
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=335">5:35</a> did he say the n word?
Kinda goes hard in 3rd listen
You took the L
boooooo
You call the album unreviewable, yet you still try to review it
such an acoustic take you&#39;re absolutely dumb
this guy stinks!
unwatchable 4,359
just give it a number tho, like a 7 or sum idk
yo, Anthony is irrelevant now? what a crybaby.
The Jewish stuff is kinda funny so ima keep enjoying it
üëç77K<br><br>üëé65.435<br>Melon won.
He‚Äôs such a joke üòÇ
okay joo boi
The hypocrisy. You can‚Äôt review Kanye but review people who have committed felonies is crazy.
isn&#39;t this like your 3rd(that im aware of) video about Kanye now ?<br>im not here to defend the man as all the backlash he&#39;s said over the recent years has been diminishing his status little by little. I do feel like its big platforms such as yours that keep what ever wild things Kanye says relevant to a certain extent. its also odd that every time you talk about Kanye its always recorded as if your attitude is &quot;I dont want to talk about this but I have to.&quot; <br>no one is making you talk about him other than yourself and the ad venue you&#39;re chasing at this point. <br>take a break from YouTube and twitter my dude for your mental health at this point.
The thumbnail transition to the video got me üíÄüíÄüíÄ
I liked Jesus is King and im not sorry about it
Must be gay
I genuinely don‚Äôt understand why this video or Fantano‚Äôs take is so controversial.
what a soy move. too bad fantano can afford to do it
If this was uploaded on the &quot;fantano&quot; account and not on the account where he is supposed to review music, I feel like a lot more people would actually agree with his logic
yeah this album was shit
Lol yea but it‚Äôs the #1 album globally tho..
i don&#39;t honestly care about the music ( haven&#39;t listened to the album ) nor have i ever liked kanye that much either way, but i think it&#39;s deeply hypocritical to make such statements when not even a couple of months ago you reviewed Ben Shapiro&#39;s song  with enthusiasm when he is a guy calling for genocide and being utterly racist calling a certain population animals and sub-humans etc... does your ethical and moral sense follow a certain pattern or is anti-semitism more of a crime than any of the other hate crimes.
Alright well don‚Äôt review it then move on and never do a kanye album. Or black music that promotes death <br>Pick something else bud
I feel like it‚Äôs hypocritical of you to review black cultural music where they‚Äôre talking about shooting each other and killing each other when they see each other and you don‚Äôt speak on it but when it comes to a certain demographic of people it‚Äôs a problem. Don‚Äôt review Black people music if you‚Äôre not going to be consistent all the way through.
youre literally a vulture lol the irony
Booger Nick!!
It‚Äôs funny because he WILLINGLY reviews young thugs latest album with the crazy allegations that came to light.
Gay as hell for this ü§£ like just shut up and review something else
I‚Äôm sorry, I can‚Äôt trust a critic who deadnames Ye so nonchalantly. Overall great video light 9/10 has a little something for everyone
He wanted out of his deals every contract he signed he wanted out of them so he could do it the way he wanted to do it. And his lawyers told him that there was literally no way out of any of them. And he said I&#39;m going to find a way and then he started saying some of the most ridiculous outlandish crazy hurtful things he could possibly say. And I interpret some of the lyrics you mentioned differently. When he says&quot; crazy , bipolar antisemite .......<br>Forgot what I was saying but this album has at least two albums that would be lower on a list of Kanye&#39;s best, albums.
Im gonna give this review a 4. Could have stuck with a unreviwable direction, but still somehow reviewed it without giving a commited review. 4/10
You are an absolute ignorant. (This is my first ever hate comment ever posted online)
You reviewed neo-Nazi Varg Vikernes and his band Burzum and said &quot;you can&#39;t stop me&quot; from reviewing that.  Varg is a convicted murderer.  You&#39;re a joke.
I bet this guy is vaxxed and boosted.
I could barely even get through the first 5 tracks before I bowed out and deleted Vultures from my Apple Music library. After how good  Donda was, I‚Äôm disappointed in Ye and Ty.
It was a great album you‚Äôre yapping
yo how about worry about the music? nobody cares about this pandering
dont forget that fantano thinks that sexyy red album is better than: all denzel curry work ever, kendrick lamar big steppers, kendrick lamar section 80, kanye west MBTDF, all travis scott work, all eminem work, all lil wayne work...
Lol thanks for the anti-kanye review
dont forget that fantano thinks that sexyy red album is better than: all denzel curry work ever, kendrick lamar big steppers, kendrick lamar section 80, kanye west MBTDF, all travis scott work, all eminem work, all lil wayne work...
womp womp
I miss the old Kanye
Fantano claiming kanye fans are just &quot;lonely&quot;.... If anyone is lonely its the bald unattractive guy who has some of the worst taste in music ever due to lack of brain power. Watch this video over and you genuinely are just going after kanye for everything he&#39;s done outside of music, meanwhile you&#39;re a music review channel so you&#39;re supposed to be reviewing music and not looking into this guys fucking life. To claim kanye fans have a meaningless life and the productoion was bad on the album is insane. Considering you dont even know how to work a green screen properly after being a YouTuber for years is kind sad, not to mention how meaningless your life is cus you just review music like you genuinely have no talent. Yet you are first to judge others music based on what happens in their social lives. (everybody makes mistakes fantano people like you aren&#39;t okay with mistakes?)
are you activist or music reviewer? also its so funny how you like oversexualised shit like sexy red or lil pump which has &quot;mysogonistic&quot; lyrics but hate kanye for way lighter lyrics XD
I mean, why release this video then?
Anyone else like me? Tone deaf to any lyrical meaning. Just listening to music to block out the noise that is the whole world crying in sufferage. No? Ok
I‚Äôm jewish and I love Kanye!!!
still better than most top 40
Would have to agree üëç
ü´•ü´•ü´•‚Ä¶..I like the album overall
Yeah, no, if you aren‚Äôt gonna review it‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt review it, I came to see what he‚Äôd say after my own personal listen and this was so honestly trash, what a wasteful upload
Pretty sure if it was called &quot;To Pimp a Vulture&quot; itd be a 10
crazy you reviewed an entire actual Nazi ! and said you didn&#39;t care about his personal politics and the shit hes&#39;s done... wild times
Based. Antisemites seethe.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=105">1:45</a> üòÇ This is such a reach. It‚Äôs rap music. When someone like Jay Z or Kendrick Lamar says something bad about women it‚Äôs a masterpiece but cause it‚Äôs Kanye now it‚Äôs a new low?  This is a music review. You should have just titled it. ‚ÄúRanting about the mentally ill‚Äù
Rename this garbage to a podcast already oh my God the yapping
I gotta say I think someone forgot their ass hair on your face
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=303">5:03</a> When he starts actually reviewing the album
lmfao, the biggest review clown on the internet has apparently decided spewing a bunch of antisemitism is worse than actual murder and rape, weird take man. as a Christian who has a half Jewish cousin Im not a fan of anyone who spews antisemitic shit, I also am not a fan of murder and rape, a lot of your reviews are of people who have done those two crimes and wernt held responsible for their actions, god will hold them responsible but as for your pathetic display of grandstanding, its sad
You did a review on Kanye‚Äôs life. You fell off more than Kanye
Anthony can you review brace yourself - glasshealer live please?
if it was called cultures instead of vultures u would have gave it a 10
bro&#39;s just mad. Disrespect to his wife too he&#39;s extra mad
Never in my 20 years as a teacher ahh rating
Thank you for saying this as a philosemite who dislikes Israel and Zionism I personally feel you‚Äôre awesome, I call myself a crypto-jew being a thelemite I loved your current 93 review, This stuff needed to be said HasanAbi sent me. Do as thou wilt shall be the whole of the law love is the law love under will
Your sponsors want you to say trash Kanye, we get it.
IM STILL THE KING!!! ü§¥ü§¥ü§¥
STILL THE KING
Hating on the music before he even listened to it. The album is actually pretty damn good.
Kanye‚Äôs downward spiral has been probably the saddest thing
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=334">5:34</a> what did bro say?
I think he may be more upset that he can‚Äôt enjoy the music anymore
who cares

Please review Baby Shark‚Äôs Big Movie soundtrack for the kids.
Stop the yapping, just rate the music dawg
üòÇthis man has no life fr
You get upset about kanye music. But these other are saying the worse shit ever and some are poisoning younger generations mind. Saying it okay do these stuff. But yet I don&#39;t see you making a strong hate video about them. Plz don&#39;t a hypocrite. When I don&#39;t see you push to say this is bad to other artists. I&#39;m not about like eminem are these og artists. I&#39;m about like that mumble rapper and younger generations rapper. Do better
womp womp retigga
You are such an insufferable person, almost as much as Kanye
Sexy redd got an 8? You have zero moral backbone. Remember Burzum
when you say &quot;Guys, you arent supposed to like this album.&quot; its gonna make more people check it out.
Well you made history because you reviewed an unreviewable  album.
L
Kanye went from Heartless to hot mess.
anthony Mad tano<br><br>back to me is sick btw
ur wife left you üòÇüòä
Lol buzz words the review.  Could a saved everyone some time and just said he&#39;s an asshole and moved on.
if kanye was a wife beater and ran a gang instead of being anti semit then fantano would fairly review this album
As a Christian, I feel very hurt by Kanye.
u wan that clout so bad
Fantano no longer vibes with the kids. Sorry Jake but you an old hat now
This is a person review not a music review
Damn dudes a hater I love Kanye gospel stuff and I‚Äôm not really for this new demonic vibe he got going on and even I can admit the album is a banger
When did music reviews become so political ü§î Bruh, the music is good. Production is on another level. Album Of The Year so far. Worst review ever! He just mentioned tracks he didn&#39;t like.
Ok Hitler boy
I thought it was pretty good
How many dislikes does this have?
you&#39;re proving ye right so bad that it seems like it&#39;s on purpose
Dude stfu and just review the album. Kanye said bad shit okay? You‚Äôre a grown up, you don‚Äôt have to say anything about what he said. Kanye is still the greatest producer and rapper of all time. Do your job bro
You should do a review of your narrow mind boy... Relax take a Xan
U&#39;re a hater
Kanye is the goat üêê
Needledrop really fell off. Unsubbing after 13 years. The death of music reviews is now complete
Incredible we finally found a way to shut this guy tf up, yet he&#39;s still talking.. strange.
I‚Äôm not even a Kanye fan but Beg Forgiveness is song of the year.
Review starts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=306">5:06</a>
Well said mr fantano
How is this an attempt at a review and not a full frontal attack on the person? This should be about the music. Not about his more than dubious statements. You are contradicting yourself in every other sentence. You just want it to suck.
but your honor he made graduation
what ive been sayin
BEG FORGIVENESS
This album is fireüî•üî•üî•üî•
I agree with u üíØ
Kids see ghosts was truly his last genius work<br><br>DONDA was alright but let‚Äôs be honest it‚Äôs easily forgettable
if the album was called &#39;kids see vultures&#39; you wouldve given it a 10/10
<b>Gets Exiled</b> üíÄ
Anthony trash fr
To be honest... The album is trash tho... Remember when people disliked &#39;Pablo&#39; for being the weakest of his discography?
You are trash bro, get ya money up
ohhh nah nah needledrop i listen to ya last review it sucks
Honestly Kanye<br>Has become someone who is self absorbed and this album is super trash nothing on this album is not worth listening to at all
you are the priceless one with your bald head and fake moustache
You disrespect kanye&#39;s album 10/7 in my opinion
You don‚Äôt need to convince or categorize fans. Who made that your official job? YouTube is shoving your videos in our face, what do you ‚Äúcreate‚Äù opinion? You don‚Äôt lead discussion, you‚Äôre biased therefore making you untrustworthy media.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=249">4:09</a> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=271">4:31</a> just watch this over and over again untill u get it. I understand your opinion.
the Kanye fandom reminds me of the emperors new clothes. no one can seem to admit the album, musically, is mediocre.
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇit‚Äôs fukinh music my guy
I agree with most of Melon‚Äôs takes over the last 10 years but I think he goes wayyy too hard on both Kanye and Jon Bellion for reasons I can‚Äôt seem to understand ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
This album has the hardest beats since TLOP. That is all I have to say.
Like you can hate on jews thats fine, but why idolize Nazi ideologies. There is a lot more to what it meant to be a nazi than just hating on jews...
BOOOOOOOOOOOO
if this was called ‚ÄúTo Pimp A Vulture‚Äù bro would have given it a strong 9 üíÄüíÄüíÄ
You look so fed up in the first 10 seconds, I had to tune in üòÇ
When did Fantano become a loser?
You&#39;ve reviewed the music of actual criminals, murderers, racists and homophobes. You&#39;ve even reviewed the music of antisemites. Why do you draw the line here?<br><br>You brought up some of the lines from the album where he&#39;s referring to the controversy surrounding his controversial statements, and said that it&#39;s impossible to seperate the art and the artist in this case, but none of those lines are even inherently antisemitic. Not to mention that even if they were obviously antisemitic it&#39;s still possible to seperate the art from the artist. One of my favorite examples of seperating art from artist is the 1915 movie &quot;Birth of a Nation&quot;. It&#39;s a deeply racist film, but it&#39;s still considered one of the greatest masterpieces of that time by most critics and film historians because of how innovative it was. I don&#39;t see how it&#39;s harder to seperate the art from the artist in a case where the artist says something that can be interpreted as vaguely antisemitic vs a film that promotes slavery, was important in the revival of the KKK and led to countless actual murders.<br><br>One of critics&#39; most important jobs is to analyze the piece of art to gain insight into the artist, the medium in general or what it can tell about society or the human condition. This album is perfect for that kind of analysis. It&#39;s the opposite of &quot;unreviewable&quot;. It&#39;s maybe the most &quot;reviewable&quot; and most relevant album of the year considering the war in Palestine, the increase in antisemitism and the rise of extremist movements.
I think Swift won this war.
You&#39;ve literally reviewed Burzum
Actual murderers bragging about murder: 8/10<br>Kanye: so morally reprehensible that it cannot be talked about
gay
Kanye is washed. his lyricisms gotten mid
how can i be different today
Cope more baldcel LOL
Just an immature non-review
Avarage Killer Mike lover
KARANTHONY  you are not correct.   That is all.
this isnt a album review
See this is why I would never be a sub to this channel. Like 10 min wasted saying mombo jumbo bs just to cover his ass when no one is hunting him for anything. All we want from you is to critize the music nothing else dawg and you only did that for about 40 seconds. Focus on what you know which is music. Please and thank you
Bro just Say that is a 2/10 bro
Kanye from 2004 to 2018 was phenomenal
Butthurt Baldheaded Big Boys don&#39;t fall out the sky ya know
If the album was called Late Vultures 1 you would‚Äôve given it a 7
you trippin
giga cringe
How nice of Fantano to sum up the essence of his video in the first 4 seconds.
Just yapping tbh‚Ä¶
Nice virtue signaling Music Karen!!
I didn&#39;t like this album that much and thought it was just not good.
L take
Womp womp zionist
The fall of ye
And you know what is worse? Since the hitler fiasco, Kanye went from 48-50 millions monthly listeners, to 64 millions. He is unstopabble by other human beings. It is over, only when Christ judges him will he stop.
I don&#39;t understand why people hate ur review, i&#39;m neither a ye fan nor nor a ye hater but that&#39;s genuinely the worst album i&#39;ve ever heartd. That thing is so bad i don&#39;t understand how he didn&#39;t make that in a day
Dude, your commentary on his political or personal views have zero to do with this album. You&#39;re reviewing him as a person and not the album. &quot;Beautiful big titties butt naked women don&#39;t just fall out of the sky you know.&quot;<br><br>And no, I&#39;m not a fan of everything Kanye does. And I can&#39;t say every album he&#39;s done is fire. But you just spouted woke bs for 7 minutes.<br><br>No, you&#39;re too ignorant to review this album.
ye has to many fanatics, so he can never loose
bro cannot cook at his big age
Or 4: people who separate the artist from the art. Youre going too deep melon
this is the best album he&#39;s made since yeezus you are coping SOOOOOOO hard
RIP Kanye
Bro is definitely mad he liked the album
First million view video I‚Äôm so long. Still benefitting off an ‚Äúantisemite‚Äù
Whomp whomp nobody respects your reviews anymore anyways
Kanye makes music for NFT purchasers. üòÇ<br><br>76k likes &gt; 64k dislikes
what do u know about art
This sounds more like a political review, you‚Äôve jus gone full on cuck mode
So it&#39;s a light 7?
ur acc a bum, no one cares and ur getting clout for being disliked. üòÇ üòÇüòÇ
Honestly I think the Album still slaps lol can‚Äôt help but jam and bop out ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
What happened to separating the art from the artist ‚Ä¶.oh wait he can‚Äôt cause it‚Äôs Kanye ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è hypocrite
This review is on point
i know ppl are being mean to you, i&#39;m sorry. you are smart enough to know that this would be the reaction, though. so, i hope you don&#39;t take it too personally.
if melon is being honest, this really backfired
Shut up yapper
Fake drama to save a dying channel
FAIL!
Let me guess you‚Äôre gonna call Kanye anti-semite while u support the Nazis in Ukraine .. dnt b G√Ü
What a clown show this video is.  Seriously?  Review the music‚Ä¶ you gave Daughters a 10‚Ä¶ I bet you would say Un reviewable now.  Just review the music dude‚Ä¶album isn‚Äôt necessarily great but there at least 6 or 7 bangers on here.  Also, you review murderers and other pieces of shit. Ridiculous‚Ä¶
his music video with his daughter was incredible and heart warming, but sure dont even mention it
dislike ratio going crazy on this one for clear reasons
Womp womp
Remember everyone , this guy says sexy red album is a 8 and her music has no impact on young girls lol
I might agree with a few points, plus disagree on some others but nonetheless, I like the fact that Fantano is somehow now facing problematic art with this new series. He is speaking about it with his own voice and heart, instead of avoiding/canceling it at all costs. I think this is more enlighntening and relevant. One day or another we&#39;ll have to be open and ready to talk about these topics and/or artists without the fear or repercussions because they&#39;re important and they do have interesting social implications. The more we talk about it, the more we might hope to be on the same page, ironically.
Maybe if it was called ‚Äúto pimp a vulture‚Äù
This feels like a weird video. He is on his right to make this type of content of course, and I can&#39;t nor do I want to defend Kanyes past behavior because he did say some wild shit at times, but you&#39;ve reviewed music from literal murders, nazis, women beaters, etc. What I am trying to get at is, you were able to set those things aside and just review the music for what is it then, why not just make an actual music review for this? Why not just ignore the album altogether if it bothered you that much? This isn&#39;t even me calling him out or anything I am genuinely curious what his thought process was.
Whether or not you like this guy‚Äôs review, I don‚Äôt understand why it seems like everyone is trying to defend Kanye in the comments, dude said more than enough fucked up things in the past 2 years for people to never listen to his music again
U reviewed a nazis album who burnt down churches but can‚Äôt review ye man I use to have respect for u why put your foot down now? What do u think your Jewish fans think about u giving a nazi a platform?? Actual response wanted cause this is dumb just review u the album youve reviewed worse and prob done worse lol
Who tf here ask Melon for his opinion on Ye‚Äôs public image? <br><br>Cue the fucking needledrop vids popping up in my algorithm now since I actually searched this tripe out of sheer morbid curiosity to hear what he objectively thought about the music.
Fantano is probably going through a midlife crisis, give him some slack
His fanbase is still filled with hiphop heads, you just don&#39;t hear us cause we don&#39;t wanna be accosiated with the psychos
Imagine being such a loser that even though your whole existence is entirely ‚Äúreviewing‚Äù music you have the audacity to call the lives of teenage boys who have the capability to achieve more then you ever will, ‚Äúmeaningless‚Äù.
not gonna watch 7 mins of yapping nonsense
This is the best way to make kanye fans mad and he did it
Kanye is the biggest heartbreak for me. I love all the old stuff and even enjoyed Pablo and some of Donda, but he is to far gone. It‚Äôs disgusting what he is doing. I refuse to listen to this record. I can‚Äôt even listen to the older stuff without getting sick.
Don&#39;t worry, at least we&#39;ve got the release of Tangk tomorrow
You‚Äôre not even talking about the music that‚Äôs not a music review melon
Only unreviewable because your (((handlers))) won&#39;t pay you
L
Professional yapper
ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°
Offensive ? Thank god you dont speak spanish Bad Bunny is waaay worse towards women and nasty AF. Ps you and Ye have one thing in common &quot; narcisit egomaniacs jerks&quot;
Blud&#39;s got a hate boner for kanye. The album is just below mid tbh, instrumentals range from garbage to good, just donda again, lyrics poorly executed and repetitive in general, this album is 3-4 at most. Dude took ye&#39;s lyrics and life personally. Shii im pretty sure kendrick talked bout rape(he was peer pressured to) in good kid maad city and gets an 8 but hey Ye is antisemantic and objectifying irl and in his lyrics right?
Horrendous take
Shut up soft boy
This man being way too serious lmao
I thought I watched you for music reviews what the fuck is this?
Bro&#39;s malding.
oh i get it, this guy is just a SJW
Aww man stop being a bitch. The album is fire üî•
youre genuinly pathetic, there is no way in hell you believe sexy redds album was better then vultures when the albu, is genuinely good, put your views aside you&#39;re a grown man dude stop acting like a teenager. vultures has way better songs in every aspect then sexy reds album like you cnat be serious lmaooo, you gotta be trolling us with this
BRO YOU GAVE SEXY REDD A 8. STOP LYING FOR NOT WANTING TO BE CANCELLED. SEXY RED BRO
Based Fantano as always
Ik my opinion doesn‚Äôt matter but man review the album or don‚Äôt. You can hate the artist but that doesn‚Äôt mean you have to shit on the objectively decent to great music. Used to love watching you man this is not a good look.
Melon beautiful big titty butt naked tens don‚Äôt fall out the sky you know.
womp womp
1,4 M views THANKS TO KANYES ALBUM üòÇ MARKETING GOD
64k dislikes are from people with hair
Didn&#39;t you review a Burzum album a while back?<br>Why is that reviewable and this not?
Dang babygirl, why are CC&#39;s hating on you? Your review isn&#39;t harsh in the slightest
Don‚Äôt forget this man said sexyy reds album was an 8 üòê
Bad album, but the point is pretty stupid, If fantano wanted to prove a point he could have simply not made the video.
Seriously can‚Äôt believe this is from the same artist that gave us classics like college dropout, 808s and heartbreaks, my dark twisted fantasy, even tlop was fantastic and iconic next to this dumpster fire. Fuck this Nazi, the one thing about him that was good is now also gone and it‚Äôs just sad
I‚Äôll save you all the trouble, it was a good album, unfinished but high ceiling. Light 8
I feel like this review style could be applied to any Ye release, even indisputable classics,  if one is simply mad enough. &quot;I&#39;ve been workin&#39; this grave shift and I ain&#39;t made shit?&quot; SHIFT AND SHIT DON&#39;T EVEN RHYME!
Kanye, were we going?
Imagine clutching your pearls and dying on this sword. <br><br>What an injustice!
We didnt ask for a Kanye review? We wanted a Vulture review?? Half of the review is just yapping about his personality which has nothing to do with the album‚Ä¶. lame
Fantano ur the most Jewish simp I&#39;ve ever seen in my entire life
1.4mil views with 75k likes i aint even have to watch the videoüíÄ
From a dude that grew a hitler mustache on top of a tenth grade mustache.
Bro you realize you&#39;re alone on this band wagon. You&#39;re gonna be taking Ls for so long hating on Kanye. Kanye stays winning.  It&#39;s clear you can&#39;t keep this man&#39;s name off your mouth whilst claiming to dislike him, the irony. If you hate him so much stop eating off his name. Nobody forces you to listen. You&#39;d be lucky to see half the success that man has seen. Mans is over here over analyzing Kanye like an internet wannabe philosopher. Weirdo.
virgin melon
Hey man, shut up and review the songs
I think there‚Äôs a very large fourth category of listener: people who just enjoy music and don‚Äôt follow artists personal lives. As fucked as Spotify is for not paying artists. I‚Äôm giving Kanye maybe 0.10 cents if I listen to the album a lot. Which I‚Äôm not going to do cause I only like a couple songs. But I‚Äôm not actively supporting him
Intensely unemployed comment section on this one
Can someone tell me what his qualifications are?
Yeah fantano you are so morally right omg ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫
I downloaded it the other day to listen to it &amp; now I can‚Äôt find it or play it on Apple Music, typical Kanye bullshit.
went to listen to PAID soon after this its GAS ! i think he was talking to @theneedle drop when he said &quot;what you gon&#39; do with a durag?...&quot;
unwatchable 2
this melon is more like a an activist than a music reviewer
This is not a review. You spent more than half the review not reviewing the album.
Bro is so worried that the Goldbergs are gonna take his platform away.... You make money Off of giving bad opinions on other people&#39;s work..... They simply create and make more money than you. And you&#39;re talking about not being able to give him a platform like you&#39;re worth anything....
Bro you gave sexy red 8
Don&#39;t let them silence you!
Kanye fans are the DBZ fans of Hip Hop
Love his music, he is an idiot but a lovable one. Critique him all you want that&#39;s why you exist
Shut up and cry this music was good asf and I ain‚Äôt gon let u tell me what to like
Ur taste in music sucks
How do you tell the black audience members &quot;ahhh, Conway didnt mean it when he said he killed your aunt or grandma. Westside was just being facetious when he conjured the 1000th lyric saying he shot someone else from your community.&quot;<br><br>Man...... Where was your line, listening to all of the killing of other people in a lot of rap albums? Were thoae just words then, or do some of these cats, and sometimes provably in a court of law, put those words into action? Now youve found your line?<br><br>I havent listened to a full kanye album since the college dropout, but Anthony, you aint no better than you were before. <br><br>You wouldve stopped reviewing and listening to rap that describes gratuitous violence against others a long time ago. Because youre the internets busiest music nerd, we know, and have seen that you do.
Who the fuq is this loser
Go touch some grass bro LOL
If it was called kids see vultures it would be a 10
You actually should be objective
At least ty is saying the truth Peggy too there here to get paid stop being offended over meaningless comments
So many kids without fathers that will follow Kanye to the ends of the üåé
he&#39;s right and you know it ;)
I see the lizard people have gotten to fantano
Isreal keeps killing people and you&#39;re talking about the minimum damage words!
parts of this review should be part of a sample on vultures 2
Imagine a world where fantano didn‚Äôt have Twitter
This is the guy who said what varg done was okay btw üíÄ
MR ILL REVIEW ANY MUSIC UNLESS HE TALKS ABOUT THE JEWS SPECIALLY IF HE TALKS ABOUT THE JEWS unfavorably ILL NEVER REVIEW IT.
Hey forgot no.4 black peopleüòÇ
Separate the art from the person. I haven‚Äôt liked a Kanye album in forever. I like this album
Ye fans have proven to be the worst fanbase in all music
this egghead has always been the embodiment of music elitism
And the award for internet‚Äôs biggest music award goes to‚Ä¶
The sad thing is nobody did their research about what Kanye is constantly talking about. ü§¶üèæ he said he can‚Äôt be anti-Semitic, because he‚Äôs Jewish lol some will hear that and think ‚Äúhe sounds crazy‚Äù but black people are the true Israelites if you do your hard core research. People will let the media think for them üôÑ
too much virtue-baiting crap, you have nothing interesting or real to say.
Kanye has always been a zero talent hack who coasts on hype and publicity stunts. It blows my mind how anyone who listens to rap can say he is even remotely in the top 10. He SUCKS.
Melon gotta stfu, giving sexy red an 8/10 then giving vulture un reviewable is crazy no shot your wife left you
Just review the music bro
Wish we could see the dislikes on this one. Ratio gotta be worse than the early yung lean and bladee reviews.
Fantano gotta be the Lamest person of all time.
I like how the antisemitic examples in his music are having sex with a Jewish person, employing Jews, and a statement about what people call him‚Ä¶. Man the antisemitism never ends he had sex with a Jewish person apparently that also makes you antisemitic. Thanks for the heads up Fantano. üëç
Bro has made it his mission to be the biggest square on the planet.
I‚Äôm gonna call the next music theorist that likes Wagner antisemitic and hateful. üëç
Salty ah dude
Bros the biggest hater on YouTube, don‚Äôt even know why he still reviews hip hop anymore if the only thing he likes is Indy shitty music
I dont know if melon has ever thought about it. But maybe. Just Maybe. You Can Like Something Without Liking The Creator.
Love reading the delusion ye teen comments
PINK GUY - GAYS 4 DONALD TRUMP
this the same guy who gave mbdtf a 6 lol fantano never truly got ye.üòπ
I just want you to know Ive been subscribed for 4 years and this takes the cakeüò≠you will never see me in another fantano review again, just lost u a loyal fan
bro don&#39;t you know the history of jews? read a book!
Im convinced melon is legit a woman disguised as a man taking part in the de-masculizing of society. Like who are u trying to please? Did the lizard people finally give u an offer into the Illuminati? What reputation are u trying to build for your sorry self?
I love how the quotes fantano uses to show antisemitism in the album are 1) I employ Jewish people 2) I‚Äôm not antisemetic. I banged a Jewish person.
Honesty idrgaf turn that shit up
I just listened to walter white whine about a black man for 7 minutea
FRIENDLY REMINDER YALL, THIS MF GAVE SEXYREDD AN 8‚Ä¶
hmm
Hip-hop is a black culture. Rap is the industry and money making aspect of hip-hop. Ran by white people and white supremacy. Who has raped black artists out of millions of dallars infront of there faces. Caucasians will never understand black culture because they always think they can make it theirs. By trying to make changes to it. Weaponing money and wealth in the process. Deep history has lies, read about history from all angles. People that know- knows. Kanye is 1 of the only artist that pushes the norms and sounds. This is host will praise every Drake album ever made. We all should have an opinion, please be balanced. He can&#39;t like Kanyes album because of what Kanye has said in the past. The truth doesn&#39;t apologize, lies do. Kanye has proven he&#39;s ahead of our timeline we have to catch up. Slavery was a choice, so is mind control. If you can control the mind, you will control the body. This is what religion has given the world mind control. History and culture has been replaced by religion. All religions are from the Catholic ideology your not different. Stolen from black history and artifacts. Culture and universal law is what we should be living by. The laws of nature has no insecurities, hate or ego. These emotional feelings is what poisons our reality. Kanye please stop saying Jesus it&#39;s Yeshua. 2 different people. Jesus, was created to steal Yeshua identity. This is not hate speech, just an aspect of what history has shown
lets gooooooooooooo
Did you say something? I am trying to figure out what the purpose of the video is. As Katt Williams said during the interview he gave to the man with muscles, we know Kanye has unsolved mental health issues. So, knowing that, I don&#39;t understand why people like you feel the need to metaphorically lynch him for his words or for his unsatisfactory apologies. If you want to do a review of his album, fine, do it. If you don&#39;t want to, don&#39;t. But what did you accomplish here? You&#39;re saying, &quot;I don&#39;t forgive him, so I won&#39;t review him.&quot; Okay, so review something else, or don&#39;t post today! Oh my god.
you a loser.
Just say you‚Äôre a virgin lol
yeah but the musics fire tho...
I like how fontanus is on how u can&#39;t rly separate character and lyrics while we have metal heads say the most satanic stuff ever and still makin good music, like, just think bout rappers Talkin bout being gangster and killing ppl, what about them? Nothing cuz you are not pissed at them and u have to cope
clown
stfu and review the music, you&#39;re a music reviewer
Don‚Äôt get mad at me, he‚Äôs gone crazy! It‚Äôs over for Kanye
U were more mad at this than on your burzum album reviewüò≠ and we know you‚Äôre not Jewish you‚Äôre literally a French. Canadian. Italian. ü§¢ album was mid tho 4/10 at most
About 3 tracks in, I realized that I don&#39;t have to put myself through the whole album and just quit.
How could Sexy Red do this?
Psyopped
Kanye is one song away of us forgetting that he said all those crazy stuffüòÇ
People acting like this is the first time Kanye said sum controversial...fantano didn&#39;t have this energy when he said slavery was a choice and backed an outwardly racist president üëÄ
I would add a fourth group of Kanye‚Äôs fan base: people who grew up with Kanye‚Äôs music, have nostalgic attachments to it and find him problematic but separate his public persona from his music (I would put Childish Gambino and Lil Dicky in this camp). I respect your opinion on him and his music but I still think he‚Äôs got interesting things to put out into the world. <br><br>Yes, there are plenty of problematic lyrics, but there have always been. A man addicted to fame fucking loves attention, surprise! To v poorly paraphrase Katt Williams - are we really going to punish the man we once heralded as our generations hip hop golden child because we put him on a pedestal and rewarded him for doing and saying wild things? Yes we should call out all the stupid shit he says, but to just shut down the conversation altogether, especially when the word ‚Äúanti-Semitic‚Äù is getting thrown around like an IDF missile, is preachy and lazy. If you want to review this album on its musicality and call it shit, fine, but seems your judgement of his music is being clouded by your judgment of his persona. Which to some degree I can‚Äôt fault you for, but then just come out and say that instead of putting out a pretty hastily done, surface level review of the album.
He reviewed it tho
Fantano is the god of womp womp
Man, either review a song or not. What was this now? I didn&#39;t even get the name of the song tbh.
Didn‚Äôt this bald melon review Rammstein albums? The same guys who dressed up as Auschwitz prisoners?
Yeah mate, still profiting over his art by doing an &quot;unreviewable&quot; video that hits the 2M mark. Nice, man.
I only liked a couple of the songs tbh just because of how they sound I didn‚Äôt know it was this deep üò≠
This album does suck regardless of anti Jewish stuff. The album is super over produced and the lyrics give me Reddit mod vibes.
Average white person smugness. We don&#39;t rock with fantano no more.
Plz review MK.GEE‚Äôs album!!! He works closely with Dijon<br><br>It‚Äôs such a well produced album
Only thing u did by not reviewing this album was drive up your views clown ü§° this video has more views than your last 100+ videos on ur channel, so you effectively brought more attention to the album &amp; allowed this ‚Äúanti-Semitic‚Äù artwork to fill your pockets.
I like the song carnaval that‚Äôs it
Good for you Fantano, draw a line and don&#39;t cross it.  Far to lofty of a concept for most.
100% agreed on this one.
hater
for those confused: &quot;anti-semitism&quot; is the magic term that takes precedence over any personal feelings or views, and can make or break your career.<br><br>This is why fantano can fan girl over murderers, but can&#39;t fathom an artist who has a negative opinion about yamulke people.
Wow, soft balls. So informed, but balls so soft.
Fantano is definitely a secret jew. Just look at him. Now now, nothing wrong with that, but just look at him.
But reviewing murderers&#39; albums is totally okay... oh okay
bro thinks not reviewing the album will do something üíÄ
maybe the review is teh friend we made along the way
You just called out all fans as psychos, weirdo cultists or nihilists - not the best idea ever.
The falloff needs to be studied
Kanye Anti-Semitic but these gangster rappers and drill rappers get a pass when they talk about killing their own kind which seems like modern day KKK to me ü§î
you need to stop reviewing and just go Keep Yourself Safe
This channel used to be good, stop injecting your politics into the video
Now I understand why beta Fantano‚Äôs wife left him
the yappiest of yappers who reviews the unreviewable album üôáüèª
Unreviewable? Just sounds like Anthony is not trying to catch any heat if he had anything decent to say about the album. If it‚Äôs about the music why bring up his wife? Only thing unreviewable is that mustache
Review without the review, an error occurred
Kanye heckin hurt Anthony &quot;smol bean&quot; Fantano&#39;s feelings and now he&#39;s heckin le cancelled!
So you wont review an album made by a guy who makes shitty political takes, but you will review literal murderers? Sound logic baldy.
ü§ì ah video
Bro refuses to separate the art from the artists lmao
You are truly white noise...
If you not gonna REVIEW it then DONT talk about it bro. We don‚Äôt want your politics. We want an album review ü´†ü´†ü´†ü´†
This feels like a review of recent yrs and not the album. I expect better from you. Just review the music.
cope + ratio + cringe channel
Looking at these comments makes me feel lost in this world man, I love Kanye to death but vultures is a horrible album, people need to realize that this behavior is not acceptable and need to realize that Kanye needs help, please if you think he has done nothing wrong get help
Yk he only hating this hard cause of what ye said about Jewish people üòÇüòÇüòÇ
M
Thx fantano for standing up against the hoard of assholes that is the Kanye stans. I say that as a former fan of him, and as a jewish man. Their copium, and brushing all of his glaring problems to the side normalize antisemitism, and it means a lot to me that you stand up against it.
All the rappers rapping about killing people and objectifying women in their music and videos is ok, but this is crossing the line. Kind of a double standard
Who knew there so many edgy nihilistic teenagers in your comments.
Too ideologically possessed to do his job lmao, abject failure.
Fantanos reviews suck
Yet palling around with Vaush and The Serfs on Twitter, the former a CP holder and the other donated millions to a terror organization which posed as a Palestine children‚Äôs fund, is just fine.
Hey lefty. We don‚Äôt care.
Fantano on his Kanye era
Another anthony fagtano review sweet
womp woooomp
Your ass just still salty over the divorce
But will listen to sexy red and think it‚Äôs fire
i havent started the video but i can tell his wildinü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
Bought a vultures shirt after I watched this
Just retire
Reminds me of that review of Hogwarts Legacy on Wired where they gave it a 1 because they didn‚Äôt like JK Rowling and instead of reviewing the game, they published a ‚Äòreview‚Äô where they wrote about how much they didn‚Äôt like JK Rowling. Not saying you‚Äôre wrong in any of your points, Kanye is clearly saying the most moronic stuff and is batshit crazy, but you have such a hard time nowadays of separating politics and music, and you have a real inconsistency on it - so I assume you‚Äôll be redacting every review you‚Äôve done on this channel from a problematic artist? We come here to discover music man, not to be talked at.
I wouldn‚Äôt even be mad if he didn‚Äôt also give sexy red an 8
Contemporary garbage for garbage people. There. Reviewed
Ye is the only musician who makes both his critics and his admirers look edgy. And that&#39;s pretty much something.
Awesome album. What he said before, he was right about. That&#39;s that. Wake up buddy.
If this was called &quot;Kids See Vultures&quot; you would&#39;ve given it a 10
Im a 19 year old dude who does have a boring life, i really love Ye¬¥s music and i am rooting for him simply because i feel like he¬¥s quite literally making the best music out there at the moment.<br>Simple as that, i actually came to this video solely because i wanted to hear the criticism you have against the album.<br>I hate that Ye¬¥s views are so radical and obscene because it takes a lot of good away from the music. But im willing to look past it, take no part in it and just enjoy the great music that we have in this world right now.
Unreviewyeable
You are unreviewable
Quiere llorar quiere llorar quiere llorar üò≠üòù
It&#39;s very easy to separate the lyrics from the song. I listened to it and didn&#39;t give a crap for the lyrics. You need to do better with reviewing since your whole channel is based on that and stop virtue signaling, and no I am not a Kanye fan.
I relatively enjoyed this album honestly. Definitely not even a top 5 ye album, probably not even top 6 but I got some enjoyment out of it. Are the criticisms against him valid? Yea I won‚Äôt deny that. Me or anyone else who enjoyed this album are not bad people, the ones co signing the Wild statements ye has made are
bro&#39;s channel is dead and this video is a banger for him, ungrateful mf
Kinda comes down to the question of &quot;When do we separate the artist from the art?&quot; Lot of people only care about how the music sounds and choose to ignore the personal life of the artist, however, this review is saying we cannot ignore Kayne&#39;s past and its having an effect on the music.
Ye = üêê
The hypocrisy here is insane, you‚Äôve reviewed and liked albums by artists who do way more foul shit and actually have given them a good score
You might be showing your age for the comment on back to me.<br><br>I do not accept anything Kanye has said about anybody in recent memory to be of merit to anyone.<br><br>But that song is meant for the kids who do think that beautiful women fall out of the sky by zoning around on the web. It‚Äôs a warning to those who assume they deserve that.<br><br>I don‚Äôt like Kanye‚Äôs antics but my soft spot for him does show me he is trying to talk to a different generation. You can‚Äôt just dismiss Kanye talking to warn a generation and type of boy who thinks beautiful butt naked women ‚Äúdon‚Äôt‚Äù fall out the sky as wrong. <br><br>Would you even want to be relatable? That is another question <br><br>When we grow older fantano we need to grow understanding that context shifts, Kanye in his absolute degenerate state has encapsulated the general sentiment of the situation well.  Maybe he might feel that better than you and is hyper about it
mid album
biden supporter
Okay , but this is a review
His music is so bad now. It feels like he makes it for social media purposes. Not to make great music to listen to like he used to do. Kanye is like a Sad kid with self esteem issues.
This was literally just a PC rant about showing how sensitive and biased you are against Kanye, yet someone makes a song about how they killed someone you call it a banger üòÇ okay
You are a Jew
Bro made me like Kanye even more somehow
<b>Panderthony Stantano</b> smh
Your receding hairline is affecting your thought process üòÇ
This video is so cringe
the sad truth is, he will stay relevant as long as people like you cover his releases thoroughly
Bruh your hypocracy is showing.
Yeah yeah dude we get it you don‚Äôt like Kanye.
no one likes this bald white guy
Kanye is on a quest to become the most unlikable, unrelatable, unintelligible artist that ever lived
ü§°
Trash review as always
honestly he&#39;s gotta know he&#39;s helping ye out.  this is the best press Kanye could get! I didn&#39;t even know ye had a new album out until this came up on the top right of my youtube
For me Fantano seems bitter. I mean he&#39;s never given Nav a good review. Tate McCrae who&#39;s 21 got a not good review for her most recent release cuz he called the whole project bland. Each of Metro&#39;s most recent releases have gotten mid scores. I can disagree with his opinion but dude seems like he needs a break from social media and music. The guy looks joyless and that is wild to see.
What about Lonely Boy (Scrim)
Kanye West is still the goat
I love Kanye, he talking in joe rogan is litteraly my alarm (like a shot of espresso in the morning), but i gotta say: this album is mid as f*. A lot of the musics just feels raw and commercial. Carnival and Hoodrat sounds almost &quot;trendy&quot; like. There are some great tracks such as Back to me, but they are like jewels in trash. To the guy that only listen to people who are younger than him cause theyre the only people with ideas, Vultures feels like it was made from an old formula from an old Kanye. The songs that are good felt more like try and error than brilliantism and new ideas like in Graduation.
If we swapped out the J words for anything derogatory towards to black.. there would be no conflict here huh
I don‚Äôt think that ‚Äúreference‚Äù line means what you think it does
You know you&#39;re right when you piss off /r/hiphopheads.
Beta males cannot be taken serious
Fantano doesn‚Äôt like hip hop, rap, r&amp;b etc. dude is a death grips heavy metal dickhead
So then why review it? <br><br>We All know what you are chasing here asking for here stop it! <br><br>You need the likes the comments <br><br>Like Kanye needs to drop music. <br><br>You chasing here buddy üçø
Is not Kanye best work (ofc he can do better) ye just putted songs together and made it sounds like album but ,it&#39;s not bad at all you just hate him personally
Lost a Subscriber and A Fan, Tired of The Ye Slander..
You are bald, your opinion doesn&#39;t count
say you Jewish without saying you Jewish
I have checked most things he&#39;s done but I&#39;ve never liked anything Kanye West has ever done. It&#39;s all awful imo
bad review
Didn&#39;t enjoy the production or the lyrics on this album. Love his old stuff like most people but times have changed.
I just love how Kanye stans are going crazy over a single Youtuber.. and all these years I thought swifties were a cult
I thought I was a well-adjusted adult with a house, a partner I don&#39;t abuse and only some light prejudice born out of experiences (remember you can&#39;t deny my lived experience!) thinking I just enjoyed the vibe of the album. Enjoying bumping Paid and the titty song hard after work yesterday.<br><br>Turns out this odd-looking guy with 3m subs thinks I&#39;m an incel. This whole video and its consensus popularity are why I aspire to be in a gated community away from you people. So much mouth-frothing misery.
Separar a arte do artista e da politica, isso n√£o existe. Arte √© politica e tem a inten√ß√£o de quem a construiu, o que voc√™ faz com os eventos que trouxe a arte at√© esse ponto √© outra coisa.
So you don&#39;t want to review the album yet you still reviewed parts of the album?<br>And you&#39;re against Kanye and his action yet still want to make profitable content off of it?<br>What is even going on in your head, man?<br>You review music for a living, did you forget that or something?
Kanye made this bitch famous
You review racist nazi and said it‚Äôs just music but it‚Äôs not just about the music when it comes to Kanye tho . That sound like hate to me just say your mad Kanye mentioned the Jews or ignore the drop completely but the music ain‚Äôt horrible at all hating az
I&#39;ve been done with Kanye for years now. I honestly didn&#39;t know he had a album coming out.
Really weird this, you don&#39;t seem to mind every other rapper dehumanizing women.
Common Fantano L
‚òùÔ∏èü§ì
this guys clearly never heard of fun
Damn
i made the mistake of reading comments and what the fuck are people on about the big titty women line- that shit was what made me pause the album listen and just go NOPE i have better things to do
So this means he won&#39;t review anyone that has done what Kanye has done, oh wait?
You probably shouls have just made a post saying you were uncomfortable reviewing the album. I think it&#39;s reasonable to feel that way. But now that you&#39;ve made a video, you&#39;re still profiting off of talking about the record and a considerable portion of your audience is feels goaded into checking it out by your virtue signaling. <br><br><br>Really, what they do isn&#39;t your responsibility. But I don&#39;t feel like triggering that response is your goal either. Hopefully those that want to check it out but have issues with it let the Jolly Roger fly.
yap yap yap yap
Halfway into the review and not a mention of any song??? Lol
I cannot for the life of me figure out why anybody cares what Anthony Fantano has to say about anything.
This is cap. And he‚Äôs a racist and who hates rap and rappers.
womp womp
As someone who isn&#39;t online much, there&#39;s a sad amusement about stumbling onto a video like this. You don&#39;t want to support him but this just brings more attention to the album, which you&#39;re profitting from. I understand not liking the guy but respectfully, you&#39;re unhinged in my opinion. I hope your mental health is okay.
U suck
The video is obviously biased because of the Kanye media shitstorm. The album was better than both Dondas and JIK
lol this album is so good and that makes this video so much more ridiculous. Anthony u look dumb lol get over yourself
based this shit is pure garbage and i like ye
album is a classic quit hating fantano
Find God Melon Head
It&#39;s interesting that you also mention Freddie Gibbs&#39; feature on this album, because you&#39;ve never had any issues reviewing him. What&#39;s his music about? Theft, drugs, pimping, abuse towards women. Where&#39;s the line REALLY, Fantano?
Arent you the one that didnt mind the album from a know nazi that burned stuff down and killed a homosexual?
this is more like a rant to kanye west&#39;s fans that offended you in twitter, this is not an album review
Ok if it was called hoods hottest vulture we know you would of given it an 8
Reviews songs from people who kill, promote drugs, etc.. but Kanye having antisemite views? Nahhhh too far.
So you have no problem with celeb pedos like Tom hanks but hate on a guy who wrote rude things on the internet. Free speech is a thing
You don&#39;t talk about music , let the artist apart from the art
Kanye&#39;s music is the best music available in the end
5 of the 7 minutes of this video are a review on Kanye and his fanbase and not the album itself. Put your feelings outside of the music aside and just review the record. It&#39;s reviewable if you&#39;re not emotional about it.
What a perfect video to drop from a content creation perspective. He satisfied the people who agree with him and lit a fire under people who don&#39;t, starting a big discussion and a bunch of response videos. One of his most viewed videos, he&#39;s milking this album perfectly üëå
Hypocritical af. Do people take this guy seriously? He is a joke
How about you give fentanyl a try
maneeee, find a bridge with a nice view and take a leap of faith
For everyone thinking fantano is being a ‚ÄúSJW‚Äù or ‚Äúsingling out kanye‚Äù, you gotta remember that kanye holds leaps and bounds much more influence than not just other rappers but ALOT of celebrities (at least he did). Seeing people bring up burzum is a somewhat valid point because those dudes say and do things that are a lot more heinous than kanye, but I think that‚Äôs sort of the issue with kanye that a lot of people don‚Äôt see. Kanye USED to not be about drumming up attention by feeding into straight up bigotry (yes I know George bush, VMAs, etc. he‚Äôs known to be controversial but his recent behaviors are a different beast). <br><br>Like cmon this man used to do beats for common, now he‚Äôs talking about how he‚Äôs antisemitic, crazy, bipolar, and ‚Äústill the king‚Äù. This album is wack yall. All these kanye verses are straight booty he legit cannot even rap anymore. Like were yall expecting this man to give this album anything less than a ‚Äúnot good‚Äù anyway? <br><br>Sometimes I think about a world where fantano always took himself more seriously and never made dumb content like thatistheplan or hopped on theamazingatheist‚Äôs podcast and had like a normal fanbase that wasnt filled with a bunch of weirdos and people trying to act like this album is even worth defending
why do i feel like you are being ¬®hard¬® on kanye and his new album just because he either is or was antisemitic; for whatever reason. i guess you wont be reviewing any new ¬¥burzum¬¥ albums either, because ¬¥varg vikernes¬¥ is an antisemite. next time don¬¥t even bother.
&quot;its unreviewable&quot; <b>reviews it</b>
Really
&gt;Unreviewable<br>&gt;Proceeds to review the album
horrible take .    ye on top!!!!!
You instantly hate the art when you hate the artist, if you can&#39;t separate them then don&#39;t talk about their art.
Can the music reviewer do his job plz
Calls the album unreviawable yet releases 3 videos on that sane album . The virtue signaling is beyond appalling, you have fallen so hard off, your objectivity is beyond gone at this point
L REVIEWER    UNSUB
I fk with this explain
They made twix double the size to make us fat
Melon head on a mission to lose the abysmal amount of credibility he had left with some of the weakest soiboi takes known to man. Embarrassing.
Nav review 2024 confirmed
Nah you just hated it before the album dropped you trash bro ,.....do better
Is it so hard to separate the artist from the art? Too look beyond what he said and what&#39;s said about him and see what his work is?
So... you don&#39;t like his political opinions, boo fucking hoo, now what about the album ?
Holy crap the Nazis and racist really angry in the comments here with all the ‚Äúyou review those other rap artists who sing about doing immoral things, how could you not review this?‚Äù as those being an actual Nazi in real life is the same as telling a story if your cousin getting shot and feeling hurt and anger. I guess to the people being black is a moral sin so even reviewing art made by a person of color is seen as a ‚Äúwhat about this thug‚Äù racist argument..<br><br>Kanye is literally trying to make being a Nazi cool with this album.<br>If you‚Äôre like, ‚Äúmaybe give it a chance‚Äù with it, idk what to tell you bro. It‚Äôs not an artistic album worth reviewing. It‚Äôs literally bad propaganda as a PR stunt. <br><br>Only Nazis could think church burning death metal or Tyler the Creator‚Äôs early work is exactly the same as this propaganda. <br>You‚Äôre just angry your Nazi music isn‚Äôt respected so you‚Äôre trying to attack other artists.<br>Go touch grass if this comment makes you angry and Fuck Nazis.
LOL, Fantano the living virtue signal ... What a sad, ridiculous dude
WHY ARE U GAY
Woke culture is literally bullshit
would recommend you review kpop to cool down a bit. there are no politics. maybe consider taking a break from twitter for a bit, take care of yourself.
Love the fact that this &quot;review&quot; has ended up in the UK news, and basically given Vultures a lot more listeners and free advertising.  This isn&#39;t so much a review as it is a very concentrated effort to virtue signal.  If it is unreviewable...don&#39;t review it.  You are making Kanye more famous regardless of your numerous protests suggesting you don&#39;t like him...and then I see the thumbnail of a video called &quot;the Kanye News&quot; with this same chump on it...I think he loves him!
WHO CARES WHAT YOU THINK üò°
Or 5) somebody whose in their early 30s who remembers listening to graduation on an iPod nano while walking home from school - thanks xxx
You‚Äôre such a democrat Anthony üêë
Ye needs his writers back, his lyrics made me cringe a lot. Sonically though I did enjoy the latter half of the album.
You&#39;ve reviewed self confessed murderer rappers quite happily . Do u draw the line at words lol?
Anthony this has nothing to do with the music‚Ä¶.<br>It astonishes me how kanye makes a stupid statement and you all use it to burn him yet he has lead to no harm of a jewish person, but you will review black music marketed to the black community that is damaging to it‚Ä¶ you honestly didn‚Äôt have to do this and you‚Äôve officially lost a following but join the populous because you think it will get you clout
Just review the music . Ain&#39;t your job to judge the man
Oh boy
I feel you Man , i just deleted the album , its kinda like being brainwashed.
but isn&#39;t he right about the jews tho?
So we‚Äôre gonna ignore your burzum reviews ? You‚Äôre such a f clown ü§°
&lt;3
Twitter broke this man
This man only got traction because of 4chan.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=373">6:13</a> wait, are you implying most records are expected to be listened to with other people?
Bro doesn&#39;t like the fact that another bold man is better at everything
all you did is straight up insult people for not getting caught up in internet drama cause they have actual jobs and friends and better things to do in general but im the little teenager sure. youre 38 years old and you have the biggest music review platform on youtube and this is how you use it seek social interaction (not on reddit) and grow up for the love of god.
Calling this man melon implies some kind of fondness. Forget it.
Free Palestine you bum
guys why can&#39;t you just separate the reviewer from the reviews
I mean it&#39;s not like Kanye said anything untrue
Bro gave sex redd an 8 but doesn‚Äôt want to review Kanye‚Äôs album.
Imagine being an anti-Semite because you wanna listen to the worst Kanye album
the album was awful. FUK SUMN and beg forgiveness were okay
most based melon vid
U have zero credibility
They are not insane theories
I have disagreed with a few of Fantanos reviews and a few hiphop reviews. Saba&#39;s care for me, Dave&#39;s Psychodrama, Killer Mike&#39;s MIKE and even with Kanye (I felt Yeesuz even more than MBTDF was even harsher). But the point here is even if you did take out the gross content and average lyricism, even the beats are mid
At this point this channel is just trying to be more controversial than about the music I used to watch this channel all the time because how pure it used to be but he lost his way along time ago thought I give it a chance after several years but I see nothing has changed..sad
Ye &gt; This guy<br>Fav song, KING
just stop mentioning kanye on your channel like you said you would be
at this point i just feel like you are just trying to hate on it i agree you don&#39;t like this type of music but everytime i open your vid related to kanye you are just pushing his anti sem comments man we are here to get the review for the album not your opinion on kanye just put a tittle &quot;talking abut kanye&quot; and do this then and i just wish you treat him like other artist atleast on music end  i am fine with your points but man you just say this is shit and bye about the music why?
dogshit opinion
Go and listen to some ratched 304s...
People who look for critics on what they should or should not listen to are idiots.
This is unbelievably corny and performative. You have every right to not like Kanye as a person, that‚Äôs your choice. But you‚Äôre a music reviewer, we are not coming to you to see where you stand from a morality standpoint, because quite frankly we don‚Äôt care. we come to you for music reviews. Don‚Äôt ‚Äúreview‚Äù the album if you can‚Äôt rate it objectively
STARS / PROBLEMATIC / CARNIVAL<br><br>Fuk Sum got cooked. OG version was goated.
Maybe bro is a Jew and he felt he deserved an apology, I love you bro...so review the music; its structure, the production, the melody, the replayability, and the features...if Ye wanna hate Jews so be it... most black artiste don&#39;t like Jews either news flash...they just not brave to say it...
The thousand virtue signaling stare
Fantano is the average twitter user. Hypocritical in his statements and views with a very skewed moral compass.
It&#39;s great that you titled the vid &quot;unreviewable 1&quot; and then actually do a review. üíÄüéß
Bro stfu and review the music
He not right
Man, people are REALLY quick to defend a nazi. I wonder what that means about them‚Ä¶
This is either bait or Mental R3tardation
Pathetic. Do your job properly
Someone fell off and it isn&#39;t Ye....
its crazy how you hate on ONLY kanye like this, yet you listen to sexy redd and automatically give her an 8, never rate again bro.
74k Likes. 61k Dislikes. (2/14) Incase anyone is wondering, the ratio on this is real
The rest of the world disagrees with you, especially the youth. 39 year old hater
And heres comes the politics creeping into his music reviews. Get fucked. Unsubscribed.
So we‚Äôre just not calling Kanye ‚ÄúYe‚Äù anymore huh
Ye is tiresome
This guy has given Kanye a 10, a 6, and a 1
your note is not a music review then :p
I feel like you forgot a category of Kanye Fan: the one who disagrees with his views as a person but just likes his music. It‚Äôs okay to separate politics and beats once in a while. Like don‚Äôt you ever just listen to the beat and the music and not the words and be like, this sounds good imma just tune out the lyrics cuz they trash?
Ye stans are so thirsty, theyre gonna be gobbling this shit up. At least his wife won&#39;t be the only one saving them from being broke.
Skip to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=304">5:04</a> to miss all the galaxy brain political opinions
Bruhh, people follow this guy??? üòÇ <br>Doesn&#39;t know crap about music.
Ty Segall Three Bells when
I give it a light 6
Kanye has F*** Y** money, and he will stay unhinged for the rest of his life ... for better or worse <br><br>the Netflix doc reminded me why I love Kanye and why he is so gemini
This guy gave MBDTF a light 6<br>And KSG a 10.... <br><br>Thats when you loose credibility.<br><br>To me this album is very similar and close to KSG, i will put both on a 7/10 on a kanye scale, they place in the middle-bottom of his discography but they still good, and better than JIK, Donda 2, and Ye, to me
These are the most painfully obvious, reasonable series of points I&#39;ve ever heard any human being make in my life. How there are actual living human beings whose brains are so fundamentally different from mine that they can even consider disagreeing with any of us this fully convinces me that there is some ancient alien genome hidden in our gene pool that makes some people 7% not of this Earth. If you&#39;re any age above 15 and even remotely disagree with any of this, something went SEVERELY wrong in your childhood development and you need to seek counselling NOW before you&#39;re a perma-singleite in your mid-30s.
you lost what little remained of your music reviewing credibility. No objectivity whatsoever. just a kanye rant lol. pathetic.
If you guys don‚Äôt want to watch the video here is a summary: wahh wahh wahh
The discourse around this album is by far the most toxic I‚Äôve ever seen.
are you autistic?
If it were called ‚ÄúSCARING THE JEWS‚Äù it would‚Äôve got a 9/10
Okay bro you have literally reviewed a burzum album. A band ran by a literal Nazi who has killed people and burnt down churches. Get real
Kanye‚Äôs says you‚Äôre welcome for the 1.3 million views
As a long time fan, it‚Äôs disappointing to see Fantano make such an illogical and contradictory decision. Biases are expected from all critics (we all know he despises Kanye, which is fine), but refusing to review an album from one of the most influential artists of our time for moral reasons really seems like a violation of the principles of this channel. It‚Äôs bizarre censorship, it‚Äôs hypocritical because he‚Äôs reviewed far more problematic artists in the past, and it shows a real inability to think objectively about the greater function of this channel. <br><br>A sad day for the internet‚Äôs busiest music nerd :(
Womp womp ur feelings are hurt
Might wanna take down ur ‚Äúgoblin, Tyler the creator review‚Äù after this
Fantano already said that he grades artist differently. He wouldn&#39;t grade an Ice Spice album on the same scale as a Beyonc√© album!<br><br>With that being said. Vultures was not a good album at all. It was really bad.
7 minutes total 1 minjtws went to talking about the album. and the remaining 6 went to complaining about Kanye and his fanbase. probably gotta be your worst review so far dude. I can understand not liking the guy and his fans but geez.
liberals bruh
this is why your wife left you
Let‚Äôs just stop watching and giving this a guy a platform. Dude doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs talking about anyway. Just hating and following an awful narrative he created years ago.
i thought it was good but i can see where you are coming from. kanye is a bad person and i aint finna deny that lmao
review starts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=303">5:03</a><br>thanks Anthony!
YOU HAVE A MIND VIRUS. TAKE YOUR VIRTUE SIGNALING CONFIRMATION BIASED ACTIVISM SOMEPLACE ELSE. People like Fantano are why Trump will win in 2024
After looking dude here up, I‚Äôm convinced he just hates that Kanye is a Trump supporter and not an NPC.
weak take
Music is pure and from the heavens. It‚Äôs the purest part of him.
Bros mad he‚Äôs divorced and Kanye isn‚Äôt
You&#39;re so insanely gay
Yo people really be seething out here üíÄ
STFU AND REVIEW THE MUSIC, THATS WTF IM HERE FOR! FUCK POLITICS AND EVERYTHING ELSES THAT AINT THE ACTUAL MUSIC. DO WHAT YOUR SUPPOSE TO DO LITTLE REVIEW BOY
Reminder this man rated sexxy red higher than DANM, MBDTF, YEEZUS, Flower boy, wolf, Utopia, ECT.
I miss Jesus Is King Kanye ü•≤
I&#39;ve been a Kanye fan for a long time, and far too many times I&#39;ve defended his ridiculous antics, but over the last couple of years I have stopped doing so. I can generally separate the art from the artist, but as you mentioned in the video, his art has also become his disgusting beliefs. I can no longer support him or his music.
Good for you finally seeing the art form and its fans for the trash it is
Completely would have done the same thing in his position! Kanye is an awful person! Keep up the great worküíñ
Unwatchable
The music is great ,the message is horrible.
You can say you don‚Äôt like it and not say anyone who disagrees is a Nazis.
Bro the album is pretty good if you hate the man just say so you don‚Äôt gotta trash the art to.
Kanye is a racist savant. Too bad‚Ä¶
Ye fell off ü•≤
‚ÄúUneviewable‚Äù <b>reviews for 7 minutes</b>
This guy is a joke! Obviously incapable of of seeing the positive side. Not likes he was even trying. Sounds to me like he‚Äôs the one with the problem
Wow, another bad take from Libthony Tardtano, not surprised
I think you didn&#39;t understand anything...
lol
This guy talks a lot just rate it!
Unsurprisingly, it&#39;s a whole lot of caping for nazis and their spineless collaborators in this comment section smh
Don&#39;t bust our balls with politics. Politics ruin the world.
This album is so bad, I&#39;d rather pretend kanye died of an overdose after &quot;releasing&quot; DONDA 2, first time that i agreed with you melon head guy üíñ
first minute of the review and i can see that your opinion is swayed by something other than the music that your reviewing. havent even heard the album but you&#39;ve already discredited your review in the fist 60 seconds. good music review.
Yes gettin old :/
Bro Melon is so cringe he should get a Job
Not sure why yall listen to this man.  Go and take in the album yourself. Enjoy it if you like it.
What a poduccy talkin bout anti semitism, chill out bro can you not handle basic conversation about things people disagree over?
This is a critique of fantano and this video by someone who doesn&#39;t like either right now. I am attempting to be as fair as possible, but if you just can&#39;t handle anyone being negative regarding melon, just don&#39;t read it. Also, before any reddit comedians point out how long it is, I like typing through and articulating my thoughts and emotions on most subjects to better get a handle on them, usually just in my own private word processer. But since I planned to actually comment this, I also included clarifications and context to make things as level as possible and cut down on misunderstandings.<br><br>This video is disappointing to me. I used to be a fan of fantano in my late teens, and seeing him spout this nonsense is disappointing. I ended up not engaging with his content anymore a few years back, because I&#39;d kinda gotten sick of it, and YouTube pushed him way too hard in the recommendations after you watched his videos, but I hadn&#39;t really started to dislike him or anything. <br>However, seeing fantano post a huge, mean-spirited video like this, which can only serve as an attempt to hurt Ye or Ye&#39;s fans, claiming that the music is &quot;unreviewable&quot; (as if that&#39;s even a possible thing any piece of music can be), and then proceeding to review it, with some mean spirited attacks to the artist and anyone who dare listen to him sprinkled in is embarrassing to witness. <br><br>Firstly, I am not a &quot;Ye cultist.&quot; His music touched and means a lot to me, as it has many, but as of now, I would not want anything to do with Ye as a person. Nor am I a &quot;nihilistic teenager,&quot; who doesn&#39;t understand the impact of Ye&#39;s fuckups. And it goes without saying I am not the other &quot;catagory&quot; of Ye fan that fantano mentioned. (Side note: categorizing and generalizing people because you either can&#39;t or don&#39;t want to see nuance is incredibly stupid and actively damaging to your understanding of reality, but that is neither here nor there) I was very hurt and furious at Ye&#39;s comments when he made them, and I have seen others feel the same.<br>The thing is though, I am able to separate how I feel about Ye and where he&#39;s at in life from this album. And that seems to be the difference between me and fantano.<br>Also, I know fantano claims that there is Anti-Semitism in the album. And that is certainly, one way to read those lyrics; likely how you would if you have never listened to rap before. All three lyrics presented that reference Ye&#39;s alleged Anti-Semitism  (I think he is Anti-Semitic, but I put alleged to be fair) are referencing the general public&#39;s reaction to it, and making a joke about it while bigging himself up. Eminem did the same thing, this time referencing his alleged homophobia, way more often on MMLP, and iirc fantano called that album a classic. Are the lines tasteful? Not really. Bad enough to ruin an entire album? Over three lines? That&#39;s absurd, and I honestly wonder how fantano listens to anything made by anyone who isn&#39;t just a clone of himself, since 3 lines he disagreed with were enough to ruin this album for him.<br>The album is quite good in my opinion, but it doesn&#39;t reach the heights of Ye&#39;s previous work. The weakest link is Ye&#39;s verses, which have bright spots and shining moments, like the instantly iconic &quot;BBTBNWDJFOOTSYK&quot; from &quot;Back To Me,&quot; but overall Ye&#39;s lyrics are strange and underbaked. That being said, as always when Ye is involved, the production is amazing and more than makes up for at, at least to me. I&#39;ve gotten a bit lost on a tangent here, but I felt that my opinion on the album would be good to know for context.<br>Fantano deciding that he cannot in good conscience boost Ye&#39;s signal (like this video isn&#39;t doing that anyway) seems wrong when you think of the artists and music he does boost and even sometimes gives positive scores. Artists who have committed acts of real world violence are fair game, but artists who have voiced problematic opinions aren&#39;t? That&#39;s ridiculous! If you are going to be a moral guardian on one issue, you have to for every issue, otherwise you&#39;re just being weird and picky. <br>Honestly, this video, despite the fact that fantano can&#39;t help but project some of his issues with Ye as a person onto the music at one point, feels very little like an actual music review or good faith update on why he won&#39;t be reviewing it (which no one is forcing him to do) and much more like a long winded attack on Ye&#39;s character and the character of his fans. And attacking Ye is whatever, he&#39;s a public figure who has opened himself up to criticism and has done many bad things recently. But attacking the people who still appreciate his art and the work he puts out for the sole crime of being BETTER than fantano and being able to separate art from artist is just embarrassing scum bag shit. <br>Fantano, no one is forcing you to comment on VULTURES. If you don&#39;t want to review it, then just don&#39;t review it. But don&#39;t release some big, mean-spirited attack on people, with the album&#39;s image attached to it, because you just can&#39;t resist the ad rev that commenting on a big release will net you. <br>One last thing; I also don&#39;t think I can take fantano seriously as a critic anymore. Not because of how mean spirited he is in this video, I can separate his content from him, but because apparently he didn&#39;t even finish listening to the tracks? I didn&#39;t discover this myself, but I saw another video (which alerted me to this dumpster fire) where he appears to skip CARNIVAL when there&#39;s still like, a third of the song left??? If you&#39;re gonna comment on an album (which you have, in this video and on the stream) can you not spend and extra minute and a half to finish listening to a song, even if you&#39;re not feeling it? Embarrassing. <br><br><br>That was my critique. I understand that many people here will probably disagree with me, and I respect that. All I ask is that you don&#39;t be hateful or aggressive in the comments. Not just because it isn&#39;t worth any of our time, but also because if I pick up that a comment is going to be something like that, I will just stop reading it, and you&#39;ll have wasted your time typing it. Peace!
The comments are proving his thesis. üòÇ
Well done
I actually like hood rat
if he was trashing white people on every track of the record, you would praise it ü§°
Is that self-imposed ignorance or is that separating the art from the artist? Aka the more objective appreciative view of art...
It‚Äôs straight up garbage, accept it. All politics and comments he said aside the album is boring garbage period. üöÆ üò¥
You‚Äôre dog water at what you do
this one is getting a redux
Cry old headüòπüòπüòπ
womp womp cry about it Vultures is AOTY
It‚Äôs sad that politics have genuinely ruined this man
I think it‚Äôs absolutely reasonable to hold Kanye to what he says and does in his songs. It honestly makes his work just unlistenable for me now to. I just can‚Äôt support what he does anymore. Its not a reviewers job to review content with clearly hurtful and stupid lyrics all over it.
Didn&#39;t you say &quot;can bad people make good art? Short answer Yes!&quot;<br>You also reviewed Burzum... he burned down a synagogue and kiIIed a man because he was homosexual. You&#39;re a clown
Wdym by &quot;read the lyric&quot; you literally took them all to literal thats how ik you know nothing about rap/hip hop
I just enjoyed the music üò≠
He only cares when Kanye does it
I agree, it&#39;s just not a good album.
Common Anthony L
This mf is getting cooked üò≠‚ò†Ô∏è
This video was just fucking stupid
So let me get this straight....this dude will review satanic genres (carti, uzi, Carson, destory lonely) murderous, violent, explicit (Chief keef, durk, 21, etc etc any Chicago drill rapper) and &quot;mysogonistic&quot; rappers like Future, Weeknd, etc etc... but refuses to review an album cause they guy said a few things you disagree about dem Boyz? Hold the L on this one Fantano.
But he‚Äôll rate carti, a woman abuser and many more such as nazis
How can any of these ‚Äúdie hard Kanye fans‚Äù not see what a fall from grace this album is? It‚Äôs a far cry from anything pre 2012
60k people are nazis
Fire ass review. Don‚Äôt listen to these 12 year olds
The internets busiest ‚ÄúOld Head‚Äù also unsubscribed
Anybody deserves an album review in my opinion. Don‚Äôt matter what he done. Music is music.
Wdym &quot;unreviewable?&quot; Dawg at least give it a low score.
can gaurentee you‚Äôre on ssris. go outside.
Kanye is CRAZY but you are a MUSIC critic‚Ä¶.listen and make your opinion on the MUSIC
Guy gives MBDTF a light 5 üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
This is the &quot;poopty scoop&quot; of the reviews, minus the funny part.
Fantano got all the Kanye fans upset, and ended up proving his point right. They are defending antisemitism. üòÇ
I fw it but I would‚Äôve rather him just talk the music and how trash it is
Just become a political channel at this point.
Use this comment as the dislike button
Unforunately, some of the production sounds nice but then the lyrics are just...ugh. Kanye just doesn&#39;t sound like he knew why he was good before.
I NEED YOU TO DO A REDUX REVIEW ON THIS ALBUM just like you did for My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy &amp; the Life Of Pablo album I‚Äôve been following you for more than 10 years &amp; your review was not fair at all !!! YOU never give Kanye a chance your are a definitely farming Views with this one &amp; all the Other reviews you‚Äôve done on Ye.
Bro is a music reviewer and then skips over carti‚Äôs verse üò≠üò≠
20 years later, Kanye is still overrated.
‚ÄúTell me you‚Äôre a hypocrite without telling me you‚Äôre a hypocrite‚Äù
Kanye and this video are both tarded
Or there are people that just like his old music and some of his newer music. And also, don‚Äôt base their opinions or beliefs on anything celebrities say. People will praise people with a good public image and opinions but are secretly garbage.<br><br>Newsflash, celebrities and politicians all suck.<br><br>His new album is not good though, I will agree to that.
bros really rating his political opinions instead of the album
this pretentious mf always got a stick up his ass
Phantano looks like a chomo on the trial
It‚Äôs giving HATING VIBES bro I‚Äôve never seen you review someone like this before trust me I‚Äôve been around way before you even hit 1 million I‚Äôm talking 2010 bro
wheres the music review?
you&#39;re a music reviewer not a moral figurehead
Stop Bitchin about things you really don&#39;t know about. Get over it, people can have their opinions, have a cry.
Like bro what happened to you bro I looked forward to watching your reviews your not even talking about his music just about his fans like how is that fucking fair
I‚Äôve been following you for years your not even reviewing him your not giving it a chance your just degrading the üêê sorry I will unfollow you
i use the &#39;return youtube dislikes&#39; extension and rn its at 73k likes and 60k dislikes.<br><br>considering we&#39;re on fantano&#39;s channel [oh wait - we&#39;re actually on &#39;needle drop&#39; - the one that&#39;s supposed to be only about music!] i&#39;d suggest the melon has lost his melon. <br>the smug laugh at the end - bro, you apparently stopped being a music reviewer a long time ago
So just to be clear, rappers who talk about murdering people, trafficking drugs, fucking/rapeing women, etc are all completely fine, but saying stuff about the jews is too far for you? Fucking lmao
His hate for kayne is so disgusting.  I hope he loses subs over this.
Este tipo esta mal porque realmente para el album cumple y me gusta que el album sea desordenado , obvio las letra si son polemicas y ya depende de como te hayan educado en casa pero en mi opinion es un gran album donde las canciones son muy buenas
has he considered that those &quot;nihilistic teenagers&quot; actually might just enjoy the music and aren&#39;t really caught up in the world of hating on someone because they said nono words about jews, whatever happened to separating the artist from the art. You lose all credibility when you cant evaluate the music without getting all your personal beliefs involved which really have nothing to do with a music review. My 21 year old coworker put it on at work the other day, he loved it and I thought it was all right. Furthermore if an album said fuck white people every other song but with songs as good as Swans To Be Kind (or whatever your favorite release is) id blast that shit every month because content of lyrics can improve a song but will never make a banger into something bad.
kanye loooves hilter.
burn is good bruh mention good things about the album not just the bad stuff
This guys a Biden voter isn‚Äôt he?
Bro says it‚Äôs unreviewable but proceeds to review it around the 5 minute mark.
Huge Ye fan, still a big listener, this was dogshit.
What is blud yammering about just enjoy the music
Ok, please review The Madding Crowd by Nine Days
I don‚Äôt agree that those are the only three ‚Äúfans‚Äù. I absolutely despise his rhetoric and I hope he does genuinely right his ways. At the same time, I like his music and I have willed myself to separate art form artist. I know that isn‚Äôt acceptable. Fuck it sucks and it‚Äôs hard. I think the music is good and those lyrics do rub me the wrong way. I honestly don‚Äôt know how to feel. I listened to the whole album and enjoyed it after a first listen and then once I listened to it again and heard the lyrics it made it hard. Fuck. I‚Äôm sorry melon. Idk how to feel.
I dont usesualy take bros side but when i heard this album i thought i was trippin but he said it this album is a hot dumpster fire that is barreling down a hill towards a house fire full of kanye fans about ro be struck by a meteor
Mans talking bout teenagers hit hardüò≠
we all know you want viewers
Been watching since the backyard intros. You jumped the shark man.
Voc√™ que √© foda
Imagine hating someone for saying shit when theres rappers who actually rob and have killed people.... like how Kendrick killed someone when he was younger but eh that&#39;s alright but when YE says some shit about Jews it&#39;s too far lmfao<br><br>What a fucking joke this guy is
Are we reviewing music or people?
thats why you are divorced bald man
Imagine a world in which Fantano just stayed off of twitter entirely
So Kanye said ‚Äú*<b>***</b> was a choice‚Äù apperently, that wasn‚Äôt bad enough, because you kept reviewing his music. But when he called out the J‚Äôs, that‚Äôs where you draw the line ?, and now it‚Äôs unreviewable ?üòÇ Yeah you did nothing but prove his point all along.
Anthony Fantano. Kanye West. Vultures 1. FOREVER.
This guy is so lame. Critics are the worst. Literally has never done anything talented in his life. So inept.
he didn‚Äôt say anything bad about jewish people on vultures you‚Äôre reaching
Good thing i never listened any of Kanye&#39;s tracks, not even getting interested into and always knew that he sucks as a person in general.<br><br>I never liked this guy and i knew it would happen to him falling down to the pit of madness.
Mind you, all of these comments are trashing fantano for choosing not to review an album with NAZI AND ANTI-SEMITIC RETHORIC made by someone WHO PRAISED HITLER IN A SHOW WITH A CONSPIRATORIAL FAR-RIGHT HOST.<br><br>Think about that logically for JUST A SECOND, and you&#39;ll realize the disgusting reality of fascism being more widely normalized and accepted in society.<br><br>I shouldn&#39;t even need to praise Fantano for this stance. It&#39;s literally the BARE MINIMUM ANYONE can do when it comes to someone who has spread ideologies of hatred to such an extreme degree like Kanye has done EVEN IN HIS LYRICS, COVERS AND SHOWS.<br><br>It&#39;s also so sad that Kanye&#39;s cult has also resourced to just replying with the same &quot;Uhhh, you review people who have murdered&quot;, as if they have the influence that Kanye&#39;s hate-mongering has. You guys don&#39;t know shit about politics and how systems of power work, don&#39;t you?<br><br>Defending a Nazi just because he made Graduation is not the hill you&#39;ll want to die on, and you&#39;ll probably be embarrassed in the future that you ever did it at all.<br><br>Or you&#39;re just going to pretend you care about his music until he stops doing the Nazi rants, that&#39;s also a possibility.
This guys just known for his shit taste in music üòÇ sounds like the needle drop is just mad about Kanye‚Äôs fame.
kanye is literally going to end your career.
Yk, I am a big fantano fan so I‚Äôm a bit biased. But let‚Äôs be real, no matter how we feel about Kanye‚Äôs music (cuz I personally love a lot of it), he has been doing some messed up stuff recently. <br><br>Anthony could have simply not made any content surrounding it, but Vultures has been so popular that literally every youtube channel is talking about it. It‚Äôs better that he makes it very clear that it is an album rooted in some bad shit.<br><br>Replying to people talking about him reviewing other artists that have done worse stuff: give him a break. It‚Äôs hard to be in a position where people are asking you to review so much music and you are trying to judge if it‚Äôs morally correct or not. Stop judging him for making this point, he is bringing light to the fact that Kanye fans really gotta stop backing him up right now. I personally think that listening to his old shit is cool, but giving him support right now is feeding into the problem. Everyone was going to beg him to review this album, and he had to say something. Yes, it was a little bit long, but cmon, it got the message across and it was more entertaining than a tweet or some shit.
So instead of just not making a video about it you made this? Lol
Would‚Äôve been more effected to just criticize the music and not Kanye now people are just going to write off your review
This album was such a disappointment‚Ä¶
Hypocrite
Dude just do the review
Ever since Kanye supported Donald Trump Anthony has hated him it‚Äôs so obvious his political views have effected the reviews. Just review the music.
you review and give good scores to songs that have much worse lyrical content than this album. Albums that have songs that glorify gun violence, killing, gang life, drugs, etc are fine to review, but antisemitism is where you draw the line? You can&#39;t make the case that kanye&#39;s antisemitic lyrics are &quot;more genuine&quot; somehow than a travis scott song that promotes drugs, or a 21 savage song glorifying gun violence. If kanye&#39;s antisemitic lyrics had as much weight to them as you seem to think they do, then a song talking about killing someone is dangerous because people will kill people after hearing that. People are smart enough to listen to lyrics, know those lyrics are bad, and not be influenced by them.<br><br>A person&#39;s personal life should not be a factor when reviewing music, even if that personal life is in the lyrics. Kanye is a musical artist. People have also moved on from the comments from LAST YEAR. The album went number 1 in Israel, people have moved on and you should too. It&#39;s not that the people don&#39;t care about what he said, it&#39;s that they don&#39;t let what he said affect their listening experience. It&#39;s disingenuous as someone unaffected by his comment to call an album unreviewable because of what he said last year when so many others who WERE affected by it have moved on.
Bro said the same thing about Tory smh
Although Kanye deserves all the criticism he&#39;s received. I feel like this is all one big virtue signal
You just solidified yourself as a fraud music reviewer. There is no good reason your opinions should matter anymore.
This gotta be the most lonely man of all time but ok
Wow, not at all biased. Well done.
Comment section just shows how Ye fans are as braindead as Ye himself
Best album since Yezus
issa good album
Bro is soooo mad that the album is good xD
salty kanye fans everywhere in this comment section lmao
I used to like Kanye. Shame he turned out to be a fucking Illinois Nazi.
He must realise that giving this album this reaction kanye won right?
Stay mad.
So basically, this isn&#39;t a music review channel. This dude is a fraud, I saw this when he did the &quot;Tetsuo &amp; Youth&quot; album. It was clearly the best album of the year, and he gave it 7 out of 10. It&#39;s free range to go after Kanye especially  when he talked about Original Jewish/Semitic People being Black. I haven&#39;t trusted this dudes judgements since Tetsuo &amp; Youth.
Anybody who can see the like/dislike ratio of this video please tell me for my own satisfaction
If this album was called &quot;My Beautiful Dark Twisted Vultures&quot; you&#39;d have given it a 6
hes a jew, this review has inherent bias
This whole video screams, &quot;I&#39;m a hypocrite&quot;
Its a great album, love how much Ye triggers this guy.
Tbh tho Beg Forgiveness is fucking beautiful. The rest basically trash
You are a huge dork
Idk bout this one
Can we all agree that an unreviewable album by default just automatically means a zero because technically he did review it cuz he did say What he didn&#39;t like about some of the songs and everything. So technically he did a review in a sense
7 min yap sesh
i was listening to this thinking &quot;this n gga has lost it.&quot;
I think the album needs time to marinate and that Fant will re-review with a more positive rating in future! :D
Bro totally forgot that Kanye revolves around introspective sampling
Bro is the bias master
That&#39;s cool, what about the album itself?
paid is not a copy of fade wym lil bro
Bro is offendedüíÄ
do yall think it is because anyone wants to work with kanye no more?
guess we&#39;ll never know
Old Melon head is agnwy
Imagine using the phrase &quot;left the Reservation&quot; while being offended by Kanye&#39;s racism.   ü§î
stop with the hate comments. i can‚Äôt like em all
You&#39;re bald
Just a reminder that a literally Nazi got invited to the Canadian Parliament and received a standing ovation from the left wing party. And people are still voting for this government. Compare that to Kanye.
this is why your wife left you
You are a feminist.
nerd
Does Nihilism expire with teenage?
WAY I POP MY SHIT. HOES NOT READY. IM GOING BONKERS
BEAUTIFUL BIG TITTY BUTT NAKED WOMEN DON&#39;T JUST FALL OUT THE SKY YA KNOW
Oy vey
not even a top 3 album from kanye but to say &quot;unreviewable&quot; just goes to show how much of a joke this guy is. acting like an edgy pretentious teen while pushing 50, crazy times
Simp take bud
This is sad man. I have been your fan for a long time and you have let me down. This is honestly disgusting that you brought his personal life and politics into the music. I would like to see how many other artists who said things you don‚Äôt agree with and you didn‚Äôt review. Really sad man. You have lost a fan today.
If anyone else had put out this exact same record, you‚Äôd give it a 10/10. üôÑ
Melon head trying to get views off of Kanyes name ü§£ &quot;still the king&quot;
does anyone else think kanye sounds like an eunuch     ?
Are you Jewish?
Yeah your opinion doesn‚Äôt matter anymore unfortunately giving sexy redd an 8 and this unreviewable is absolute madness. Had to of been paid off or sum
The obvious question everyone should be asking is this: Why should any of us be told who or what to support? It all sounds like an agenda to me. I‚Äôm not on anybody‚Äôs side. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Just for the record, I&#39;m feeling a high 7 for this. Agree? Disagree? Let me know in the comments below....
He&#39;s one of the reasons i think bipolar and other linatics should be locked away from society
I&#39;m just here for the Kanye stan tears.
get over yourself man. you&#39;ve reviewed albums equally as &quot;immoral&quot; or arguably even worse from some artists.
Cry abt it this shi fire
yall kanye fans are legit so die hard he has never made a good song
Hatin ahh melon
he sounds like my math teacher
thank you
7/10 album that he gonna regret not reviewing eventually and will probably revisit in the future
count your days fraud
this feels more like a rant towards kanye fans that have annoyed you from twitter and your reaction to the album, then any bit the actual album itself.
Anthony Woketano
Fantano the hypocrite
Review more ween bub
Click bait üòÇ
‚ÄúLooking like a reference‚Äù clearly referring to a nude art model. Cmon you‚Äôre better than that
After the fall out of the Nicki and Meghan beef, and now the Kanye fans shamelessly selling their souls for an album, I want you and Shawn Cee to take back your claim that Eminem has the worst fan base in HipHop. You owe us that. Seriously, the worst thing that Em fans do is argue that ALL his  music is great and he‚Äôs the best rapper‚Ä¶very innocuous stuff
cornball
not good but doesn‚Äôt deserve a not good
If you listen to the album front to back and the conclusion that you have is that Kanye is speaking facts or Kanye is a genius you are a fucking moron. I can personally point to any other song in the past and tell you why it is way better than anything on this album. Every Kanye performance on the album fucking sucks ass and is clearly not on the same level as anything that has come before it especially in terms of lyrics. As a person who consumes Kanye&#39;s music for years you can clearly hear a decline in lyrical substance starting 2018 (I kinda give Donda and Kids See Ghost a Pass). These are some of the goofiest fucking bars that I cannot find time to sit through, and they clearly indicate a new low for him and its just sad. I get the reason for no review, Kanye isn&#39;t in the right mindset anymore to make music in good faith. If the Donda 2 roll out hasn&#39;t taught you anything than this surely should. Also Carnival is straight up doo doo dog ass.
jesus
Bruh just review the music. It ain&#39;t that deep
Would&#39;ve been easier to just ignore tha album? What a crybaby
&quot;Unreviewable trash&quot; <b>starts reviewing it</b>
These are the type of videos that YouTube removed dislikes for
Album is üî•. Hes not black and not from the hood so who cares about his opinion on hip hop?
The more children fanbase havin ass content creators adressed this, the more dislikes the vid got
lmfao ye comments too much but bro can like GG Allin promoting death to LGBT and minorities in his music. bros the biggest hypocrite ever.
NEWS VULTURES 2 has Lil Wayne on it üî•
id honestly argue that when these ppl say &quot;they only care about the music&quot;, they mean it and heres what i mean. ive noticed that this younger generation (me included) usually only like music for how it sounds. most of the time i could give 2 fucks what an artist is saying. for me its about the sound and what emotion hearing said sound elicits from me. that being said... yeah this album aint the best...
At this point this guys reviews and opinions are completely not taken into account this guy doesn&#39;t know music
wow. you‚Äôre such a brave human being. you review music. wake up
You&#39;re the biggest loser online, holy moly
This is definitely another argument towards Kanye being replaced - new version has not talent (or his tattoos). It‚Äôs like someone is giving us an impression of Ye
People are waking up
I kept telling people in 2016 that youre a moron and they believed me .... imma say it again now and people will still believe cuz its true
When this guy moves in your neighborhood, he makes noise complaints
BBTBNWJDFOTSYK
How are you going to call out Kanye‚Äôs lyrics as misogynistic, but Lil Pump or any other rapper who makes a TON of misogynistic bars is somehow fun music to your ears? You‚Äôre unbelievable man.
üåΩ
Go touch grass
i dont even listen to Kanye like that but i listened to the album and its a solid 8/10. Melon trippin
How is this person relevant?<br>What credibility does he have?<br>I&#39;m not throwing shade or anything...but who actually values his reviews?<br>If he helps you in any way...please leave a comment below telling me how he does. Thank you‚ù§
all i wanted to know is if it was worth listening toüíÄ idgaf about the political situationüíÄ
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=267">4:27</a> This could be true but when you look at his older videos reviewing albums such as Tyler the Creator&#39;s &quot;Bastard&quot; or &quot;Goblin&quot; he gives them fair reviews and at least a chance although the lyrics are pretty messed up.
He&#39;s crazy. And probably did not make the album or does not make music in general with the goal of pleasing others.<br><br>If you instead of listening the piece of art/production as just that, but analyze it as some kind of political statement or how correct it is in any way, of course it&#39;s shit.<br><br>And i&#39;m not saying if you do listen to it as just a piece of art/production and don&#39;t like it, that you&#39;re wrong.
My comment got deleted, bro is terrifiedüòÇ
Why can‚Äôt we just separate the artist from the art? Really annoying man. Fantano also acting like he‚Äôs never reviewed a controversial artist who has done bad things.
Kanye is a neo-nazi his music should not be consumed by anyone.
I think we can all agree we came here for a music review, not you sitting here giving us your personal opinion on Kanye‚Äôs life. I would‚Äôve much rather you given an honest review of to me a personally mid album, rather than listening to you rant like a school girl about what another grown man says and does in his personal life. Give us the content we want not your weak pointless opinion of him as a person
Crazy how this shit has double the views of your 2nd most viewed in the last yearüòê
i will follow kayne bruh love the music
cringe
your hair is long you should cut it dude
Anthony can‚Äôt get any more cringe
allowing aspects outside of the sound of the album to detur you from sharing your thoughts ain&#39;t it
Funny you‚Äôre saying all this with the Hitler mustache.
Cool virtue signaling, great music review
man you gay
Honestly, you should&#39;ve just skipped the video if you didn&#39;t wanna talk about it. <br><br>Kanye is the human embodiment of garbage (as a person), i enjoyed a few songs on vultures though, but the video feels like you&#39;re just mad. Just ignore Kanye.
I think I listened to the first 30 seconds of Back To Me on repeat, since the bars on that record are trash. I am sorry, that song could of been one of his best , the beat and the hook by Ty$ is golden but then it falls rather quickly until Freddy gets on.
I know for a fact people like you ain‚Äôt real
Wait isn‚Äôt your job to review music?
Is there a locker on earth Anthony fantano hasn‚Äôt been stuffed into?
Big Respect Man, any ill response from this only illuminates your influence, keep going we trust you üëäx
Kanye West is the Metallica of hip-hop: released two good albums and then trash for the rest of time.
You literally rated albums for years  that promote black on black violence, violence jn general and objectifying women. Just admit your bais and move on, you fell off bro.
Dude this is the most butthurt ive EVER seen Fantano
I will never watch another review from you
Clownworld
Well at least Fantano shows his true fascist colors of not believing in free speech and wanting to cancel/censor and ban people. What‚Äôs it like to be a Nazi Fantano?
Rappers that Murder: great üëç<br><br>Kanye says bad things about Jews: unreviewable
so you called it that for views
He has reviewed artists who have KILLED PEOPLE and have those messages in the lyrics of their songs. Give kanye some justice
You failed to possibly look at what he is trying to say with his antisemitic rants? The memeology as formula in his music? and styles on album, highly  likely to be copied? Just like Madonna and others, controversy (or hype) has been a part of pop (and Ye hybrid hip hop) for quite some time. I personally think there is possibly 2/3 good songs/tracks on this album, not that there are not a few good features, that are good aside the tracks being dull. I also think your review has bent a knee to certain audience, and comes off as pretentious (if it really bothers you? why do this?) I am not a Ye fan personally, but I found this &quot;non review&quot; as equally cringe and like many thing unspoken in society, perhaps you culture &quot;Vultures&quot; do need to discuss some difficult topics. Ahem!
So this is Unreviewable because Kanye said some bad things? Yet, Varg Vikernes who you have reviewed multiple times is? Varg literally murdered his bandmate and burned down churches. He is an actual Neo Nazi and served time in prison.
I like this non-review, but yelleing the N-word 15 consecutive times at ye was a bit excessive u think?
nuh uh <b>finger wags intensely</b>
Beard needs a trim
not a melon or kanye fan but hes right
POV: you see a bald middle aged man having a meltdown
how is your wife doing?üôÇ
Man, this shit is, fucking ridiculous
Yeah the album is trash but give it a scoreeeee
The real issue with all you soft commenters is that Fantanto is consistently correct and you can‚Äôt handle it
but you&#39;ll review murderers and rapists... and burzum
what&#39;s this phenotype btw? male feminist?
Can‚Äôt believe he used to review screwdriver albums and now it‚Äôs a problem?
please never rate again
yet he reviewed burzum. butthurt whiny bald word i cant say on here
review the album bro no one cares that u hate kanye lmao
News flash, <br>you do know it is possible to feel he says many bigoted things and is definitely a narcissist and not acting as the best human being right now, but still has amazing production and music theory writing ability. The two ideas are not mutually exclusive bud.  <br>You don‚Äôt have to obsess over lyrics 24/7
this is why your wife left you
bro trying to hate on the albumüòÇüòÇüòÇ
What did you rate your divorce papers ?
Kanye‚Äôs music today is like a fashion models outfit or a high end department store mannequin. There‚Äôs things I like about it, but it‚Äôs ultimately not for me. I don‚Äôt feel as strong as melon does, but 100% understand where he‚Äôs coming from.
&quot;You would have to expect me to separate my brain from my skull to ignore it&quot; that&#39;s a bar
Factz nobody cares about this man&#39;s music from couple heard were str8 üóë..your best and honest review yetüíØ
Find god
This dude is a dweeb
unwatchable 1
Anthony Fantano has such a punchable face idk why. Maybe its his ability to absolutely NEVER form his own opinion. Literally every mainstream opinion that comes out he will latch on to and parade it around like look at me! I agree with everything you‚Äôre supposed to socially!
You had no problem reviewing Burzum though
this not even professional anymore , he doesn‚Äôt even talk about the music
Loser
Ant is a &quot;Pick Me&quot; for Ye... He wont date you melon, no matter how many unreviewables you give him.üò¢
Ok jew
Sounds like you‚Äôre a jew
for a mn i believed Marc Rebillet shaved his hair lol
The production alone makes this a 5, the beats go crazy
Sad, sad rant and absolutely ridiculous &quot;review&quot;, lmao. The absolute stuck-up energy of this is at least funny to observe
Fantano just being a SJW where its cool to be.<br>How can you review someone who has killed at least 7 people and brags about it on his album but refuse to review someone (who is mentally ill) because of statements they have made (while probably having an episode)?! Nind boggling
retire lil bro
Thank you for this. Kanye‚Äôs antisemitism is profoundly dangerous due to the scale of his following, most of whom apparently swallow and mimic his irrational screeds (as trump followers do their their corrosive idol).
This has to be the gayest review on the internet
You‚Äôre bald
Tl:Dr for video<br>Kanye is a bad person and the songs suck
Nah this dude a left wing nut job!
Okay but don‚Äôt bother speaking about music one second then. Like you really have to smoke crack to think it is worst than Jesus is King
if your jewish just say so, biased review
why are u so unfair to ye you said head so good she a honor roll was a bad bar but hoods hottest princess is on you‚Äôre top 10 albums. how are you gonna complain about that but have one of the most sexual albums of 2023.
This an unwatchable review...
didn&#39;t expect a fantano fall off video on my bingo card this year.
Oh brotherrrr this guy stinks!
rents due
Insecure mayo  laden cave m0nkey sftu. I love the album because it upsets you
Watching one person you hate trash another person you hate is pretty satisfying. If only either of them had a brain.
When hatred affects your ears...
Kanye is able to make Fantano this upset.  What a legend.
It‚Äôs getting sad man, please just get off of twitter. You don‚Äôt have to respond to every single person who criticizes you, you‚Äôre clearly very insecure about what you said here.
Looks like I‚Äôm gonna have to listen to the album for myself
Literally listened to the album a ton and not skipped a track once. Can play it right through. Honestly not done thst in years. Maybe since Lauryn Hill, or D`angelo Voodoo. Bro hatred is affecting your ears üòÇ
Hater ass dude
Great review
This man got out the wrong side of the bed today üòÇ
He did speak facts about Nick Fuentes though.
Thank you for being so harsh on his relationship It‚Äôs fucking disgusting
aweonaooooo
It&#39;s kind of ironic that you chose to review Kanye&#39;s public statements as opposed to the album he released but whatever. I came here for music reviews. This video is just kind of corny
Hypocritical melon
Has he ever put out a good review?
what honestly is the point of this video?
Fantano, just because you didn‚Äôt like the album, doesn‚Äôt mean you should go around saying you would go ‚ÄúDEFCON 3 on Jews‚Äù and That podcast you did with Alex Jones doesn‚Äôt help at all.
if it was called To pimp a vulture you woulda gave it a 10
&quot;Emotional, &#39;motional, &#39;motional, &#39;motional<br>Why you emotional? Why you emotional?<br>Ah, bitch, you emotional, yeah&quot; - Kendrick
You gotta be the most butthurt grown man on the planet, especially when you be reviewing the albums of known felons but then feel the need to rant about someone&#39;s bad opinions
lame
just like your channel, unwatchable
another poop and unoriginal take by this guy. stick to reviewing music and stop trying to be a brain-rot media commentator
Ok to not review but why make a video on it then? We know you dislike Ye, but what about the music? Feel like your opinions a a bit coloured, and one cannot be 100% objective, but idk, you review music.
That&#39;s crazy... alexa play carnival
Never let bro cook again
Heard now everyone listen to Jesus Is King, overlooked but beautiful in every way. On God and God Is, enough said.
Dude really just chanting as how bad a person is Kanye as an excuse to not review the album. Unsub.
This guy Ran to make this video. <br><br>This guys is making good money of Kanye. Over one million views. <br><br>You should demonetize this video!!
man, i absolutely love and appreciate your reviews and especially appreciate the incredible effort you put into giving a nuanced and straightforward reflection on this album. i can&#39;t imagine the shit you get on a regular basis, which is surely dialed up to 1000 as a result of your dedication to honestly and objectively reviewing (or NOT reviewing) this thing. super appreciate what you do, and what you did here.
this video is so annoying
FINALLY! Someone who agrees with me and thinks this album is garbage.
GET HER JADE
Hold up. You say unreviewable then proceed to review?
i liked it, i liked paid
thanks man
THE NI**A IS JEWISH SOMEHOW I FEEL THIS WAY
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=305">5:05</a> the review starts here
Kanye‚Äôs #1 cock watcher
You&#39;re full of it, Fantano. If you&#39;re going to be reviewing music based on moral/ethical purity from now on, you ought to purge your reviews of any artist/band guilty of past crimes. Kanye has repugnant views, but you&#39;re a music reviewer and he made music. How you feel about his beliefs is irrelevant.
you do know that this type of reaction only adds to the spectacle and goes against what you were trying to achieve. IF YOU REALLY GAVE A SHIT YOU WOULDNT EVEN CREATE A VIDEO TO ADDRESS IT.
Your politics have broken your brain. Enjoy your slow decent.
Whether you give it a rating or not, the video still monetizes all the same
After listening to Earl Sweatshirt, Billy Woods...Kanye&#39;s album just is crap...its awful.
Liked the Album by moments, like the production, the lyrics are either good or very bad. Obviously I will not even begin to pardon anything he says or does, but I still like the album. I would give a huge plus to the production because it was really good imo. Loved your unreview and totally understand why you think this way. Keep up the good work!
If sexyred was on the album he would ve give it a 10
What if I want to listen to a song because it sounds good? Why are you taking such a moral high ground and bashing his fanbase? Sure there are a lot of idiots but that should be pretty obvious to someone who is as chronically online as yourself. Why are you so involved in how others decide to listen to music? Lol, I have too many questions.
Wow I mean good for the pr I guess but come on man
I think he‚Äôs just being childish by not reviewing it
Why don&#39;t you keep this same moral standard when reviewing other artist&#39;s music? Why do you claim that Kanye&#39;s statements have actual impact on the real world, then give a pass to artists who glorify gang violence and objectifying women?
No one can persuade you otherwise but your entire argument can be applied to the American government, corporate capitalism, dairy market etc. <br>All of their brands cannot be separated from their actual truth vs their product. <br>Enjoy what you want
All these people talking about Burzum arent actually making a compelling argument. That was a long ass time ago, and people change a lot in that time. And im sorry but fuck Kanye, he&#39;s always had some of the most annoying stans.
This review will age terribly
fontano as a jew im telling you to please stfu and delete ur channel
Credibility just plummeted. I didn&#39;t really like the album either, but this video is just plain stupid, especially from you.
Stop talking about him then but you cant can you. This is the only time you can afford crablegs. This is the only time you get so many views. Look at you eating well for the first time in such a longtime go collect that check.
guys calm down. what yall expect from a guy that gave sexy redd an 8
I personally disagree as it would be possible for a review to be made
You‚Äôre completely biased
Oh Anthony. Did I ever hear a load of crap. You&#39;re not being the authentic album reviewer you once were. You&#39;ve become a puppet of the internet who&#39;s too scared to give his real opinion. <br><br>To be clear, I&#39;m not a Kanye fan but I do enjoy his music. Yes, Hoodrat was utter trash. Yes, there&#39;s irreverence towards the antisemitism and mysoginism in some of the lyrics. But there&#39;s no grounds for you to say the album is his worst. Donda 2 was far worse than this. What I&#39;m actually upset about is that you have abandoned your vocation of giving out unbiased, genuine record reviews and have now strayed into giving the internet what you think it wants. I feel sorry for you melon. Grow a pair.
The ones you‚Äôre not allowed to speak against ü§î
bruh if you watch this kids twitch stream his doing to much, you lit know that the songs are good stop d1 hating, how tf are you so pressed over an album on your stream, the mf kanye dont even know you exist and your going off on him, who tf says this guys opinion is valid. Like you are some random white guy who sits down and says random stuff abt albums, you actually think people think your the &quot;reviewer&quot; of music, bro couldnt hop on the mic for the life of him and hes giving kanye an unreviewable. get a real job my brotha
we want music review not political review ü§¶
My two Cents - Kanye is a horrible person; that much is very obvious. A few songs on the album, like King, have some very questionable and rude verses in them. Still, I really enjoy a few songs. Beg Forgiveness is a banger. I also like Stars, Talking, Vultures, and Carnival. The rest is very mid or trash. Does my take make me a hateful Psycho, Nihilistic teenager, or an obsessed cult member? I think I should be able to enjoy a song like Beg Forgiveness (a song where he doesn&#39;t talk about any of his opinions) without being labeled a bad person.
Get your money fantano.. word up protect the mass media slave master with your intellect üëç
Salvation is found in Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ loves you all
Kanye is antisemitic.. OK so how is he number 1 at Zionist state of Israel üòÇ
So you like it, eh ?üòè
from this point on you cant review music from people how have commited crimes like, killing, kidnapping, armed robbery
we watch you to review music not for your politics, even if i agree with you
Bro politics is making u a sad person .
It‚Äôs mid not awful chill
Guy thinks he‚Äôs the be all and end all of good music, first off it‚Äôs subjective so shut up just coz u review music on YouTube doesn‚Äôt mean your opinion is fact and bro some of that music was good e.g burn
damn bro das crazy, aight ima listen to &#39;do it&#39; now
The response to this video by the majority of the internet has been a downer
He just yapping for the views
i genuinely just like the sound lol
You should retire after this one, Mr. Fat Tony.
I hate when people make shit out to be such a big deal and your a horrible human if u disagree with them, shut up Anthony music is music
how is it unreviewable lmao ?? you making this video, is the same thing as reviewing it. congrats, you made a video about kanye. you take an L
I couldn&#39;t disagree more. But I generally love your content. Oh well.
here have a cookie
This video is literally just hating bc you don‚Äôt like him. Ofc he has gone off the deep end but you can love his music or at the least respect the major influence he has had on music. Being in denial and not reviewing it is your choice but makes you weak and insensible.
Thought &#39;unreviewable 1&#39; was the title for this album because Ye would name his project like that
Why even waste your time to do this video then?
ATP this channel is just bros political views. No wonder he&#39;s pissy about the divorce, lol
I guess we know needledrop is Jewish nowüòÇüòÇüòÇü´µ
This is why your wife divorced you Fantano
who is the douchebag?
Cry harder
U listen to and praise murderers rap about murdering claiming it‚Äôs cool to murder. Pick a lane
Kanye was having a manic episode. Move on.
Fantano just because an independent successful black man released this album doesn‚Äôt mean you should call it trash
Solid 7 tbh
Mr Bald when an artist is a gang member and commits crimes: 8/10 üòÄ<br>Mr Bald when Kanye doesn‚Äôt like Jews: unreviewable <br><br>Kanye is insane especially right now the guy is a wack job but you look pretty silly right now teehee
Bro you are a music reviewer do your fucking job no one gives a fuck
If it‚Äôs not reviewable why even post this üòÉ
Ironic moustache...
I know he secretly likes it
I expected a dark sky paradise type review. Ye it&#39;s time to learn the flute
This vid comes off as so pessimistic and obsessive. No wonder his wife left him ü´°
Listen, I like your content alot! But you gaslight and cancel alot of artists right now. More debates then actual music reviews. If Kanye is a bad guy, there are alot of bad people out there making dope music. Michael Gira of Swans has accusations of violence and rape and you just did a classic review of them. You could at least give a score, I mean come on!
Can&#39;t say anything about jews but they can say anything about anyone else. Yup, that&#39;s balanced
Congrats! You deserve the woke-king medal.
You extremely bias bro ooff  just review it and say its bad
cry about it fantano
this dude hates to see people of color succeed.
Hey Melon, just wanted to say Im a guy you wouldn‚Äôt expect to appreciate this video. I‚Äôm not exactly a guy who would generally be considered moral. Similar to Kanye West. I appreciate this review. It‚Äôs critical, honest and accountable to the artist‚Äôs clear motivation for their commerce: the latter being something many consumers of art overlook based on ignorance. Just wanted to say the people who understand your intention with this truly appreciate your unfaltering integrity. As someone who lacks that, it‚Äôs inspiring and moving. Thanks for keeping true to who you are, I had no doubt you wouldn‚Äôt.
Reminder. He gave MBDTF a 6.
fantano you gotta stop being a legit dumbass bro
Interesting take considering more than half of the rap community is made up of criminals/ sing about heinous activities. Ye hasn‚Äôt done anything, he just talks. His ideas do influence people, however if that‚Äôs your issue why have you never discussed Lil Nas X lap dancing on the devil? His entire fandom is comprised of children, don‚Äôt think you that‚Äôs more pressing? Anyways this is just my opinion, nothing more
Well I&#39;d say the purpose of a music review and by extension a music review channel is to review the music, not immediately go into an antisemite and misogynist diatribe about nothing
You failed to separate the music from the art for multiple reviews of albums on which rappers killed their opps and bragged about them on the tracks. We need the same energy with everyone.
You gave grouper a 6 out of 10 Anthony  ehy
What if I just fw da album
talking about &quot;hoodrat&quot; made me want to listen to the album again for the 312th time
Yeah, Kanye is crazy and shouldn&#39;t be promoted. But when rappers rap about killing in the streets you have to be sensitive to the context of their lived experience and you rate the album normally, but if someone believes anti-Jewish conspiracies, its the worst thing ever and you need to specifically punish them. Either be consistent or just acknowledge your obvious biases.
u suck
i don&#39;t get it, you said there are two reasons you review music, if you can&#39;t do it for the reason of encouraging people to listen to this, why don&#39;t you do it as you said to tell people what you do like or don&#39;t like about it ? Censure on this day and age on youtube i wouldn&#39;t have thought ...
Who does he refer to as a booger eating white supremesist at the start
Common L needledrop crying about Kanye being right about what he‚Äôs said üòÇ
This one of those moments where I wish you could see the dislikes
u dropped of hard
Showing your old age in your recent review. Get off youtube unc
Ain‚Äôt still number 1 with no push
Fantano correct yet again. Stay mad that your favorite artist is falling off but you can‚Äôt stop the march of time.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=152">2:32</a> actually there 4 the 3 you said and the but he made graduation tho fans
i&#39;m just here to give a dislike. Lova ya
More dislikes than likes
This why I dont take this mf serious. It‚Äôs cool to review king Von but Kayne is worse somehow ? Lmao Fantano is a joke and always has been
Okay but can I wear my Yeezy 500s I can‚Äôt afford new trainers and AF1s are trashed. Am I a bigot for wearing Yeezy 500s please melon TELL ME WHAT TO DO WITH MY BRAIN
SEPERATE THE MUSIC FROM THE ARTIST
disagreeing with an artists political agenda does not deem his album unreviewable by a music critic.
big talk hating on Hitler from a guy that is two razor strokes away from the perfect Hitler &#39;stache
Donda would be disappointed. She truly was the only one ever holding him together. A damn tragedy this has become
Ay man I liked the album fuxk yall
Couldn‚Äôt listen to it. And the devil/evil imagery is lame af
Virtue signaling on an album with a shit ton of bangers
Fantano is right with everything he said
Thanks for this! I was legit listening to it and just ignoring the bad parts without even realizing. Don&#39;t be let down by all the hate that you&#39;re getting now, keep at it!!
Delusional.
You have to keep this same energy for every artist, you know? All future controversial artists, topics, etc, you have to say you can‚Äôt ‚Äúseparate the art from the artist‚Äù.
your inability to fathom relatability in the lyrics &quot;im just here to get paid&quot; proves you are out if touch with reality. song is a banger for the working man, especially on fridays
Bro
Everyone‚Äôs life has meaning Anthony. I don‚Äôt like that you said people have no meaning, it‚Äôs insensitive and fucked up bruh. Truly.
Pimp a vultures<br>Kids see vultures<br>The vultures store
kanye is bad and we all should hate him and the people who support him because the people who say so, said so? fall in line or else?
This is atleast a 7 just admit it
bro mad cuz he a jew
Anthony scared to give this a good review
4. People who just like the music and beats because music is subjective and can see the difference between when he‚Äôs wrong and right
Cope at its finest. Not his best album but better than a lot of music you reviewed favourably. We get it identity politics and activism trumps your ability to do your job.
Honestly can&#39;t blame melon for this vid at all
Fantano - what about the music you‚Äôve rated highly that talks about killing / gang banging? What about the families that were affected by you promoting such violent music? I don‚Äôt even listen to Ye but how can you be such a hypocrite? Ohhhh that‚Äôs right. Y‚Äôall internet mf‚Äôs will say anything to please the ears of those who pay your bills. Too funny !!! ü§£
Alguien que me traiga el chisme en espa√±ol porque no entiendo bien qu√© pas√≥. El √°lbum de Kanye est√° suave, pero no es para tanto la vdd
MALD MORE
this dudes a beta cringe wet wipe, get out of your safe safe space feels and review it for the music.  Fannytano should join the view with the ideologically posessed.
Kanye could litteraly do anything and still be more liked than you lil bro so does it really matter üòÇ
Edit: Thanks for the gold, kind stranger!
Ye, the real black klans man
if it was called kids see vultures he would&#39;ve given it a 10
Kanye sycophants should eat more Twix.
You are the most wrong type of person to be rating this just seperate the artist from the music.
Damn ye cultists mad mad
Fantano is pro Netanyahu
If you like the music you like the music. I never understood the point listening or a reading a review
Are you stupid , talking about his wife
So basically you dont listen to anything that comes from an artist who has opinions you disagree with?
Serial killer goes hard but a anti semite should not be listened to
ky6-1
Don&#39;t even act like the line from BACK TO ME isn&#39;t stuck in your head rn
You can see from the first frame of the video that he‚Äôs been handheld and gun held, in order To this rich public
Interesting take and also it&#39;s worth pointing out how people are determined to seek ,,the old Kanye&quot; and cite numerous references to the past projects of him.
Kanye Stans being butt hurt is comedy gold.
just stick to the album reviews &amp; leave your political opinions out of it
mauld more
It seems personal for you
Fantano is an industrial sized cock inhaler
Lordddd shut up fantano ur a joke
We need dislike button back
This Album is reviewable. Don‚Äôt listen to this guy. I am not a Kanye fan but the Album has some bangers. Anthony knows this but he is being paid. If he supports Kanye he will be cancelled. Also he might be hurt by something. He actually sounds like a hater and like a Kanye rant.
Fantano has been a sell out for a while but refusing to review an album because of public backlash is something that he himself would have laughed at someone for 10 years ago .
2, 3, Mic check mi check, FANTANUS ü•∏
the part where u &quot;categorize&quot; people who actually still like Kanye, to me, is far more offensive than anything he has said and done.
No he‚Äôs wrong
It would have been a bizarre predicament had Kanye put out 10/10 music after his downfall onto insanity
I think he likes making people mad...
I wanna hear the kind of music you world make üòÇ
everyone knows, no one cares
&quot;unreviewable&quot;<br><b>looks inside</b><br>a review
Why bother doing this video Anthony? I hope you‚Äôre ok
you can‚Äôt tell me burn isn‚Äôt the best song that‚Äôs gonna drop this year
Ah yes, I love my &quot;music review&quot; being almost over 70% social commentary and the 30% left being half-assed &quot;analysis&quot;.<br>Maybe you be a good little youtuber next time and give us the music review we give you our time for; Because nobody gives a shit about your personal beliefs boy, less so when you&#39;re just beating a dead horse like a pathetic grifter.
bring this guys divorce paper rq
If you wasn‚Äôt gone review the music then why make a video ‚Ä¶ you just wanted a cookie lol I‚Äôm a black man and I support Kanye
Reminder that Anthony has given a Burzum album a 6 previously
He did give it a rating, it&#39;s in the title of the video.
don‚Äôt care if he says he hates jews, put it under a hell of a life sample and it goes crazyü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
it&#39;s so ironic a hip hop community full of white supremacists
You can tell he‚Äôs trying HARD not to like this album
kanye doesnt apologize for anything and no one should expect him too
Be a convicted murderer promoting degenerate acts in their music? Yeah Anthony will check you out. Have some weird opinions? --&gt; LITERALLY UNREVIEWABLE.
This shit is so crazy üòÇ ye still tha goat üêê
I thought this was supposed to be a music review channel, not given biased reactions.
Cry me a river
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=278">4:38</a> aplasticplant catching heat
it is unreviewable but you go on to review it. conscientious assholes with narrow minds, commenting on and taking a stand to a camera. youre just as bad as him.
Mans just chattin üëèüèΩüëèüèΩüíØ
If Ye was just anti-Israel you would be all over this like a moth to a flame, I don‚Äôt like Ye but last I checked aren‚Äôt you a music critic not a political analyst? Rare melon L
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=257">4:17</a> &quot;I can&#39;t be racist my dog is black&quot; type of excuse üòÇ
this video sucks
Dude talking about nazis looking like one lol
i miss the old kanye
Buddy is just yapping
Shitty take Fantano
Fantano is seething that multiple of these songs are going viral on tiktok lmao. Still the King.
This is the same guy who thinks King Von rapping about people that he murders ‚Äúgoes hard‚Äù. Nothing except virtue signalling here from fantano, it‚Äôs quite obvious when he spends more of his time painting kanye fans black and white rather than addressing kanye himself; you‚Äôre either a psychotic loser or you aren‚Äôt a kanye fan. Just disgusting behaviour from yet another individual who never deserved a platform
kanye fans gonna be crying over this as per usual but fantano said what needs to be said
Ppl are gonna call Ye antisemitic for supporting palestine hes still grinding despite defamation. Also we are not Ye or Bianca so speculation over their relationship is lame and uninformed. Sad other fans are sending you death threats though and defending his antisemitism.
I miss Donda
Faking it
if you cant separate the artisz from the art, the itself gets overshadowed with the behaviour of the artist and of course you wont like it. that being said making this review you basically dont look at the music itself, you look at kanye being kanye, which defetata the purpose of an ALBUM review
You&#39;re a music reviewer, you should stick to reviewing music
Good review fantano love that ur not letting ppl taint ur accurate review of this shitty album
why doesn&#39;t he keep this standard of reviewing when it comes to rappers rapping about people they have killed?
We just like music<br>I can&#39;t u do the same<br>Bitchless looking depressing no money making balding ahh
Am I the only one that thought the line ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not racist, it‚Äôs a preference‚Äù was referring to the fact that he likes white women? Not too sure what what‚Äôs wrong with that specific lyric. Rest of the album is pretty trash though
haha Ye made him re-evaluate his whole existence
This guy is like the critic Anton Ego from Ratatouille.
Kanye: Slavery was a choice.<br>Anthony Fantano: Yeah we good.<br>Kanye: Juice bad.<br>Anthony Fantano: ü§¨ no review
Anthony, all respect for you.<br>Sincerely, <br>I think most of the people that&#39;s interested in the core feelings of the lyrics and contents of the album, should  look deeply into the context, interviews and developments of this &quot;Villain Phase&quot; which, at first could be seen as some Todd Phillips Joker evolution, but ive watched the interviews myself,  seeing him talkling to Lex Friedman, understanding was possible even for Lex being almost crushed and sad by the firsts things he thought Ye was saying,  Lex was sad, they kept talking, a bigger perspective arose, and suddenly his words werent that offensive but interesting. then you could see where all that &quot;trash&quot; was coming from. being that said, im not supporting any kind of racism, or violence. and i think he isn&#39;t aswel, its just a  language used to emphasis rage and anger and pain. music is always and expression.
Still don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs unreviewable, but ok.
I swear, Kanye fans are the weirdest weirdos. They&#39;re mad because a guy on YT doesn&#39;t want to review an album. Pathetic. The album is trash anyways. -7
Am I sexual?  YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
This guy has no testosterone in his system lol
4th type of kanye fan: i just like the music an unhealthy amount
You know nothing about music
Hey look! your a fantano vid that hit a million views.. haven&#39;t seen that in awhile.
I didn&#39;t remendar oordering a yappuccino
Bro you get paid to do reviews not get your panties in a twist. This is why less people watch your ‚Äúhonest‚Äù reviews. You have no ability to be subjective
I appreciate that you made this video, half because you&#39;re right and the other half because I keep seeing horrible-looking response videos to this in the recommendations sidebar, and it&#39;s giving me an easy list of channels to hit &quot;Don&#39;t recommend&quot; on.
Poor lonely man:(
More people watched the review than the actual video.
Review the album, stop just shitting on Kanye and his fanbase
This guy is such a fuckin pansy if ur gonna stand tall for one thing stand tall for everything
So it&#39;s unreviewable cause you don&#39;t like antisemits. Noted
Fantano became a jaded History teacher in Tulsa, Oklahoma for this one.
So insane to me that a self proclaimed &quot;music reviewer&quot; will virtue signal while barely criticising the actual music. We get it bro, you need to bend to the jews who DONT CONTROL what you say. So many disingenuous and strawmanning statements that show you want to morally distance yourself from Kanye as much as possible while giving no credit where its due. Fantanos Carnival reaction is so utterly cringe with how hes obviously listening to a great track but he keeps snickering and sneering to convince himself that its garbage. Cope bruh. Grow a pair.
bro&#39;s just a d1 hater
When you get no b*tches:
Stay mad baldie üòÇ
hush lilttle baby dont you cry
Opinions....
Welp here goes another fallen YouTuber all because he‚Äôs skimpish üòÇ
I just like his old music
This was a great review.
Booooooooooooooooooo üçÖüçÖüçÖüçÖ
well we know hes a jew now
You&#39;re a bit harsh her bro, but imma tell you one thing &quot;BEATIFUL BIG TITTY BUTT NAKED WOMEN JUST DONT FALL FROM THE SKY YOU KNOW&quot;
Where sexy red ?
Yes, I think Anthony is jewish, and that is completely okay to be.
That&#39;s your opinion i enjoyed it a lot and i think Kanye is a genius . I don&#39;t care what he thinks about the Jews
Unwatchable reviewing unreviewable, nice!
Meh.. I like the music, and his new wife a has great body.üíÅ
Can we finally agree how right j.cole was on &quot;false prophets&quot; ?
but have you given the record a listen?
Man you lazy as hell just review the shit
Worst part is the album just sucks. Even separating the art from the artist, it‚Äôs just mid
Not only did this clown review the unreviewable, he&#39;s also given his opinion on albums yet to be released lol...
i thought it was an ok record, i liked the production if nothing else. Ty Dolla $ign and carti carried
Most shit take I&#39;ve ever heard, kanye ‚ù§
This is your worst review ever.
You going out sad
if it was called To Pimp a Jew you would‚Äôve given it a 10
Tony sounds hurt from the jump. Unreviewable because it&#39;s too great and went over your head. You&#39;ll be ok...
Adin Ross does better reviews than this one cmon Melon put yourself together
Sexy Red got a 8 and Kanye got unreviewable. This man starting to loose credibility
I couldn‚Äôt make it past the first track and put the album down
Low Testosterone Alert
This man trying so much to be different it&#39;s getting annoying
now do burzum
and i can tell u one thing beautiful big tittes but naked woman just don&#39;t fall out the sky you know
Mane I just like his music, I don&#39;t support what he says
who asked tho
‚ÄúBeautiful Big Tithony Fall out the sky Youtano‚Äù
Damn!
You don‚Äôt like it that‚Äôs your lose, your opinion don‚Äôt change the show cost.<br>Kanye told you on do it ü§£
I just like the album as an artistic expression. But also hold the ability to separate the artist from the art. I still would rather not discuss him past the music unless I&#39;m having that conversation. If it&#39;s just about music, his personal decay is needed for context, but it won&#39;t overwhelmingly dictate feelings on what is being communicated. Not defending, just a fan of sonics and he is still one of the top sound experimenters making music.
Bro is getting dragged in the comments
You should start listening to music with a helmet on if ur so offended
free Palestine
Say what you will about his views, but when you learn about the shit he went through with his personal trainer, I&#39;d find it hard to believe someone could argue he&#39;s acting crazy.
Shame on you. You lost all your credibility on this one. I&#39;ve been watching you for years but I won&#39;t be doing so any longer.
bro chooses this album to display his moral grandstanding, but reviewed plenty of other albums that promote violence, killing etc. if you are going to push a narrative maybe stand on business instead of picking and choosing when to be the voice of reason.
Absolutely not fantano ‚ÄúROXXXXAAAANNNE‚Äù goes so hard
I get it. You can‚Äôt give it a good score because you‚Äôll lose ad revenue. I get it Melon. You like the album üòâ
I wonder if he would actually review and think the album is trash if it wasn&#39;t for the antisemitism stuff
7 minutes of a 45 year old man throwing a tantrum
1.2M views in 24 hours. You should start every review by saying ‚Äúthis is completely unreviewable trash‚Ä¶‚Äù
Fantano is woke now guys! Tune in for the next review to learn why you should support Gaza!
The album was pretty good
I turned it off when he said he was Jesus again. I&#39;m done with the blasphemy.
thank god for drugs
Kanye west new album is trash as fuck
But Burn was fire only good song imo üôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôè
I‚Äôll admit Kanye‚Äôs album is like a 5 but didn‚Äôt you review a guy who burned down a few Churches and stabbed his band mate 20+ times as well as being a nazi and racist? Why isn‚Äôt his shit unreviewable?
So for people who want a TLDW: &quot;I didn&#39;t listen to it properly so therefore wont review it properly, goodbye.&quot;
Kanye was talking about Palestine. Fantano bought the neoliberal story about it.
too bad melon is too much of a fucking left-wing dunce to at least pretend to stay consistant and simply not release any video on this album. do I even need to explain how stupid the &quot;lyrics example&quot; looked in this video holy shi and I don&#39;t even like kanye to begin with
Ya&#39;ll still watch this shit lol
loser lol
Bro wishes he had talent
This shows how out of touch you are and how big your ego has gotten. Music reviewers review music. Your personal feelings have nothing to do with it and nobody cares what you think about the artists, that is not part of the tracks. Your inability to actually review music, instead convinced by your sheep fans that your opinions should all be hailed, shows you as an incompetent reviewer.
Some of the samples are fire but the album is trash.
You know this has nothing to do with the actual album he started the video with a 5 minute rant about Kanye‚Äôs character‚Ä¶ review the fucking  music no one gives a fuck about his  political views.
Yethony, you can&#39;t just call this album &quot;unreviewable&quot; because you know you won&#39;t be able to get through 1 minute without dropping an anti-semitic slur.
Shut up and grow up fantano, it&#39;s a great album. Get over yourselfüòÇ
That said i hated this album and i really fucking hate tydollasign as a whole. Never been a fan
this guy is a loser
You can not be nihilistic and still find the unraveling amusing and hilarious. Being entertained by a crazy rich guy having insane meltdowns doesnt mean my life is meaningless lmao i grew up watching famous people unravel
This might be the realest thing you‚Äôve ever said.
Jewthony jewtano mad his wife dry and flat
Based
I WOULD RATHER LISTEN TO THE FLUTE ALBUM BY ANDRE 3000
UNFOLLOWING THIS LOSER WHO GAVE SEXY REDD A 8. Your a weirdo
bro straight up wasted our time
certified fucking hater boy bro is just a cry baby
thank you for releasing this video. for this exact reason i stopped watching your channel. you did the same thing for kendrick lamar‚Äôs ‚Äúdamn‚Äù review where he was talking about his christain faith. focus on the music dude, stop making shit so political or bringing up things that have nothing to do with the music.
The album cover is hard that‚Äôs about it
This album is really popular on Israel. You are just cringe bro. Delete this video.
Ye got&#39;ya! U ttly forget to speak about music!
Dude you are %100 soy
Fantano man, why are you going on this teenage girl rant about Kanye, saying you won‚Äôt review it, them semi reviewing it at the end anyways. Look I hate the album, think it was terrible but come on man lol, this is sad.<br>Edit: Also what about the people who like Kanye for this old stuff they grew up on and want him to go back, what group of people do they fall into melon?<br>Also the ‚Äúreference‚Äù line is no difference from saying you have a preference when dating, it‚Äôs really not that bad.
ü•± lil pup is yappin
comments section weak as hell on this review
It was good, u r g3hy
Ye is not a musical artist. He is a conceptual performance poseur. When I think of him putting out a &quot;recording,&quot; I have to ask: Of what? Maybe he&#39;s mentally ill, maybe he&#39;s just nasty. I have no way of knowing. But a &quot;record&quot; by him in 2024 makes me think of that legendary LP, &quot;The Best of Marcel Marceau,&quot; which consisted entirely of silence. Ye&#39;s current &quot;musical&quot; output is the equivalent of silence, only louder.
My man literally reacted to the whole album on his stream and was all laughs during that + made money from it. So now you come here fighting for the oppressed and at the same time basically reviewed the album just didnt give it a score. You basically destroyed Kanyes whole career by doing that + saved humanity
It‚Äôs kinda depressing seeing an artist I used to like just go down this endless pit.
Hahaha your a music reviewer not a Political reviewer. Oh God the day has finally came that Anthony falls. Watch turkey Tom and acheeto brought a smile to my face when hearing how much you suck Anthony. Aww glory dayüòä
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=334">5:34</a>
Pura verdades
Oh sure it‚Äôs not great in all places but I think Anthony is over correcting . Shit was way better than donda in its entirety and I feel it‚Äôs disingenuous to pretend this is his worst record to date just because now he‚Äôs a dumbass public anti semite . Which he is, publicly liking Kanye is way beyond acceptable but this album had some bops on it . Also you said you wouldn‚Äôt review the album and then‚Ä¶ reviewed the album ? Like sure it wasn‚Äôt a comprehensive track by track review you basically gave this a ‚Äúnot good.‚Äù
I read dude gave sexy red an 8‚Ä¶and called Ye ‚Äúun-reviewable‚Äù? He gave the pregnant stripper who makes section 8 music a fucking 8?<br><br>Never cared, but I get the feeling this dudes reviews are all paid for by studios and Kanye gave him the bird
Came for music review landed on another political platform with some angry guy refusing to review any music and talking about celebrities personal life. Stupid loser with an agenda nothing new here.
maldin real heavy dude
soy
worse than &quot;poopity scoop&quot;?
Are you the morality police or a music reviewer? Learn about music and then review some.
Dang, the soyiest boi i ever saw. Sending strength and love Anthony üôèüïã
Thank you for standing up for sanity. Kanye is trash!
so you can review a burzum album but not this? anthony fagtano fell off
so glad fantano is taking a stand against the genocide currently happening against the jews because of what kanye said... oh wait nvm
&quot;Unreviewable&quot;, but you review it anyway?
Mishmash of a few completed songs and unfinished sonic ideas that leaves a lot to be desired considering the artist. Sometimes great artists release a dud.
Average fantano W i will glaze till i die
Sam to this day is right
Nice lecture bro
Completely biased review built entirely out of anger. I genuinely thought the album was shit and surely it is for various reasons‚Ä¶but to start the video off visibly angry, give no real interpretation of the music besides ‚Äúkanye and his fans are psychos‚Äù, followed by an abrupt cut without your regular call to action for your audience. Is just truly laughable. Isn‚Äôt the point of all this to get into the nitty gritty of what makes a project bad vs. good? <br><br>Like explain why the sound was bad, crack jokes about the absurdity of the lyrics, and totally own his ass. This is just 7 minutes of crybaby bitch chatter. Bro had the red shirt set out for months. Ready to spring into action at a moments notice and record the abomination you just watched.
Im Jewish and i dislike this video
Womp womp
You‚Äôre such a soy boy üòÇ
Wow Fantano, so brave. Really stuck it to Kanye.
Album is garbage!
this man is a crack head
Ye, the first ever hip hop artist with misogynistic and anti-semitic lyrics üòÜ
seriously. im hurt. i wish i would have bought cds and vinyls of kanye in the 2000s, cuz then i would have supported the kanye i liked...the backpack woke 2000s kanye! if i go and listen to his old music now on spotify he gets money for each play and i dont wanna support kanye now. i just wanna listen to the old songs before he turned full blown antisemit -.- ps: i listened to his first track &quot;stars&quot;...ffff i had to turn that off only after seconds cuz 1. it sounds like the worst ive heard in a long time and 2. he just needs 35 seconds to splout dumb stuff about jewish people. ugggh. byebye kanye forever
I don&#39;t get how he makes Burn AND the rest of the album.
literally the worst opinion ive ever heard
My brother. You be reviewing the albums of known murderers
Fantano with the Hate bait....
Stars is fine<br>Keys to my life is weird, jarring switchups and incoherent structure..<br>Paid lyrics are weird, they jump from topic to topic with no clear coherency.<br>Talking holy shit this is repetitive. I like the vibe, but the first couple minutes of lyrics lack any meaning and just repeat over and over. It&#39;s basically an intro for 2 minutes.<br>Back to me, if you thought Talking was repetitive, it takes that and copy pastes the same formula for 5 minutes. There are some notable good points, namely the second rap. <br>Hoodrat more repetitive drivel.<br>Do it, the first decent song on this album. Outro is a little long but otherwise good.<br>Paperwork more repetition but at least more lyrically interesting than some of the others before.<br>Burn, good vibes good all around.<br>Fuk Sumn boring.<br><br>Vultures the most half assed delivery in the tracks so far.

As a Leftie, who really hates what Kanye said, I think your lacking lots of nuance in the Kanye critique tbh. I understand not wanting to give him any grace but you kinda gotta grade his behaviors on a curve is how I see it. And clearly his intentions was never truly anti semitic at least from what I saw. It was more just bad taste generalizations and contrarianism mixed with his mental issues.
never a truer word
This dude fell off so hardüòÇ
Is the album good? Yes.<br>Is it a classic? No.<br><br>Way to much bias in the review.
Kanye fans are worse than Eminem fanbase bro
I got ad blocker so you ain&#39;t getting shit from me you vulture<br>you hate Kanye but still made this video for the clicks
Womp womp opinion invalid, 10/10
ironic that you can barely set up a green screen yet youre talking about production value
This video is doing higher numbers than all your recent videos THANK MR. WEST
Anthony toooootally misinterpreted the &quot;my B**ch lookin&#39; like a reference&quot; bar imo. Correct me if I&#39;m wrong someone but the way i interpreted that is she&#39;s such a baddie that other girls have to use her as a beauty reference. Similar to how fashion designers reference other designers and mood boards
Worst album of the year and it‚Äôs only February
damn you fell off hard
Shit take lol took an L on this one no one cares lol
I don‚Äôt think people can grasp how foolish this take is. If we follow this logic to its conclusion, this man has only reviewed albums he‚Äôs 100% agreed with. So any album promoting murder, drugs, or demeaning women, this man 100% supports y‚Äôall. People who don‚Äôt understand where their logic leads often fall into these traps. Next time either don‚Äôt speak on it or review it and preface that you disagree with the man and many of his lyrics‚Ä¶
If it was called ‚ÄúThe vulture dropout‚Äù you would have said it was the best kanye album
Reasoning sounds fine, when are you going to be removing your reviews of Burzum and Swans then?
Absolutely wild how many Kanye stans there still are. The guy made a dreadful record and he‚Äôs a terrible person, like comeon y‚Äôall‚Ä¶
You sound like such a hater! The album was good 7.5/10
You seem jealous of how he has a wife
It‚Äôs true tho. If we focus on the music and put his controversies aside, this album was not good. Easily his worst album. And the fact that a lot of people in the comment section are like ‚Äú10/10‚Äù just shows there are a lot of Kanye fans who don‚Äôt have the wherewithal to understand that an artist can make some of the greatest music of the 21st century and still make underwhelming work at other times.<br><br>The mixes are terrible, the lyrics are lacking. Kanye can say so much. This man has reached stardom levels unheard of before and any self-reflection can pause a room just to hear what he has to say and what something like that is like and the best thing he can say is ‚Äúbeautiful big titty women don‚Äôt fall out of the sky you know‚Äù. <br><br>I love Kanye‚Äôs music. As a human being, tragically flawed. As an artist Kanye is a walking genius, but this album can be best described as brainstorming songs to get one‚Äôs musical muscles warmed up for the actual songs that should belong on an album. These songs should have never made it to an album and are more in tune to leaked YouTube songs because the artist didn‚Äôt find them fitting.
Review payroll by the IDF üòÇ
Maybe i like the beat and dont give a fuck about the lyrics? Did you ever think of that?
Kanye has psychological issues, its truth, he need help
It sounds to me like you are biased because you don‚Äôt like Kanye. It has nothing to do with the music. Fantano is a joke
Grumpy leftist
Baldthany baldtano crying about kanye or something bla bla bla‚Ä¶ just review music
Just Relax, is rap what is about not ballet
Dude YOU‚ÄôRE incapable of giving a fair review to the album because you don‚Äôt like Kanye as a person and that‚Äôs ok but you didn‚Äôt need this video. It‚Äôs not the album itself because if it was the majority of people would be on your side or at least give it low reviews which is not the case at all. The album is a solid one 8/10. You‚Äôre more worried about the optics than being a reviewer is all.
I&#39;m very unfamiliar with Kanye&#39;s body of work, I thought Yeezus sounded pretty cool. I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t care to know and I couldn&#39;t give a single fuck what Kanye has to say or has said because I&#39;m not terminally online. A lot of artists were absolutely horrible people. What does any of that have to do with what the music sounds like? Is the music any good?
Just came here to give a dislike ‚úåüèº
Woke baby
He&#39;s just not a nice person thats all. I remember Beck at the Grammys. He is a very mean man indeed.
All antisemitism aside, this album is garbage. And its literally the old Kanye vs. new Kanye fans who is arguing online about this
Saw this Review before i heard the Album and your dead wrong and must got a Bag to give this HORRIBLE spit-take. Hope this gets video gets üëé
Coward
Kanye&#39;s old stuff tho
This album is objectively pretty good. I understand where Fantano is coming from in that some of the stuff in there is pretty out there but the &#39;art&#39; is still good. Somehow we need to separate the art here and at least give people a chance to make their own decision. This is not a bad album. it&#39;s actually pretty good.
imagine being a kanye fan üòÇ
you defo don‚Äôt got the same mindset for the musicians in support of israel cause guess that‚Äôs not mainstream for you lmao
What&#39;s this bald jew talkin about?
anthony is just womp womping thru all video
Just crying and yapping lmao what a loser
Why u so soft Anthony?
Sure kanye is so sad u don&#39;t want to review his album üëç
the worlds biggest yapper
kanye the goat fuck the woke album was great
its mid af
You fucked up now people are going for your past isn‚Äôt it ironic
Nice to see you speak on politics. You should review the genocide in Palestine next
This is soft. Even for you. It‚Äôs not that deep. Come back to reality Fantano.
L take on the music but Kanye IS insane
If Anthony wants to make a statement, he should delete all of his Kanye reviews.
Yeat better
Quit yapping and review music
horrible &quot;review&quot;
&quot;unreviewable&quot; and calls it trash within the first sentence üíÄ
excruciatingly bad is crazy lmaooo
The album was dope lol this dude must be Jewish!
Three types of Anthony Fantanos:<br>1. Anthony Fantanos who reviewed Burzum, a band led by guy who was a neo-Nazi, burned churches &amp; synagogues, and murdered a homosexual man.<br>2. Complete hypocrite Anthony Fantano<br>3. Virtue signaling Anthony Fantano
Anthony reviews music of killers, domestic abusers, and literal NAZIS, but Kanye goes too far!
Like who cares lmaooo
I love Kanye as an artist and always have and most likely always will, and yes in recent time he has been a terrible person. But that does not mean I&#39;m wrong for enjoying art and his craft nor does it make me a racist psycho. I am never going to justify what this man says, but will always be honest with him as an artist and in my opinion he is the GOAT. <br><br>I understand the point of your video and you not wanting to review it, but don&#39;t understand you continuing to review the few tracks and lyrics you did not like. If your stance was strong I think you should have ended it with the controversy and that this project just brings more light to it, but not to continue to review the &quot;unreviewable&quot;.<br><br>Anyways I will remain listening to his music including his future projects if I find them musically appealing, whilst not endorsing his character.<br>And yes I miss the OLD Kanye.<br><br>ps: Jesus is King is not better
‚ÄúSeparate the art and the artist!‚Äù Yeah even if you do that the art still sucks dude.
The album&#39;s dogshit and Ye&#39;s fanbase has degenerated heavily over the years, I&#39;ll agree with that, but your hypocrisy and moral highground makes this video a testament to your degeneracy that has come from obsessing with some fake culture war
this album is 10/10, thanks Ant.
Brotha get off the internet, you have fallen off üòÇ Not a soul takes you seriously. Just come here to troll you üòÇ
Ima Kanye fan and I‚Äôm not any of those 3 ‚ÄúKanye fan types‚Äù
Bro In his feelings.. he talking about what he thinks about Kanye and the album
‚ùÑÔ∏è
so bc he expressed an ideal or opinion u dont agree with u lable n single him out? all this media slander and cancelling shit is corny. mind u bro was a college kid, neva in the streets all good positive music. why u hating bro? u could be the illest nigga all across the board. say one thing and ur whole legacy can be ruined. shits sad lmaoo
Ngl. You‚Äôre a panzi. You spent 0 second of this video talking/ reviewing the actual music and spent the whole time speaking yapanese
so it&#39;s a 10/10 by default
this seems more like a kanye rant and less like an album review
So burn was your favorite song? Mine too!
4 minutes of the review was bro hating on kanye
Not even a Kanye fan and this is cringe as fuck
someone leak his social security number this time please
This YouTuber is a fergun fergit
WILTER
Antony and ye stan in 2024 what timeline is this, also first ye 10/10 album
what a loser lmao
only good stuff was the drum loop on back to me which was kinda cool and the song talking
I love Kanye‚Äôs music. But the last album that was decent to me was life of Pablo. The ones after are just booty to me. People will glaze this üòÇ
Gives a pass to artists that are literal murderers tho.
Why is bro genuinely mad
IM ONLY COMMENTING TO SAY THIS. <br><br>YOU SHOULD NOT RELY ON OTHERS OPINIONS!!!<br><br>ANTHONY FANTANO IS JUST A LOSER WHO REVIEWS MUSIC WITH A LOT OF FOLLOWERS NOTHING SPECIAL <br><br>IDK WHY YOU GUYS GET UPSET OVER A POINTLESS REVIEW
bro does NOT understand that most kanye fans are just normal people who just like the music üò≠üôè
this is dumbest take you have ever made
Now I know why I never watched your videos lol. If u felt that strong about ye or the album why did u feel inclined too make two videos about it ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
at this point why focus on fantano‚Äôs harshness? it‚Äôs more mature to focus on the actual correctness of his points in the review, which were absolutely spot on as far as im concerned. kanye‚Äôs antisemitism has influenced real-world violence on jewish people, and he‚Äôs backing it up on ‚Äúvultures‚Äù and ‚Äúking‚Äù on vultures 1, the rest of the songs just dodge the issue. fantano had every right to go in
It‚Äôs clear of donda and tlop
Wow, you showed your colours... all the buzzwords
Fantono really fucked up
You‚Äôre actually the dumbest reviewer anyone has ever seen üòÇ
proud 30 year old nihilistic teenager
üëèüèª
It‚Äôs true, he treats his wife like an object.. it‚Äôs disgusting and this album was not good he can‚Äôt even take any criticism anymore either. He was literally out done by his features üòÇüòÇ
this melon looks kinda funny tho
Imma be real. Wasn&#39;t his best work but some of this does feel like hating fam..
Your job is to review music, if I wanted to watch some libtard voice his political opinions I would watch the news.
Kanye has lots of fans who aren&#39;t those 3 types, you ranked his albums dude.  He has lots of great albums
Im a hateful psycho and yes, I do think you are a jew
but why does this guy think he&#39;s relevant?
Vultures is 1000% less harmful than the promoting of violence and drugs most rappers convey nowadays, this is just stupid. You review every Future album, what am I missing?
Anthony Fantano LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
So you got your feelings involved and couldn‚Äôt get things he‚Äôs said. Didn‚Äôt he give sexy red a 8?
You would‚Äôve given it a 10 if you weren‚Äôt a typical leftist whack job
XQC - &quot;you have artists who have actually killed people, but saying some stuff is now taking it too far?&quot; yeah gotta agree with him on this one. You review pieces of shits music all the time, but now that he&#39;s politically opposite of you, its &quot;unreviewable&quot;. Honestly don&#39;t be such a baby and just do your job and review the album (or dont make a vid at all), no is coming to you for moral guidance.
I love how Anthony perfectly explains what Kanye fans are like and then yall come into the comments ON THIS VERY VIDEO and you prove him right.
Just go bald bro ‚Ä¶
&quot;I dont like kanye so if you like him youre a racist, antisemtic loser cult weirdo teenager&quot; Yikes, do better man.
I&#39;d worry less about what Kanye West says about Jewish people and worry more about what Israeli Jews are actually doing to Palestinians at the moment.
the only downside of this album is, he doesn&#39;t sample Skibidi dob dob dob yis yis in it üòû
What are your thoughts on Burzum again?  Emotional hack.
Well we have an idiot in their natural habitat. Believes mainstream media. Wow so smart.
Bro shut up
This dude is glazing over sexxy red and he hatin on ye albulm smh
Album sucks
Imma just go back to listening to Back To Me now
Seems like melons been losing it ever since he had to defend the sexxy redd review
How you gonna proclaim the importance of NOT listening or reviewing this album, and then doing just that ü§°<br><br>There‚Äôs some good tracks on here, and no I don‚Äôt like the ones featuring antisemitism <br><br>Get over your self and stop trying to be something you‚Äôre not - we get it, Kanye‚Äôs not a good person and we shouldn‚Äôt go and shake his hand but how you gonna switch up all of a sudden on the principle of subjectivity in art? Are we not entitled to our right to ENJOY something that sounds good? <br><br>Guess I‚Äôm delusional for being raised on Ye‚Äôs music, and wanted to hear anything he puts out. <br><br>Also, delete your burzum reviews, hypocrite
It is reviewable, there is 3 songs at least that can be reviewed
Boohoo Fantano!
Bro just say you&#39;re sensitive
Honestly there are so many bad faith reactions here in the comments and online that were just...well be honest totally expected.<br>Its not like a 1/10 of the people here will actually watch the vid.<br><br>I agree with you fully, if your goal in a review is to archive at least one of your stated goals, than it would be meaningless for you to waste time to try to review this album.<br><br>PS: It is hilarious how few people seem to get why you call this album unreviewable
how he ain&#39;t bring nothing to the table, when he the table?
This guy also believes it‚Äôs ok to groom kids
vultures 10/10
My wife is a reference is a clever way of saying an example of his preferences like the women he likes, he is not racist, the kind of person he is, not sure why that small lyric went over the melon‚Äôs head
No way this dude got so many views and even some likes for being a hypocrite
terrible review, you fr gotta stop being the ‚Äûgo-to‚Äù reviewer
as a fan of Kanye I have to agree that Kanye is his own enemy and with all that shit he put his family through and said about the jewish community he managed to ruin his own career and now he&#39;s just the guy who made Graduation.
Glad i use adblock so he doesn&#39;t make money off my view
Dude shut up üò≠üò≠üò≠
im jewish &amp; this album is alr, prolly like a strong 7 to light 8
This is why your wife left you
You know its bad when he‚Äôs got his glasses off‚Ä¶
So you&#39;re not even reviewing the music, you&#39;re reviewing Kanye&#39;s actions since 2022.
Boy oh boy I sure do love being patronized by a pouting bald millionaire that doesnt work for a living, telling me why I‚Äôm a bad person for liking a Kanye West album.<br>Good to know that YNW Melly and Burzum are fine though. Murdering people is totally fine but once you bring the chosen people into it, it‚Äôs a no-go from this guy.
Fantano has fallen so far
Lol Fantano mad at anyone who enjoys a song off this album. I‚Äôm not hateful, nihilistic, or cultish but I think the beat on CARNIVAL is good. Sorry.
Never forget this guy gave Yeezus a 5
I LOVE YOU MELON
&quot;How do you penetrate this level of self-imposed ignorance&quot;; Says the guy posting this with a computer, cellphone, clothes, etc all made by some form of slave labor.  <br>Why not just admit you don&#39;t like Kanye and can&#39;t review his album because of that, instead of passing it off onto the fans as if they are the problem.
i think it was better than donda and donda 2
If it was called Hood&#39;s Hottest Vulture it wouldve got a 8
is this where you begin to separate from the very thing that made you so attractable?? are you pulling a kanye?? you&#39;re crazy if you think fade and paid are the same song... is it jus bc they both have a steady kick on the 1? Also, just because his lyrics are unethical does not mean that there was no talent and passion put into the work to make good music.... this is a review we are talking abt here. I don&#39;t intend to tell you how to do your job when you&#39;re the one with almost 3 mil subs but at the end of the day, you chose not to review the album bc of your personal feelings towards ye... the anger you have is justified but you&#39;re letting it get in the way of your ability to unbiasedly judge music... you could easily say &quot;great song but i can&#39;t get behind the subject matter&quot; or &quot;terrible song and even worse subject matter&quot; that&#39;s an honest opinion abt the music rather than giving it a 0 when it is clearly more talent put into every kanye album than like at least 30% of all music ever made.... how do i know this to be the case?? because of the history of music quality.. there are objective improvements to kanye&#39;s music that wouldn&#39;t have been possible without the technology that was available to him... as well as him having experimented with so many different sounds that he&#39;s been able to create a new planet of innovative sound for artists to draw inspiration from.. as well as using methods that break new bounds in music and methods that are objectively better than the methods used before him. There is so much abt even the worst kanye song, the poopity scoop song, that places it higher than a lot of other music in terms of talent and sound quality. i think we can all agree that kanye has a knack for using controversial subject matter in his lyrics but we should also be able to agree that low talent and low quality is not something that kanye has ever delivered... (well maybe he&#39;s gotten lazy on the talent part but he always has solid production quality even if we disagree with some of the split choices that he decided to make in some instances.)<br><br> This wasnt really to defend kanye but more so shed light on faulty line of reasoning you used when refusing to review this album the same as any other.... this is your channel, review what u want and refuse what you don&#39;t but i can see the moral inconsistency. <br><br>although i did appreciate the sample sized review you gave at the end... even if it was to appease the viewers that were itching for a fantano review
I am very glad this comment section is full to the brim of uneducated right-wingers, nazis and kanye defenders. Makes me feel so good about myself, and people like Fantano, who can research things properly and form opinions that are not regurgitated by millionaires.
you may not like fantano, but he is 100% right, if youre purposely blinding yourself to the fact that kanye is going deeper into his antisemetic spiral you are simply ignorant
how many gang members and killers have you reviewed? only to draw the line at politics?
Damn the Kanye groupies are intense üòÇ
I actually quite like a good chunk of the album. Some of it is eye-roll and cringe, and then some of the lyrics are so so bad like &quot;Problematic&quot;. I still think he&#39;s mentally ill and problematic though.
45% dislikesüòÇ
The album is so bad, I listen to every song and they are all so bad. What happened to Ye? He was good before.
it‚Äôs really just fantano not being able to separate personal feelings and the music. get real
respect FGibbs for attendance on this, f anthony for being a whiny lil bish
you gay as hell
my guy rated sexxy red album an 8 wtf is he
Why even do the review in the first place if you were gonna hate from the get go
Impressive! Nice!<br>Let&#39;s see Paul Allen&#39;s virtue signal!
But still rated You wont get what you want 10, huh?
5/10. Good production and amazing features. Kanye is the worst part of the album imo. I don‚Äôt think he is antisemitism, I think it‚Äôs more for the effect. There is like 6 songs I would go back to. It is rushed obv but it has creativity and freshness to it. Kanye‚Äôs worst album. But doesn‚Äôt make it bad. Just not what I‚Äôm used to for a Kanye album.
is the music good tho?
He&#39;ll happily review rappers who&#39;ve killed or SA&#39;ed others but someone who said some bad words? Nahh that&#39;s a bridge too far.<br>This is why the world just keeps getting more and more right wing. You leftists have lost every shred of rationality.
omg Anthony is so mad.
this why your wife left you
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
you missing the 4th type of fans, who view the guy just as a entertainer and the crazy stuff he does in and outside music strictly from a entertainment perspective and don&#39;t take his personal life or views that seriously. The album was funny as hell.
3 gang üëç
<b>This album was fire</b>
Kanye West is dead to me.  I used to love his music, but his tirades, anti-Semitic rhetoric, and public behavior is inexcusable.  His music can no longer be great to me because he has become such a deplorable human being.
stop being a fucking baby grow up
Hey number one album in over 100 countries what you say ultimately does not matter, nor what you think matters because the facts speak for themselves
It so interesting to see people mad at a person&#39;s personal views on something that has no policy or structural impact on the society.
Most of what you said has nothing to do with the actual music album and more about your personal stance on his character.
King Von can murder people and still catch reviews. Understandable.
This is why I don‚Äôt think people take you seriously anymore for legit advice on music to enjoy or skip. Kanye‚Äôs album as a whole does kinda suck. There really are only a few good sounds and tracks I can count as songs yes, but you know for a fact without this lenses your looking through about Kanye‚Äôs current actions you would give this album like a 4.If problematic was on st Pablo you would have given it a 7
All the Kanye debacles aside, it seems like his artistry really started slipping after the release of Ye. His albums just aren‚Äôt well put together masterpieces anymore. He sort of just throws shit at the wall and calls it a day, no matter how unfinished or dry the mixing on the songs are. Yandhi had a real chance of being the closest to his magnum-opus MBDTF in terms of style and influence, but I guess after he ‚Äúfound‚Äù Christ he decided to can it? I don‚Äôt know. His album covers aren‚Äôt good, the music is subpar, even the clothes don‚Äôt have the level of refinement they had back in 2015-16 when he was doing the YZY SEASON stuff with Adidas.
This is the most biased review I have ever see. We all know this is just vanity for your personal vendetta, just say that.
clown
i dont like all the songs but I like some off them, i dont undersand why you cant review it.<br>some of the songs on vultures are thrash. some are not
The like:dislike ratio here is astonishing.
This is what happens when u give a lot of relevance to a a very knowledgeable douchebag with no common sense and no objectivity
this video has 69k likes and 54k dislikes BTW, so this review should speak for itself.
i enjoyed like 2 songs, i absolutely hated every other song. what he‚Äôs done aside, everything that kanye was a part of on this album pretty much sucked
I&#39;m none of those 3 fans you described. this is an emotionally driven [though intended] yap, nothing substantial whatsoever. 2/10 review. 2 because &#39;0&#39; isn&#39;t looking attractive to me with &#39;/10&#39;. <br><br>plus, the title, and the video itself is a contradiction lmfao.
After MBDTF Kanye dropped Yeezus it was alright but no near to mbdtf then I was hyped for So Help me God but he renamed it to Swish and then it became TLOP. Honestly I was very disappointed in that album. Then some years ago Kid See Ghost was released and it was very good. Then Jesus is King and Donda really let me down. I didn&#39;t like those Albums. <br>But Vultures 1 is very good. It has every Kanye Element. Im glad he&#39;s back
You work for the industry? üòÇ
Who&#39;s actually taking this wholefoods face goofball opinion about a rap album seriously smh
Didn‚Äôt you give Sexy Redd a 8
Seems like Fantano couldn&#39;t seperate the art from the artist.
He made the college dropout, watermelon
I don&#39;t even like Kany&#39;s music. But it&#39;s really weird that you can review gangster garbage. About killing, raping, and guns. But this is the moral line that needs to be drawn.
BETA
And here I thought Taylor swift fans were the most psychotic delusional weirdos.  Nope!  Lets be honest Kanye fans are just a bunch of 15 year olds who are sad and lost after their idol Andrew Tate fell off the map.  Because what self respecting adult would be listening to this shitty ass music?
fantano is controlled by j people
I dont agree with Kanye. But i fuck with the beats on this album. Hearing Carti and Travvy on FUK SUMN is still fire to me. Call me a bad person, i dont see an issue. I fuck with the instrumentals and the chill vibe u get at the end of the album
as a religiously observant jew, kanye is crazy as fuck. on the other hand, he is a genius. this album slaps. 7/10.
ily
Imagine if he did this for every single problematic artist, he would end up with more ‚Äúunreviewable‚Äù videos than reviews. Anthony decided on 90% of this video before even clicking ‚Äúplay‚Äù, so why would we even watch this?
You review music from murderers, rapists thieves and thugs: great music <br><br>You review music from Ye: HE&#39;S A TERRIBLE NAZI.<br><br>Gtfo hypocrite
LOOOL embarrassing af. Spends the whole video talking about the artists rather than the art ü§°
Kanye stans are so weird and pathetic. Ya boy sucks!
This is embarrassing for you cheif
we supposed to watch this degenerate and call him a genius ü§£as if man god doesn‚Äôt love Kanye
Damn... It&#39;s been a while since I almost 100% disagree with you bro.
I know I‚Äôm not crazy saying vultures sounds like donda 2 lol
This vid goes hard on mute
respect
69K likes but 54K dislikes...take a hint Anthony
Reminder, he gave sexy redd an 8
Alleged hip hop music reviewer realizes that hip hop music can often have lyrics that are considered demeaning to women ü§Ø
ü§ì
lets put it in this perspective for the people saying &quot;you&#39;re trashing on kanye but not all these rappers that have killed people or done other illegal shit&quot;<br>1. the people that rap about having done crime usually (admittedly not always) have lyrics either expressing regret or having served time for their crimes and tend to not continue to do it.<br>2. the fans of said murdering artists are not as belligerently psychotic and pro-murder as kanyes fans are pro-anti semitism.<br><br>if the (at least vocal) majority that listened to rappers were murderers or murder-sympathizers, then there would be fucking problem, but no, most of the time this shit happens, it doesn&#39;t happen OVER AND OVER like kanye spouting the most insane, racist bullshit, and then his fans/defenders not only listen to it and not think &quot;wow this is fucked up,&quot; but also AGREE with him is a sign that there is something wrong with kanyes fanbase, moreso than kanye himself. sure, its fucked up that kanye is/was like this, but the fact that his fans are being just as bad/worse than kanye, is why this has gotten so bad. im not in either boat, fantano has some dumb priorities and can act like a bitch at times, but the kanye fandom/defenders are being far worse than anything fantano has done or said in this situation.<br><br>just because a rapper is a murderer doesnt mean their fans are also murderers or support murder, and likewise, just because kanye is being racist, doesnt make it morally acceptable to be just as racist or moreso.
Haha you can leave this review up if you want but a bernie bernout bro getting so bombastically butthurt over this album is probably the best advertising it can receive. ü§£ü§£ü§£
Lock your windows tonight
Fanny, I know you understood that by &quot;lookin&#39; like a reference&quot; he meant she&#39;s physically the quintessential woman. Hardly &quot;one of the grossest and most dehumanising things said about a woman&quot;. He&#39;s got many offensive examples you could point to, no need to invent more yourself.
U a goofy and a lame
thank you
If this was a Death Grips album you would&#39;ve jizzed all over it
Kanye&#39;s discography ended in 2018  for me

On of the most annoying mf of the planetüòÇ bro just leave it your not gonna win this one
I‚Äôm none of the three and I thought it was fun
What does antisemitism have to do with the music ?
Facts vs Feelings
I tried listening to it and was shocked at how bad it sounded. Legitimate garbage.
I feel like 100+ years from now people will actually think this guy was Jesus because of his cult ass fans
Bro is the yappster 4000
Ok now that you got that out of your system pls make this the last video you make about kanye (at least for a while). For the past month you&#39;ve been saying you didn&#39;t want to give kanye any attention and then you go ahead and make a video giving him attention. It&#39;s so annoying to the point that I had to unsub for a bit on the second channel cuz I genuinely don&#39;t give a shit about kanye anymore. I&#39;ve seen many of your fans on Instagram have the same sentiment so I know I&#39;m not the only one.
While I respect Fantano&#39;s response to this. He&#39;s somewhat ignorant here. Fantano&#39;s comments have been flooded with radicalized Kanye fans and in the response, in attempt to push back, Fantano has radicalized himself in the other direction. When Kanye fans say that there is no needed connection between the artist and his art (especially one so famous in pop culture while it it is being released), they&#39;re delusional. But for Fantano to simultaneously say that at least giving a good faith attempt to still listen to the music and give it a review while separating the artist and art to his best ability is also impossible, that too is unreasonable. He&#39;s pushing back radically in the other direction to combat the radical fans that he feels are surrounding him. I don&#39;t necessarily blame him for it as it must be overwhelming and he likely doesn&#39;t even now that his response is so negative, nor that it is happening. While he is certainly not there yet, and there is a long ways to go, we very well might find Fantano himself approaching the same level of radicalism as the Kanye stans, just on the opposite spectrum.
69k likes and 54k dislikes, that&#39;s why your wife left you lil bro.
Bro gave Birds a 3 and Utopia a 7
This dude has dropped off, biased and is most likely getting paid to shit on Ye üíÄ
So, was the album good or no?
how the mighty have fallen... so who am i talking about here
w
unreviewable is crazyüíÄ
Hes speaking facts about most kanye fan&#39;s he forgot the 4th version people who just like his music and dont agree with his opinions
You reviewed Burzum
I fully agree about Kanye having someone tell him ‚Äúno‚Äù. He‚Äôs had that problem for a while now. See Chick-Filla
He called her a reference referring to his previous line about his preference basically saying she‚Äôs his type lil bro cmon now keep up
Why give ‚Äúpause‚Äù?  Music is about feeling. It‚Äôs about emotion. To give pause it to think about. That‚Äôs not what music is about. I think at times Fantano is to intellectual about what he‚Äôs listening to instead of being open to his emotions. Now if that‚Äôs how he likes his music than that‚Äôs totally cool. But I believe the majority of music fans listen differently. And that‚Äôs what the fans want in a review. That‚Äôs why I like the Mollory Bros reaction vids. It‚Äôs mostly emotion they‚Äôre giving us. Honest emotion. I hope Anthony gives this a try.
Imagine removing comments that disagrees with you‚Ä¶
He is speaking facts about Kanye fans.
he ain‚Äôt say one lie in this video
Anthony......shut up......

Still had to make a vid though didn&#39;t ya mellie
Kanye should&#39;ve named it &quot;to pimp a vulture&quot;.
walking L, imagine being unable to enjoy ANY songs, &quot;unreviewable is crazy&quot;. shi how about we start reviewing your opinions on literally everything.<br>The point you seem to be making is, &quot;I understand that if I have a lot of hate on a highly talked about album&quot; you don&#39;t mention any songs, and its wild you review an album to literally not mention anything.
didnt ask for psychoanalysis go back to reviewing music
This album is great. Fantano a bum
Everybody&#39;s bullying this guy for what he said about this album, when all he said were straight facts
&quot;album review&quot; my ass
As a kanye stan. I can understand your point of view. And I agree.
I will now listen to vultures 1 thank you
Bro this is so performative. I agree that you shouldn&#39;t be giving Ye attention rn but if you think that, then why did you make a video with the lyrics in the thumbnail, then spend the first half of the video saying why you won&#39;t review it, just to spend the second half reviewing it. This just comes across as you trying to get the clicks and views that any video on kanye is gonna get while not making it look like you&#39;re doing that so you&#39;re not accused of promoting an antisemite.
If it was called &#39;To Pimp a Nazifly&#39; you&#39;d be running butt-naked in the streets screaming its praises, Melon!
Dude üòÇüòÇüòÇ cmon the album isn&#39;t as bad theres some good songs in there theres a reason its number 1 right now and dont say there&#39;s nothing else right now or some shit
bro is dissecting his fan base bro i just like music that don‚Äôt make me an idiot or a ‚Äúcult fan‚ÄùüòÇ
kanye fans are pathetic tbh
Pushing 40üêª
I gotta say I find this video completely disingenuous, I understand how deplorable Kanye West has been as a human, and his problematic views defiantly did flow into the lyrics on the album, but where was this energy when you reviewed Utopia. Travis Scotts actions actually led to people dying, and you could argue he bragged about his involvement on Utopia, yet you were able to review that project. Not to mention the 1000 other artists that people listen to and love despite their uncomfortable subject matter, and/or behavior. I love your videos, and am open to whatever your opinion is on the album being good or bad, but the reality is you will probably review an album this year by an individual who has done worse things than Kanye. A side note:  making a video calling vultures &quot;unreviewable&quot; is 100% going to make people more interested in listening to said album, than if you just gave it a mediocre, poor, or even good review. No hate intended, just wanted to share my opinion, been a viewer for a long time and will continue to be.
Nuh uh
Kanye just made Fantano come up with a new review list lmao unreviewable trash I love it wonder who will be number 2 on this list
So sexy red can get a review but Kanye can‚Äôt? üò≠
I‚Äôm here thanks to li0nsmane
Why your mustache look like the Pizza Hut logo?
This guys a joke scared to review an album
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=254">4:14</a> I mean, who even notices the lyrics while listening to a song? Music is mainly a set of frequencies on a timeline, and it&#39;s purpose is to evoke feelings. Fantano should know this by now, tbh It&#39;s sad that his leftist bias is so copious to the point of not letting him appreciate greatness.
Kanye got quite the nerve putting his own daughter on an album filled with anti-semitism &amp; sexism. Rappers can‚Äôt parent kids for shit nowadays
What a tough guy
This is pathetic and pure weakness. Not surprised
You&#39;ve reviewed burzum. Stop pandering
lol you‚Äôre using kanye for views you shill
Well that was a waste of 7 minutes
I‚Äôm surprised y‚Äôall let him get this far
small hat tribe reviewer
Kanye Fans are the scaled up version of Chris Brown fans üëÜü§ì (Lessfuckinggoooooo)
Dude you gotta realize you‚Äôve been doing this for like 10 years, this is your whole life. I work a blue collar job and I don‚Äôt give a fuck what he‚Äôs talking about, I hear songs about killing people, doing coke, picking up hookers, beating women.. the reality is people just wanna hear something that sounds nice on the ears. You saying oh he said this type of bad thing therefore you shouldn‚Äôt listen to this, okay so what about all the other types of abuse in other songs, those get a free pass too? I think me and the other 90% of people are too busy to be concerned about someone‚Äôs controversies or who they‚Äôre mean to, who has time for this shit? For someone who‚Äôs whole life is just the internet I understand where you‚Äôre coming from but just talk about the music, this isn‚Äôt your place to be the moral authority on Kanye. Most people already know he‚Äôs a stupid asshole, and if they don‚Äôt, who cares? Seriously who has time to care about this?
As a Mexican i speak english, but its still somewhat hard to understand most lyrics spoken, more son in hip hop and rap because its fast and conjugates words on ways its not as easy to understand unless im reading the lyrics at the same time. <br><br>What im trying to say is that its easier for me to just focus on the melody of both the instruments and the voice and by just focusing on that, id say i musically liked like 6 songs in this album. Its fresh from Kanye. But im a little disappointed that some of the lyrics are really stupid or downright racist, that do make it harder to enjoy.
Hard hypocritical. - you review tons of albums with questionable content  - rappers talking about murder and shit - you look at the merit, you review their context, even if you find Kanye deplorable the truth is you still reviewed it by saying it&#39;s unreviewable and it&#39;s the laziest review you&#39;ve ever given - I think Kanye is wrong and agree with you that he&#39;s a shitty egomaniac - but what&#39;s your job? To review albums. Just give it a real review, remove your emotions, and try to understand why he&#39;s doubling down, talk about exploitation, talk about how controversy is relevance, give the album a zero -give it a negative 10 -  but don&#39;t be such a wimp that you review it under the guise that it&#39;s unreviewable - weak tbh
Fantano is such a hypocrite. Bro picks and chooses what to be upset about. No morals whatsoever
But you reviewed burzum? Are you okay?
wtf man you hate him bc of his opinions .... the music is fire will always be fire you cant cancel the guy and he is still talking
Bro really took objectivity out of his reviews ü§¶üèº
Anyway pods are $20
bro yapped for half of the video about what kanye did and didn‚Äôt do‚Ä¶ This is a music review bud
When you refuse to acknowledge that a large portion of the black community is anti-semitic and continue to pretend that what hip hop is is music and not pastiche. Enjoy your clip art.
This guy is so corny man all we want is an unbiased music review.
why does your head look like when you drop a lollipop on the carpet
if it was called to pimp a vulture perhaps it would‚Äôve been a 10 or if it had sexy red at least a 8
How about you just review the music and not his life?
Lame ass dude
You literally just need to say <br>‚ÄúYe is Anti-Semitic I don‚Äôt agree with his views however this is my review of the album‚Äù
7 minutes is a lot of time to say you don&#39;t get it.
MY WIFE&#39;S SON ü•π
if he called this album tec he would‚Äôve rated it not good
you skipped cartis verse, joker activities.
Some fans also just like the music but not him
Funny how he claims he can‚Äôt give it a fair review because of his moral high ground but still makes a video on it to get them views and that $
Damn I wish Kanye just mixed the album a bit better so these clowns wouldn&#39;t be able to call the album bad. Album still good even with some questionble mixing at times.
Bros just yappin just to yap
Literal Nazis just get regular reviews, mind you
Bro your mustache built like the yellow angry bird what u talkin about üò≠
You need to have that Minor Threat tattoo removed. You&#39;re no longer the black sheep. You&#39;re the herd.
Album is good actually. Im a kanye fan but im not in his cult. I did not like Ye, i kinda liked Donda, havent even listened to or wanted to listen to Donda 2 or Jesus is King. To me it&#39;s called Vultures because it&#39;s an analogy for his fans eating off his corpse in the public image, completely killing his own reputation, as well as an analogy for critics watching his every move from their moral high ground waiting to pick him to shreds. The lyrics are very stupid. The production is at times obnoxious. But there&#39;s a lot of old Kanye humor and innovations that he brings to almost every record he touches. It&#39;s just interesting to listen to. I don&#39;t think Kanye is truly a hateful person, his words certainly are but they are just words at the end of the day. He&#39;s been saying crazy shit since the beginning and he doesn&#39;t care what anyone thinks for better or for worse. 7/10 for me
Imagine judging someone as antisemitic with that mustache
U WOKE! I STAND 4 EVERYTHING FANTANO IS AGAINST JUST 2 SPITE HIM!!!
Bro gave it a 10/10 üòÆ
Can you just tell me if the tracks are equalized properly? I actually don‚Äôt care about anything Kanye says, and especially don‚Äôt care about your political perspective considering you are not as good at producing a track as Kanye.
Unreviewable and yet this divorced bald liberal yaps for 7 whole minutes
Mustachioed, bald headed, inconsistent reviewers just don‚Äôt fall out the sky, you know?
To much yapping anthony
Bro upset that peggy was gassing up kanye on twitter üò≠
unreviewable but still gonna talk &amp; make video about it (cause it&#39;s trending) for yk making money üòÇ<br><br>what a clown ass
Insignificant gnat ...
Who tf is this guy? Fr. He made vails points about the artist, but I don‚Äôt agree with 90% of what he said on the music. Is he an artist? What authority does he have to speak on music? Or does he have none, and is just a guy on YouTube who gained a fan base because of his music reviews? Genuinely, curious, not hating, because any real musician knows how good that Jesus is king album. The harmonics, the soul, the whole reason music is there. Something external to make your internal self feel different?
I‚Äôm sorry, I thought I was here to hear a music review. Didn‚Äôt realise I‚Äôm on a political platform.
Maybe it&#39;s just a sign that you lost touch with what&#39;s good nowadays Grandad
<b>Kanye meat riders are the swifties of rap</b>
you don‚Äôt have to be politically correct to review a fucking album bro
Fantano, stop being politically correct and so soft. review the damn album!
Oh yeah, well xQc called you stupid so checkmate
Direct quote from fantano on a Burzum review: &quot;I don&#39;t care if he burned down some churches, don&#39;t care if he murdered a guy, I really don&#39;t care if he&#39;s racist. If he comes out with an album in the future i will welcome it with open arms&quot;.  <br><br>Just know this guys full of shit. Fuck Fantano.
If it was called vultures the kawk kawk ü¶Ö it would have been a 11
‚ÄúThis is unreviewable trash‚Ä¶‚Äù *proceeds to give review
The double standard is crazy. Every rapper treats and raps about women like that
Yeah but he made graduation though
Maybe would‚Äôve been an idea to just ignore the album mate, I think that would‚Äôve been more valuable than going on a rant why you don‚Äôt like Kanye (which btw is perfectly fair). I actually think this album is straight trash and I‚Äôm a massive Ye fan.
kanye is going too far for your taste but apparently reviewing a burzum album is no problem
I feel like, not everyone should have an opinion. Just saying.
I think he&#39;s ready to call Vultures 2 &#39;unreviewable 2&#39;, since this is unreviewable 1üßêüßê
wifeless 40yo incel, stay mad
If it was called &quot;Come Over When You&#39;re Vultures 1&quot; you would&#39;ve given it a Not Good.
I ONLY like Kanye because he&#39;s antismite
nice view bait
Coming from the Guy that Reviewed multiple Burzum, DaBaby and YNW Melly records, this is just ridicilous
Aren&#39;t you tired of using people like Kanye for a platform? It&#39;s just honestly sad because who tf even cares? Anyway, team Kanye all the wayüêê
You sound like my aunt karen
So when are you gonna talk about the music?
If that&#39;s the case, then why do you give good reviews to people who have actually murdered people, and put it in their lyrics?  What a joke
bro this album is fucking shit i agree its by far kanyes worst album but this video is honestly pathetic and not befitting a professional reviewer who&#39;s been doing it for over a decade should have just not released the video if you weren&#39;t going to review it
why the fuck you talking about his public persona shit when hes been on this forever, review the tracks pussy.
Yeah‚Ä¶you review tons of albums with fucked up subject matter and dealing with legit crimes. This is inconsistent.
Some beautiful tracks, but the lyrics are horrendous
he appologized to the jewish community whats your problem?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=227">3:47</a> that‚Äôs not your responsibility, you‚Äôre a reviewer. We watch your videos for reviews not political stances/opinions.
ong
I think it would&#39;ve been better if he at least reviewed it, but it did seem like he already hated it before it came out.
You&#39;ve reviewed people that have murdered people, or abandoned there children
Just listen to the music. You don‚Äôt have to mix his life and music together. Also, try to understand where he‚Äôs coming from.
Someone: Fantano, why you hate so mutch kanye now?<br>Fantano: Cause Kanye kills my grandma, ok?!
It‚Äôs fine that you drew a line in the sand, but how about other artists that you DO review who have committed violent felonies? Say what you want about Kanye, but he‚Äôs not a convicted felon. I could give a fuck less about Kanye, but you know some of these other artists have actually harmed people and been convicted of violent crimes. Don‚Äôt be a hypocrite.
Nerd
Bro missed the fourth Kanye fan group: people who grew up with his music and are desperately wanting to see the old Kanye back (r.i.p. Kanyes meds they weren‚Äôt longed for this world)
This is not a 10 it&#39;s a 1/0. Kanye almost made it
bro just review the music you bald weirdo üòÇ

what a yaper
i wish you can see the dislikes
Hypocrite also bald
Always knew you were a jew
Shut up about the politics and review the gosh darn music
This review feels like I&#39;m watching some drama unfold about two ex lovers...8/10 not enough virtue signaling.
You don‚Äôt care when artists openly hate white people and white culture?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=331">5:31</a>  Dummest?? Ok do an album so...  it&#39;s beautiful judging other works, so let me tell you this FANTANO... YOUR CHANEL IS BORING AND I DONT FOLLOW YOU NEITHER!!!
Hypocrisy doesn‚Äôt validate anything. The influence of the mindset the average human in America contains years and years of indoctrination. The mainstream slanders him because he exposes the ugliest parts of the pursuit of the world order. as a mass society, we have no idea how submissive we are as Americans. We are so far brainwashed our subconscious minds are taken over. Just think about all the unhealthy things you buy and consume/ watch, think everyday. Things that are allowed to be created for influence. So now that someone comes into the world and tries to raise vibrations once again like many people in history have, we just as a whole kill our most inner selves in this world. Who cares about the ‚Äúanti semetic ‚Äú stuff man. Seriously . This is like a game of tattletale at preschool. You can take an entire mass of people and literally physically and mentally control people at an extreme level and overtime sedate them into workers but some people can‚Äôt realize how it happened? You think the Universe doesn‚Äôt bring darkness to light. Ur wrong.
Ur irrelevant at this point man
kanye hasnt been the same since 2010, but i still like his music, but i only listened for carti and rich the kid, and i really enjoyed the beat
Number 1 in Israel üëçüèæ
Woke melon, bad melon.
that fader article really fucked u up....
This guy is the literal definition of a pseudo intelectual
Wow, another E celeb has a politically charged opinion! I&#39;ll put it in the &quot;don&#39;t watch&quot; pile.
unwatchable 1
doesn‚Äôt want to give him a platform yet makes reviews, livestreams, tweets and fantano vids up the wazoo about him. hypocritical
Yeah I don‚Äôt care for the horseshit spiel his new woman likes the shit she does so don‚Äôt speak for her but yeah the music sucks. His opinions range from dumb to eh to ok I get it but eh. Mainly his music has sucked though. He hasn‚Äôt released a decent album since graduation to me. Didn‚Äôt like the fantasy album. Everything after that has been trash and it‚Äôs why he‚Äôs had different mixes and releases and leaks. I think he‚Äôs just clinging to life at this point. I don‚Äôt care about jews hurt feelings when he‚Äôs just as anti Black as he is anti jew if you listen to his lyrics but yeah the album sucks.
Pause carnival while I‚Äôm singing it again and I‚Äôm banning your ip and releasing your address
I think you‚Äôre always cranky because you have to see you‚Äôre own face in the mirror every morning.
Even Wyatt James didn‚Äôt achieve a unreviewable
When you use words like ‚Äúhe replaced his wife‚Äù your opinion doesn‚Äôt matter.
This dude is a loser
I like how he was so worried about kim exploiting their daughter online and he just puts her in his disgusting album with some chick thats not her mothers ass on it that shes gotta pick up and look at every time she looks at her first song.
Jus wasted 7 mins of my life thanks‚Ä¶. Won‚Äôt watch anymore
hey, anthony, antisemitism is bad, but why is this unreviewable when albums by murderers, predators, and even more antisemetic people aren&#39;t? i know you hating kanye is sort of a meme, but please man. <br>inb4 &quot;kanye talks about the whole antisemetic thing on vultures&quot; yeah, not shit, thats what kanye does. his work is full of self-referencial shit, good or bad. if this album is unreviewable, all his albums should be.
I&#39;m one of the people for whom lyrics turn to gibberish while listening to music. Sometimes I catch a word here and there, but that&#39;s about it. If you personally dislike Kanye that&#39;s completely okay, but I think it should not affect your review. You should just talk about the music as is. You can talk about the beat, rhythm or how distasteful the lyrics are as part of the review and people would listen. I bet most people would just click off the video before <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=252">4:12</a> and not hear what you have to say, because all they hear is rambling up until that point. By doing this you are basically telling people that if they want to find out about the music, they should just listen to it. If you want to steer people away from listening to it, you should have just started with the review and tell people what you think about the tracks. For the record I mostly listen to electronic music, so Kanye is not really my cup of tea.
no jokes, totally agree.
This dude had zero moral backbone. What a flip flop
He got the Kanye fans mad with this one üòÇ
He reviewed it, all while acting like he wasn&#39;t gonna review it.  Marketing genius!
This was more a review of West&#39;s controversies and his fans instead of the album. It&#39;s especially disingenuous because he needs to characterise Listers as blind defenders in order for his stance to work. If you can&#39;t consume art without removing your own bias you&#39;ve failed... And I don&#39;t even like the album.
ok, i get fantanos point, but for example, the boys from NFR Podcast both said they enjoyed the album overall; does that mean that Anthony thinks they are cringy teenagers or racists or what? there is no excuse for what kanye did, that is for sure, and there are some verses in this album where he pokes the bear and boasts about his actions, which is scummy for sure, but if i listen to it and enjoy the overall experience, i don&#39;t think that i am placed in any of the categories you&#39;ve mentioned Anthony;  still, many points are for sure valid, so i am for sure not throwing any hate. love for everyone! (also, i am curious if jpegmafia collaborated on this project, does that mean that you wont review things from him as well?)
Like the album, this review was a waste of time.
Boyy think he actually funny
bet you are fun at parties
Idk I understand you can‚Äôt look over the things he says and does i feel like the album is worth a fair shot based on how great $ sounds and the production is actually great in my book.
maybe stfu and do your &quot;JOB&quot;?
This is why u got divorced
he must be a god damm jew
This album sounds like if someone tried to do their own homemade version of Pink Album without the funny.
It&#39;s not bad, but it&#39;s not as good as everyone claims. I think the mainstream music quality has lowered the bar to the point that anything in the range of 7-9/10 are considered AOTY.<br><br>Though it is hypocritical that Fantano praises people like Ice Cube, but gets butthurt about Kanye. But hey, he&#39;s allowed to make the content he wants to make.<br><br>To be honest, I think Fantano does a great job at exposing people to a lot of music that they otherwise wouldn&#39;t have given a chance ... but I also think the opposite is true.
if kanye was a shaking ass and had a vagina this would have been an 8
Fantano is the type of guy to be like<br><br>‚ÄúI never really liked Ye‚Äôs music anyways.‚Äù
bros a professional yapper üó£üó£
Trying so hard now
I think you are missing the fans like me. Or even you to a lesser extent.  Im a Christian and im certain you are not, however we are clearly agreeing to some degree over the hypocrisy and or use of Christians to support kanye and then toss is aside.
yapping
Wtf is this? A review on his music or mouth-piecing for zionists?
Holy yap you review music not politics üíÄüôèüò≠
Buddy you 50 your opinions are shit get off the internet
bro gave sexy redd an 8, explains enough
I supported kanye through everything until this trash release that i refuse to listen to.  How will an album of dark bs after he failed to get his wife back relate or inspire a soul?  It wont.  Its gross. All of this vultures shit is gross
Why is it ok to make references and wordplay towards white, black, asian, hispanic, Muslim, Christian, etc. and basically any other group of humans in rap music but when it‚Äôs towards Jewish people it‚Äôs an issue? Why can we make references towards ANY other group except Jewish people? Why are Jewish people so untouchable in today‚Äôs society?
In the last mouth I&#39;ve been playing TCD AND MBDTF repeatedly  every day because the music is undebatable and freaking beautiful and awesome, and to go from that to vultures made me wanna puke, how could an artist who had one of the greatest hiphop run for 12 years from TCD to life of pablo to making lps like jesus is king and vultures. The couldn&#39;t even get to 70 percent of the album. Lyrically it is hell for my mind and the flow riding and preforming has just mede my eyes cry. So bad of a project honestly and this opinion is not because of what he said or did on the political spectrum. If he made an album as good as graduation for exemple i would&#39;ve praised it cuz I&#39;m a hiphop head and that&#39;s what i care about as a matter of fact i love kanye&#39;s music and i spam his early albums on repeat but truth be told this project is one of the worst most ridiculous unworthy of listening albums to ever come.
I had alot of written but its a waste of time to even bother. <br>You promoted his album by being hypocritical so bad that you became viral for it. <br>Deserved
you forgot the 4th type of fan, the ones who don‚Äôt care to hear him criticized but will just listen to the music cuz it‚Äôs music
Weirdly little mention of the actual music on the album for an album review. More of a Kanye review of the past 2 years than a vultures review
8 mins of hating on Ye
Album is all over the charts everywhere, dont think too many people share this sentiment lol
reviewing burzum but not kanye :D
what a hater man holy shit
Strong opinion! Thanks melon ‚ù§
lame ass hipster lumberjack
So many of y‚Äôall getting mad at an opinion with another opinion, like either of you really had something to say? Sure.
unreviewable? Nah I bet I can review it. It&#39;s melted shit
Bro just did this for views
If it was called ‚ÄòThe Life of Vultures‚Äô he would give it an 8 on a redux review
This is the highest praise possible
I mean its his opinion so i dont got no problem w that
People don‚Äôt understand Kanye. Watch Lil Dicky appear on that comedian podcast talk about Kanye. Lil Dicky is Jewish and use to play basketball with Kanye for over a year. What he said, in summary, was that Kanye hates being said no to. If you tell him you can‚Äôt say anything about Jews, that‚Äôs what he‚Äôll do. If you say something is not possible for him, he has some drive to do it. Obviously that doesn‚Äôt make what he did right but the over hatred for this man who has hurt peoples feeling over the internet is kinda overblown.
i used to think a certain online creator was unfair to you, but now i don&#39;t
Yup I&#39;m a number 3 and ur takes are still just as horrible. We do not care, the music is good
Confirmation bias is a hell of a disease...<br>Ye is not anti-semite, i don&#39;t recall him calling for harming...<br>He is pointing out things and you should focus on rebutting his claims, not resulting in calling him names because you don&#39;t have counter arguments or facts.<br>I don&#39;t agree with a lot of things he says, but without using logic to rebute him you are just going to grow his &quot;fan base&quot; or people who just happened to already believe some of the stuff he says.<br>And also some of the things he says can&#39;t be disproven or proven since they are theories. At the same time people should be able to make their own opinion based on claims and or know facts.<br><br>What are his claims ?<br>Are they unfounded ?<br>Are they 100% false ?<br>Context ?<br>He loves the H ? Context ? Clip ?<br><br>Lesson to be learn to all the pseudo intellectuals  that oblivious to the fact that they are actually part of cult &lt; NUANCE is important.<br>Giving the worst possible sense to a sentence someone say and make it look like it actually confirm what you were thinking.... make you look like a fool for people that actually look at the whole canvass and the even see the wall and the gallery the paint is on.<br>You views are too narrow and you should stop trying to make yourself look smart, you aren&#39;t. Try to be useful to society and if you are bored, jerk off...
You don&#39;t need to lecture other adults. Hey guys... did you know, that racism... is bad? Grow up.
Ok and i agree about all the shitstorm but look I love &quot;Paid&quot; the track is musically pumping and badass, that jodeci choir in the intro, roxanne the police ref. I could elaborate but out of all the context, isn&#39;t there also fans of this album just coming from outside that messed up context to enjoy the good tracks we get here ?<br><br>At least I do, and i don&#39;t pay that much attention to lyrics. And that&#39;s it. Album is reviewable for me. The &quot;musically garbage&quot; isn&#39;t justified for me. Maybe I&#39;ll boycott in the future if it&#39;s getting straight up hate in the lyrics.
At least, unlike Donda 2, this album was released on platforms where people can listen to it. Not sure if it&#39;s a good thing though. Maybe it would&#39;ve been better if Nazye kept it stashed on his computer.
I&#39;m not a rap fan at all, but aren&#39;t there rappers who say homophobic and sexist shit all the time yet you still review them? A lot of those people are also actual criminals who directly harmed other people. Those guys are fine, but Kanye is not? Why is sexism and homophobia fine but antisemitism is not?
There&#39;s the 4th category: people that have loved the music for years, love the sound, know that he&#39;s not a good person or role model. Hi! :)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=324">5:24</a> you have a sick desperation to your laughs
I can&#39;t believe you actually tried to convince us and yourself that this album is &quot;awful&quot;. Despite all the critics (fair) of him being antisemitix it&#39;s just a crappy superficial delusional review
Damn, I agree with you largely, but I really don&#39;t like that you leave out the category of people who separated the art from the artists.... You can enjoy Kanye&#39;s music without liking him... Idk why you have to be an edgy teenager or a white supremacist to like his music now.
why u sound mad fantano
You do know you&#39;ve reviewed people that have commited felonies? Absolutely cucked take.
Dont cry so much
what a horrible take
that fader article absolutely destroyed him
liberals seething liberals malding rn
Who likes this guy??? Like seriously wtf
This guy is fake and phoney and people actually value his bull üí©.
Hows the wife?
the album cover doesn&#39;t hurt
haha im all three of them üòÇ!!! good oneüòÇ!!
I mean, I think its fine so make a statement like this. But if you&#39;re going to say an album in unreviewable on the basis of antics &amp; artist actions as a music reviewer, then you better go and deem every single album ever made by a bad person unreviewable aswell. Don&#39;t people who have litteraly taken others lives and committed atrocities ALSO not deserve the &quot;pause&quot; and &quot;excitement&quot; you describe? Dont get me wrong, Kanye is for sure a shitshow and the shady shit hes saying and doing SHOULD NOT be ignored but this whole video just comes off as very contradictory &amp; seems like you&#39;re virtue signaling. I don&#39;t think you&#39;re consistent with your values.
I tried to give it a listen but i jst couldnt its so bad üíÄ
Bro you literally listen to murders but you cancel someone because of his words?
i think at this point if he made an actual attempt at changing himself to be a better person a lot of his current fans will leave him. that&#39;s his current fanbase
This is the most soy album review I&#39;ve ever watched oh my goodness.üòÇ
If it wasn‚Äôt Kanye none of you would give a fuck. Kanye is boring and shit
Bro is music fuck whatever ye said you review durk and all the shit from<br>Chicago knew and and file by the court killer why is ye different now ?
Just expecting this guy&#39;s vaush moment
Your opinion has never been that relevant tbh. I only whatch your videos while pooping for mid entertainment...
Why do you never have a problem with lil nax x making fun of Christianity then and you also have no problem reviewing the albums of murderers like 21 savageüôÉ
L + ur bald
i wish you read comments so you know that you are actually the delusional one
What‚Äôs up with your anti-Semitic rhetoric little bro?
Trying way too hard to hate
He‚Äôs mad more than the jews themselves
Ur goin downhill so bad bro‚ò†Ô∏è ur clearly tryna push an agenda and Haring just cause u don&#39;t wanna receive hate for liking kanyeüò≠
Thats cowardly, you dont have issues with any other religion, but the dig at the jews is where you cross the line? You are quickly become as boring as mainstream media, just afraid of any backlash that might go your way. The long lasting castration of Fantano continues.
its litterally his best album
Yet you Gave Sexy Red an 8. DUDE YOURE JUST A HATER CLEARLY. üòÇ
Kanye says you‚Äôre welcome for the ad revenue he earned you with this review on your mid channel little bro.
Fantano is a perfect example of the neutered complacent cattle mindset thats literally destroying our country. If this isn‚Äôt obvious to you, you‚Äôre probably part of the problem.
I honestly just think fantano genuinely hates the music he is hearing from kanye. There are countless reviews of him going into detail of artists personal life or perspectives they&#39;ve shared on social media, interviews and in public. Also, legal issues and criminal documents that are released on artist have come up in his reviews many times before to give his viewers an idea of the artist mindset and content they are expressing within the music. On top of that fantano does have the right to agree or disagree with the artists behavior, sentiment, point-of-view, content, intentions, hate, harassment, vulgarity, violence etc in their personal life, music or artwork when he gives a good or bad review. I&#39;m not understanding why people are butthurt about a negative review. He has given kanye bad and good reviews before while bringing up kanyes personal life, political stances, and other perspectives of life.
You should grow your hair back dude
This mf decided to include calling out a fanbase as part of his ‚Äúreview‚Äù. If that doesn‚Äôt destroy your creditably idk what does tbh.
Biased. üò¢
wtf do his personal life and statements got to do with the music. shit lame
Soooo this has nothing to do with the actual music? This is why I‚Äôve stopped watching
youre pathetic
There is no such thing as unreviewable. You just chasin the bag and the cloud
But some of the things he did say are true, I mean look it up and look thats happend with America &amp; Isreal. So whats the problem?
Jesse i don&#39;t like the new Kanye album
If yall fanboys think his rapping is still sharp in this album you probably never listened to &quot;No More Parties in LA&quot;
My prediction is that sometime in the next year or so Ye will try to initiate some sort of redemption sequence by going on some big name talk show/podcast..... whatever... and admit that he is batshit crazy and that he got help and is now back on his meds. If all goes well (for him) he will be able to portray himself as a helpless victim of mental health issues and all the haters are actually being bigots or something. Its up to us all to not let this happen. I personally have disliked him since the first time i became aware of him way back when some people i was talking to at a gathering in Oakland were playing him and it caught my eyer. Interestingly enough this thing i was at was actually an impromptu renegade appearance in a park by Mos Def that had something to do with the first Obama campaign. It was free and I remember it turned out pretty cool. But ive always thought it was ironic that i first heard Kanye while waiting to see Mos Def play a free show on the fly. <br>Mos Def&gt;Nazye West
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=120">2:00</a> WHERE IS YOUR DATA FOR THIS? ARE YOU OMNISCIENT? I NEED THE DATA
Damn if I was this guys wife I‚Äôd divorce his ass. Speaking of downfalls, he should speak on his own. Pathetic behavior lol
&quot;you don&#39;t like it thats your loss, your opinion don&#39;t change the show cost&quot;
Where‚Äôs your wife?
After 10 years, I&#39;m done. Your high brow ego has become your own filter now. Go lick the liberal trickle. Weak.
Shit on a man with mental issues, what about all the other rappers that have done horrible crimes and you don‚Äôt condemn them? Why you turn into another politican andy with brain rot
anthony clowntano
I like how you hate Kanye and call his album unreviewable while you review the albums of a lot of other artists who are also trash human beings. Just be consistent and don&#39;t lecture us what music we should listen and how we should listen them.
anthony&#39;s hairline correlates with his inability to keep up with the times
If Kanye hardcore fans aren&#39;t objective when reviewing a Kanye album because they praise him whatever he does, you on the other hand aren&#39;t objective for the exact opposite reason. You just hate him so you&#39;re gonna shit on him on every occasion you could. Labeled the record awful but just mentioned three actually weak to bad songs while there are great songs too, completely ignoring them. At this point I think it&#39;s almost pointless you keep doing reviews on him, I mean if we all know what you&#39;ll rate them no matter what even before watching the video then what&#39;s the point?
This is why your wife left you
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=258">4:18</a> I‚Äôm having the hardest time finding the hate or discriminative nature in these hip hop lines. <br><br>1. He‚Äôs quoting what other ppl call him. Like???<br>2. So he‚Äôs paying Jews. Being responsible for their livelihood. Funding their future. If that‚Äôs what hate is, I wish Kanye hated me too.<br>3. So making love to someone is hate? Fucking someone is the literal physical carnation of love. <br><br>This review is unwatchable. Let‚Äôs just talk strictly about the music next time. One more of these videos and I‚Äôll definitely have to unsub. <br>There are plenty of video essays on YT about Kanye‚Äôs character. Not the type of content I followed your bald ass for. Step it up melon!
Buddy your washed asf
BEST ALBUM I HEARD IN A LONG TIME... I LOVE MUSIC AND JEWSü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
Yap yap yap üòÇtalk about music dude wth ü§¶  lmao ü§£ dude has turned into news reporter
i‚Äôm confused. how are left leaning people mad that kanye makes antisemitic comments when they themselves stand with Palestine and are antisemitic?
fantano delete your channel
Bro became more of a joke than kanye ever was
Im sure if you stop critiquing black music, you wouldnt have a platform.
&quot;professional critic&quot; ü§ì
You are honestly shocking at reviewing music just cuz u don‚Äôt like it doesn‚Äôt make it bad u absolute clown üíÄ
Didn‚Äôt even know it was out, still don‚Äôt have any interest in it. He‚Äôs the result of everyone calling him genius, and throws hissy fits when people say ‚Äúno‚Äù.
Love yah fanny tanny ‚ù§Ô∏è
It&#39;s funny to me that Kanye West fans now sound exactly like headcase American right-wingers. It&#39;s not a cross contamination I ever would have seen coming, but these are strange times we live in.
But what if I just like his older albums idk
7 minutes of malding
You can‚Äôt review it because you‚Äôre too political. But a new career would be cool because I‚Äôve only heard of this guy until this instance.
valid, kanye ans are delusional beyond help. the album honestly sucks ass (at least we got graduation, college dropout and mbdtf)
If this was called to Vulture a Vulturefly you would‚Äôve given it a 10
Oliver Fantano be like: <br><br>&quot;Oh nice this person who has been charged for grape and murder in the past just made a new song lets review it üòÅ&quot;<br><br>Oh im not reviewing this guys song because he said mean things about jews üò°&quot;
Stop trolling and do your damn job. Is it so hard for Americans to review anything without bias? Without making it about themselves? If you didn&#39;t intend to give a review, why even do a video?<br><br>Attention seeker!
&quot;But you reviewed Burzum&quot; Burzum doesn&#39;t have millions of followers worshipping him! Everyone listening to Burzum admit to all the shit Varg has done unlike ye fans.
Dude lost critical thinking and is a hypocrite lol
Is he still rewriting all his old music to exclude cursing? That idea sucked. Joel Osteen was fucking with him.
Thank god you stopped rating his music. I think the world needs a break from you disrespecting actual good albums.
Terrible review with no critical thinking
Just review the songs baldy
How can he be antisemite Ye first in Israel
Bias reviewer
They were right about you man.
Fantano forgot there exist people who separate the artist from the music. Fantano also forgot that he reviews the album and not the artist.
Ungreenscreenable
Does not change show cost, number 1 in 109 countries... because of nihilistic racists cultish kids... u salty jewüòÄ
Guys, who knows another good music reviewers to watch ?
Dude thank you. People just forgot what he said wtf
Fantano the grade A hypocrite
‚Äúi‚Äôm not racist it‚Äôs a preference and my bitch is lookin like a reference‚Äù he‚Äôs saying he likes white bitches
Gotta be one of the most hypocritical reviews from you good job melon head love it üëç
embarassing
Bingo
YE GOT FANTANO IN HIS FEELINGSüòÅ
This music heal us stfuü´µüèΩ
i agree with this, still, stars is a fucking amazing track imo, plus do it and fuk sumn bops, but that&#39;s about it
he thinks he got a cult fanbase that will save his ass
&quot;You have a world view thats different than mine so you must be wrong.&quot; Bro just proves Ye point just like the rest of em lmao
Damn I was there when he did the listening on Twitch. The chat was the most toxic thing I witnessed in a long time. Truly pathetic, I don&#39;t even know how he kept his composure
Fantano is benefiting off your feelings
52000 dislikes on your bald headtop üò≠üò≠üò≠
Your opinion is trash.
Fantano&#39;s politics will only ever be a light to decent 2
So James from AVGN was praised for not reviewing Ghostbusters but Fantano not reviewing Kanye&#39;s album is criticized? Hypocrisy much huh chuds?!
This was the dumbest video I&#39;ve ever seen
its not &quot;unreviewable&quot; just say if you like it or not
Your opinion and taste in hip hop music is irrelevant, lets wait till you find out how much other rappers you love are antisemitic.
Bro talking about bias when he went into the album already decided he will hate it
Grifffffffffffffffttttttttttt
if it was called kids see vultures it would&#39;ve gotten a 10
I can see dislikes and omg that disklike ratio is almost 50/50 crazy lololol
come on‚Ä¶what about BEG FORGIVENESS‚Ä¶WHAT ABOUT BEG FORGIVENESSS???????
What about carnival I like that songs
what a ü§° take
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=229">3:49</a> The Kanye‚Äôs get a bit quirky at night
This guy has never had a good review of any of kanye wests music..not one....even if the albums are later certified ...pure hate mail ....i get he is a reviewer but if you establish how much you hate someoens music.... sometimes just leave it for others to enjoy and move on to review what you consider brilliant.
giving it a mid review would have been better if he really hates ye so much. he just out here giving ye clout by making it &quot;the worst thing ever&quot;. stupid ass.
The way these comment try to make fun of him, but they dont bring any reason is sad.<br>I&#39;ll say this hitler is NOT A GOOD PERSON.<br>Jewish people are not bad people. <br>THATS IT.
who still listens to this schizo? why does this borderline shit on my recommended page?
U literally review nazis üòÇüòÇ u lost the plot. Unsubscribed
I thought people were liking the album, this is his worst album, seriously?
I have no skin in the game, i see kanye as a funny little man that probably is a bit schizo. He&#39;s not a bad person, he just a has a brain that&#39;s prone to believing conspiracy bullshit.
For his next project, Kanye should team up with Ethan Kath. I think their chemistry would work really great together.
Oy vey!
You really hit home with this video Fantano. I strongly agree with your points on how Kanyes behaviour has been too out-of-pocket, even for Kanyes standards. Your willingness to speak on his (extremely) unethical behaviour  like this knowing you&#39;ll get hate from the stubborn fanbase is very admirable and respectable. You used your platform the right way knowing you&#39;d get crucified for it. Hope it&#39;ll make it easier to know you did the right thing and that you ARE getting through alot of us. You&#39;re one of the most authentic and genuine Youtubers out there man!
Why even make this video? People come to this channel for music reviews not political posturing. This is a bad look. I don&#39;t give a fucc about Kanye West, but this is just going to cause this channel to lose credibility among music fans. Doesn&#39;t he have an alternate channel that he could&#39;ve expressed the same opinions on? Why do it here? This is sad to see.
You think that‚Äôs bad wait till you hear what Michael Jackson did
support local wigger slam
The album is pretty shit and Kanye fans and free speech warriors are mad just cuz Anthony didnt put a number on the album.
ü§ì?
Boooooo
God forbid anyone enjoy music and put aside the terminally online mentality
I think you as a reviewer/youtuber can pack your bags, fell off, shit in his own mouth. Desperately trying to follow brainwashing propaganda instead of trying to actually review music so yeah ur just done lmao
1 mln views a day, wow üòê
The lack of moral consistency is crazy on this one chief
This is the most basic opinion possible‚Ä¶he basically said I don‚Äôt like what he‚Äôs doing therefore I don‚Äôt like anything from him. üíÄ
Ok jews bit** free palestine first, and then we can talk about kanye album.
üòÇ this review admits that the needle drop is not an unbiased reviewer.<br>I had a hunge before but this confirms a lot ..
Haven&#39;t listened to the album and probably never will, but this comment section only serves to prove Anthony right.<br>I just wish he would&#39;ve spent more time talking about the album than about Kanye&#39;s antisemitism, because we already know... the obvious doesn&#39;t need to be stated (except for some people here, which is unfortunate)
What about &#39;EL ALBERG DE LA GUASA&#39; by &#39;ELS CUNDITS&#39;?
The man likes sexy red then has the nerve to act like his opinion matters.<br>What a clown.
I care about the music more and I think Kanye is just crazy so I cannot cancel culture him. If the justice wants to condemn Kanye then they will do it, I am just here to enjoy creative music and still love the work of Kanye and Kanye‚Äôs team
that one friend always looking for attention:
The riff about hateful psychos, nihilistic teenagers, and parasocially obsessed cult members being the ones enjoying this is so spot on.<br><br>If any of you want to see it for yourself, just display comments by &#39;newest first&#39;
yet you were happy to review burzum which are known to be anti semetic and have evn burned down churches and synagogues and murdered some people
You should stop reviewing music. You are really bad at it
On a serious note, would y‚Äôall care if he did this video on any other artist that wasn‚Äôt Kanye?
Bro just stop reviewing u can‚Äôt do it
You‚Äôre so lame
You‚Äôre unwatchable lmao
Anthony criticizing a paranoid Bi-polar psycho is like us making fun of his hair and eyesight. Anthony stick to rating music poorly instead of talking about literally anything else.
Anthony Fantano try not to be a hypocritical annoying asshole challenge, level impossible
imagine titling it unreviewable but yet giving it a review
&quot;You&#39;d have to expect me to seperate my brain from my skull if you think I&#39;m going to ignore it.&quot;<br><br>Probably the most based thing I&#39;ve heard in a long time.
Good ol Anthony Virtue Signaling Fantano
no way, washed out rapper that hasn&#39;t released a decent album put another shit tier album...color me surprised Pikachu. People are too wrapped in nostalgia, deaf, and sport a smooth brain to agree with all the stupic things Kanye says and does.
Leave it to Fantano to be a bigger braindead clown than Kanye ü§° How embarrassing lol
This comment section is horrid. Great video, painful to watch, but very true. I&#39;m glad fantano took this stance and everything he said was very true, especially the part about the nihilistic teenagers that also make up 90% of reels viewers and fantano fans alike. It hurts to see.
The look on his face at the beginning honestly made me scared for a minute lol
Fantano&#39;s the GOAT
Anthony is just blasting emotionless on repeat right now
You‚Äôre so mad and it‚Äôs SO FUNNY ü§£ü§£
Vultures #1 in 109 countries!
....And yet you still streamed the album.
Even the new thumbnail looks unhinged. Poor guy.
You are a hypocrite
I liked it‚Ä¶.
Separate the art from the artist, then proceeds to take problem with the subject matter in the music. But doesn&#39;t have a problem with the constant demoralization of women for instance in every other Rap album. Can&#39;t pick and choose Fantano. If you don&#39;t want de-meaning Racist/Sexist/Anti-semetic stuff in your music then you have to condemn ALL of it.
Anthony must be on his period to throw such a hissy fit.
Now me as a muslim feels offended.. there are so many islamophobic lyrics thru the years and I never saw an outrage about that.. well good luck m8
Melon just gets worse and worse. I miss when he wasn‚Äôt so deranged by his political views. So many classic albums he‚Äôs recommended from artists who were strange or unsavory people. Just review the f‚Äîing music.
Everyone who ever said West was worth listening to is to blame for this. West has always been a d-tier rapper and musician. This is what you get when you promote a moron. I could&#39;ve told you he was shit right from the jump. All his songs are forgettable; I can only really remember &quot;Gold Digger&quot;.
Promoting yourself as a liberal on all of your channels and then making misogynistic comments about Bianca ( who literally didn&#39;t speak a single word about anything) and calling her Dollar general Kim K is so fucking pathetic.
Kanye meat riders gonna have a field day with this one.
What does this have to do with the album. IS THE MUSIC GOOD? that&#39;s what you&#39;re here for
kanye made such a good album that he got a review nobody else has
It‚Äôs crazy how many people in these comments are riding Kanye like a merry-go-round, trying to be like ‚ÄúUMMM MELON WHY DIDN‚ÄôT YOU MORAL GRANDSTAND LIKE THIS FOR X/Y/Z ARTIST????‚Äù Most of these artists being ones I‚Äôve never heard of lmao. Kanye has an extremely wide reach, of course Anthony‚Äôs gonna be so vocal against someone who seems to impact the cultural zeitgeist/conversations in really unpredictable and harmful ways.
Clown
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=160">2:40</a> i just like his music, dont agree with any of the shit that comes out of his mouth
If Kanye West changed his name to Kendrick West and the album was named To Pimp a Vulturefly you wouldve given it a 10
To hate this guy is an understatement, he has reasons for his opinion however I do think he is wrong for not understanding a key aspect of art. To separate the art from the artist. He claims conspiracy music is garbage, yet gave 10s to music about murder. If he is simply going to tear down Kanye and have it represent his artwork (Which is completely separate) then this guy is clearly unfit to properly judge music. And his opinions will lose a certain credibility to them.  If we wanted to see a review about Kanye as a person, you could&#39;ve titled this, &quot;My thoughts on Kanye&quot;.
The twitch chat and album broke this man the live stream was so funny by far the best review
I&#39;m disappointed you didn&#39;t give this a NOT GOOD.
Gonna report this for misinformation.
so basically Fantano isn&#39;t your last name, it&#39;s goldsteinberg.
if this album was named kids see vultures it wouldve been a 10
Who is this goof ball. Twitter brought me here. This guys a JACKASS ü´è
Son, Anthonio Fanta is DISAPPOINTED üò≠ üî•
Ye trajectory is something &quot;CJ The X&quot; has alluded to about &quot;Objectively  Bad Art&quot;. I&#39;m not saying Ye makes bad art.
Lame ass take
Is this worse than a NOT GOOD ?
and I thought virtue signaling on twitter was hard. Bro, this video is embarrassing
üëÉ
I keep hoping for a wormhole to open up and we get the Kanye from the universe he deleted Twitter like six years ago and makes Kids See Ghosts 2 years after instead of this :/
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=266">4:26</a> goes hard
Bald
Unreviewable album? Who is this Kanye guy? Is this paid publicity? Im so confused. I just come here for dope music reviews and recommendations, not whatever this was. Did this kanye guy kill people? Well I&#39;ll do my own research on this Kanye fellow and get back to what all this hubba bubba is about. Truly I&#39;m confused.
If it whould have been called the life of vultures you whould have given it a 6
Where was all this when you review the rappers who killed people, beat their girl friends and sexually assaulted people. I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m a Kanye fan, but you are just doing this to boost your channel and likes. &quot;hey guys look at me, I&#39;m kicking someone who is already down&quot;.  It&#39;s just gross. and generalizing all Kanye fans to say there either this this or that people can like his music and disagree with what he says. You&#39;re just a troll trying to get publicity by saying something is generally good is bad.
Grow up Anthony.
Fantano was eaten up by his own character, he only does and says things to stay relevant, like giving sexy red album a fucking 8. The best you can get from these channels or magazines they are the musical recommendations, because they are quite arbitrary with which project deserves a better score than another.
Anthony Hipocritano
I listened to the whole album a few times and I didn&#39;t think it was technically good or artistically good. So if we were to put aside his politics for the sake of argument, the music itself isn&#39;t even good now either. He&#39;s clearly losing at life from every angle.
what an L fucking take
You played it safe this video‚Ä¶ disappointed.
im bouta touch u lil baldie
Dude comes across as someone with an inflated sense of self importance... it&#39;s like watching a special Olympics little league kid critique the best MLB player out there... you know his music is still great he just hurt your feelings and you can&#39;t handle it... your opinions definitely don&#39;t hold any weight with me anymore, probably the same for a lot of people after this video.
Bruh just review the album no one is going to cry because u give it a number out of 10 üíÄ
Drop summ sense you know music so good baldy go make a track run and see how ppl dog on it
Panderny Virtue-Signato
These comments are so unoriginal and not funny üò¢
I‚Äôm watching Young Dabo‚Äôs reviews from now on instead of this melon head
fantano when a rapper is homophobic gang member who has admitted to drug dealing and killing people üòäüòä<br>fantano when kanye says stupid mean stuff to jewish people üò°üò°ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨üí¢üí¢üëøüëø
but one thing for sure, keep talking trash about the artist and can&#39;t seperate art form from its artist personal life yet keep producing video about the guy for views. that sir i would call it &quot;unreviewable&quot;. i bet everything i got if van gogh or monet were born in this era, they would be canceled by the judge of their personalities not their arts
Some1 get Melonhead a pack of Maxipads... his üò∫ is hurt. Can&#39;t even separate the artist from the music like a normal neutral reviewer... had to be a typical political sheep whinging over non-issues
L BOZO
I‚Äôm with you dude. Trash fires all around.
Just ignore him or stop making videos about him on what he does
Kanye‚Äôs actions are to egregious for his album to get reviewed but not enough for you to not make a 7 min video and cash in on clicks ig.
W
I miss the old Fantano
We wanted a review and just got an apology type video yap session
I agree
i like how everything anthony said about kanye fans is just being proven right in the comments üíÄsame corny jokes repeated over and over again or hidden racists trying to tell him he should do the same to black artists who &quot;kill&quot; people apparently. grow the fuck up. kanye is a clown now and his music is absolute dogshit. anthony is justified to have this take a hundred times over.
I think Melon Man spends too much time in the Elon app
props on doing this. kanye is pure trash and isn&#39;t worthy of a 1/10
On a serious note though I do think there are a pretty solid number of people in the middle between Kanye stans and Kanye anti-stans who would still be capable of having their opinion swayed by a review or gain something from this review other than simply automatically agreeing or disagreeing based on their own already established views.  While he is an extremely divisive artist now I think there&#39;s comparably divisive artists out there who are also worth reviewing and who have fans who don&#39;t totally agree with their controversial views.  Like Pantera was still extremely popular with alot of non-racist people despite Phil Anselmo&#39;s openly white supremacist statements, Burzum became one of the more well-known and popular black metal bands despite the frontman/sole member not only being a white nationalist but also a convicted murderer, and although I personally don&#39;t have any issue with people holding far left views in general there are bands/artists like Rage Against the Machine, Bj√∂rk, or Dead Kennedys that hold very far left views and yet still have substantial fanbases that don&#39;t all (or even mostly) agree with their political views.  If you don&#39;t feel comfortable reviewing the music of an extreme anti-semite then that&#39;s totally understandable, but I don&#39;t really think your reasoning holds up as to why you believe this album is unreviewable.
Ty dolla sign shoulda said &quot;im just here for the carti&quot; it wouldve been way more relatable
If you determine someone is a bad person, and you can‚Äôt separate that person from their art/product, there‚Äôs no point in talking about the art/product.
kinda weird to cheer gang violence in lyrics, but get so outraged about this
Jesse Jackson still hasn&#39;t been forgiven. Why would Kanye expect any different? Meanwhile, Trump&#39;s defense of white supremacists in Virginia, some of who surrounded a Jewish temple, was conveniently overlooked.
Music is about aesthetics, not ethics
It‚Äôs better than most music out there.
this 10x&#39;ed your views
it was sad to me how dehumanizing to women this album was
My guy would rather listen to sexyredd then this wow ü§£
This is a review of Ye‚Äôs life, not a review of Vultures lol
this guy is the n 1 kanye hater
you mad?
Yet this went #1 everywhere - somebody is wrong and looks like it&#39;s this &quot;reviewer&quot;. Thumbs down üëé
Everything after this is unreviewable because this is album of year hands down
When you aren‚Äôt inescapably entangled with western identity politics and can just listen to music üòäüòäüòä
chronically online
Kanye is bipolar and the fame machine echo chamber he‚Äôs trapped in will never help him get better. Moral grandstanding from anyone will not help. Anyone with mentally ill friends with delusional thinking knows this. It‚Äôs a tragedy. We‚Äôve lost one of our generations greatest artists.
Embarrassing<br>Complete sellout
This is a review on kanye fans, not Kanye music. this is virtue signaling
We all know Kanye is a shitty person. However, we are here for the music review not your personal opinion on the artist. We are not all kids.
Guy is a 40 year old man acting like a passive aggressive 12 year old girl. <br><br><br>No wonder his wife left his pretentious ahh
Was the mustache ironic?
What a sorry excuse for a review, nobody asked for your opinion on the guy
Bro just lost all his credibility üò≠
Y‚Äôall really listen to this dude? üòÇ
Would‚Äôve given it a 10 if it was Death Grips- Vultures 1
i cant stand this guy
Nihilistic teenagers üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ epidemic man!
Congratulations!<br>You reviewed Vultures 1, the unreviewable album.<br>Time will now collapse.
Idk just seems like bro has a vendetta against Ye and only Ye, like where‚Äôs the fairness?
is this even a review of the music? seems like you just said, ‚Äúhe hates jews and his wife sucks.‚Äù i‚Äôm jewish and this didn‚Äôt make me think anything in regards to rhetoric dude.
Just don‚Äôt wanna give it a 10 sheezh
Loved everything you said, sir!
Loser
No wonder your wife cheated on you!!ü§£ü§£ü§£
gj
All I&#39;m hearing is a child reeeeing about someones political and personal life instead of just reviewing the work. I guarantee we can find plenty of artists you&#39;ve reviewed are far worse than kanye lol
Why do people still act like this guys opinion is valid?
i remember you was conflicted
I&#39;m just really interested in the production because I&#39;m a audio engineer and some of it is actually good
wow Anthony
BALDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
I&#39;m a genuine hip hop head. I hated this album. I still like Kanye and I&#39;m excited for what he does next
‚ÄúNazi adjacent‚Äù <br>God you couldn‚Äôt be more of a liberal couldn‚Äôt you? Either have some balls and call him a Nazi and yet still be an idiot about that because he‚Äôs not or don‚Äôt. You did similarly with Eminem when he actually had a message you might‚Äôve agreed with on Revival but yet you still shit on him for it so what the fuck? I stopped taking your opinion on music seriously after that moment, you hated it so much you couldn‚Äôt see the emotional growth and vulnerability he portrayed on that record whatsoever and it‚Äôs utterly ridiculous
shuut uupp BALLDDD!!!!!!!!
Plot twist, you get canceled for trying to be apart of canceling Kanye ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The Album is number one bro. You‚Äôre the one loosing it?
Fastest 1 million ever
unreviewable yet you&#39;re happy to make a video about it and monetize it for your financial gain. Pleb
guys opinion doesn&#39;t mean anything when he gave hoods hottest princess a 10
Back to Me is badass‚Ä¶just listen to the album‚Ä¶it isn‚Äôt that bad.
Kanye is right about the juice
&quot;What can i do to be different today&quot;
Bruh just review the album
Throwing a temper tantrum about an artist as a 40 year old man is wild
At some point let not act like Jews don‚Äôt have it coming
Fanteno you can‚Äôt have double standards man that‚Äôs not a good man‚Äôs quality.
Why TF i have to wait 5 minutes to listen to shitty reviews.
I wish ye made it possible to completely separate the art from the artist but his music seems to be his main outlet for his rants. He also doesn&#39;t seem to have anyone around him to tell him no or not to include certain things anymore. I almost wish he would adopt a man on the moon-esque alter ego to make stuff like ksg or any album that has a cohesive sound and idea without including all the extra stuff.
&quot;This album is unreviewable&quot;<br><b>proceeds to review it</b><br><br>I need to stop falling for fantanos titles, 2016 clickbait epidemic shouldve taught me better.
Kanye for president
Kanye is the üêê
Wow you are such a great person, I am so glad that a music reviewer is fighting for whats right in the world, there is still hope for the world with people who embody stand and just morals like you around
mofo should try to release music and then ill review his trash
If I don&#39;t agree with your viewpoint melon, does that make me a nazi? üòì
What does him being antisemitic or posting his wife have to do with the quality of his music ?
#1 In Israel btw
kanye isnt wrong but your biden supporting dementia deep state supporting ass is wrong about almost everything
Gotta keep the same energy with other artist that get caught in SA and literal murder. Can anti semitism really be as bad as murder?
Worst review I&#39;ve ever seen. As a reviewer, you don&#39;t understand your job. Do other content dude.
can you just do a review of the carti verse thats all we care about
Did y‚Äôall genuinely like this album?<br>I was excepting to and just really did not so I‚Äôm curious
This is the brain rotted from liberal politics.
What a fucking loser. Fantano is literally a vulture on the music industry
Isn‚Äôt this the guy who does Omegle pranks?
This is why fantono gave a pass to mamamax this guys knows nothing about music go shit is a cat litter box you waste of space
Blud did NOT talk about the music
BEAUTIFUL BIGG T**Y BUT NAKED WOMEN JUST DONT FALL OUT THE SKY YA KNOW‚Ä¶ Nah but BURN is a vibe, 10/10
Did he just still review the album....
nice attack on his wife, really great review bro üëç
I stand with Fantano ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è is what it is. Go outside read a book. Get some good art in ya life.
So music that promotes murder and lots of drug abuse is ok, but kanye isn&#39;t because things he said, got it. üëç
if you dont wanna review him i get it. but i think a lot of people are just mad of your hypocrisy. but the real question is who seriously watches music reviewers?? you could just you know...listen to the music yourself???
If it was called &quot;scaring the vultures&quot; it would have got an 8
i think the part that bothers me about those kanye fans is that they weren‚Äôt even actual fans until recently. they say ‚Äúbut he made graduation‚Äù and either haven‚Äôt listened to it or did when he said al that shit. fake fans.
I think your kinda biased against Kanye like you just went over 3 bad songs and not the other great 13 songs‚Ä¶ then you just slander him and all of his fans like Ik Kanye said  crazy sht and I Don‚Äôt support him but his life ain‚Äôt got nothing to do with me I don‚Äôt worship him or look up to Kanye so I could care less if he gets cancelled over what he says but if he makes MUSIC that is good I will listen to it because that‚Äôs what I want to do why are you grouping all his fans up into one thing it‚Äôs just sad and really pitiful that guys comment wasn‚Äôt wrong if he makes good music then he can listen to it what Kanye says has nothing to do with his life you should be allowed to listen to what you want
just review the dam thing that&#39;s your gig. your review albums not artist
Bro what are you talking about üòÇ why do you sound so salty. Everything you said is a lie. I am a huge fan of Kanye music and some of his clothes or sneakers but I can be critical about him, so can many others I know and have seen talk about his stuff on the internet. Saying he loves Nazi was wild, his new clothing sucks. Jesus is king was trash. There I critiqued him. üòÇ this album though fucking üî•. Also you don‚Äôt think some of your viewers might be weirdos?
Unfortunately he&#39;s a complete psychopath and he should turn silent writer for his own good.  Which sucks, cause he was a great artist. ü•≤
lol dude he had bad opinions and we&#39;re pretending that he&#39;s worse than the artists that actually commit murder or abuse?<br>Some people&#39;s view on where they draw the line is ridiculous, <br>Murder...?  separate the art from the artist! <br>Beats women...?  separate the art from the artist! <br>Anti-Semitic? UNREVIEWABLE!
Kanye whole discog is pop trash
strawman fallacy go brrrr
god it was so forgettable, what a trash album
the album was so fucking trash
bro talking to me like i shouldn‚Äôt enjoy the albumüíÄ
Why didn‚Äôt you mention that your crush Peggy produced for the album melon
Man stfu you were listening to music made by nazis before culture came out
You know what I find funny..you don‚Äôt have an issue with rappers talking about killing blk people or treating bw like shit but now you draw the line..all you doing is proving his point..that you can talk about everyone BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE JEWS NOW ITS TERRIBLE FOH YOU PHONY
Whining
this was NOT a proper album review. separate the art from the artist if you actually are a music reviewer
You&#39;re such a sandbag music reviewerü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ
Yes you can review murderers and thugs and drug deales thats fine but when somebody makes fun of jews.... and then apologizes for it... during a time where the world is not fond of jews. Yea thats crossing the line. Good thinking fantano
If it was called &quot;scarring the vultures&quot; he would&#39;ve given it an 8
the nose flare at the end really got me for some reason lmaooo
Lol I dont even like Kanye, but Anthony sounds like such a loser here.
music is objective
So uhh, where was this energy with XXXTentacions albums, a guy whos like, objectively 100x worse than kanye as he was an actual criminal &amp; abuser?
there‚Äôs also fans that just like the music the album is honestly not bad tbh
When the world is delusional and meat riding a bad album blindfolded there&#39;s nothing better than a good old Fantano album review
so... you spent the entirety of the video reviewing Kanye as a human instead of reviewing the actual music....
If you didn‚Äôt want to review it then why bother lmao you‚Äôre the type to cry about getting stung by a hornets nest and still keep messing with it afterwards.
idk i kinda like the album
Unreviewable? Is this not a review? Lol<br><br>Is it about the politics you wont score it? Didn&#39;t he review burzum? Like 3 times?
I did not like this album too, but unreviewable?....<br>You did review many homophobic, racist, ped* and real life murderer artists but ye is out of it..<br>Does not make sense at all. I think this is not a Music review channel anymore
womp womp
Bias üôÑ. You would‚Äôve liked it if it was called to pimp a vulture
Very professional. Where is your spine?
If it was called &quot;Speeding Vulture to Heaven&quot; you would&#39;ve given it a 10...
Sorry but I just can‚Äôt get behind this, they are soooo many times the fantano himself separated the art from the artist, but can‚Äôt for this, it‚Äôs ridiculous. Yeah Ye had some horrible takes and is definitely a weirdo, but there are rappers who are literal murderers that fantano reviews just fine, it‚Äôs just odd‚Ä¶
guess he‚Äôs going the political commentary route
you shouldn&#39;t be allowed to listen to music if you watch the needle drop
this clown will never create anything on par with what kanye west shit in the morning, you can feel the frustration of this clown
It would have been a 10 if it was called kids scaring the pimped vultures
Okay Melon I&#39;m with u but u can&#39;t act like beautifulbigtittybutt naked women just dont fall out the sky u kno aint on loop in ur head like it has been for me all day cleaning stuff. Shit is one of those lines where it&#39;s so bad and yet you cant unhear it ü§£
Soft
This is the same dude that gave Sexy Redd&#39;s album an 8 lmaoo
L TAKE. BURN IS üî• üî• üî• üî•
if it was called KIDS SEE VULTURES 1 you would have given it a 10
Bald
Anthony is the biggest virtue signaler in existence.
such a brain dead take
try not to get political challenge hard mode
This will be BIG for the charts for a week or 2 because people will not bet believe how crappy it is and will listen to it then it will fade to nothingness. Maybe thats good enough for Kanye nowadays...at least he will have more to talk about and blame everyone for how shitty it is. Maybe he will play the race card, maybe the jewish one, maybe he will say its getting bad reviews because he is jesus and jesus was persecuted who the hell knows.
In all seriousness, this is a horrible take. Absolutely it&#39;s messy, but to not see the beauty is many of these songs is actually WILD
What I can&#39;t understand is that his music has always been utter shit, can&#39;t rap for shit, annoying as fuck production. Influenced the worst decade and a half of rap/hip-hop.  Dude&#39;s like the Motley Crue or Def Leppard of the 80&#39;s.  I could understand supporting his music if it was any good.
I agree with everything you said related to Kanye antisemitism, BUT to me theres a better way to do it, I think Professor Skye&#39;s did perfectly, he called out the anti-semitism multiple times, but also analyzed the music and each song separately when he could (but his review was more than one hour, so not everybody can do that type of reviews  lmao). He also said something really cool in my opinion, maybe I`m about to misquote him, but I think it goes like &quot;Kanye is an antisemite, but if the heart of his music is not antisemite, I feel comfortable reviewing it&quot; I`m paraphrasing so maybe I could have misquoted him, but I thought that was a very nice way to put it, but hey, he gave Vultures a nice review, and loved the project, so maybe I could be biased also, so, who knows...
The review of the music starts a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=303">5:03</a> btw
üëèüëèüëè
Where is your hair
Get her, Jade.
This album is not trash‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs the melted goop left from trash on fire.
i don&#39;t care about kanye as a person and only care about his music in the same way i have amazon and don&#39;t care about the conditions of the workers enough to stop using it despite being of the opinion that it&#39;s bad. <br>(edit: you&#39;re here for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=305">5:05</a>)

Vultures is an 8/10
&quot;My bitch look like a reference&quot; is actually a unique compliment, we know Liberaltano keeps pussy DRY
You&#39;re just hating to keep your Jewish friends happy. ü§£
Don&#39;t care about any artists personal views, beliefs or actions. Judge their art solely by their art. Listening to black metal music doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m a satanist that burns churches or support the nsbm movement, I just think the music sounds cool lol.
I listened to the listening party and then the released album because I thought: oh maybe he took the time to project feelings other than antisemitism and loving to fock. But I was wrong. And also I am still shocked at how uncaracteristic his music has become. Donda and now this, they sound so alike and not made with what has built his career, wich was his charisma and his humor. Now everything is back to his vices taking over him and him not letting anyone help him because they might cause harm to what he believes is right and just. My only hope is that he stops releasing music or atleast take a long pause. Reconsider his actions, actually putting emphesis on his future away fro stardom. Until then, we still have lots of great albums that sound a thousand times better than what he released since 2020 to listen to. To wrap it up, I think you&#39;re right in your video.
womp womp
yeah im not gonna watch any more of your vids srry. i dont care if this makes me a bad person for listening to kanye, i like his music and thats my opinion. if you refuse to review his album, that means i will refuse to watch any more of your videos.
anthony is real one for this
Your wife left you lmao
Should have shaved first bro üòÇ
Mans trying to call ye‚Äôs attention üòÇüòÇüòÇ
I fall into a 4th category: Jewish, hate him as a person, like his sound. I completely understand your point in this video. Anyways, if he had called it ‚ÄúThe big vulture‚Äù it would have gotten a 0.
This man is the undeniable embodiment of a snow flake. Vegan, liberal, divorced (poor girl), supports cancel culture, and can&#39;t separate the art from the artist- you know the very thing you HAVE to do as a critic Imao
Lil Uzi Vert is my favorite rapper ‚õ∑

its funny how melon was clowning nicki minaj for going insane on twitter only to becoe her in the span of 2 weeks
who are you and why
This reeks of desperation. Yikes buddy
Does it need to have other lyrics to be reviewable? Or you just hate Ye
Does it need to have other lyrics to be reviewable? Or you just hate Ye
I agree with the things your saying but really do not like this video. I agree Kanye has done and said irredeemable things and shouldn&#39;t be let off the hook for such but this video is blatantly distasteful. Your a music reviewer. You said this at the beginning and even give your purposes for being such. Being a music reviewer you have two options . To cover a record on your platform or not cover a record on your platform. If you truly wanted to take a stand against Kanye cause you don&#39;t like him (which is perfectly understandable) you would not have uploaded this video which only draws more attention to him, better yet you wouldn&#39;t have listened to the album which you clearly did . Honestly this comes off like you don&#39;t care about taking a stand cause a person taking a stand doesn&#39;t tell people they are, they show it .
Unsubsubscribed what a dork
Average killer Mike fan
No way he&#39;s actually getting hate for this.
Mr soyano
10/10 with Kanye albums. First mbdtf, this. Melon is knockin it out the park. I literally haven‚Äôt listened to Kanye but this typical ass pandering video coupled with his track record now convinces me this is some of ye‚Äôs best work.
number one hater fantano nerd free palestine

The world before you reviewed it: üåç. The world After: üåç <br>no one cares for your opinion

Me thinking he would of actually reviewed the album üòî
Ok Grandpa
I think this will go south both ways...
just review the album it aint that deep
You a true sucka
In March 2018, Fantano told Polygon that he is a &quot;free speech purist.
If you can&#39;t review a musical work you are a failure as a critic
bro this video is supposed to be reviewing vultures not talking about how he‚Äôs antisemetic and his fan baseüò≠üò≠
Let me guess, it&#39;s another album you pretentious music shitters will call bad for like a year and then mysteriously down the line you&#39;ll start saying it was a challenging masterpiece that was under-appreciated when it came out. Critics who think they&#39;re better than the art they&#39;re reviewing need the arrogance bitch-slapped out of them. Nobody cares about politics.
aint no way he talking about wives üíÄ
what happened to separting the music the artist makes from the artist? why even make a video, for the revenue? just don‚Äôt review it then melon.
Youre going out sad
I would throw all the shit on Ty, but I just can‚Äôt bring myself to meat ride that hard.
The old melon has become tone deaf. I&#39;m the new Melon and I give this album 6.25/10.
What do fans have to do with the quality of an album?‚Ä¶

Didn‚Äôt change the shirt from his donda review NICE. Did she take all the clothes too?
who you think you are , kanye the king ,
15 year olds try not to be so fucking dumb challenge
Kanye meatriders are actually so hypocritical. They both defend antisemitism by telling you to separate the art from the artist and tell you to ignore the fact that the music sucks because they can&#39;t seem to understand that their idol is a complete fucking bozo.
youre bald

he should leave music, pivot to politics

Westies vs swifties
Album went number 1 sold 200 million in Yeezy products Shutup you bot
These comment sections always suck shit but holy fuck this one sucks. Grow the fuck up yall
Anthony Fantano try to give a mainstream artist a good rating because the music is good challenge
It sucks that Kanye&#39;s mental illness is getting to him the older he gets... bro is delusional. Haven&#39;t been a fan of Kanye since College Drop Out
Vice called, they want their smug hipster pseudo intellectualism back.

Womp womp shut up
I understand u but Carnival goes crazy üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è
Agree with this review, it completely sums up my feelings for this album.  Don&#39;t know why you would even want to listen to anything Kanye has to say when everything he&#39;s said for the last several years has been unintelligible ignorant nonsense.  The people trying to get all &quot;ethics in journalism&quot; in these comments are fundamentally dishonest and only care about ethics or art as far as they&#39;re tools to bludgeon others.  Everything Kanye has done for the last decade has been unethical but you draw the moral line at a halfhearted review?<br><br>Everyone, ESPECIALLY Kanye, is better off if we all just ignore him.  It&#39;s gross to see this machine built around observing a man&#39;s mental-health crisis, funded by ignorant young people who judge music by name-recognition, and to the misfortune of every person in his life who actually tries to support him. Tbh you should&#39;ve not posted a review at all but the fact that it made people this mad is kinda worth it.  Hope it makes at least one person reflect on the artists they choose to support.
Anthony will willingly and happily review people who talk and sing, (and have actually done) nonstop about murder, sex, drugs, beating women, and all sorts of other depravities. But as soon as it&#39;s antisemetic! That&#39;s where he draws the line. Can&#39;t say mean things about those folk!
Hey baldy, is the reason you&#39;re wearing that moustache, because you&#39;re cruising for ass, or is it to take away from the receding hairline (Which ain&#39;t working)üë®üèª‚Äçü¶≤üòÇ

Weakling! Kanye is the most listened artist in the world ü§°üòÇ
Will review artists like Young Thug who actually kill people but not Kanye. Hypocrisy at its best
Lol k
Based Fantano.
Regardless of all this gay discourse, the album was mid af
l
I‚Äôm Jewish and Kanye is my black panther
If it was called The College Vulture you would‚Äôve gave it a 10
to be honest. it&#39;s not a good album - like the mixing is astoundingly horrible for someone with so much money, let alone the absolutely squashed flat mastering on top of mess of instrumentation and vocals. It kinda hurts to listen to, especially loud
So he‚Äôll review albums from murders, rapist, and pedophiles but draws the line at talking about Jews. Then he has the audacity to call people who listen to Kanye‚Äôs albums psychos. SMH that‚Äôs crazy.
Just take away the &quot;un&quot; from unreviewable and you got REVIEWABLE!!! YAY!! ü•≥
I don&#39;t like fantano and I don&#39;t like the views that kanye has, but I find fantano sort of saying &quot;im morally superior to anyone who likes this album&quot; and thats stupid. For me while listening to vultures I thought the lyrics were a bit messed up to name drop columbine, but I remembered that in a slayer song they name drop aushwitz and in other death metal I listen to they sing about way worse. I think that it&#39;s hypocritical for fantano to say that he is superior when even he should have had the same realization as I did when he listens to rap about killing people and commiting crimes. I think that art is just an expression and shouldn&#39;t be taken as seriously to discredit it if it is &quot;messed up&quot;. I personally didn&#39;t like vultures overall, but it had some redeeming qualities and I think it should be treated as fairly as other albums from ACTUAL criminals that he has reviewed.
The thing is you people always want someone to fit into your own agenda or mold or perspective he is free meaning that if he was experimenting through the sound it might hit it might miss but that&#39;s authentically who he is as an artist part 1
Time to hang up the gloves Anthony you lost the message.
Fantano knows he can‚Äôt speak positively about the album because his fan base will eat him alive. It sucks to see dude put himself in a corner where the only way out is to pull semantics and label it as unreviewable lol üòÇ
a lot of famous classic albums received bad reviews when they were released. Wish you were here had some pretty negative response from critics back then. I think you might change your mind on the music if you actually gave it a chance Anthony. I thought that a musically intelligent person like yourself would appreciate this album and separate the artist from the product. What a shame.
&quot;Music critic&quot; spends an ungodly amount of time talking about about the person not the music. Lmao trash
its insane to me that people listen to bald man
very antithetical of you Anthony, very Hegelian response to Kanye fans
Stop being annoying fantini. You&#39;ve literally reviewed burzum&#39;s music which is made by an actual self-proclaimed neo nazi and esoteric hitlerist üíÄüíÄ <br><br>Don&#39;t pretend it has anything to do with kanye&#39;s &quot;inflammatory&quot; remarks---you just have personal beef with him.
Tate Mcrae deserves a 6
it just came out lil bro
As a Jew it genuinely makes me sad that I can‚Äôt listen to his music without getting pissed off. I used to be one of those ‚Äúoh he‚Äôs just crazy‚Äù but I just can‚Äôt do it anymore. Every time he opens his mouth I think about what happened to my ancestors and how he justified a literal genocide. And it makes me even more pissed to see the ‚Äúwho cares the album is fire‚Äù comments. Keep standing up for what‚Äôs right Anthony. People out there appreciate it
never talk againüî•üî•üî•üî•
Don‚Äôt worry!! We already knew your opinion before the album came out üôÇ
Stop waffling
Reminder that Fantano has done Burzum album reviews, a band led by a literal Nazi who has burnt down churches and synagogues and murdered a man for being homosexual.<br><br>Fantano is a smug hack telling you what you want to hear for engagement. He has no actual moral backbone.
bro gave peppa pigs album an actual rating over this‚Ä¶
I like it because it‚Äôs catchy
your wifes boyfriend thought this album was an 8
You rating nazi music but not kanye. Type a bald clown that gave sexy red an 8ü§°
*YAWN*...how about you review the actual album bro?
Libthony Raltano angwee
Jewsthony Sucktano
Clown can review people talking about murdering, grape and gang related shit but Kanye is too far lmfao
Kanye lost everything
It was a good album, I‚Äôm not worried about the semantics
rappers rap about murdering people and actually doing it but ohhh noooo kanye insult jewish people, now that&#39;s a line eh? you can murder n rap about it but he second ur anti semitic its a huge deal? Like stfu. I dont agree with what he&#39;s saying but dawg he said slavery was a choice but oh no insult jewish people?  we gotta cancel him for that
Now let&#39;s hear your Palestine take Melon.
BIG Reddit mod energy. Cornthony Balltano
TLOP was the last decent Kanye album, since then he‚Äôs continually been on the decline.
Why tf do ppl still watch FantanoüòÇüòÇüòÇ
jew
I used to love Melon but god damn he&#39;s stubborn
I was a huge Kanye fan up until Donda, and from then on it&#39;s become more and more clear that Kanye thrives off the attention of being crazy and it rejects his past of actually standing up for real issues. When he called out George Bush on live TV or when he stood up for single moms on college dropout. Really sad to see such an iconic figure burning his reputation for clout
Rappers talk about robbing, killing, stealing, and taking advantage of women all the time. Double standard?
Imo Yeezus was unreviewable but somehow that got reviewed? Separate the artist from the art fantano and do your job ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§£
Can Cal Chuchesta review it?
lol bummer I won&#39;t ever be checking out any of your other videos based off this bullshit
reviewers are useless, frustrated and talentless
I‚Äôve been saying this, Kanye is the most overrated self absorbed douche bag in the music industry.
please end it now!
Back to me is my shit. I love that song. What are you talking about?!
Kanye is trash anyway
Talk about not being able to separate the art from the artist. You don‚Äôt have to understand the artist to feel sorrow, passion and beauty for the art itself. It‚Äôs actually counterproductive when you do know the artist. Because you create biases. After all that is what Art is. If it does not make you feel sorrow, passion and beauty it is not art.  It‚Äôs just entertainment. if anyone ever asks you what Art is you say, it is anything that is created by the mind and a hand of an artist, that‚Äôs make you feel sorrow, passion and beauty. Otherwise, it‚Äôs just entertainment. You don‚Äôt need to know anything about the artist life, or what they went through all that is extra bull crap. Real Art does not require you to know about the artist life and background to feel or see the art itself.  Sometimes it can be a plus to what you are already feeling about the art. But it is not a requirement or needed in anyway. Again it can create biases to where you cannot separate the observer from the observed which is yourself, and the artist from the art.
think you&#39;re wrong about the fans bro, most people just like how it sounds. similar to suburb white kids pumping drill music most of them don&#39;t even pretend to rep the life they just like the sound
Kanye been trash since ye
ur dumb
doesnt review the album cus he doesnt know what he would tell his jewish friends/viewers is hilarious‚Ä¶ jokes write themselves. just do ur job melon.

You‚Äôve reviewed murders but the crazy dude who said some wacko stuff on the internet is too much.
I figured it out. He actually likes the album and is mad that he does.<br><br>I hate this album. It‚Äôs awesome.
So tired of this
bro the type of guy to say &quot;The bell doesn&#39;t dismiss you, I do!&quot;
fantano turned into the corniest fucking youtuber, i never could have imagined honestly.
reviewing an album doesn‚Äôt make you a nazi
I can guarantee you have never given anyone &quot;Pause&quot; on anything... You are not insightful or enlightening.
The album fire we don‚Äôt care about the bs you sayin
First listen and I can say, you doing to much. Album had good moments. Somebody paid you to post this. Lame
signal thy virtue bald jesus of music critics
I think this guy is just mad because Kanye dared to call out his people.
Kind of hypocritical. I don&#39;t listen to Kanye&#39;s music, but you review Playboi Carti, Bobby Shmurda and R. Kelly. This is the same kind of arguments I see on X when people get mad about how our cell phones and clothing are made, but do absolutely nothing to try and fix the issues.
Thats right
Worlds biggest drake and kendrick meat rider
And you‚Äôre supposed to be a music critic. How about you separate the art from the artist you amateur.
DO YOU ONLY COMPLAIN??
Bald
But it was peak I don‚Äôt care bro
but he reviews other bad ppls music all the time so what the dif??? and he still made the vid. so he got a lot of views off this so it feels like he made it for clout and traffic/views

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=44">0:44</a> You do realize the source of these behaviors are a result of his illness??? Bipolar is an incredibly serious illness 2 have to live with. Up there with schizophrenia. Its always &quot;Mental health matters&quot; until someone with bipolar has a manic episode. Or a schizophrenic person has a public freakout. A lot of these claims were made when he wasn&#39;t in the right mind and were incredibly self sabotaging and impulsive. Call me a meat rider, but I just know how it is cuz I&#39;m diagnosed bipolar 1.
If you ever feel like you have bad music taste just remember that Ice Cubes Laugh Now Cry Later has the same score on albumoftheyear as Vultures 1
the album was very good
Lmaoooo bro was big mad like I understand but beautiful big titty butt naked women just don‚Äôt fall out the sky ya know
But Graduation though
Regardless, even if he were to ACTUALLY review it, he wouldnt like it. Nothing from Kanyes new album stands out. I will die in this hill
that comment left by that user with the ‚Äúblonde‚Äù pfp is the kanye/kendrick/carti fandom in a nutshell
Bro has a hitler like mustache
The hypocrisy is wild. You have no problem reviewing a literal serial killer who killed 23 people but when it comes to someone who said anti-Semitic things you finally decide to use your moral compass.
&quot;Don&#39;t make me go beast modeüëπ&quot; type ahh stareüíÄüíÄüíÄ
The whole calling someone racist or anti-semitic just to quiet them is played out and does not work anymore. I do find it funny though that this only happens to the people that speak the truth.
Tone Anthony, tone.
Thank you.

did a democrat pay u to make this?
We need the scores man.. how will we know what to think now?
i feel bad for those who watches you for music review
Ive been a fan of yours and Kanyes for a long time, but this video was nothing but self important virtue signalingüòÇ just don‚Äôt review it? Or post a quick tweet saying you won‚Äôt review his music anymoreüòÇ With all due respect, do you go outside your bubble ever? What Kanye said is a mild version of what you‚Äôll hear about any group of people, anywhere in America. With that being said, that album is a 5.2/10 (from a Kanye fan) I may not agree with 85% of what the dude says, but the album had a solid tone it was just all over the place and it would‚Äôve been better had he not rushed it out and shortened the track list.
If it was called Mad Vultury melon would have given it a 10
He‚Äôs feeling a strong delusional to a light antisemite on this one
I&#39;m out here working just trying to do enough for me and my family to survive, keep the roof over our heads and food in our bellies and if I&#39;m not also dedicating enough emotional energy to be outraged by Kanye West I&#39;m now imposing ignorance onto myself. Bro get a fuckin clue anyone who is mad about Kanye fuckin west is incredibly privileged.
It was laugh out loud bad. Was it trolling? ü§î
Shut up liberal. Who cares what Kanye does, who cares what any artist does... is the music good or not? That&#39;s your only job bro.
sorry fantano you can&#39;t pull of a &quot;i wont review this&quot; like avgn did
Fantano trying so hard to be provocative ..... GETS THE PEOPLE GOING
remember when he said he didnt care if burzum is racist and burned down churches hed still listen to him. nobody cares until the minority affected is white
you still have time to delete this
I&#39;m really thankful of Anthony Fantano for introducing me to amazing music for almost like a decade now, but I think this take may be out of touch, at least in my opinion. The internet zeitgeist isn&#39;t indicative of mass opinion, and I fear people get manipulated by it. I have always loved most of Kanye&#39;s music and I couldn&#39;t care less what ridiculous arc he&#39;s going through at any point, he&#39;s literally insane, and that is fine. In a way, I even think that is why his art is so great. Even Van Gogh cut his own ear off. <br>Just take everything with a grain of salt. He is not as a powerful figure as Fantano attributes him to be, he does not change people&#39;s minds that were not already leaning a certain way to begin with. Neither is Fantano capable of doing that. We shouldn&#39;t hold any popular figure to those standards. I believe that to be unfair, for it assumes people are just blind and too easily manipulated, which I don&#39;t agree with.<br>I do understand Fantano may feel pressured, since he is a public figure after all, to toe the line and not upset too many people (like he said in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=222">3:42</a>), but I still don&#39;t agree with this.<br>Having said all of this, even though I think Fantano&#39;s opinion is silly, which I believe come from his political and geographical background, I will still watch and appreciate his videos. I can separate his opinions from his work. I just wish he could do the same.
was this a review?
So let me get this right you&#39;ve reviewed albums made by actual murderers and drug dealers who perpetuate violence within their own community. But Kanye said bad things about Jewish people wtf is wrong with you. I get not wanting to do it but the hypocrisy is wild.
Ur a clown
Remember when you reviewed a band of Neo-Nazis?
Added Back to me to the playlist halfway through the song then Gibbs verse came on üòÆ‚Äçüí®
I&#39;m glad fantano said basically my exact problem with Kanye&#39;s new music; you can&#39;t separate the art from the artist if he&#39;s LITERALLY putting that shit in the music, and I&#39;m sick of Kanye stans trying to gaslight anyone who actually uses reason
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs review Kaynes new album‚Äù<br>Only talks about his drama
I Strongly Agree with this
Can&#39;t wait till Trump walks back into the white house in 2025 with Ye by his side.
Category 4: People who love who Kanye was and listened to his crazy takes with a sigh yet can&#39;t give up on the music because he&#39;s a genius and they recognize how probably all celebrities do terrible things just they keep it behind closed doors so reluctantly they still put their airpods in on the day the music drops and listened start to finish.
This video wont age well.
its pretty a pretty mid album honestly. no real stand out tracks. &quot;paid&quot; is the least mid song
do your research on why Kanye is doing this and it‚Äôll make perfect sense Anthony
So just a Rant about Kanye
Kanye fans all share the same brain cell
Fantano uses his platform very wiselyüëç
Such a fucking high horse. Nothing you said was even really wrong, this is just reeking of millennial aunt i unfollowed on facebook
EXACTLY, you couldn&#39;t have worded this better. People need to grow up from garbage music that spews profanity and people praising such garbage, horrible for the state of mind.
Number one in 109 countries a new record for collab album ye holds the record for solo album too donda was number one in 152 countries. Ye spreading love

Hey Anthony do you still chat with Sam?
8.5 /10 or 7/10 minimum
You couldn&#39;t review vultures cause of Kanye saying things about Jewish people. Okay. What about goblin by Tyler the creator? Didn&#39;t like what kanve said about his wife calling her a reference what about  &quot;Kim&quot; by Eminem? You too do not have your own opinion. You go off what the media Said.
10/10 album.
bro how many bitches made you hit now that you&#39;re so woke?
To pimp an antisemite 9/10
the examples used for &quot;anti-semetic&quot; lyrics are all mostly out of pocket for arts sake. the lyrics of KING, from my perspective, are about how the public percieves him, with him saying that even past all of that he is the king. don&#39;t get me started on the line from vultures. that was definitely to get media attention.
Goes to show where Melon&#39;s true allegiance is
Damn it&#39;s over for Kanye now.<br><br>What a moron.

How‚Äôs your marriage going, Fantano?
L
And here I was expecting to hear an album review, instead witnessing a &quot;let&#39;s share our feelings&quot; session. Welp, unsubscribe it is
This is rap. This is the genre where idols like 2Pac talk about killing people in their songs, and people listen to it. But I guess someone who has harmed a community because of things they have said isn&#39;t cool anymore because of a new agenda. I could understand not enjoying the content of Problematic and King, where Kanye takes a stance on his situation, but it is completely ignorant as a full-time reviewer to call this &quot;unreviewable.&quot;
Jesus Christ, the Ye kiddies are still going. This has to be the biggest fanbase hissyfit in hip hop history.
L
I think he should have just not reviewed it without making a fuss about it. It feels like this welcomes controversy and attention which is what people like Kanye and the former President want. Their narcissism is a bottomless pit and nothing will ever change either of them or make them think about their bad behavior. They‚Äôre also always gonna be surrounded by enablers that defend them. We all have to make a choice about whether to listen to Kanye‚Äôs music and I think Fantano could set a better example just being like nope, not reviewing it for ethical reasons. Next video.
I rlly liked problematic and carnival
Melon says its unreviewable and then goes on to review it in the same video

Review What Now by Brittney Howard.
Bro never talks this passionate about other rappers talking about killing, robbing, selling drugs, glorifying violence, fornication, etc etc‚Ä¶. But say something about Jews and it‚Äôs the end of the world.
That&#39;s the stare of a man who&#39;s looked into the abyss, and the abyss looked back. Never have i seen such a fall from grace than a once goat level legend like Kanye being reduced to Nick Fuentes nazi hype man
Bro definitely likes Elvis Presley
You couldn&#39;t be anymore hateable
if this was called to pimp a vulture it would have gotten a 10
Wow never seen Kanye derangement syndrome.
We get it. Kanye is a fucked up person. It&#39;s hard to separate the art from the artist because most of the art is a direct representation of the artist. The main problem with this is since you cant separate the art from the artist people will follow the artist hence the three types of fans you listed. The album has a few bright spots but majority is slopped together or just not very good. I understand why this album is unreviewable and Kanye as a human being is a terrible person regardless if he meant the things he said. He needs mental help immediately. But alas the album had a few good parts but im gonna just listen to old kanye
Bro really doesn‚Äôt think people can just like the album lol
Not to be that guy, who by the way also does not and never has been much of a Kanye fan personally. To review his album with attitude of he is what he is, while not doing it for seemingly anyone else seems odd to me. How many rappers have you reviewed killed someone, been a part of the drug and gun movement in America or abroad. Is a registered sex offender, or has clear allegations of pedophilia or even domestic issues with partners or spouses. You can sit here pick and choose who you want to speak out against. And yes we all agree Kanye is one to speak out against. But why not go after the others in the music industry? I‚Äôm genuinely asking, where is the headlines and outrages for this and that for countless other artists doing disgusting shit.
Couldn&#39;t agree more. I lost faith about Kanye when he gave the Lex interview and started getting angry at him. <br><br>But here&#39;s my objective review for anyone who cares: <br><br>Half of Vultures is unlistenable. <br><br>HOODRAT / BACK TO ME / KEYS TO MY LIFE are objectively bad songs.<br><br>DO IT / TALKING / FUK SUMN / VULTURES / PROBLEMATIC / KING aren&#39;t an enjoyable listen. None of the soundscaping Kanye showed on TLOP and MBDTF. <br><br>I did like PAID / PAPERWORK / BURN / CARNIVAL / DON&#39;T DIE. Honestly, BEG FORGIVENESS is fine but very of-a-time, KING is actually alright and not too misguided imo.<br><br>This album is more forgettable than Donda, and at a time where he needed to produce a Twisted Fantasy or YANDHI.
As a long time Kanye hater I&#39;ve always considered his music good but its just like impossible to separate the artist from the art now
Mogolico
Yet another political video. Try reviewing music again sometime ü•±
I disagree with a lot of your reviews, but I&#39;ve never been actually dissapointed with one like this. By the end of the video it almost felt like you just were clowning people who liked the music. <br>I can understand how you don&#39;t like the ignorance of hip-hop heads to what he&#39;s done, and I actually agree with you there. People sometimes seem to act like he was actually a normal dude who has done nothing, but that&#39;s just how it is sadly.<br>Even so, most of the review is literally just saying how Kanye is a bad person. I can see why you wouldn&#39;t want to review and make people want to listen to someome who has done lots of fucked up stuff recently, but if that&#39;s the case, don&#39;t review it at all. Besides, you reviewed fucked up rappers in the past, so I think it&#39;s hypocrite of you. It just feels like you are just severe of Kanye&#39;s actions and no one else. <br>Also, I might be confused, but did you just say Kanye fans are psychos, nihilist, or parasocial weirdos? Most of Kanye fans who defend him are just ignorant people who are yet not mature enough to recognize the mistakes of their idol (mostly teenagers I suppose), MAYBE this counts as parasocial, but I&#39;m sure they are not nihilist or psychos (atleast a majority).
Bro out here finally realizing the majority of the people who watch these are teenagers and this dude making vast over arching opinions on things without any self awareness that his entire way of making a living is pandering to teenagers on the internet. Evil, judemental, racist, homophobic, misogynistic, etc all in rap music but this dude is targeting kanye because he‚Äôs rich as fuck And influential. If jpeg mafia shit into a microphone for 4 hours he would give it a 6
you&#39;re a fraud lil bro
ANTHONY SPEAKING FACTS
Yall all loved it when he shit on Lil Pumps latest album which was actually cool.
ü§°
I‚Äôm partly Jewish (ethnically) and even I feel kinda gross by the things that Kanye has said. I feel like there‚Äôs a lot of Jewish people who will listen to the record, not love it, but will be scared to show how they truly feel about it because of how unhinged some of Kanye‚Äôs fans are. I don‚Äôt have to like something that someone else likes just to make them feel validated. If you think the album isn‚Äôt great, say the album isn‚Äôt great. I think it‚Äôs not very good, though there are some cool bits and pieces from it. I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs another artist out there with as unhinged fans as Kanye fans. Seeing them bring up Anthony‚Äôs divorce pretty much unprompted was the first eyebrow raiser, and then the constant berating on Twitter is almost as funny as it is sad. This is a rapper that once made some of the best rap in its history, but now is parading around a shell of a woman who I have literally never heard say a single word from and some awfully mixed and seemingly thrown together garbage. Me being ethnically Jewish shouldn‚Äôt be a factor in the discussion on whether I like a song or not, but when the lyrics directly mention Jews, I kinda have to take that into account. I hope Kanye starts to take his medication, gets someone that can talk some sense into him (perhaps Jay-Z), and understand that he is not a god and is a flawed person.
lets make this the most disliked video üôÇ
You sound like a professional victim.
Weak
Came here just to downvote. This dude sucks
You know what‚Äôs that this fantano, the body‚Äôs upcoming album with this artist named dis fig , a noise artist. Give their new singles a whirl pwetty pwease

I like Kanye for the beats he makes I don‚Äôt like the things he says sometimes but he‚Äôs good at what he does üî•
this culdve been To Pimp A Butterfly quality and still unreviewable cause he hates kanye that much
People on tiktok glazing tf out of kanye for this album, this ish is garbo
The song ‚ÄúBack to Me‚Äù obviously made Fantano mad
Anthony stop being a bozo
since youtube hid the dislkes im here to tell you i disliked your video
I‚Äôm confused you think Kanye did something wrong?
What is bro rambling aboutüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
This mf looks like a 2011 hipster why?

It‚Äôs gonna be so funny when the second ‚Äúunreviewable 2‚Äù just is for Vultures 2
should have named it vulture death grips 1
Why Ty$ instead of Kid Cudi? ü§î
This review is not very sigma. Kanye clearly expressed his internal sigma with this album. I am now unsusbscribing. This is not¬†<br>how you should be a sigma mewer. You watch your back from me and the sigma fam.
‚ÄúWho ain‚Äôt cash a check off my name‚Äù
He‚Äôs right üòÇ shit is so ass

I liked it
What a convenient time to like Jews lol
thank you for reviewing so i don‚Äôt have to listen to this garbage lol
U sure ur not Jewish?
Bro got mad as soon as the first beat dropped lmao video coulda been 30 seconds long and just said &quot;I hate Kanye so I hate his music&quot;
The artist and art separation only comes up when fans are trying to defend their idols bad behavior. No artist will ever separate themselves from their art.
but he made gradutation
You review murderers and feminazi on a daily basis but antisemitism is were you draw the line?
thanks fatanio for the 7 minute mald some really quality content here
I didn&#39;t dislike this album as much as Fantano but I will say that there were some really bad songs, most of the songs were mid, and the best songs were worse versions of stuff Kanye&#39;s done before.  It&#39;s gotta be a 2/5 for me and I don&#39;t really understand the people saying it&#39;s great.
Just review the fucking album holy shit it‚Äôs not that deep
thank you for this, anthony.
How can you be so stupid about music?
This man has the worst takes oat he‚Äôs just a Kanye hater
You had a lot to say about this album than a lot of  albums you actually reviewed. Made me wonder why you made the video but I know reviewing is beneficial for you in some way so..
essentially, you cannot listen to or enjoy any of the album if you are one of those 3 people
Album is still #1 across the board in Israel since it dropped.
This is the same guy that gave MBDTF a 6 so im not even suprised
I didn‚Äôt attempt to buy his latest album even his album is at good price. üëÄ cuz I honestly dont like his latest album. I prefer his old music.
you reviewed like 4 songs dude
You could&#39;ve just said the album was trash bro üò≠ some of us don&#39;t wanna glaze the millionaire
imagine siding with the jews over YE
Beautiful big titty butt naked melons giving kanye a fair review just dont fall out the sky you know.
So now you won‚Äôt review an album coz you disagree with the content???<br><br>Five million Christians on a ride towards us<br>Oh, I slaughtered the bunch with one single hit<br>(With my spear)<br>Five million woman so alone in the night<br>Oh, I had them all satisfied profusely<br>(Every night by myself)<br><br>These lyrics are from a Darkthrone song <br><br>I guess you wouldn‚Äôt review something like this coz‚Ä¶ what are you gonna say to your Christian friends‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. üòè
Anti-semites coping so fucking hard lmao, sorry but Anthony is right
0 backbone on this prick
Odd takes from someone with Burzum album reviews. Corny af lmao
grouping Ye fans in those 3 catergories is kinda fucked up. ngl. like as if none of us just like how his music sounds.
6.5/10 for me
he got what he wanted though, views
Bro will review murders, arsonist, anyone even he said himself he doesn‚Äôt care if they‚Äôre racist. He just tells people what the want no back bone
Seriously don&#39;t get why people get so bothered by someone else&#39;s personal opinion üíÄ he&#39;s not stating facts, just his opinion, guys
Would‚Äôve been a 10 if it was called ‚Äúvulturemind‚Äù
You make me feel bad about myself and suicidal
OMG bestie thank you ^^ for being the internets comfiest and safest music reviewer :3
ur ears are turned off anthony this album bops
&quot;Hi, everyone! Anthony Fantano here! Basically, this channel is passionately dedicated to reviewing music&quot;
The same guy that gave Sexyy Red a 8/10‚Ä¶ <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>keep that in mind..
Ladies and gentlemen this is what being on the wrong side of history looks like.
I stopped looking up to Kanye when I turned 30.
wait so this is why everyone&#39;s so mad
Challenge: Actually review music instead of bringing politics into it(Impossible for people who look like pedophiles)
good on you fantano
God I wish the dislike counter was still visible
Oh you a hater hater lol
So its a Banger. Nice review .
Yea ur doing this for views, could&#39;ve easily given a bad review with a rating of 1/10 or whatever
Confused as to why there is a monologue of what Kanye has said in the media? Just review the fukin album melon boy.
Biased. skewed by political noise. Emotional. Giving it a 1 is proof.
Melon showing how hypocritical he is with this review.
u are genuinely the most hypocritical mf on the internet. mr high and mighty pc nerd. you wonder why u get the hate that u get, the trash album reviews aside.
same person gave sexyy redd a 8 ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Fantano your wrong broüòä
Ye fans going crazy in the comments hahahahaha he is kinda right Ye fans are the most insane fans in history, y&#39;all think this man is some kind of a God lmfao üòÇ
83K Dislikes
Yes bro we get it you‚Äôre a good person now can you review the albums
and i thought kid cudi was impressive for the only artist to get a 0 and a 10 from fantanoüò≠
Can‚Äôt believe I used to think bro was non-biasedüíÄ. My guy is HURTTT
How u gona criticise ye&#39;s antisemetism and say you can&#39;t separate art from artist when westside gunn has a catalogue dedicated to hitler and you not only reviewed his music but hosted him on ur channelüòÇlmao
You say this yet justify rape and murder of Jewish people because of the place they live?
you piss me off
this is the same guy that gave sexy red a 10 out of 10üòÇ
Cry. Album of the century
Someone&#39;s political beliefs and their art should not be intertwined when critiquing them. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ
Get this goon outa here
womp womp
The way Ye makes Melon seethe is the best reason to give this album a listen.
find god
Love that you‚Äôre saying all this. I don‚Äôt understand how so many people say it‚Äôs good. I‚Äôve had Kanye as my #1 most listened artist a couple years ago, but this Album is absurdly bad on too many levels.
I agree with this take.
If it was called Mr. Vulture And The Big Antisemites you would have given it a 10
definition of selective outrage
If it was called &quot;To Pimp a Vulture&quot; you would&#39;ve given it a 10
what a looser
Rare Fantano w
Well said! I appreciate you Anthony!
It‚Äôs crazy how this would‚Äôve gotten an easy 10 if ye had been pro-Israel√≠
ugh..okayy u the king, Burger King üòî
Shut up and review Revolutionary Vol. 2
The sheer stupidity of the Paid verse is what makes it for me one of my favourite recent Kanye verses. It&#39;s like poopity scoop 2.
Major hater üòÇ
What a loser
Fantano: furiously explaines why this album is unreviewable because of antisemitism (still reviews it mid video and reacted to it on stream like dude are you ok?üò≠)<br><br><br>Also Fantano talking about Burzum:<br><br>‚ÄûI don‚Äôt give a shit about him burning churches, I don‚Äôt care if he murdered a guy, I don‚Äôt really care if he‚Äôs racist. If he comes out with an album in the future that I find interesting, I will welcome it with open arms‚Äú<br><br>Yes I know that this review is over 10 years old but keep in mind that he was already pushing 30 back then so he can‚Äôt really say that he was young and dumb lmao. Ye is literally an angel compared to the other dude and even if he changed his opinion:<br><br>He‚Äôs also to this day still objectively reviewing albums by straight serial killers who brag about their crimes in their lyrics, to a point were you can‚Äôt separate the art from the artist anymore. That was his main argument against Kanye. <br><br>Ok rapping serial killers might be a extreme example but what‚Äôs about rappers who glorify drug abuse to their young fanbase? Or sexism? 90% of the albums you review are full of misogyny and sexism.<br>Is this morally acceptable for you?<br><br>So he only seems to have a problem with musicians being terrible people/doing terrible things as long they aren‚Äôt aren‚Äôt political or Kanye. Yet he can still post 30 videos per month on various platforms discussing whatever Kanye is doingüíÄ Dude that dude is partially paying your bills at this point <br><br>Very weird moral compass to say the least. And yes I listen to all of these people but I‚Äòm just here for the music and not the one acting up.
He spends most of the video arguing ethics instead of music then uses some joke lines or a line talking about how the media labels him as proof that his music is ‚Äúanti-Semitic‚Äù like if you aren‚Äôt going to spend more than a minute talking about the music then don‚Äôt make a music review and skip it. I‚Äôm not saying Kanye is a good guy but dear god even watching your reaction stream was cringe because you tried your hardest to dislike it at every turn. Sexy red‚Äôs music didn‚Äôt compare to vultures even when you compare what each was hoping to accomplish. You need progressive music or music about rap norms like gang banging or selling dope to be propped but god forbid you didn‚Äôt go head first into giving a nonbiased review because Kanye was antisemitic.
This was one of Kanye‚Äôs weaker projects and you still couldn‚Äôt even make something as half as good in your lifetime. Sit the fuck down
you have reviewed way worse people knowingly of what they‚Äôve done. you are a clown
huge L, should have just not uploaded anything
So why cover it? Cover the music or move on.
Wow it‚Äôs almost like this guys gets paid to hate oh wait he does

Nah you didn‚Äôt care when it was von actually taking lives from people. Shut up

i don&#39;t agree with you
Jewish Overloads are heated! His name Ye
I miss the old fantano
If Ye wants to be treated with respect he should start treating others with that respect. He was my favourite artist of all time but making life harder for Jews because you had a bad divorce is fucking stupid. Unless he completely 180s and has a come to jesus moment, there&#39;s no coming back for him.
He hurt your feelings üò≠
biased
no fantano number? quit punching kanyes people down, fantano
This blockhead literally gives 7+ ratings to rappers who glorify gang violence, rape, ‚Äúgettin‚Äô dat paper maneeee‚Äù, and every degenerative practice that causes the disintegration of society.<br><br>But nooo, can‚Äôt call out a certain group of people who literally hold a massive disproportionate amount of power in the West for their population size, all the while, using that power to divide and conquer the masses.<br><br>The fact that there‚Äôs this huge taboo around pointing out ANYTHING bad about the J**s (I can‚Äôt even type the word without the risk of this comment being deleted) is the literal proof that they have massive power, and use that power to censor any criticism.<br><br>‚ÄúTo learn who rules over you, simply find out who you are not allowed to criticize‚Äù
This guy really fell of crazy after this and the sexy red stuff
My man is in his forties talking about an other mans wife like she‚Äôs nothing, she‚Äôs an architect for Yeezys since 2020, who‚Äôs the misogynist, he‚Äôs got to separate the art from the things the artist said outside music, I‚Äôm 18 btw and I can still enjoy this it‚Äôs like a 7 or 8/10 not Kanye‚Äôs best but good/great album, favorite track rn: keys to my life and is very underated, ofc paid, fuk sumn and carnival are club bangers ;) still funny seeing Fantano going at Kanye‚Äôs and there‚Äôs still 2 or 3 albums coming hahaha
It‚Äôs unreviewable bc it‚Äôs a good Kanye album
What‚Äôs offensive about being a reference?
HOODRAT is so good. My fav song on the album
Kanye burned away $3.4 billion just to become an irl /pol/ troll. Because he doesn&#39;t like people. And his divorce was totally not his fault. Embarrassing.
Fantanos just a political nut now art not artist
why did we give this man a platform
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=248">4:08</a> that would relate to all the gangsta/drill/murder rap you‚Äôve covered and praised, which is usually has victims behind the music.  I don‚Äôt get this stance‚Ä¶ This vid just seems like virtue signaling to the group with the strongest victim currency.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=185">3:05</a> you can say this about literally any interest in the world, what an annoying ass video
haven&#39;t watched anything from Anthony in years. Glad to see he&#39;s still virtue signaling after that meme page he made that got him into hot water. Don&#39;t worry buddy - we know you&#39;re a GoodGuy‚Ñ¢
If it was called Ridge Wallet Vultures you would have given it an 8
do not worry bald man. the album fucking sucks. next question.
Who hurt you man? This is honestly just sad, clearly hearing what you wanna hear. Stop reviewing hip hop albums all together man. No one respects you at all in that community other than white people.
Shalom
Statistically, so many people are enjoying the album and listening over and over, so are you saying that every one of them is delusional? If they were pretending to like it, that wouldn&#39;t have happened. Most of this video is you whining about people you argue with in your chat and not the actual album. Pretending that anyone who disagrees with you is just one of those people is such a lazy argument. You ingore all the blatantly great production ideas and verses, criticize a few lines and samples, call it a day, then wonder why people don&#39;t take you seriously.
fantano too damn PC
DORK
but he made graduation
agreed man. seems like kanye has just dug himself into an insurmountable hole, and he can&#39;t repeat the redemptive arc of twisted fantasy, its a completely new era and hes touched on much more serious subject matter, and the world isn&#39;t going to pantomine around his narrative. the die hard fans need to start criticizing him fairly, like this video, and kanye needs to get therapy, couple&#39;s therapy, time alone with a few loved ones and just go into a little retirement for a few years and heal. if he does make a next move musically, it should be something thematically similar to big steppers. i can see what he&#39;s trying to do, keep up the drama, the marketing, the hype because he wants to keep up the thrill of being the &quot;biggest&quot; and best from his 30&#39;s and distract from the divorce. it just feels like a midlife crisis of the highschool quarterback who is starting to lose everything and wants to relive the glory. he&#39;s honestly given enough art to this world to rest on his laurels, i just want him to get better and chill with his kids, maybe pop up for a feature every now and then as a treat like andre 3k.

lotta lame pearl clutching here
Divorced ü´µ
Crazy how this low-T and exhausted babysitter still has a channel. &quot;Know your audience&quot; I guess.
If it was called to pimp a vulture you would&#39;ve given it a 10
Fontana looks like he‚Äôs repressing his homosexual urges more and more with each video , be gay melon we love you
3 types of kanye fans... or the 4th one, where we aren&#39;t terminally online and invested in twitter politics and just like the music.
So basically a light 6
Don‚Äôt care but this guys opinion is hot ass
if this was called &quot;to pimp a vulture&quot; he would give it a 10
ü•±
Can anyone let me know the dislikes on this vid? It would be much appreciated.
Soyjak reviews kanye new album
After seeing all the Ye stans melt down about this review I thought I was in for some clownery. But nah Fantano was going easy
you love it you just dont wanna say it
Never do a review again üíÄ
L take
im just commenting to agree with all the comments saying that you will review an album by someone who has killed people but not kanye, makes absolutely no sense
Bro I agree with almost everything this man says about Kanye but at some point if you are going to run a music reviewing channel you should probably review the music
I miss the old kanye
without all the fuss about kanye&#39;s character and tendencies, this album just sucks lmfao
boooooooooo. you suck.
Rappers: glorify rape, crime, violence, etc<br><br>Fantano: &quot;i feel like a strong 8 on this one ü§ì&quot;<br><br>Rapper: has a different political and controversial opinion cucktano doesnt share<br><br>Fantano:
Just no.
‚ÄúIm not mad im just disappointed‚Äù ahh stare
Reminder that Fantano has done Burzum album reviews, a band led by a literal Nazi who has burnt down churches and synagogues and murdered a man for being homosexual
Not everyone likes ye but not everyone matters, cry some more
Paid and Fade are on two different planets whadduyumeannn
Damn melonhead doing anything possible to not give Ye any flowers ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
Typical Fantano L!
this is wild.
Another dumb biased take from someone who literally reviewed Burzum material. Total hypocrite piece of shit.
For some reason recently I‚Äôve been seeing hate on the media of Fantanos review of this album. And I‚Äôm just saying if you come from his PERSPECTIVE and actually consume his thought process on the album you‚Äôll understand why it‚Äôs considered unreviewable. And ngl if you listen to this garbage on a daily basis then idk man üò≠
I agree with everything u said here but you did call this unbelievable then do a review of it
&quot;I am walter hartwell white&quot; stare üíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ‚ò†‚ò†
I found the issue with this guy. He&#39;s just quirkmaxxing trying to be as quirky as possible and deviating from the &quot;norm&quot;.
idubbbz dad
cant believe i just watched this clown seethe
Damn the Ye fans are on the Twitterbot setting üòÇ these roasts are  awful
BBTWDJFOTSYK , How Does A Someone not like that bar ??
Bro sounds so salty üòÇ
This dude really made me go back and give Vultures another chance üòÇ
wait till u realize spazzing on jews isn‚Äôt antisemitism since they are not the only semites but they claim the title to thier selves only , so they can use the antisemitism card whenever u say anything about themüòÇüòÇ
No issues reviewing albums from literal killers who brag about it tho
The current Jews of today come from the line of Ashkenaz they aren‚Äôt the real Jews of the Bible.
It was that good it was unreviwable üòÇ
fantano L
Well, he ain&#39;t lying. I agree with fantano. But happy for jpegmafia produce some track with his hero
You sound like a low key racist trying to not give a black man his credit
You are literally an outsider to rap. You have no right to comment on it. üíÄ
You just talking sounds like a hater
COWARD
Yall didn&#39;t care this much about trump so now you do the math
Honestly this ‚Äúunreviewable‚Äù review made me lose a lot of respect for Anthony. As a critic your duty is to have an opinion, you cannot simply say ‚Äúno thanks‚Äù yet still post something on a hot album in a timely fashion simply saying nothing. Especially when you‚Äôre so clearly virtue signaling, or are you donating all the money you make via the views on Kanye content? You are right on the money calling out Ye for his mental decline and bigotry, yet you say you don‚Äôt have an opinion on the album??? I get in a case like this you can‚Äôt separate the art from the artist when the ego bleeds deeply into the content, but you fail to say ‚Äúantisemitism is a NOT GOOD/10‚Äù. If you truly don‚Äôt stand with the man and his hateful rhetoric and mediocre music why not give it a 0? It reads as someone who doesn‚Äôt even believe the words they are saying. Despite Ye being an insane asshole he even coins you right Anthony ‚ÄúWHO AINT CASH A CHECK OFF MY NAME‚Äù guess you‚Äôre a Vulture and didn‚Äôt even know it! What about all the artists you lauded that stand prominently around Ye? Why not group them in with the 3 groups of insane Ye fans? Or does it not work for you to group people you support into these despicable categories.<br><br>Long time watcher of the channel, i dont claim to know anything but maybe you don‚Äôt either anthony. Im not upset by what u said its just shameful to clearly have an opinion yet walk it back. Low tier journalism my man.
thanks fantano good to see someone addressing the album without horse blinders on
Bro didnt cook lmaooooo
Your such a hater just retire
Most unlistenable rap album, id rather listen to  new kid cudi.
you know this only makes me want to listen to it more, right?
Crybaby
I like Ye
good video
nihilistic teens? people are smart enough to seperate the person from the music
feathers? ruffledüòÇüòÇüòÇ <br><br><br><br>fcking crybaby
No more Mr. nice guy
What if kanye sees this and it hurts his feelings?? What the frick dude
Sorry to break it you annie banani but you are a MUSIC reviewer not a people reviewer. You have no choice but to separate the artist and the music, no one cares about how you view the world.
Halfway through the review and he&#39;s barely talked about the music.
icl the album is p ass
6/10 yap session same time next week?
It&#39;s kinda crazy how Fantano can say he&#39;s gonna draw the line at Kanye saying anti-semitic things when he praises albums made by rappers talking about how they kill people and blow peoples heads off. The line is all over for him and its very clear its just a bias/hate thing. It&#39;s almost like he&#39;s more offended at Kanye than the actual jewish people themselves.
Fantano Try To Be Objective Challenge IMPOSSIBLE
Yo! This guy is the biggest Kanye hater ever. I think being this bias will hurt your integrity when you‚Äôre supposed to be giving honest reviews. If you can‚Äôt see past what you don‚Äôt like about Kanye, just don‚Äôt review his work. Let be honest this album is the most complete and polished work ye has done in a while.
Dont you review gangsta rap ? Where is this schooling for the murder and drug talk ?! You even reviewed young thugs album while he‚Äôs in jail for a RICO ! And one of the list or charges is MURDER ! You a joke bro
I love much of Kanye‚Äôs music, but was unaware of the extent of his behavior in recent years before this video. Genuinely, thank you for educating me.
Never trust a guy who gave sexy redd an 8 üíÄ
47k dislikes btw.
Album is good its not that‚Äôs serious melon
This video is completely unwatchable trash
music man refuses to review the music
He‚Äôs such a fckn crybaby
number 1 album.... just another long time hater coping
Reminder that jews are white. You can not be bigoted, or racist against white people.
Fairplay fantano, a decent review of what the album is and what the artist is, sometimes one is more apparent but not here
How‚Äôs your wife?
Is he Jewish
You have no brain cells
The music is great, there are barely any lines on the album that are actual complete misses, and even if you really hate them, take away 1 or maybe 2 points from the final score, to say a project this good is &quot;unreviewable&quot; is just pretencious interaction bait and you know it fantano
I love his music but, it‚Äôs absolutely true that he has changed for the worse.
Ahhh bopping snoop doggies doggystyle for a classic throwback and countless other misogynistic hip hop records is an ode to time of an era, ‚Äúsome lyrics can be dated and sound crass for todays standards‚Äù. But calling a bitch, reference is suddenly an added reason to grow your long list of ‚Äúi just got paid to hate on kanye‚Äù. Bro i didnt even like the album but come on, get a hold of yourself and what you are blabbering. Anybody with two braincells should be able to see what youre upto. Classic double standards there.
Is this guy a hater? Yes
bro skipped carnival the second he heard cartis verse
But reviewing King Von isnt off the question? Hypocrite
First Time Fantano hating üòÇ
Maybe if you checked your massive ego every once in a while your wife would still be around
I can respect what you‚Äôre saying and I think you at least made an honest review of the album because art can come from anywhere and all art are worthy of review and thoughts.
The isn‚Äôt even Kanye‚Äôs worst album, v bad take.
I didn‚Äôt hear any lies he said about the fake white Jews
I think Fantano hates him so much now that he‚Äôs letting it blind his review. It‚Äôs not the best Kanye album but def not the worst. Also he acts like other people haven‚Äôt said shit, ummm jpeg literally jokes about white people all the time idgaf that he does and apparently he doesn‚Äôt either and I know jpeg means nothing by it but still is that not racist? Also I love jpeg so no hate towards him all love and same for Fantano I just hope he will get out of this blind rage
Please review Masta Ace &amp; Marco Polo&#39;s new album :)
What a pathetic second-rate &quot;music critic&quot; that simply cannot separate the music from the artist.<br><br>You&#39;re a disgrace to journalism &amp; music.
Unfortunately what‚Äôs best to do from now on is to simply not talk about him‚Ä¶ Not give him credit. Not give him media, not give him attention. There is plenty of music out there, we dont need what he has to offer. Which is really a shame, for me, who is a fan from many years ago and who is naturally still curious about his musical outcome. He really made some of the music that most impacted my life for quite afew years. <br><br>To be honest, listened to the album and liked a few songs (stars, keys to my life, talking, back to me, burn and good). Liked it way more than Donda, also. So its hard and sad to feel that the best thing to do is to not talk about him anymore‚Ä¶. But what makes it easier is the actual saddest part of the story, which is the realization that although I dont think the album is all complete gargabe, it doesnt even come close to being anything as mindblowing or forward-thinking as what he made during many years. There are some average-cool songs, some relatively nice production tricks, but all in all‚Ä¶. He was a masterful musical artist and even a great lyricist. Nowadays, if u strip all the hype away, hes just an almost-below-average artist with no great musical or lyrical ideas to present<br><br>Actually feel sorry for him having his truly genius (and fragile) mind broken by becoming so rich and powerful in a sick shallow-content and entertainment-driven capitalist culture‚Ä¶ I dont think he is a happy man, seems more like a really anxious, paranoic and increasingly lunatic man
Bro that take is terrible
The Kanye Twitter stans already clipping parts of this video without any of the context just cause Fantano isn‚Äôt dickrider
He reviewed Burzum twice but Kanye was too antisemitic for him
note that i‚Äôm not a kanye fan i didn‚Äôt enjoy this record and i am disgusted with his recent behaviour<br><br>you‚Äôre a hypocrite you‚Äôve reviewed countless ‚Äúproblematic‚Äù artists including burzum üò≠ knowing varg is a human cesspool of hate you‚Äôve even made an entire video the point of which being to separate the art from the artist your stance is nothing ‚Äúmoral‚Äù you‚Äôre simply piling on because it‚Äôs trendy not to like kanye and you‚Äôre a spineless hypocrite who‚Äôll do anything for clicks
bro was so mad he created a new rating
You were one of the realest Music reviewers until like very recently. I have never understood where you actually even draw the lines?<br><br> Let&#39;s put it this way. Do you think Religious Blasphemy is worse than actually committing a violent act? Can you confidently say you&#39;ve never reviewed a person&#39;s work who&#39;s been involved in major crimes?? <br><br>Rooting for Nazism isn&#39;t validated. But again are they worse than certain physically carried out crimes? Besides all these.You&#39;re a music Reviewer. You can have a separate channel for gossips. But here we expect reviews even of Jeffery Dahmer if he were to ever produce an Album. (or unless you think Jeffery Dahmer deserves a review and not Richard Dawkins because he committed blasphemy,woops)
HYPOCRITE ALERT
I do not condone anything kanye has been condemned for, but i also think its crazy how much backlash he has gotten for it. Mental health awareness and activism is really popular until we start talking about Kanye. Bro is obviously dealing with serious mental health issues and everyone acts like its his fault for not dealing with it properly, so fuck him. Idk, it  just seems hypocritical
You did a review on Burzum albums, y‚Äôknow a band led by a Nazi who stabbed a man for being a homosexual. Rent is due I guess
Unwatchable
if it was called to pimp a vulture you would have given it a 10
A biased reviewer with a lesbian shirt giving us moral lessons and saying he is not going to do the review while he actually does the review, and asking us to not listen the album becaude of blablablah but  monetizing the video. Fucking ridiculous.
Kanye is my favourite artist of all time. But sometimes you just gotta look past that and see. Even with everything he&#39;s said recently, ignoring everything. The album is still terrible (same with Donda 2)
I agree with most the shi u say but paid and fade are totally different songs
spot on. thank you for this
But baby you ARE reviewing it, right now, in this video; reviewing lyrics, reviewing music, reviewing features, reviewing artist catalogue, this is a REVIEW
Best album since TLOP
Permanently judging a mentally ill person for spouting irrational ideas during a manic episode, while Nick Fuentes was his ear telling him to say those things is more embarrassing than anything. This narcissistic grandiosity complex you have is very telling.
He hardly said anything about the music? Used to be a huge fan of needledrop, now I feel he‚Äôs out of touch and puts his personal agenda forward rather than an ‚Äúunbiased‚Äù review of the music
if you called it oil of every vultures un insides you wouldve given it an 8. RIP SOPHIE
I see why Fantano is sick of Yeezy&#39;s bs at this point, dude causes nothing but trouble and has a fanbase that equally and egregiously attack others who dare to criticize him
Fantano KING. MY MELON.
if it was called vultures 2 you would have called the video unreviewable 2
Cherokee here, while I agree wholeheartedly with your non-review, I would humbly and gently suggest avoiding terms like ‚Äúoff the Kanye reservation‚Äù in the future
yhe on the verge of tears
Can you just delete this channel so you can become a breadtuber like you so desperately want to be?
MELON MAD ASF
melon mad cuz he never seen a back like that
I can see that you secretly love the Jay and Silent Bob song, don&#39;t hide it!
i have a review of this album (that im not going to promote) and i liked the album. the lyrics can be fun, but absolutely awful at times. i can absolutely see where you&#39;re coming from on this, and i 100% agree. i only really liked a few songs but those highs are higher than the lower parts on the lows if that makes sense. idk, i went into it without any thoughts of what ye did, but he kinda forced it down my throat, he just thinks that he can be the &#39;rap villain&#39; which, yes, he is a villain, but not in a good way. he&#39;s a general villain. not a rap villain.
Nobody comes to your channel for politics, they come for music reviews. You&#39;ve failed.
common L from this poor guy
I never comment on this channel
Dammn this video was more intense than expected üòÇ. This guy is the Ben Shapiro of music
Idk man it seems like you get the most amount of views when you talk about Kanye. Kanye said if you‚Äôre a fan of him you‚Äôre a fan of yourself, I suppose this is what needs to be done for the views I guess üòÇüòÇüòÇ
I love how he thinks it‚Äôs disgusting when Kanye degrades women but when countless other rappers do it he doesn‚Äôt give a SHIT ‚ò†Ô∏è
Where was your moral self righteousness when it came to reviewing Tekashi 69??
nah if he doesn&#39;t like &quot;beautiful, big titty, butt-naked women just don&#39;t fall out the sky, you know?&quot; his opinion is infinitely invalidated.
kanyes music couldn&#39;t be less relevant in this day and age. please review the new Sonic Youth album.
Fantano has been consistently correct about Kanye gotta give him his props
After Kanye‚Äôs interview with Alex Jones (say what you want about Jones but he gave him multiple outs and apologize) it‚Äôs hard to ever defend him on anything. He completely ruined his legacy after that interview by praising one of the worst humans to ever live
If it was called the vulture heaven you woulda loved it
whined abt Kanye doing fuckshit for like 5min, presented a strawman of what his fans are like to whine some more, before finally talking abt the actual album where he then gave a couple brief examples of things he didn‚Äôt like from like 3 or 4 songs off of a SIXTEEN song album and concluded the whole thing was so bad that it was &quot;unreviewable&quot; what a fucking jokeüòÇ
CAP
bruh will do anything to not consider kanye&#39;s pov<br><br>pussy
Ain‚Äôt your job to just review music? When you start reviewing people‚Äôs lives
Yep, Donda (1) will be the last one I&#39;ll bother to listen by him. Ty$ is just an enabler
Oy vey!!! no review
Fantano when king von disses tooka 253 times on his album: üòå<br><br><br>Fantano when kanye: üò°
&quot;Never in my 20 years of teaching has a substitute left a note this bad&quot; ahh video
if this was called ‚Äúto pimp a vulture‚Äù you would‚Äôve given it a 10
Really not giving many options. You are either dumb af for liking it (or even any song) or a hater, people can&#39;t like things no more.
The 3 types of fan point is dumb af. Why cant we just like the music and that‚Äôs it? I‚Äôm a fan of Kanye‚Äôs music idc about his personality I don‚Äôt know him in person.
Kanye is not anti semetic, frankly youre being racist
He‚Äôs gone old <br>Even more bald <br>And Mald
Paid &gt; Fade, Ty has more lyrics than just that one line lol, it‚Äôs a repetitive chorus like something Daft Punk would make and the way Kanye mimics the higher pitched tone of the sampled vocal is just goofy and clever, production is cleaner and fuller as well
The part where you talked about having to tell the Jews in your audience&quot;  the album isn&#39;t so bad he didn&#39;t mean it&quot; is exactly the part of this that you&#39;re misunderstanding. You have no obligation to explain the behavior of a psychotic artist to anybody it&#39;s your job to fuckin review the music so fuckin review it
Bro, you reviewing Kanye, not the album. You just hate the man and that&#39;s it, admit it.
yes anthony you are so right let everyone know you are against bad things and that you are a good and awesome person with morals
bro why do you hate hoodrat? are you an aristocat?
There was a time that I actually respected your music opinions but holy sh you fell off so hard. Acting like a salty miserable old head for attention. You sold out and it&#39;s sad to see.
Crazy how you clickbaited hating Kanye to get one of your most viewed videos in a while
dawg are you reviewing the album or are you reviewing kanye? üò≠
This is why your wife left you
#1 in Israel yet you the one crying
If it was called ‚Äúhood hottest vultures‚Äù it would‚Äôve been an 8 in his eyes
FU
aside from anuthing he has ever said/done (which was absolutely horrible) i believe kanye has absolutely burned all the bridges with any good responsible producer and you thus all his work from now on will sound like shit forever
Vultures 1 got Unreviewabale1
We all know damn well if you hated the album you would have loved to shit on it.
that stare looked like a teacher that got a bad note from the substitute
A bunch of white teens are seething at this
the yapper
‚ÄúI just told you who I thought I was! A god. Would you like it if I said I am a nigga? Or I am a gangsta?‚Äù
can i still listen to his old music üòî
What a fuckin crybaby.
ye is so washed it sucks
Is this the politically correct virgin space?
Melon, so many other albums talk about extremely vulgar content, frankly I can‚Äôt believe you reviewed goblin by Tyler, the creator and not this album. I‚Äôm not even saying seperate the art from the artist or that it was a good abut but just give it a rating, you have been making videos or reacting to every tiny bit of Kanye news so to disappoint your fans by not giving it a rating just sucks.
bro perfectly described be in the second type of fanüò≠
Very nice self righteous video
L take
Many people will believe ignorant things about you that aren‚Äôt true. Kanye is not an antisemite as a fact.<br><br>Yet you made money off this non review, so Kanye is putting money in your pockets‚Ä¶‚Äù How many people made checks off my name ‚Äú You one of them<br><br>You‚Äôll be surprised how many Jews love this album‚Ä¶<br><br>The funny thing is you actually listened to the whole album and still gave a mini review saying you didn‚Äôt like the music‚Ä¶ after ranting about not reviewing it<br><br>So Fantano I can respect your diction when it comes to reviews, but you‚Äôre not ‚Äúright‚Äù you just have opinions
he is literally trying to gaslighting people that the album is bad cause he just hates kanye like what i am hearing sounds good what is this man talking about
Genuine question: why do you draw the line with what Kanye has said over the last couple years when you‚Äôve reviewed Burzum, lead by a legitimate nazi, or many many rappers who have killed people/glorified killing people, peddling drugs, etc? Seems pretty odd
I give this review a score of unwatchable/10.
Did you even listen to it? What a terrible take
BALD. Also fantano is cool af guys but he missed here.
Alr bro
Anthony Fantano is the peak example of the Dunning-Kruger effect at work.
Nice &quot;review&quot; LOL<br>I&#39;m not even a Kanye fan, I almost never listen to any of his music, but you spent too much time on your personal opinion of him than anything else.
If the album was called &quot;to pimp a vulture&quot; you would give it a 10
BALD
anthony you just hating  üòÇ but I get it he&#39;s not the best person at times
You are so disconnected from reality. <br><br>You think the non-terminally online common person with a life outside the internet who works a 40 hour+ workweek cares or has the energy to think about the personal life of the musical artist that they enjoy in their free time?<br><br>Also, how delusional do you have to be to group every Kanye fan into such deplorable groups. You need to believe that there are that many Nazis that exist, and will spend the effort to listen to kanye on Spotify just to push a Nazi agenda? What kind of tin foil hat logic is this?<br><br>The consumer only cares about the product. No one cares that their smart phone was made in a sweatshirt in chine by children. If the product is good that‚Äôs all they care about. <br><br>Also, fans don‚Äôt actually group themselves into a group. People just enjoy things and leave it at that. The majority of fandoms just enjoy their tastes in private. They aren‚Äôt online on Reddit, and consuming content about that media.<br><br>Stop pushing this rhiteous agenda/ crusade on the average consumer.<br><br>No one wants to be patronized by some kid on YouTube, disconnected from reality, for being wrong or immoral for enjoying a product that is objectively popular and high quality.
idk why ur being hypocritical abt kanye. i 100% understand/respect ur arguments, but you never extended those same arguments toward other artists that u reviewed and enjoyed
It‚Äôs still number 1 without your review. You wanted the attention so you made this video. If you really were disgusted you would have ignored this album as if it didn‚Äôt exist. You listened, you loved it yet you can be open about it.
I love the track hoodrat
What a clown
The amount of people in the comments that are hurt is wild. Not surprising but wild.
i wonder what the court hearing was like during the divorce
ill give your logic, and butthurt yapp yapp a solid 6
that last frame is honestly all we needed to see but thanks for the explanation anthony
guys, this is only disc 1. let‚Äôs wait to see what he says about the next 2 parts
Grow some hair and review the damn album
stop connecting his personality with the album. garbage review
but you still think TLOP is an 8 right?
Yea if this was called ‚Äúkids see vultures‚Äù thus would‚Äôve been a 10
L
this guys reviewed Michael Jackson and a ton of artists with trouble actions <br><br>bro dont act like you have a line
L
I actually agree with this take
Ngl I ain‚Äôt even the highest of Kanye fans but fantano is literally just hating
Albums dope this foos just a hater
bro looks like he&#39;s about to scold Jesse
It‚Äôs ironic that you still make videos about artists you ‚Äúboycott‚Äù because you‚Äôre still getting paid because of their demand üòÇ
kanye making history again, THE GOAT
You can see that the new album was placed in the trap area where he discovered the next level from this area. I am not a fan for Kanye West or Jay z or Eminem but I know that I am able to recognized the good quality music since I was insipred from 2015 from Kanye. I really love this album where I can listen all of his songs without thinking of poor qualityt or repetitive flow from thom the past of hiphop/trap. I really love the short scenes where he highlights/media that were written by other reports where his real life has burned/shorted from him and he communicate every feeling that was on it in a good quality music that you can actually feel it via unqiue music elements. You are our Michael Jackson with this album Kanye.
I agree
i think ‚Äòseparate the art from the artist‚Äô doesn‚Äôt apply when the art reflects the artists beliefs, that‚Äôs why i wouldn‚Äôt mind a Michael Jackson album because it doesn‚Äôt reference pedophilia in any way, but i don‚Äôt wanna listen to vultures cos it‚Äôs just kanyes meincampf
this is the guy who gave hood hottest princess a strong 8
Let‚Äôs be real, you have a political agenda and hope to advance it in any possible video you make
Man shut up and review the damn music
When is the review coming out
Aren‚Äôt you a Nazi
Vegan cookies part 2
get over yourself
soon you won&#39;t be talking about Drake because he smokes hookah and advertises betting. Wake up man
I didn‚Äôt even like the album but you‚Äôre still an absolute herb. This might be unreviewable but you are also unlikable.
If anyone wants an actual review/analysis from someone who doesn&#39;t talk down to you the whole time and doesn&#39;t act like he is King Shit because he is just so virtuous, &quot;Professor Skye&#39;s Record Review&quot; is for you. He addresses Kanye and the obvious harm he has done, but doesn&#39;t just virtue signal and lecture the whole time.
vultures is just Kanyes Meincampf
I will only agree about the fact that kanye said alot of antisemistic shit in the lyrics, its was unnecessary and if he just rapped about something else rather tha  jews every minute of the song, i would enjoy it.
This is sad, you compromised the reliability of your review and probably your whole channel now, how do we know all your other reviews weren‚Äôt based on how YOU FEEL about the artist instead of the actual music. On top of that, you just advertised this album you hate to your entire audience who will definitely run to hear it what your talking about, which is $$$ in Kanye‚Äôs pocketü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Idk if he parades her as a naked body I think he is trying to show from growth from some Kim controversy where he wanted her to cover herself AKA controlling what she wears
Leaky is right, why post anything at all. Such a hypocritical post. It‚Äôs sad to watch you lose touch in real time. Just review pop culture melon baby
Thanks to this video I will listen to the whole album and start to add Kanye‚Äôs whole discography to my set lists
WOAH Kanye won!
He says things like that in his lyrics to make people like you mad
too much opinion on Kanye rather than the music, good job
he is right fantano you are based
Did he even listen to the music?
If it was called To Pimp a Vulture, he would‚Äôve given it a 10
Honestly I love Kanye and don‚Äôt agree with all the shit he‚Äôs been saying or doing but this album is beyond trash is the most uninspiring project he‚Äôs ever put out
Idk what happened between now and when you talked about the Talking single last week.
Bro, you did a review on the openly neo-Nazi band Burzum. You&#39;re two-faced and resentful.
Not protecting but kanye is doing this is bec he called out the industry and secrecy society and lost billions of dollars overnight mysteriously. Which explains how hes going over edge rn to make up for it.
Shut up Fantano, Bros gonna cry üíÄ
Wait a minute Rappers can be talking about all the murder they do and shit but hating the jews is crossing the line?
I was really hoping he would review the album and not give us bs politics
totally agree with everything
You&#39;re a clown. ü§°
Average soy boy
So for those who want an opinion on the album. It‚Äôs a 6 at best.. couple fire tracks but overall kinda whack.
With what‚Äôs happening in  Palestine maybe Kanye‚Äôs right
Might be the best review I‚Äôve ever seen from you
‚Äúwhy me‚Äú ahh stareüíÄ
1m less than a day is wild
fantano is jewish besides that great video
FREE PALESTINE!
Bro didn‚Äôt add a 4th option of just liking his music
The album was still heat thoü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Common kanye L . Jsut came to the like the video
A milli views in a day, damn.
Thats why your wife divorced you
Melon is very hypocrite myself because he&#39;d review numerous of album with controversial lyrics. I don&#39;t agree with Kanye West anti-semitic comments or his behavior, but you&#39;ve reviewed Kanye West album with questionable lyrics in his past. Where do you draw the line because they&#39;re many musician who were inspired by Nazi beliefs or anti-semitic comments from Ozzy Osbourne, David Bowie, The Sex Pistols, The Rolling Stones, The Beatles (Pepper‚Äôs Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover), Michael Jackson and etc.
I agree with pretty much everything Melon said, however
This is bigotry adjacent, please do better, Anthony. Point being, there is quite a bit of projection going here given some of the extreme and weirdo views you hold.
&quot;Who ain&#39;t cash a check off my name?&quot;
You literally spend ur days posting bad fit pics and selfies on instagram and tik tok as a 40 year old man, yet you talk of the purpose of other peoples lives. also your wife cheated on you.
Kanye going back to the hood with this one üó£Ô∏èüó£Ô∏èüî•üî•üî•
realest review ever ty pooks
He made graduation
i actually agree with him and i love Kanye.
This is what a Vulture looks like
Melon
The album is named after you, how could you not review it?
This guy is such a loser
So basically I won&#39;t review the album due to my political opinions. How dumb?
bald and mad. nice.
Kanye has been trash for well over 10 years
Could have kept this in the drafts
really bad but donda 2 was worse
Bro im jewish the album still fire (second half) (first half kinda weird)
You are unwatchable
Bro ack to me is so good
These comments have me losing all hope for the future. Why is our culture holding up artists like this and defending blatant mediocrity and bigotry instead of quite literally anyone else who brings substance and something of merit to the world. None of these other dumbass comments have anything to say. This is where our generation is at man. Brain rot en masse
Fantano and Kanye both got crazy after divorce
‚ÄúOh poor me I have to make a video on my monetized platform, to advertise the fact that I‚Äôm above reviewing media, because I don‚Äôt like the person and their actions. Never mind that I could just ignore the situation entirely, no, I need to advertise my opinion on the matter, to prove to the world that I am a Good Guy.‚Äù
this is so dramatic for no reason lmao
Does Anthony know Kanye?
Yeah but did you like the album
What‚Äôs an Anti Semite? I don‚Äôt even know what Semite means. Someone please explain.
Is bro just mad abt life? Losing all your rep ngl
Still had to make a video get a quick million views on with kanyes name, instead of just leaving it alone without attention
Fantano you forgot to list the ppl that just like to hear music. I‚Äôm not a nazi for listening to Kanye‚Äôs music. I just wanna hear a kickass Freddie gibbs verse. Love you melon.
Zionist ü§¢üòì
INCOMING EDGY 13-YEAR OLDS!!!!!
Has no concept of art and true artists
This shit was so bad
Reviewable Ye albums don‚Äôt just fall out the sky ya know?
Bro just review the album, no his shit
Kanyes delusional fans are plaguing this video. Fantano literally gives it the fairest chance it has ever gotten bc most people will just flat out tune out from this absolute mental illness and drastic spiral downwards into insanity. Anthony you did as best as you could to cover this trash. And even if it saves just one brainwashed teenage idiot Kanye listener I call this whole video a W.
This is proof his reviews don‚Äôt hold wait and he does it for attention
Here before he deletes it
ur wife cheated on you
garbage review/opinion
Trash opinionüòÇW albume
Womp womp
How does The College Dropout, an album that was made 20 years ago, sound better put together than something made in 2024 with all the modern technology we have and all the money Kanye has at his disposal
im #2 and #3 kanye fan
‚ÄòYou dont wanna see my dark side‚Äô ahh stare üíÄ
Yapthony Midtano
Fantano is so based for this one
Kanye has a wife you don‚Äôt
If it was called &quot;To Pimp the Vultures&quot; you would&#39;ve given it a 10
Bro get a new wife it&#39;s over, she&#39;s not coming back
‚ÄòYou don‚Äôt wanna see my bad side of me‚Äô ahh stare üíÄ
I don&#39;t disagree with you, but calling him out for misogystic stuff towards his wife in lyrics means you should really be do that for all rappers who have similar lyrics
L take album ain‚Äôt good but dude quit crying are you a social activist now üòÇ
I&#39;m surprised people are surprised at the response to this video, if the last 18 months have shown anything it&#39;s clear Kanye fans are the most insufferable cult breed fanbase
If I get the aux I‚Äôm playing ‚ÄúU‚Äù by Kendrick, right melon?
Kanye supporters have no father. And for a reason.
You right this album sucks bad lmao
but how can he be antisemitic if he slept with a jewish girl, huh melon?
JIK beats this every day of the week/month/year/decade and the opposite is inconceivable. no cap on god
&quot;I won&#39;t review this album but I will generalize in broad strokes anyone who likes Kanye.&quot;
With this and Abbey Road the melon&#39;s pumping out the best reviews of his life
hell yeah
says the dude with burzum reviews
L take 10/10 album
brother you review actual gangsters having lyrics about killing people but THIS is where you draw the line? ok
Nazi
&quot;kanye fans are close minded&quot; also fantano &quot;if you have a different opinion than me you are wrong&quot;
He was always crazy and always overrated. We are talking about a guy so insecure that to this day he&#39;s still mad about a silly joke in South Park. He thinks persisting on sayin&#39; shocking stuff and believing and that shit is genius. Because you all made him believe he is a genius when he&#39;s just a good producer and a horrible Lyricist.
bow down to the elites anthony stay in line üòÇ
Anthony. <br><br><br>Taysachs.
The fact you are even bringing up misogyny in a fucking rap album shows what this is really about. You&#39;re lame bro
i love how now one cares when kanye would call out white people and then no one still cared when he called out his own race and the left, but now everyone is suddenly so appalled when kanye calls out jewish people. makes you think ü§î
It is not valid to use the term that you cannot separate the art from the artist when literal melon gave a fucking 10 to an album by Duagthers band whose vocalist Alexis Marshall has charges of sexual abuse, gaslighting, rape and taking someone to an attempt at su*<b>*</b>
Naaaah bro deserves to get ratioed on this one
You review music not the person who made it. do your fucking job melon
Art is art.
man these kanye fans are goofy as hell
The sonic spin ball options screen of music
youre real as hell
womp womp. fantano L
Not for ‚ÄúI ain‚Äôt reading allat‚Äù people:<br><br>I don‚Äôt understand why people are so up in arms about Kanye to the point where people like fantano won‚Äôt review his album.<br><br>What Kanye SAID was terrible, yes. BUT do you realize how mundane it really is when we look at the complete history of music? For thousands of years humans have been barbaric‚Ä¶ Ancient rulers KILLED millions of people. Gengis Khan for example has many songs made about him, people still listen to that music and nobody wrongs them for it. Many people listen to ancient music of their nations regardless of how many people they killed wrongfully‚Ä¶<br><br>Compare that to Kayne saying ‚Äúthere‚Äôs alot of I LOVE about h*tler‚Äù and is it really that bad? The guy was probably midst of a bipolar episode‚Ä¶ and we feel that we can no listen or respect his art now? Give me a break.<br><br>Maybe a controversial take, but seriously‚Ä¶ If one shouldn‚Äôt listen to Kanye then nobody should listen to any music made more than 500 years ago. Humans are evil my friend, much more so than Kanye‚Äôs yapping.
Man, seek help
If it was called &quot;To pimp a Vulture&quot; you&#39;d give it a ten üòÇ
Is this a music review or a yapfest on why jews are so important to you?
I don&#39;t understand Fantano, he says he can&#39;t review Kanye&#39;s album because of the propaganda of anti-Semitic, sexualization, racism and lack of musical content on the album but he still makes a video about Vultures. If you think he&#39;s a horrible human being, it&#39;s better not to talk about him anymore and make money with that content because it&#39;s clearly going to be your most viewed video for a while (Now it has 1 million views in 24 hours).
c&#39;mon, man. yes, the album is mid and sounds like a demo. just give it a not good, explain why is it that you think that and move on. by making this video you&#39;re giving the ppl material to troll you.<br><br>you&#39;re pusing 40 and still arguing w/ 15-y/o guys on twitter. love ya, melon, but this is not it
With its justness being here nor there, Where was this outrage when he mentioned slavery was a choice?
You mention that &quot;Kanye fans dont wanna hear critizism of Kanye at all&quot; and then you tweet abt &quot;Kanye fans cant say anything to me abt not liking sexy redd or smthn like that, very hypocritical and a big yikes ngl, stop being a hater just cause you like to hate
calm down lil bro, you know that you are doing something wrong if KANYE has a wife and you dont
I‚Äôd divorce this loser for too, you feel like you‚Äôre the man hiding behind a computer screen with all your ‚Äúfans‚Äù being social rejects jusy like you. Genuinely feel bad for this guy
You‚Äôre balding, pushing 40, and you still can‚Äôt review music for shit. You are obviously incapable of rating something without your bias influencing your decision. Do better.
I have been unsubbed all these years. I finally subbed
I left the reservation...I&quot;m sad about it.
I can agree Kanye says some  crazy shit but if we look at our world leaders who are never sorry for what they do to America and us citizens . Can give 2 shits about a nigga saying some antisemitism it‚Äôs people who say worst shit that‚Äôs not publicized . Reason why we shouldn‚Äôt idolize we take famous peoples words as if it‚Äôs gods
<b>Anthony gets and unfair and very bias article calling him right wing or some bulls&#39;it</b><br>Anthony response: Dresses as the most f&#39;cking stereotypical liberal person possible and virtue signals
Anyone getting upset at this video is a Nazi-defender.
Nope nope nope. U make reviews. Tap into those years of music theory and cut the politics. Separate the art from the artist. The words can‚Äôt be used against dude in the court of public opinion
Bro doesnt have any humor
Its music and you&#39;re a music reviewer. Not a social activist. Review the music.  I understand that this channel is obviously a reflection of yourself and the you have the right to stand by what you think is right. But its kinda funny that you gained a platform from reviewing music and you have a full reaction to the album but you&#39;re also morally grandstanding. It&#39;s kinda like you never had to drop this review if you didnt want the views or bring more attention to something you dont stand with. But instead you decide to criticize while also leeching the views of the controversy that Kanye brings and his fans. Lowkey hypocritical. Cant have your cake and eat it too.
What a monumentally horrible review. Baldo‚Äôs really fallen off. Prime example of the rot present within the hipster millennial culture
see im not much of a kanye fan but i liked a few songs on this album. and i agree the antisemitic comments in this album are a little excessive. but a few songs were better than Jesus is King. i wouldn‚Äôt put it that low but i would say its tied with Donda. other than that its a mid album that will probably get him nominated for a grammy. then he‚Äôll slam the jews again. hes a shit human being, but a genius in fashion and music. except for the past 2-3 albums. üòÇ
Idk how this guy has a platform. Horrible take
Won&#39;t review vultures cos Kanye is antisemitic but has multiple burzum reviews up despite the fact varg is antisemitic and a literal murderer.
He&#39;s not antisemitic because he loves Hitler, Jesus loves everyone he talks about this, And his public image isn&#39;t altered if this album sold out, surley no one would buy an anti-semi&#39;s album over 10s of millions of times and counting since this comment
So you cant just like his music because its good?
opf√∏r dig lige
People should not have an opinions influenced by media so much ad that guy. I pity u mr. reviewer who evidently doesn&#39;t know a thing about rap.
What a coward.
I guess it really depends on the problem the artist has created. People only care about his music but don‚Äôt necessarily care about what he‚Äôs said or done. But another artist might do something they don‚Äôt like, and exclude their music simply because of that. Come down to the individual but Kanye has been Not Good since Pablo
So I‚Äôm hearing a 10/10
so you&#39;re biased because he isn&#39;t a white nazi or hasn&#39;t burned down a church? you should start purging a ton of your older videos if you really want to keep this moral stance of yours.
I enjoyed it
then don‚Äôt listen to it. find a wife
kanye is literally making fun of this dummy how u offended enough to not review this
Kanye hate jews like shut up and talk about the music. 6 minutes talking about how Kanye hate jews 1 minutes talking about the damn album. the album like a 7.5. you just mad because he got a new wife and you didn&#39;t  you are 40 years old and beefing with 14 year old boy like grow up
BALDüë¥
Coming here not to support or because I‚Äôm subscribed. Here to save fantano is the most pretentious unlikeable mf ever
does he ever review it?
Bro is 40 years old and terminally online.
I just like Kanye&#39;s production and the sound of his music. I don&#39;t care who he is outside of it. It&#39;s not my business. Even if it was his words hold no bearing. He is just Kanye. Why would I take any of  his words or lyrics seriously? One can tune out the lyrics and just enjoy the sound if they want. They don&#39;t need to be obsessive about it.
Lock your doors boy.
Also, it&#39;s not a very good album.
Nah it wasn‚Äôt for you
It&#39;s so easy to tell who in the comments is here from Youtube and who is here from Tiktok lmao
If it was called vultures from Jerusalem you would give it a ten ü§°
i dont know if you know this, but every, or at least most mainstream rappers treat women like this, and second, he never said he loved hitler, he only said that theres good traits in everybody, I think that you just hate Kanye just to hate him ngl
If it was called to pimp a vulture he would gave it a 9
If it was called VULTURES. He wouldve rated it higher
Man you really upset the nazii fandom on YouTube here, which is apparently a thing üòÇüòÇ
if this was called &#39;kid vulture&#39; you would have given it a 10.
ay theres a fourth type: mfs who just want a music review
If it was called ‚Äúto pimp a vulture‚Äù it woulda been a ten
Man, Anthony is becoming woke and gay now‚Ä¶. :/
What did you rate your divorce papers?
Is unreviewable better than a Not Good?
if you respect fantano‚Äôs opinion you are an npc
Baldy jew mad üòÇüòÇüòÇ
sexxy red is better right?
L
igh bru
King is a gut punch of a shitty song with a shittier message.
don‚Äôt mind me, i‚Äôm just a bystander üò≠üò≠ this shit crazyy
you&#39;re pathetic
Kanye was right
womp womp
Bro just do the damn review
I thought this was supposed to be about the music
Dawg you literally reviewed albums of artists that KILLED people I think that‚Äôs a lil worse than just dumb shit that Kanye west always talks about üíÄ
L
kindah reviewed it. juss sayinüíÄüíÄ
&quot;Back to me&quot; was fire üî•
Don&#39;t care. Still listening to the album.<br> GO! GO! GO! GO! üó£Ô∏èüó£Ô∏èüó£Ô∏è
Fantano criticizing Kanye on the basis of him being a bad person and not being able to separate the art while simultaneously using his name to release one of his biggest videos in 4 months is peak irony and incredibly disingenuous. Fantano nothing but a clout chaser.
Man I heard you were this serious music reviewer but all you‚Äôre talking about is this guys life outside of this album.
with house of Balloons, this is surely your worst take ever
Kanye&#39;s public antics aside, the album is just kinda shit. Like there&#39;s some catchy moments but 80% of the album is just boring. Production was great but Kanye&#39;s verses were just mid and Ty$ vocals makes me wanna take a nap.
Saying this just shows people its a great album LMAO
You forgot one type of fan, the person who just chooses to seperate the music from the artist. Don‚Äôt really agree with much of his actions but I will say this album is decent. Not the best he‚Äôs made or even from this year but definitely some songs I‚Äôd listen to.
if it was named to pimp a vulture he would‚Äôve rated it a 10
‚ÄúThis album is unreviewable‚Äù <br><br><b>proceeds to review album</b>
If it was called &quot;To Pimp a Vulture&quot; you woulda given it a 10
YOU MADDDDD
I respect Melon for calling out Kanye&#39;s deranged &quot;fans&quot; who really don&#39;t care about anything and just wanna see the world burn. To quote Logan Roy, they&#39;re not serious people.
I can‚Äôt believe how terrible the album is
Sooo A 9/10?
Watching tik toks about this album is infuriating because every comment section is the same echo chamber of people saying he‚Äôs back like he didn‚Äôt just drop his worst album besides JIK
Notice how he didn‚Äôt talk about carnival; probably been stuck in his head all day
just review the album
Bro out here having reviewed people who‚Äôve killed people, if anyone has any taste they will choose their own art
This guy is a clown. The album is fire.  Hes just a typical woke white leftist.
10 / 10? Gotcha
He is just advocating for better mental health care availability.. it&#39;s crying for help and people like Melon just refuse to listen! :D
What I hate more than a guy rating art is a controlled opposition rating art
üíÄ
THAT&#39;S WHY KZNYE IS THE GOAT, GOGOGO KING <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg"></a><a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/xsIfY4OqCd2T29sP54iAsAw"></a>üå∂ SHOW THESE JEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEWS THEIR PLACE.... <b>HMMMMM, FARTS</b>
So this is the issue with Cancel Culture. You&#39;re not reviewing this album! So STFU! Why even speak to the album. So your mission is indoctrination and self-righteous propaganda! Hey, since you have become a political pundit, please speak about your man Netanyahu and the parents of those children. Cancel yourself! üòÇ The Album is FIRE. So is Free speech and redemption!
If it‚Äôs bad because of the lyrics then my did you rate ‚ÄúBastard‚Äù by that logic you are saying you support rape and canabolism? Doesn‚Äôt make much sense does it?
Still waiting for fantano to review his divorce papers
If each cheek from bianca on the cover was an image of your bald head you would&#39;ve gave it a 10
NO ONE CARES IF KANYE IS CANCELED HE MAKES MUSICüò≠üò≠
Oh brother , this is a 10/10 album as you are a mess
You are right this album is 3/10
How can you be calling other people losers when you‚Äôre a 40 year old divorcee desperately clinging to youth culture on the internet?
Quit politics and get back to music please
UR A MUSIC REVIEWER NOT A PERSONALITY REVIEWER
If this was called ‚ÄúTo pimp a vulture‚Äú it would have been a 10.
Yeah this album is absolute trash. The only people who like it aren‚Äôt fans of the rest of Ye‚Äôs discography or are just die hard fans who force themselves to say that it‚Äôs good and find good things to say about it
Honestly i think kanye sacrificed himself, his image to show us the damage of what the modern world can do to someone with mental illness. We‚Äôve seen him become a misogynistic nazi thanks to his fans, people around him who have continued to egg him on despite knowing he is bipolar. Not trying to excuse anything he‚Äôs said, but i‚Äôm sure any of us would be guilty of saying some insane stuff during a mental breakdown. Kanye seems to be doubling down  on these extremely harmful beliefs because he‚Äôs permitted to do so by the culture, he knows we will always let him get away with it because he‚Äôs ‚Äúkanye‚Äù. We see the same thing happening with modern day school shooters or these new far right white terrorists, the exact crowd he is appealing to. it‚Äôs this new culture of chronically online, pessimistic doomers that take out all their rage on everyone around them when a girl rejects them or they don‚Äôt get their way. Kanye is the most famous case of this that we‚Äôve seen so far. I think that his fans and the media outlets who profit off of his downward spiral are the real ones to blame for him going so far down this path .
Dude must be short on rent
Yeezy fans are the most sensitive and irrational people lol go to ur safe space to be racist
Fantano when he can‚Äôt seperate the music from the artist
wdym he didnt do anything to gain forgiveness he literally apologized to the whole jewish community IN HEBREW ON HIS FIRST INSTA POST BACK
A music reviewer wastes time giving us his opinions on non-music things.
44k d bags watched this
Sorry, but Kanye is right, Jews are people, they fuck up, some jews fucked up, manipulative bunch, he called them out, period, and they were jews
These comments literally prove that most of fantanos fanbase exist in the second group of Kanye stans. Great job proving his point.
he scoopidity poop and they eat it up.
I love how mad people are at this video
Damn, Ye broke him
politics have nothing to do with the music released
What about other rappers that have actually killed people, seems like you only cared about the music then
THIS ALBUM IS SO FUCKING BAD IM 100% CONVINCED PEOPLE THAT LIKE IT JUST LIE
Melon is right!!!!
U can tell he&#39;s reviewing this album on what he&#39;s done in the past .... The hate is there why start the video about what he said or has done in the past let&#39;s just get to the point of the review
Spot on.
The bias is strong
he gave sexy red an 8 <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg"></a><a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg"></a>
Melon
Bald
Says the purpose of his reviews are to either bring attention to music people haven‚Äôt already heard, or to help understand why you don‚Äôt like the particular piece of art‚Ä¶ Then proceeds to give his personal opinion on Kanye and barely touches on the music. You are shittier then ever and that‚Äôs saying a lot.
Great example of why you shouldn‚Äôt let your politics infect your work here. If he can‚Äôt review Ye‚Äôs music for political reasons, then the same should be true for the reviews of Drill projects that he‚Äôs given. Can‚Äôt take him seriously as a music critic if he‚Äôs showing this level of hypocrisy.
I still like Kanye‚Äôs music from ye and before. This album was dog shit and filled to the brim with god awful lines that are not okay at all. I‚Äôm not even a Stan nor do I think what he‚Äôs said has no consequences. I just like tlop and yeezus man.
Bro has absolutely no taste In music, Im absolutely baffled people actually watch this buffoonüò≠ü§£<br>(Edit: i must admit i loved your role as sheev in the Dukes Of Hazzard Movieüôå)
Vultures 1 is Yeezus 2
Imagine basing your music preferences on the opinion of a soy boy like this üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Bro has a masters degree in yapping
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
I honestly agree with what u said about kanye. But i was hoping for an actual review on the album instead of a full rant like we weren‚Äôt aware of any of the shit he did the past few years. If you hate the man, just don‚Äôt give us a review of the next 2 volumes lol. It‚Äôs not that hard
Still firmly on the &quot;I dislike Kanye Rhetoric but think every single one of his albums slap musically&quot; train.
It‚Äôs time to ask yourself the question once again ‚Äúcan bad people make good music?‚Äù You‚Äôve switched up quite a bit melon. I remember when you were respectable and now your just like h3. Losing popularity so you go to political banter that is held in regard only by far left weirdos on the internet. Do better.
Unwatchable video 1
so wait if i like the album does that make me evil
Awesome statement, fr. This man should  just straight up quit at this point, he is rich as hell already, just shut up
he mad kanye not talking about selling crack and or killing black people ‚Ä¶ wake up
lol Kanye fans are just like Taylor Swift fans and they don&#39;t even realize it. They both consist of dumb teenagers that blindly defend their favorite rich narcissist that makes terrible music, because they haven&#39;t lived long enough to experience any music beyond that. they&#39;re also insane.
you dont care about the music no more just the optics huh.
You&#39;re being hypocritical. You reviewed a SERIAL KILLER in King Von, TWICE! He has killed over 20 people and is on FBIs serial killer list, parents of victims still openly mourning, but because that isnt a big social problem you dont care. King Von was bragging about murdering these kids on the album you reviewed, no issues with that? You care with Kanye because the social weight is stronger, not because the implications of his behavior are worse than others youve reviewed. You can choose not to review people based on character, and if Kanye is on that list that is reasonable, but ONLY if you&#39;re consistent and fair.
Anthony, I like the album. Am I cooked? Am I a racist?
Womp womp
Fantano fell off years ago. He probably thinks everyone against him is some Kanye fanboy.
Fantano wishes he was Jewish
Anthony is such a victim and this was the closest to Anthony&#39;s identity being attacked <br>you can tell he&#39;s seething hard here<br>probably got back his 2% Jew reults on 23andme
If it was called ‚ÄúKids See Vultures‚Äù it would‚Äôve been a 10
I can already tell the dis-like to like ratio is unbelievable without seeing thumbs down, another poor opinion
Your age is showing
never seen anthony so salty. Album is a classic though
I still listen to burzum
your&#39;re the best. best. best. ‚ù§
Get tf off your high horse ffs
If it was called &quot;To Pimp a Vulture&quot; it would have gotten a 10
As expected the entire video has nothing to do with the music.
I used to love kanye.
U mad
Worst take
Fantano. Do everybody a favor and shut up for once. Thank you.
Oh no bald whiny liberal told me I can‚Äôt listen to this what will I do
&quot;music reviewer&quot;<br><br>Doesn&#39;t review music<br><br>Spergs out for 7 minutes<br><br>Average fantano moment.
Fantano wishes he was a victimized race.
Bro he‚Äôs just hating what review, there is no review üòµ‚Äçüí´
Where‚Äôs your album baldy ? üßëüèª‚Äçü¶≤
Pretty sad watching this guy talk for 7 mins about how he can&#39;t review an album because anything Kanye does is &#39;icky&#39;...and then he actually reviews some songs at the end. Guess it pays more to make a video about how you can&#39;t review an album then actually reviewing it.
really appreciate this concise takedown but i especially cheesed at the fact that the pfp in the comment at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=270">4:30</a> is blurred despite very OBVIOUSLY being the cover of Blonde

&quot;Unreviewable, awfull, a mess...&quot; And he still... The king üé∂ He still... The king üé∂
album of the year? in ferbruary? if you so say...
at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=46">0:46</a> you show a screenshot of a news article which reads Kanye thinks his jewish doctor wants him dead and you call it a conspiracy theory. Yet Harley Pasernick really tried to kill him. Disgusting.
Bro had a frown the whole time listening to vultures lol
I&#39;m not condoning all of Kanyes behavior, but try to be in the spotlight and maintain a good image; it&#39;s a lot for anyone. I think Kanye is a victim of his own success to a certain degree; the danger of the hustle. You unintentionally condition yourself to become successful that when you get there; you are a different person. Kanye needs help and positivity, but that&#39;s hard in a selfish capitalistic world. A lot of artist are flawed and it&#39;s peoples choice on whether they want to support or not; just don&#39;t criticize me on my choice to continue to support. Kanye is responsible for some amazing works of art that has gotten me through tough times. I&#39;m not disillusioned by the media and spotlight. There are bigger things to worry about. When did we as a society become so sensitive? Kanye is not a nazi or racist to jews. Do we really have to revisit the past and actions of truly terrible people? Get off your high horse Anthony.
Sooooo was it good or nah?
Really attention seeking to say unreviewable given that you‚Äôve reviewed straight up murderers
You said you weren&#39;t gonna review it but you reviewed it. You literally gave an &quot;assessment&quot; of the album, in your own words. If you don&#39;t want to give any attention to Kanye, just don&#39;t make a video on it. Better yet, if you do make a video on it, don&#39;t actually review it in a video titled &quot;unreviewable.&quot; Just explain why you don&#39;t like Kanye and you don&#39;t feel he deserves the attention and then close out the video. I&#39;m not a kanye fan by the way, I like one song and one song only by him and that&#39;s On Sight, I don&#39;t fuck with nazism or anything Kanye has said or done in the past few years.
Hey Fantano, can you review the music, and not the artist? Thanks.
It‚Äôs an album review not what do you think of Kanye, this is a good album musically wether you like him or not
This felt oddly personal...
Buddy your washed go kick rocks
this why u the goat üôèüôèüôèüôèüôè
album is unreviewable so you just reviewing kanye üòÇ
i‚Äôm number 2 fr
I give your Career a light to strong 0
Do people actually like this?
&quot;y&#39;all know this is just my opinion, right?&quot; your opinion is garbage
the zionists got melon
This album was awesome and really spoke to me. It also gave me an insight into what he has been going through  over the last few years. You missed out.
You reviewed albums from worse people
It always floors me how liberals allow their political opinions to ruin great pieces of art. ‚ÄúIts good.. BUT HE VOTED ORANGE MAN, SO ITS BAD!!
L
Bro&#39;s still mad that jpeg and Kanye are friends üò≠üò≠üò≠
why do you still exist
WOOMP WOOMP
at least we can rate that hairline a light 0
Here&#39;s my review:<br><br>I didn&#39;t listen to it but I rate it divorce/10.<br><br>You&#39;re welcome and remember to smash that like and SUSCRI button.
Here before the 1 million mark in 24 hours. Good job Fantano! ü•≥
washed, bald, hipster and horrible taste in music üò≠
yeah i won‚Äôt review it but i still make a vid about it since it‚Äôs kanye and i want money
This da same guy that gave sexyred an 8 out of 10 üòÇüòÇ foh you being a jew does matter and it is y you don&#39;t fuck wit it and I don&#39;t blame you because if the same thing was said about my people I would say it was trash
#1 Album eat shit Fanta
Let‚Äôs not forget Kanye made Bound 2 11 years ago, and New Workout Plan 20 years ago. I don‚Äôt understand how he can think this would be a full serious album, of course he‚Äôs gonna have fun on some songs. ü•±
Kanye West, like his buddy, Donald Trump: are a kind of dark menace to society that people like serial killers and Hitler would have admired.
Give it a 11/10 üó£Ô∏èüó£Ô∏èüíØüíØüî•üî•üî•üî•

Every time u prove that ur the voice of the people
You really think you‚Äôre society‚Äôs saviour or something, just be quiet.
This is a biased, emotional review. You do not keep this energy for other artists with moral issues. I like vultures, it has problems, but it is different. I will never watch your reviews again, you fell off my boy.
Unwatchable 1
Funny how you complain about Kanye objectifying his wife and yet on twitter you go and call her a &quot;dollar store kim k.&quot;
Ok yea but hows the music
Album still good
How by ye liking hitler can hurt your life or affects anyone ??? The guy been dead for 80 years, this channel is not about music anymore is political and personal , maybe hes  mad coz ye hasn‚Äôt responded to him
Such a sad man
This album was wack
N1 in 71 countrys
long ass yap session üò≠üò≠üò≠
When will you review the album?
Don&#39;t waste time on fascists.
the fact that this video is considered controversial is crazy like it should be the most agreeable thing in the world
This is all facts
Profesional hater
I get it... You don&#39;t like Kanye but to say it&#39;s trash is crazy
Who bases their own opinion of art on what they imagine someone else thinks or feels?
Overall, though you said you wouldn&#39;t review it I think you made a quite honest and well argued review that does not only contemplate the music itself but the elements surrounding it
vc n tem amigos e tamb√©m e careca
Love Melon but got to say the way he handled this is laughable. couldve just not made a video in the first place and made a comment on a different platform saying why. Instead you used this as an opportunity for exposure and clicks
Kanye is at his lowest as a human being and I‚Äôd never give him money but musically I think this was better than Donda on first listen
shut up
talk music or shut up
I feel like he didnt even give the album a Chance, which is reasonable.
I really tried to shit out a joke in the comments, but this is literally the most patheic video on any of Fantano&#39;s channels.<br>I do realize his bias towards Kanye&#39;s albums, but seeing this video transcends Anthony&#39;s one-sided feud into something unexplainable. Like, was it necessary to make a 7-minute video about not wanting to do a review if you still make a review of the album in the same video (though purely based on hate)? Was it necessary to not review the album if you still streamed THE ENTIRETY of it? <br>I don&#39;t even want to start talking about his &quot;true&quot; &quot;opinions&quot; about the tracks - not after he shat on &quot;Hoodrat&quot; and called &quot;Paperwork&quot; a bad Yeezus leftover TEN SECONDS IN THE TRACK.<br>Honestly, he could&#39;ve just made an other &quot;Gold Cobra&quot; video if he really wanted not to review an album properly.
Its kinda upsetting hes basically said I cant listen to Kanye without being antisemitic saying that you cant listen to him for the music because the music is antisemitic. Guys dont listen to songs about murder anymore or else it means you condone it.
ur such a bot
Actual meltdown lmao, get help you blockhead
Die he intentionally misinterpretate Paid? Like Its pretty obvious especially with the Roxanne reference
Wow Fantano! Wasn‚Äôt expecting a 10/10 but I‚Äôll take it!!
You are the worst reviewer ever
Sus
this is so sad man melon has lost his mind. i hoping the dude gets the help he needs i know he wouldn&#39;t do the same for ye but  dudes lost his mind his on a weird hate boner and its obvious his having a mental break down because of his wife  and its soo sad to watch.
my exact thoughts literally oh my god
what if i just like the album
Bruh he didn‚Äôt even talk about the music
wow
This is such shit, you completely lost touch with your audience. You are not better than your viewers, so don&#39;t act all high and mighty. <br>People come to you for relevant Objective opinions on MUSIC, not a mentally ill human. <br>Melon man fell off, L take posting for clicks.
shut up and review the music lil bruh
&quot;&quot;insane conspiracy&quot;&quot;
goddam fantano really knocked it outta the park with this one
giving your divorce a strong 10 for your ex wife
If it was called ‚Äúto pimp a vultures‚Äù he would have given it a 10
wait until he realizes the subject matter of gangsta rap
This is the same guy that gave MBDTF a 6 and gave sexy redd album an 8‚Ä¶..
just focus on the music
cry me a river.
xqc disagreeing with you is easily your biggest endorsement.
FACTS
I actually did enjoy the album but I don‚Äôt think wether or not this album is good is the important thing about it
if it was called &quot;To Pimp A Vulture&quot; he woulda given it a 10
Funny how people who have never made music always have an opinion ü§£ü§°
I agree with Fantano, I only listen to artists that align politically with my beliefs. Wouldn&#39;t want to give a platform to someone I disagree with. As a matter of fact I only listen to people that think exactly the same way I do. Don&#39;t care for opinions that don&#39;t conform to my worldview
From the guy who brought you &quot;Taylor Derangement Syndrome&quot; comes &quot;Reeeeeee Kanye Reeeeee&quot;<br><br>No self-awareness.
Wholly unlikeable jew
You‚Äôve literally listened to music about people talking about killing other people and this is too far? Why are you acting like this channel is here to talk about what‚Äôs wrong and right to say in music ? Your persona is reacting to music not talking about whats wrong and right like who tf you think you are baldy.
i miss the days when fantano would just talk about music. these days he just cant shut up about politics. nobody cares about your political opinions, just talk about the music and keep it at that. thats what you are good at, and thats why you have subscribers. nobody asked for your opinion on politics. nobody subscribed to your channel to hear about them either. it seems like the melon has started to become rotten.
100% agree with you man
Hey your videos normally are ab light 3  but this one was 10/10 no doubt
I don&#39;t need the PBS special can you just review the music
Where yo wife lil bro üíÄ
Kid see ghost is better than vultures
Based fantano making kanye fans seethe and cry.
‚ÄúIm not racist, its a preference‚Äù is halarious
Every single time a good piece of music comes out I am reminded just how incompetent you are at reviewing music
if it was called ‚Äúhair‚Äù you would‚Äôve rated it
4. People who don&#39;t follow the news and just hear the releases. (This album was bad really)
plz shut ya trap
So when ‚Äúslavery was a choice‚Äù his albums are a 10?
&quot;Separate the art from the artist&quot;<br><br>Proceeds to show quotes from the artist embracing how people aren&#39;t able to do so and somehow that&#39;s still an issue üòÇ
Common fantano L tbh
Folks, A smart Kanye fan would hate this album. Hitler would‚Äôve hated this as much as melon.
Bro didn‚Äôt even show the cheeks on the cover
&#39;&#39;oh im gonna shit on this album just so i can gain the sympathy of the jews i have out here and look like i have morals and dignity&#39;&#39; just stfu
unwatchable 1
Bro doesn‚Äôt want to review this album because it‚Äôs not made by someone he wants to tap
If it was called kids see vultures you&#39;d give a ten<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>I&#39;m just kidding, I totally agree with you I just don&#39;t want the kanyes stans up my ass
Videos like this make me miss the dislike counter
i kinda liked the first part is thart really that bad?
Bro genuinely looks dissappointed  about the album üíÄ
A &#39;reference&#39; is a common term in music production, it&#39;s the gold standard to compare against. If you were making a pop record, you might reference Thriller, or a rock record, you might reference Alan Parsons. A reference track is the highest quality recording of which you can compare against to help you improve your own mix/master. I feel like that line is being greatly misinterpreted.
There was definitely a couple tracks that i didnt care for, but overall i really the album, and I&#39;m definitely looking forward to the next couple albums. Melon hates him, and thats fine. Half the time I hate Melon. I really think that some of the samples on Vultures were its weakest attributes. That&#39;s about it though.
This is a pretty funny take. Kanye‚Äôs following is certainly more complex than the 3 categories you reduce it to. I respect you for articulating the opinions you have, I just don‚Äôt agree. It seems you are seeing things through a very rigid frame of reference and no youtube comment will shake that. Much love Fantano
Kanye is the goat
..L<br>ü´¥
fantano the type mf to review a mans political views like bro were here for the MUSIC not the political bsüòÇ as a ye drider ill admit it that ye been saying some insane shit but ur a music reviewer lil bro
everybody in the comments dickriding a nazi...brains full of beans.
Wasn‚Äôt the line about his wife calling her a ‚Äúreference‚Äù in reference to his preference
Separate the art from the artist buddy
never rate again
Bro can‚Äôt separate art from the artist
I&#39;m glad you liked it!
FANTANO YOU BUM
Fantano was praying for this album to be bad
I wanted to get mad about this but he makes a good point. Regardless of fantanos rating there would be rage
Okay cool, now review the album please!
You are bald
Most sane Kanye fans in the comments rn
way to go anthonyüôè
How do you get money off of this?
Naw its good trust
what
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=259">4:19</a> none of these lyrics are particularly disparaging of Jewish people, just glib and referential to the controversy, so saying afterwards that people aren‚Äôt being genuine when they say they‚Äôre just giving the art a viewing is just dumb. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=274">4:34</a> oh hey, tell me, which of those ‚Äú3 types of Kanye fans‚Äù you mentioned is this comment belonging to?? Cuz it seems like‚Ä¶none of them! Just a normal person üòÇ<br><br>Kanye is no hero, but Anthony, you‚Äôre a parody at this point. The Fader truly did this man‚Äôs head in, permanently. If you don‚Äôt want to review the album, just don‚Äôt review it. You‚Äôve done that with plenty of albums since Day 1. Embarrassing content.
hate kanye but this mf is SOOOOOOOOO CORNY LMAO
What ever happened to separating art from the artist
This dude is so gay.
Fantano: I will not review this album because of my moral standing<br>Also Fantano: Makes money off of a stream playing it at full blast<br><br>Idk man
Bro gonna get a vegan cookie recipe pretty soon
Fantano is a full on liberal dweeb
Anybody have the dislike count?
rent must be due üòÄ
Daaaang not even a ‚Äútran-sition‚Äù at the end‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen an album-related video from Anthony where he doesn‚Äôt include that, even for ‚ÄúNOT GOOD‚Äù videos.
man kanye RUINED fantano lol
tldr: he gave it a strong 10
7 minute yap session
Tylers gonna have to make a song called melonhead abt u
Real YAPPER
bro slo asl
&gt;bald 38 year old man won&#39;t review album because &quot;muh antisemitism&quot; then proceededs to talk shit about his own fanbase

didn‚Äôt he review it already tho
The assassination of Kanye West by the coward Anthony Fantano.
If this was made by Kanye Weest then you would have given it a 10
Bald guy talking
soooo sexxy red got n 8 tho?
This one of the most embarrassing things I‚Äôve ever seen from a respected content creator like you man. Real talk. If you really stood by what you said You could‚Äôve just not reviewed the album and gave it no attention, but instead decided to suck all the clout off it that you could.
I get it man. Kanye ain‚Äôt gon pay your bills if they come after you for enjoying the album
Kanye is hiding though out the album...
Nothing shows your solidarity with the Jewish community like profiting off of an album you ‚Äúrefuse to review‚Äù
Fantano looks like a kidnapper from the 70s
Seven minute yap session
L
Good. Call it out. Kanye is a piece of trash.
Huge L Anthony
Fantano don‚Äôt get on some moral high ground as if you don‚Äôt listen to any music by less than savory people
Melon head L once again. Find god
man i think you re gone much further than even kanye himself on all of these rants
I commented on an ig post saying the standard for ye albums has dropped. Legit all I said. I got absolutely spammed with hate by his fan base. So thank you melon for standing up to them. Your reaction made my day and your review is based. W melon ‚ù§
Can you believe a rapper said something negative about women, IMAGINE MY SHOCK ‚ö°Ô∏è
A million views in 24 hours? <br>Damn son, you done blew up
If your reading this<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>I hate you needledrop.
who r u to tell me what music i cant enjoy
if it was called ‚Äúkids see vultures‚Äù you would have given it a 10
‚ÄúAntisemite‚Äù going #1 in israel. Ye really the goat
Lmao this guy
Sounds like a mad jew hating on a man that‚Äôs doing the lords work.
Stick to music.
He has no right to be saying any of this after what he said about Burzum. I know he went on a rant about why he couldn&#39;t separate the art from the artist here, but if he couldn&#39;t do that, he shouldn&#39;t post a video at all. How are you going to trust future reviews if all this guy wants to talk about is politics?<br><br>BTW I could be wrong, but isn&#39;t he for Palestine?
ignore the haters my man. I disagree with you but you are getting way to much hate.
I love all these comments proving they are part of those 3 groups. As a Kanye fan, just listen to the music and stop dick riding anything Kanye ever does, you&#39;re not even trying to not be a cult.
Bro just reviewed his life and not the album üòÇüòÇ
ur so boring in usa, everything is politicized, 7 mins about some jewish nonsense like cmon
At the start of the vid he says he doesnt want to draw attention to the album or review the albums contents because they are bad. But u have made made the review minus the actual rating. On top of this u did the livestream which u also posted which combine for over a mil views. You insult Kanyes fanbase to farm hate views for your egregious content. If u really cared abt ur Jewish fanbase u would not have ‚Äúunintentionally‚Äù made videos gaining millions of views all promoting Ye‚Äôs album. All you want to do is profit off Kanyes project and it shows
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Bro hating like his life depends on it
I genuinely feel sorry for Kim&#39;s kids, all who have to grow up with the fact their father has evolved into this.  Those lyrics... that&#39;s despicable.
Every other review is Anthony Fantano endorsing that person&#39;s actions. Got it.
I do not like fantano at all, I feel like sometimes he doesn&#39;t even listen to some of the albums he reviews, but vultures 1 was pure trash. Case closed.
Anthony has no issues reviewing rappers who rap about murdering young black teens. But when Kanye says something he doesn‚Äôt like, he‚Äôs ‚Äúunreviewable‚Äù
yapfest
Fantano not wrong thoü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
As a critic, you <b>must</b> separate the art from the artist. The failure to do this is the fundamental failure of being a critic.<br><br>A biased critic is no critic at all.<br><br>If you&#39;re criticizing art, but you&#39;re letting your personal and/or political opinions get in the way of the objective criticism of said art, then your criticism is worthless.
Clearly your thoughts, and anyone else&#39;s who speaks ill, don&#39;t matter. #1 baby!!
Don&#39;t ever step a foot in Szabadsz√°ll√°s
Don‚Äôt care he made wolves
the melon, is bald
How is this not trending????
if it was called To Pimp a Vulture, it would have gotten a 10/10
i just like kanye
fantano is a goofy fr what a pathetic guy
Does anybody actually CARE
Idk sounds like you liked it. I know I did
Why could he not just review the album and then give his thoughts on Kanye.
Through your title you‚Äôve insinuated that unilaterally a piece of music is not a piece of music worthy of critique because you deem it so. You also add to this by insulting the intelligence of anyone who did approach the album without bias, which is odd because we were actually doing your job. You are a music lover. A music lover should know and appreciate that not everyone shares the same taste. That doesn‚Äôt render what you don‚Äôt like invalid it just isn‚Äôt your choice of music. If you don‚Äôt know that then how are we supposed to take you seriously. If you went in with your mind made up already with this piece of music how are we to take any review seriously?
bro just yappin about how he doesn&#39;t like Kanye
soy
boooo
Blah blah blah ü§ìü§ìü§ìü§ìü§ì
That was weird.
thats why ur wife dumped u gg
It‚Äôs just music man. Enjoy it
Yedolf stans proving his point in these comments
he made graduation
Dam yo Kanye really hurt this man , like on a deep level lmao
How can you chose this album over Jesus is king oh you Jewish ü§¶üèΩ
This guy is a joke lmao you dont have music taste nor are you a smart human like me you goofy
I bet this same virtue signaling Fantano is also calling for the genocide of Jews in Israel in some Twitter burner. Liberal hypocrisy
This is so fucking lame, Either review or don&#39;t, rather that take the moral high ground on your soapbox. He said he was Christian, and required to love everybody, even hitler. How the fuck can people so consistently take this out of context. Fuck off, unsubbed.
&#39;the hoes gonna love this one&#39;
You still got the album didn‚Äôt ya üòÇ
If this was Kanye with Kid cudi instead of Ty and was made years ago you‚Äôd give it a 10
Man, this guy.. I bet he‚Äôll blame the dislikes he gets for (Kanye fans attacking him) but as a guy who appreciates music for what it is and in a true non biased opinion. His reviews always seem to have a biased view.. like even if I fucking hate a song. I won‚Äôt dis or down it. I‚Äôd just say it‚Äôs not for me. I try and evaluate what said artist put in in the studio and respect them for the effort‚Ä¶. Give em homage in the good parts of their song so it‚Äôll influence them to make a better song. Not shit constantly wait for another project just to do the same thing.. we‚Äôre talking music and art guy. Not personal life
Bro looks DRAINED
Excited for unreviewable 2 üòä
Sounds like a hater but it‚Äôs ok
If this album was called &quot;hair&quot; he would&#39;ve gave it a 10 out of 10.
Left when you limped back after the Fader hit piece, check back periodically to see if you&#39;ve recovered. Clearly not. If it&#39;s &quot;unreviewable,&quot; then no one wants an unrelated 7-minute rant from a music reviewer. See you again in probably a few years I guess.
all you fanboys are wrong stfu Anthony Fantano on top bruhhh<br><br>(But it aint his worst, its like a 4 AT LEAST)
vultures is number one in israel btw
Just review the damn album instead of reviewing the person for 6 minutes and then picking out two songs that you dislike and only talking about them. I&#39;ve seen random people on the internet review the album better than you
This ain&#39;t it Tony.
Sellout
Daily reminder that Soythony Baldano tried painting Oliver Anthony as a racist for the line &quot;Rich Men North of Richmond&quot; as it was a south vs. north thing and not referring to Washington ie. politicians.
lumberjack arthur with another awful take
There‚Äôs such a negative bias in your review here that you‚Äôre even commenting on how he handles his marriage üòÇ who gives a shit if he ‚Äúparades her around‚Äù they‚Äôre both adults who can run their marriage how they see fit. Just say you hate Kanye lmao I mean my boy you gave Sexy Red an 8 and all she does is dance around half naked
I don&#39;t think this is the same guy who gave Kids See Ghosts 10.
Review‚ùå political opinion‚úÖ
Saying his fans are all weirdos for liking or listening to his stuff is kinda weird. Might be wrong about this tho but he‚Äôs got a few fun listens on there
Just review the music nobody cares about your opinion on anything else
keep ur head up Ant! Dont let the bastards grind u down, keep doing ur work!
Carnival and Beg forgiveness goes hard.
Trash review as always. Keep up the good work!
Gave Sexyy Red an 8 btw
unwatchable 1
This thumbnail is hilarious.
Idk not a single person can tell me exactly, ( in quotes) what he said that was antisemitism‚Ä¶ like I need a direct quote. And the whole loving hitler thing was him giving an example of what Christianity should be ie ‚Äúlove thy enemies
No way bro said its his worst album when JIK exists
If it was called to pimp a vulture it would have been a 10
this video has 42.000 dislikes i didn t know people still dislike
Kanye‚Äôs a Semite so calling him anti is wrong. Every one of your complaints in the first half of the video is leftist and feminist rhetoric. You‚Äôre so insulated as to who controls the media, economy, wars and pharmaceuticals etc. Just a coincidence it‚Äôs the tiny hat group right? Youre really reaching.
Talk about the album not about all the controversy sounds like your reviewing his antics more then his music ü´µüëé
Your review gets a 1.
don‚Äôt let the kanye stans silence you
Thank you for promoting the album
I honestly doubt you had any opinion whatsoever when Jewish (amongst other races) professors taught an entire generation of American youth that white people and men are evil. It honestly gets a little boring listening to you try to hide your political bias behind moral grandstanding.<br><br>I guess it&#39;s only Jewish people that are completely untouchable and cannot be held personally accountable for anything. When white people hire their own race, it&#39;s racism, but when jewish people hire their own race/religion, don&#39;t mention it.<br><br>When you look at the way in which Jewish people within the music industry have held black artists down over the past 100 years with predatory contractual agreements, it&#39;s easy to understand why Kanye is doing everything he can to piss off certain people.<br><br>As a music reviewer you&#39;re supposed to focus on the music, not the politics or personality of the person behind it, but trust me when i say that we&#39;re all adult enough to have forgiven you if you reviewed the album. <br><br>This album is a strong 6 to a light 7 by the way. it has a lot more focus than Donda and the production is a tighter, but the peaks are most certainly lower. The best song on this album wouldn&#39;t rank in the top 5 against the Donda tracklist, but nonetheless a very servicable album.
this review sucks
Goddamn, this has 40% dislikes üòÇüòÇüòÇ
I respect this. Integrity.
Melon you‚Äôre a joke now
love how the comments are perfectly proving his point lmfao
even my mom likes vultures
If the album was called ‚Äúvultures gangsta edition 1‚Äù he would have given it a 11/10
Kind of odd to accuse Kanye of objectifying his wife, without ever mentioning her name and only calling Bianca Censori Kanyes wife, feels a bit ironic no?
Good for you Anthony you cant afford to get canceled. But music is music you can review his art, yes he said a couple of lines that are sus, but when he was saying ninja the whole album its okay .‚ù§
He&#39;s not antisemitic lmao, it&#39;s kinda obvious what he meant, he just doesn&#39;t think stuff over too well.  But w.e man, you&#39;re PC, SJW, will never be cancelled, good job. Stick to music, wtf is this social commentary political bs.
reviewed convicted criminals and murders, but anti semite is where you draw the line lol
This the most glazed poindexter dedication of energy you could have spent
Anthony with the first ever exclusive reviewüî•üî•üî•Kanye one of the üêê‚Äôs
Wait melon! You didn&#39;t like North west&#39;s and Ty dolla $signs song?!?! Talking was good!!!!
I defended Kanye for YEARS, but couldn&#39;t do it when he embraced the whole Trump MAGA nonsense. I can&#39;t do it. Narcissistic insufferable ignorance to a fault and for spite, is something that can&#39;t be changed. When Taylor Swift turns out to be the one with the steadier head on her shoulders, then you KNOW Kanye is effed up. Eff Kanye. Was a HUGE fan, now I can&#39;t even hear his songs.
The album wasn‚Äôt his best but unreviewable is ridiculous, it was a overall good album
I miss the old melon. straight from the go melon.<br>I hate the new melon.The bad mood melon.<br>Hating on Kanye melon.<br>I miss the sweet melon.Liking Kanye music melon.<br>I got to say at that time I want it to meet melon.
kanye did not thing wrong<br><br>he&#39;s still #1
You are antisemitic and you are dodging for Kanye, what a let down, bald guy
Who gives a duck, review the music
YE&gt;&gt;&gt;
Album was ‚õΩÔ∏è
I like his music, so imma keep on listening
Face it Fantano, you‚Äôre on the wrong side of history. Do better.
Bro you Litterally are being unfair to himü§£ every album he comes out with changes the sounds of rap that we hear damn near every album. Obviously this man doesn‚Äôt know good music and I‚Äôm not even a Kanye d rider
kek. Fantano comes off as such a uncultured whiney brat.<br><br>He could&#39;ve just said the album isn&#39;t good, but nah he instead wanna cherrypick lyrics and act as if Kanye is a worse person than most of the hip-hop artists he reviews. <br><br>Corrupt jews have been taking advantage of the black community for ages now (especially in music industry) and Fantano wants to ignore it and then also bash the latest guy speaking out... why? because he simply hates kanye. <br><br>Fantano&#39;s political ideology is based on false pretenses because he just wants to pick a side and not actually pick authentic values and virtues. He doesn&#39;t care about what someone has to say because he&#39;s made up his mind, just like how the jewish corrupt execs want him to think.<br><br>Many rappers &amp; groups (for example: Public Enemy, Lupe Fiasco, Clipse) have called out the blatant corrupt dirty jewish agenda in their lyrics. Where is the comment on them? LOL, there is jack shit because he cherrypicks and just wants to out Kanye as a bad guy and completely ignore real injustices.<br><br>the undeniable facts are that jewish execs in music industry are beyond corrupt and been putting artists down forever.<br>you wouldn&#39;t see anti-semitism in hip-hop otherwise.<br><br>I know the truth hurts, but what hurts more is knowing these people in power are doing everything to suppress real cultural diversity. And they want to convince you you&#39;re a hateful person if you don&#39;t stand up to real corruption.
Anthony, please, only music
I cannot take your opinion of Kanye‚Äôs new album serious if you gave a sexyy redd an 8 page just full of bad takes üíØ
I fuckin hate this guy
You should review the music not the person smh
Can you just review it and not be a grumpy gremlin. Some of the songs are pretty g. Favourite is vultures Havoc Version
Most importantly not reviewable cause Kanye is a nazi
LMAOOOOO YOURE A LOSER
LOL!!! Great way to Isolate Kanye fans. This review is exactly the definition of what you are criticizing. &quot;I can&#39;t criticize album bc of the pro kanye bandwagon&quot; but at the same time you can&#39;t separate yourself from the Kanye hatin wagon..... .SOOOOO objectivity?
Review your ex wife
What happened to fantano
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=306">5:06</a> naaaaaah Melon, You lost me right there. Paid is a goated song
Keep crying about it
Mr bald man,<br><br>You give good ratings to literal murderers.<br><br>You are a hypocrite
fantano doesn&#39;t want to review kanye west for ethical reasons, but reviewing travis scott is fine<br>so i am forced to conclude that fantano views espousing antisemitism as being worse than directly causing the deaths of ten people
fun fact!!! Fantano is divorced
Pretty interesting how you could have left the album with no review if you felt so strongly on the matter but instead you wanted to make a quick buck off Kanye‚Äôs name, so you released this video which will only bring more attention to the media you apparently hate so much.
Review the album not him
fun fact!!! Fantano is divorced
first billy joel now this
Lame
the yap master
So Kanye saying slavery was a choice wasn‚Äôt the tipping point for you but the Jewish comments were? How does this make sense?
the views üò≠üò≠üò≠
So biased
I think volatility of the fanbase at Fantano to his video is really just strengthening his points further.
Wrong
&quot;Hey everybody look at me I&#39;m a good person LOOK GUYS LOOK&quot;
love ye
We don‚Äôt accept you in hip hop even if you had an opinion it means shit üòÇ
I bet your divorce papers are unreviewable too
album of the year.
This dude is zestier than drake
this is all just one big wojack meme
BEST ALBUM I EVER HEARD
Such a W album
Here is his actual review of unreviewable 1 (according to the stream) :<br><br>Stars : liked the beat, liked the chorus, hated the jews bar and argued it was the main reason why you can‚Äôt dissociate the arr from the artists<br><br>keys to my life : liked a lot of the bars and some part of the production, thought it was still pretty boring overall<br><br>paid : hates kanye‚Äôs elmo voice, likes the chorus but thinks it‚Äôs just a worst version of fade<br><br>talking : likes it, thinks it‚Äôs cute and interesting but he is perplexed by the facts it‚Äôs just two small songs loosely tied together<br><br>come back to me : don‚Äôt hate the beginning, however hates kanye‚Äôs verse, said it was his worst chorus ever, liked freddy gibbs part, said it was easy for him to dominate the mediocrity of the record<br><br>hoodrat : said it‚Äôs the worst mix of kanye‚Äôs discography, sounds line death grips but worst<br><br>do it :  said it was his favorite track mainly because there isn‚Äôt much kanye, said he would listen to it if it was on a ty dolla sign record<br><br>paperwork : likes the brazilian phonk sample, think it sounds like a bad yeezus leftover, dislike the progression and thinks it‚Äôs a mess held together by a good beat<br><br>burn : thinks it‚Äôs fine but sounds line generic 2000‚Äôs pop song, that it‚Äôs ty rapping over a youtube beat, said 2005 kanye was a breath of fresh air from songs like this<br><br>fuk sumn : didn‚Äôt said much, mocked kanye and carti because he thought they were cringe, said the vocal mix were bad and sounded like a podcast<br><br>vultures : skipped it because he already reviewed and would rather have the havoc version, in his previous reviews he said the song was trash and poorly mixes with awful bars, but he liked Dirk verse and the synth<br><br>carnival : thinks it sounds like an awful 2010 edm trap style that we already heard before, mocked carti and skipped his verse, thought kanye‚Äôs lyrics was him projecting <br><br>beg forgiveness : said it sounds like a donda leftover, thought it was too long with a weird pathing, liked ty‚Äôs verse but thought it missed something<br><br>good don‚Äôt die : said it sounded like black eyed peas and that it wasn‚Äôt really going anywhere <br><br>problematic : didn‚Äôt said much, just said it was a mix between a mid bound 2 and a mid all of the lights, criticized the reference bar, saying it is extremely deshumanising<br><br>king : just said it had an awful mix, and that him saying he is an antisemite is a proof that he is an antisemite<br><br>overall : said the albums could be good if it was song like do it without kanye doing cringe antisemitic bars and being egotistical, said it was his worst album and that he could do whatever he wants his fans will still praise him
Anthony brings up politics over music‚Ä¶.. what is your platform based off of ?
FANTANO trying to put out an objective and well thought out review challenge (impossible)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=264">4:24</a> ‚Äúlook at these lyrics‚Äù holds up the funniest lyrics i‚Äôve ever seen
You‚Äôre so woke dude. Hope you‚Äôre proud.
Interesting take on the fandom ‚Äî but devil‚Äôs advocate here, what if you don‚Äôt like him nor the lyrics, but you can appreciate the tune, the production and the talent?<br><br>On your argument that you can‚Äôt separate the art and the artist, how about the hundreds of supposedly cancelled directors, writers, YouTubers, content creators, and musicians? JK Rowling and HP? Picasso? Or what about just Chris Brown?<br><br>Don‚Äôt you have to bundle them all? I‚Äôd argue there is value to the art of even the worst of people because it tells us something about ourselves.<br><br>But if your point is to not just put money in his pocket by not recommending it, then that is respectable I guess. I just don‚Äôt think there really is no value in it.
‚ÄúIf only Kanye had talked about robbing, shooting and murdering people instead of the Jews, than this album would be okay‚Äù - Fa*tano<br><br>TND Been doing damage control ever since 2016
Bro is just reviewing kanye
at this point bro is just hating
anthony soytano back at it again
Says he isn‚Äôt going to review the album. Continues to review the album. I use to love this dude. What a joke. Unfollowing.
bro <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=175">2:55</a> is the ‚Äúusing my platform for good‚Äù cringe that made me stop watching fantano in high school
Nice politics melon. Definitely need them in your reviews more often. definitely help your channel!
This album is amazing melon head needs his meds only reason its unreviewable is cus he dont like kanye as a person
ok jew
if it was called ‚Äú To Pimp A Vulture‚Äù you would have gave it a ten.
Went into the album wanting to shit on it  but I actually enjoy it quite a bit. Sorry Anthony üôÅ
hey at least you listened to it i guess lol
Ok but, is the album good or not? We don&#39;t really care about your &quot;former alt right youtuber&quot; guilt, just say if the music is good or not. We all know how problematic he is, there is no need for you to tell everyone that, just say if this is good music. If you don&#39;t want to, if you don&#39;t care talking about a racist schizo then just don&#39;t talk about him, don&#39;t make a 7 minutes video to profit on Vultures if you really think it doesn&#39;t even deserve a review.
The disc is amazing
to pimp a vulture
Jesus fantano, what the hell is wrong with you?
Dude got a vibe with Ye, I don&#39;t aggree with Kanyes anti-semitism. Yes Ye has many flaws. But come on his new album is dope asf. I give that album a 9/10...
Hey fantano, do you remember your burzam review, when you said you ‚Äúdon‚Äôt care if they burned down churches or are racist‚Äù but hey go you
It was indeed a bad album.
I miss the old Kanye. I don‚Äôt like whatever he has become.
He made graduation
you will be divine punished by mr big titty for that mark my wordsüôèüòà
He said ‚Äúlookin LIKE a reference‚Äù not that she was ‚Äújust‚Äù a reference. Man this channel truly sucks now. <br><br>Why do people even listen to you?<br>You stay supporting Sexy Redd‚Äôs nonsense that‚Äôs actually destroying the black community. <br>What she talks about is just fun and games to you huh? She gets that meaningless 8 out of 10 huh?
as a jew myself, i think you should just tell us what you thought of the album, even if it was a 10/10 for you i wouldn&#39;t think that you agree with everything he said and did.
Same guy that gave sexy redd a strong 8 üíÄ
how come you haven&#39;t covered a single tigers jaw record over all these years.
FANTANO L
Are you a music reviewer or a political commentator?
listen to &#39; b r a s s r i n g &#39; by tuxedo mask Melon, it will make you feel better.
i do agree with this video, but i do think that the ‚Äú3 types of kanye fans‚Äù topic was very underdeveloped. while they are rare at this point in time, there are fans of kanye whom dont support any of his actions since 2022, and very much dislike this album and the music hes been putting out recently. to say that the 3 types of kanye fans doesnt include the one that i specified does feel ignorant and maybe even arrogant to say. besides that though, this is a good video and i do agree with it
Anthony rides Ye like a carnival
LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
Bro didn&#39;t even review a song Just told me his opinions on kanye new album and just dipped.Hey melon man review the album.
It&#39;s ya bestie miss miss Westie
Lil bro, kanye dont know you
bro yappingüíÄ
or I just like his music! <br>goofball
&quot;vultures 1 is unreviewable&quot; <br>Proceeds to post a 7 minute rant about the album
I think the better question is:<br><br>Why can‚Äôt you argue against the things he says instead of just saying aNti-SeMite?<br><br>It‚Äôs almost as if all the points he made about Jewish control and the inability to criticize Jewish systems of power‚Ä¶ but having the same people criticizing wHiTe systems of power‚Ä¶ are proven true by people like you and your inability to deny his points.<br><br>Weird how that works, huh?
Anthony &quot;Israel is literally geocoding Palestinians&quot; Fantano needs to do some more research on antisemitism. Might be closer to home than he thinks.
Im still confused how peggy got mixed up in this
As xqc said, why didn‚Äôt you do this when all the other rappers talk about murdering innocent people. Kanye isn‚Äôt even near that bad. Separate the art from the artist.
I‚Äôm the second one lol
Bro you a hater
Fantano making this covert review so he can get ad revenue:<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m just here to get paid!&quot; üé∂
thats why your wife left you
Funny calling Ye anti-semitic while you support Hamas
The fact it has quotation marks around crazy,bipolar,antisemite makes it seem like that‚Äôs what people are calling him. I‚Äôm not 15 so you might not try to argue about it with me. How‚Äôs the wife btw?
I can‚Äôt believe people have horrible taste for music because this album was trash and if you say otherwise you need help
This album was fuckin amazing n ian even one of them weirdo kanye fans
Just a reminder that this guy also gave one of the best rap albums ever,mbdtf,a 5/10 ,idk why people think his opinion is even relevantüíÄüíÄüíÄ
Fantano gonna rant on twitter on how kanye ‚Äúdegenerates‚Äù are harrassing him any time now
if the album was called &quot;to pimp a vulture&quot; you would give it a 10
If it was called To Pimp A Vulture it wouldve been given a 10
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=336">5:36</a>. You get the pass!?
do what you get paid for: review the music
is good album tho
I think you‚Äôre self projecting when you call his fan‚Äôs life meaningless. I think hating on Kanye gives your life meaning.
Fantano should be canceled.
If it was called To Pimp a Vulture you would‚Äôve given it a 10
The Fader won
White knighting for his ‚ÄúJewish‚Äù fans went into it already wanting to hate it‚Ä¶this review is full bias SMH
It ain‚Äôt that serious bro
I love when a guy who is supposed to review music decides to spew his political viewpoints all over YouTube‚Ä¶ all while complaining that an artist shouldn‚Äôt be able to talk about his political views.<br><br>Hypocrisy at its finest.
my advice to you, if you want to be a respected music journalist you can‚Äôt put your obvious bias against kanye as a person into your reviews
You ain&#39;t recovering from that sexy red album review
Hey Melon, WHY YOU MAAAAD?
bro the lyrics don&#39;t really matter to me. i mean they do if they&#39;re good, but if they aren&#39;t idc. i just like how it sounds.
The only thing interesting about this project was ty dollar sign lol made me want another ty dollar sign album ye sounded uninspired üòÇ
You literally just said that depressed kids lives are meaningless. There you go, the left hypocrisy.
L
Wtf has happened to fantano bro, last time I watched him he was a normal person and reviewed an album instead of insulting the person who made the album and refusing to review it because his views and beliefs don‚Äôt align with someone else‚Äôs
Melon just mad he can&#39;t post his wife three times on instagram
everything you said in this video is true and kanye fans are dummies
Anthony cucktano
If it‚Äôs unreviewable then why make a video on it? Oh right, it‚Äôs your most viewed video in three months. If you really wanted to penalize Kanye for his opinions then stop trying to make money off his name.
Why would you not review the album? You have reviewed artists that are worse people
Did your wife leave you because you just argue with 15 year old online all day instead of spending time with her?
he&#39;s jewish
I have no problem with the review at all, if he feels that way it‚Äôs understandable &amp; his opinion BUT implying he‚Äôs a  mysoginst bc of the way he posts his wife &amp; said she‚Äôs a reference in a line when he‚Äôs defending ice spice, sexy red and WAP for women embracing their bodies is fucking stupid. All of a sudden his wife can‚Äôt dress how she wants and it‚Äôs a man fault but the other way round it‚Äôs liberating? LMAO
‚ÄúYour opinion don‚Äôt change the show cost.‚Äù
Find god.
I don&#39;t like the album and think Kanye&#39;s a twat. I also think you&#39;re a lemon for not reviewing this. Of course you can separate Kanye&#39;s art from his persona. He&#39;s been rapping absolute nonsense about women, about black people for years. Remember when he said slavery was a choice? Taking Kanye seriously is like listening to the crazy homeless dude outside your supermarket. <br><br>4/10. Good (don&#39;t die) is awesome, rest is sh*t
The Kanye subreddit is having a full blown meltdown over this üòÇ
I&#39;m one of those that left a couple years ago
fuck what he says i just like the music. (but bbtbnwjdfotsyk)

Man, I am Ukrainian, and I understand your words so much. We were listening to russian music before big war. But after terror that russia made to us it‚Äôs not even an art at all. I cannot listen and assess that culture cause this is disgusting. <br>I don‚Äôt understand Kanye, nacism, racism and shit like that destroys the society
bro this album&#39;s weird.
Kanye West went into Omni Man mode and basically called his wife a Pet
They cookin u in the comments section lil bro üíî
Bro literally reviewed murderers of innocent ppl yet draws the line here
Did this guy forget Kanye has bipolar disorder? I grantee he‚Äôs in the camp where people cry about mental health, yet here he is complaining about Kanye‚Äôs maniac episode.
I can&#39;t believe its the same guy who did runaway and I wonder. genuinely hard to believe he&#39;s downgraded this much
It‚Äôs so good he doesn‚Äôt feel worthy of reviewingüî• good call egghead
hey
Divorcedthony Washedtano
The Jewish community is anti black
Bald reviewer turns into mald reviewer
Back to Me is a bop!!!
What about the other artist featured on the project?? Sound engineers, producers, song writers? It&#39;s art whether you like the artist or not. I would have respected this opinion if Fantano didn&#39;t listen to the album BUT YOU LISTENED TO THE ALBUM WITH YOUR COMMUNITY. This video is such obvious clickbait because no one actually respects his opinions anymore. This guy is such a weirdo now.
What a idiot. Such a DF
hypocrisy
6 mins kanye&#39;s public image review and 1 min actual music review
This entire stand of you can‚Äôt separate the artist from the art is the worst take in history. It only exposes the effect media brainwashing on what‚Äôs good and bad has on him. How many artist commit crimes and no one thinks about that to determine if the music is good? We know nothing about artist but we know how innately nasty that world is. But they are projected to  us as perfect. A lot of these artist have to sell themselves to make it. We think about that when we listen to the art? It‚Äôs a stupid thing to say because it‚Äôs not true. You don‚Äôt like this person for what he said and should just say I can‚Äôt review this album. People would respect you more for that. But this fake moral stance bs it‚Äôs just embarrassing to watch. Jayz sold crack to pregnant women you don‚Äôt separate that from the art? That‚Äôs not more evil then anything Kanye has said? Diddy for years had these allegations people in media just covered it up they didn‚Äôt separate from the art? It‚Äôs fake and makes you look like a bald virgin who can‚Äôt get women even if they paid.
something lost in all the memes and jokes is how profoundly depressing kanye&#39;s career and art have been from a historical standpoint. he went from being a genuinely pro-social artist who simultaneously created some of the best pop &amp; rap hits of the 2000s into a straight up nazi that&#39;s revealing how fascistic and predatory the hip hop industry has become. as much as i loved yeezus, we really should&#39;ve seen this coming once his obsession with brutalism and euro-fashion dominated his aesthetics.<br><br>i wish we could say much better about his contemporaries like jay z, or drake, but they&#39;re all kind of evil capitalists themselves anyway, not even mentioning the grooming/predatory behavior in those two cases (and also kanye&#39;s own sexual harassment issues.) shit, even meek mill is out there watching candace owens as we speak.<br><br>such a waste of sound. i can&#39;t believe that even jpegmafia of all ppl folded on his principles to work with this asshole
yeah wow anthony i didnt really expect you to make an entire parody album of vultures except youre just shitting on kanye and his experiences but thats really brave of you!
Bro is such a pretentious loser its so cringe
i just wanna hear your opinion on the music, i don‚Äôt care ab your political opinion at all
The video starts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=304">5:04</a>. You&#39;re welcome.
damn dude you‚Äôre getting old
he made graduation tho
Amthony Fantano will review music from anti-white racists and actual murderers but god forbid someone is anti-Semitic<br>Being anti-Semitic is bad sure but keep it consistent
God get this guy off the internet

I mean melon all he did was call out the faction behind closed doors wich are primarily Jewish and they got upset and call him anti semite when he‚Äôs just saying it without a filter , and they have robbed more artists and left a lot of artists either dead or broke because of the trickery behind their contracts Kanye signed a deal where he has to make music for the rest of his life that‚Äôs modern day slavery and all for the benefit of the company and people he signed to I can say most likely Jewish there‚Äôs a reason for why he says what he says from his point of view I don‚Äôt even believe he‚Äôs being anti sematic the Israel president is worst than Kanye if you ask me but that‚Äôs another story
You review anti white artists all the time, funny how the energy changes depending on which race it is

review your divorce
Idk man, why talking about it then ? You‚Äôre taking part of the hype by giving him that ‚Äúspecial‚Äù review, that‚Äôs how Kanye‚Äôs roll outs work, for better and for worse.
Ye is the still the number 1 artist globally.

I just don&#39;t even understand how anybody can be so bothered about what ANYONE has to say about ye. Y&#39;all know he&#39;s not gonna fuck you for defending him against the melon&#39;s mean words right?
You are supposed to review music not start labeling ‚Äúfans‚Äù if we do that then your fan base would be 1.dumbo the bimbo 2. Twinkostink 3.talentless
Hypocrisy
This dude is bald and sucks
Dramatic af just review the album lmfao
Worst Video youve ever done, Liberal trash
Fantano rate your divorce papers
Squinting to read the script that was written for you and paid by another clown doesn‚Äôt achieve anything. Keep cashing those checks because you need them.
separate the art from the artist
Everything bro said in this video was true.
loser lol
How he felt after naming it unreviewable 1: ü•∂ü•∂ü•∂ü•∂
Since 2022 Fantano has made it his mission to BE THE MOST DIVORCED MAN IN HISTORY
i am listening to a review of an album i didn‚Äòt listen to and i don‚Äòt wanna listen to and i completely agree. crazy times.
guys dont listen to the guy who gave sexyy redd a 9/10, Kanye unreviewable trash? fantano has officially been bought
if kanye was lgbtq or 100 gecs youd review it
What do you think about people who don‚Äôt wanna give vultures time of day but still love something like late reg, Ye etc?
no way this isn‚Äôt rage bait
I would call myself a Kanye fan, this album however is shit. I got three songs in and do not have any intention of finishing it it, I turned song three off mid track and called it a day. It is, without question pure ass.
YE da üêê or nah?
so salty, you&#39;ve been pegged with a block of salt.
&quot;tell the jews in your audience&quot; what? That their home state has grown into a nazi parade?
Boring coward
Melon please review hella by 1999 WRITE THE FUTURE
This is cringe within cringe. üòÇ
This review has nothing to do with the music.<br>Anthony is just another mad NPC
Can‚Äôt believe I used to watch every video from this absolute clown
Who ain‚Äôt cash a check off my name?
you a real one for that melon!
Bro just do the review man, it&#39;s not a bad album. I&#39;m not defending him by any means, but TY didn&#39;t do anything wrong and he really contributed to this album. This is a solid album, and I honestly think it&#39;s more consistent than Donda. I would give it an 8/10.
Yikes bro‚Ä¶ Fantano hella salty
ü§ì
If beautiful big titty butt naked women fell out the sky you know Anthony, you wouldn‚Äôt have such a lack of hair.
Lol this is so soft and has nothing to do with the actual music
Bro was being more positive and fair with donda 2...<br><br>I used to love fantano for his genuine unbiased opinions on music<br><br>Sure, he may have been wrong a couple times but he was honest <br><br>This seems like he is purposefully hating and ripping apart this album for the sake of provoking the people who may have been pissed off at his other kanye reviews<br><br>And i hate when he has reasoning behind rating an album something besides his own opinion, i valued that he rated swimming a 3 originally but he re reviewed it and gave it a higher score purely because of macs passings, which is respectful but dishonest<br><br>Vultures is finished and even if he isnt impressed by it, you have to admit that it isnt completely unlistenable
he&#39;s just here to get paid
The album was good man, kanye is an asshole, but just calling every kanye fan either a white supremacist or a weirdo basically is idiotic
It&#39;s ok to have wrong oppinions melon, i forgive you for this one
No one cares about your politics. Just review the album.
Fantano is soooooooo predictable.
i disagree
I&#39;m a Jew and honestly your support made my day better fr
If you don‚Äôt support Kanye and are pissed off at the things he‚Äôs said recently, that‚Äôs completely acceptable. But what I don‚Äôt understand is, why keep talking about him at this point? You clearly don‚Äôt give a shit about anything having to do with Kanye anymore, or care to listen to his music, so why do an hour livestream reacting to it where you argue with fans the whole time? why involve yourself in a fan base you hate so much, going back and forth with them on twitter? It‚Äôs pathetic and seems that you‚Äôre more interested in cashing a check off the negativity instead of sticking to your beliefs, it would have been more respectable to put out a statement that you‚Äôre n longer interested in talking about or reviewing Kanye going forward.
Those crazy teen kanye fans in the comments, just don&#39;t have a clue of what is music
Man I love seeing all the Kanye fans coping in the comments and making videos bashing this guy
i really don‚Äôt like you
Common Jew behavior
Bollocks. You just conform to overall opinion and go along with it. IT should be about misic,not your personal opinion/view. Your unreviewable review made me reaching out to have a listen to this album (not a fan of Kanye in any possible way) and I like it. I really like what I hear.
The fact that some people take this guys every word as gospel is insane to me (and I‚Äôm talking melon man not Kanye). <br>As someone who does think Kanye is an asshole and that everything he‚Äôs dropped since Pablo has sucked, THIS album is actually pretty damn good. What kind of music critic is unable to review the ACTUAL MUSIC due to a handful of lines that reflect the artists shitty opinions? Even if it was every single line it‚Äôs not as if lyrics alone make up an album. Absolute joke of a critic.
Does this means it‚Äôs a 6 or a 7??
ye own you clown
Fanboys coping hard with &quot;what about other rappers? &quot;, &quot;It&#39;s not that bad&quot; or &quot;youre just biased&quot;. <br>If I say even half the degenrate Stuff about black People like Kanye said about Jews, I would get beat up in the Street. Too bad his Fans are lost.
Looks like Anthony is going to receive a vegan cookie recipe from ye
Fantano fell off. Bro is way too political. Just review the fucking music. That is your job.
But melon, it banged
This dude Anthony is so lame
This video just shows your bias towards an artist, which makes you a strong 2 to light 3 music critique
dont worry guys this is the same man who rated mbdtf a &quot;Light 6&quot; ... dont think his opinion holds much weight LOL
if kanye didn&#39;t have opinions that you disagreed with, you wouldve reviewed this far better. you&#39;re just so political brained that you can&#39;t thank about anything but it.<br><br>get a grip lad, your wife left you and the papers got leaked cuz you shat on destroy lonely LMAO
Not a Kanye fan at all.<br><br>But No1 is 83 countries.<br><br>There must be something there.
You love Kanye like Kanye loves Kanye it‚Äôs uncanny
Just review the album
I genuinely feel very bad and scared for you, Anthony, as I have looked up to you as an inspiration for music reviewing for so, SO many years. This was going to be a lose-lose situation no matter what you decided to do about it. To have so many brainwashed and ignorant people in this very comment section go after you like this has got to be draining on your mental health. I would take some time off of the main channel if I were you, but at the end of the day... it&#39;s YOUR channel. You can do what you want with it, right? Take care of yourself, Melon; the sane ones here want to see you happy and healthy. You have brushed off criticisms before... and you can surely do it again.‚ù§
that&#39;s cool and all but you love music with gang shootings and drugs and borderline rape so moot point
your cooked you old ahh kanye the goat
i absolutely loathe what he is doing do bianca
youre not listening melon, they making the twix bigger to make us fat
Stars, Keys To My Life, Back To Me, Burn, Beg Forgiveness, Problematic are all good songs.
Review ‚ÄúSUPERNOVA‚Äù of Ralphie Choo pleaseüôèüôèüôèüôè
No way he said n word at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=334">5:34</a> üò≠
‚Äúunreviewable‚Äù ‚Äútrash‚Äù<br>Review is in the second word. Thanks for the review.
/r/Kanye in shambles as we speak
This album is straight up bad.
To discredit Kanye‚Äôs art for the reason of him being anti-Semitic, is for Fantano to declare that morality is a pre-requisite for artistic merit.. aka if someone is immoral in Fanfano‚Äôs eyes, then their art doesn‚Äôt deserve to be taken seriously.   But nobody is morally perfect, including Fantano, and btw morality is a human construct- only god can judge Kanye.  The universe is immoral, Mother Nature is immoral, art is immoral.  Im not defending hate but Kanye isn‚Äôt breaking any laws and the art is way bigger than morality. Fantano disrespects God/art/life/us/himself by not allowing artists to paint with every color in the universe.
I dont know , what was more mid the album or the review üíÄ?
‚ÄúWho ain‚Äôt cashed a check off my name?‚Äù
If it was called Hood Vultures Princess by Sexyy West you would‚Äôve put it higher
I dont think anthony realises that in the song &#39;king&#39; hes referncing how people are calling him crazy antisemetic bipolar in the headlines but he remeains unbothered as hes still rich and famous
Kanye fans are absolutely fuming in these comments.
How can be an unreviewable album and still do a review? üòÇ <br>This man just wants polemic <br>Sad from you man
Black american antisemitism is toothless and largely marginal. Review the damn thing, you virtue signaling hipster.
so you are sayin that this record is beyond of good and evil?
all these tiktok ye fans fuming rn üíÄüíÄüíÄ
doing my part and dropping a nice dislike on it
Lol this guys trash and knows nothing about anythingüòÇ Kanye is right about everything he‚Äôs ever said he‚Äôs got no reason to feel sorry
So unreviewable basically means ‚ÄúI disagree with what this person has said so I‚Äôm not gonna review this album‚Äù? You could‚Äôve just titled it that lmao.
I own Jesus is King on blue vinyl.  I really do love it, but agree it WAS his weakest by a mile.<br><br>Vultures 1 and Donda are fucking garbage.  How can 1 man fall so much creatively.
This guy is such a clown lol
As a Kanye music fan, this album is not good. It‚Äôs pretty bad. Not sure what the brain rotted fans expect from a review. If he gave an objective one, it wouldnt be anything more than a 2-3. Sadly Kanye hasn‚Äôt made a great album front to back in over 5 years. He drops great songs here and there, but the days of consistent bangers is long over.
waaah waaah waah waaaaaah waaah waaaaah waaah wah waaaaaaaah waah waaaaaaaaaaaaahh waaaah
4. people who hate him but still would listen to his new music, if the lyrics wher anything but what they are. andthe music was good. which it wasnt.
this is honestly the most illogical unreasonable thing I have ever seen. You&#39;re basing it all on your feelings towards the artist and not the actual art/music. You gave Kanye an unreviewable rating, not vultures, so why not change the name of the title to Kanye is unreviewable. If Vultures was released with the same lyrics, production, and features and everything was the same just by a different artist you would be fine with it. Also, when you said the music is trash I mean who are you kidding it was clear in your live reaction that you had already based an opinion on the project before even listing it. You lack any form of consistency, you said that you can&#39;t separate the art from the artist. Ok, then why do you listen and give positive reviews to artists who talk about killing people? Does that not affect people? Also, hundreds of rappers have been reviewed and rated by you, and if you were to review them based on them personally as a human being they would be unreviewable. it&#39;s not reasonable to form an opinion on the music based on the person, because frankly, it has no impact on the music at its core. When it comes to lyrics as I said show some consistency you are fine reviewing people talking about murder, so why is there a problem now all of a sudden? fix up!
The irony is that he has wu tang clan album behind him and they are one of the most profoundly anti Asian racist groups of all time
your career is over, melon.
anthony i think you‚Äôre too woke and honestly your political and religious views are completely irrational and i disagree with almost everything.<br><br>With that said this is a completely legitimate review and i actually agree with your take here.
Disappointed from Melon here. As a Kanye fan can‚Äôt relate to any of the 3 options. You missed a fourth one. Those of us who separate the artist from its music. <br><br>Liked the album and far from being one of Kanye‚Äôs worsts.
first good fantano video ever
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=343">5:43</a> made me cackle laugh
Beautiful big production all inclusive 10/10 ye albums just don‚Äôt fall out the sky you know.
you couldve just not made a video and not given it any attention, but you are desperate for attention lol
Melon is so painfully socially correct that he forgot we want a review either way, so pressed its awkward to watch
Know you‚Äôre getting a lot of flaq, but I respect the decision. I‚Äôm not listening to that. Too much amazing groundbreaking music made by decent people to waste my time.
i personally really liked vultures, i dont think its his worst album ever but i do agree that its a lot messier than others, but some of the songs are actualy pretty good like carnival and stars. but i agree that kanyes behaviour has been incredibly rude and not on at all, but personally i can look past it and just listen to the music, however i understand why it can make you dislike the song entirely<br><br>also i respect all of antonys opinions that he states in the video
what r u doing lmao
At least mk.gee dropped a wonderful album
bro sounded like dwight schrute with that &quot;question: ...&quot;
I personally love kanyes music, he is my favorite artist. But i think that  the things he has said and has done are inexcusable. I personally think that he messed up with this album except a few songs.
Melon you&#39;re definitely a jew I mean YOU CAN TELL BY YOUR BIG HUGE thighs.
I‚Äôm an outspokenly ‚Äúseparating the art from the artist IS possible‚Äù person. This is one of those cases where I don‚Äôt think you can do that unless you get the instrumentals, and even there I wouldn‚Äôt buy any of it. I just hope dude gets better.
lol Kanye struck a personal note with mr fantano
I have Jewish friends who were massive fans but after he started saying all those things they haven&#39;t touched a single song of his
This video proves you have a third purpose with your videos, which is to cause a reaction or to use your giant platform and your (also dick riding) fans to fight for your opinion. You‚Äôre in a bubble if you think everyone is on board with cancel culture and cares about other people being offended.
Bro you literally went into this project with ZERO intentions of liking it , for emotional reasons that is CLEAR . Was this his best project ABSOLUTELY not not even close , but there were still some slaps in there , you‚Äôd know if you listened. But instead you got emotional. We‚Äôre actual fans . Not psychopaths like you mentioned . We fw his music and we don‚Äôt condemn him for suffering from mental illness we dont just say we support the mental health awareness for endorsements , we full on support it . Why this man feels like HE is relevant to OUR culture I‚Äôll never understand.
Honestly, for maybe the first time, I truly agree with Anthony 100%
if it was called &quot;to pimp a vulture&quot; you wouldve given it a 10
banger video from the melon
7 minutes of complaining about politics 0 minutes of reviewing music
ok
Negative XP scrambled this guys brainüòÇ
Not a review dont care.
These Kanye fans needs chill you act like he cares about your opinion
we love you Grotesqony Albumano. Stay strong please!!
Unparalleled Melon Man W
Virtue signaling much. Also, you totally reviewed the album.
Kanye fans malding
Fantano; you&#39;ve worked yourself into a shoot, brother. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
so we just dont separate the art from the artist good fantano
lol, this is just pure hate
So fantano is pro Israel
Le cringe melon at it again
he&#39;s too deep in the hate (rightfully so I get it) but i was able to just listen to it as music and i loved it ESPECIALLY KING AND PAID! King to me was an amazing way of saying despite all my failures and wrongdoings I am still a king, but it could also be intepretated as narcissim idrc. Paid was about the roxanne sample! ty dolla&#39;s verse explains it all &quot;you shake that ass, i throw that cash... you keep on saying I&#39;m just here to get paid&quot; loved the drums. I appreciate melon for making me reflect on just how hurtful the anti-semiticism is, i can imagine if he was saying this about black people or another community i hold dearly to my heart it would also be hard to focus on the music.
The fake self righteous act is a 0/0
Even if we separated the art from the artist, the album is terrible. The only redeeming factor is Freddie Gibbs. <br>Im done with Kanye, so I never gave it a chance, but if this was made by let‚Äôs say Denzel Curry the music aspect would be forgotten in a week because the lyrics are bad and the beats are flat.
This is the review of the fan base
L take
i mean its not his best album but this review is legit the definition of<br> &quot;the worst that she can say is no.&quot; her:
So he said if you are still a Kanye fan you are a bad/dumb person‚Ä¶<br><br>Maybe some of us have the ability to separate the art from the artist because we aren‚Äôt children. I GUARANTEE Anthony listens to Michael Jackson.
I think Melon will go down as one of the bravest heroes of the 21st century for this review
hey bald stop bringing in politics and review the silly little album
If the album was called to pimp a vulture you would‚Äôve given it a 10
He gotta admit, Fuk Sumn was reviewable.
Very liberal review.
This review will live in infamy.
You need to be debated and taken off your white boy echo chamber pedestal. No offense
The level of cope that Kanye fans are omitting is peak comedy
The fact that you have come onto your channel to create an attention grabbing titled video regarding Kanye West whilst he is trending says a lot to me... Anyway, I&#39;m just a random guy in the comments section üòÇ
Calling all Kanye fans Nazis and/or lonely teenage edgelords when he‚Äôs one of the biggest artists of our generation is crazy
This is such a bitch ass video, album is fire fuck all the other shit. Don‚Äôt mention ye or review his music at all if your gonna do all this BS
Got ya, so Kanye and everyone who likes Kanye is evil. Thats the only explanation of why someone may like his music lol this is Kanye derangement syndrome
I‚Äôd love to hear how Paid and Fade are at all similar excluding the similarly sounding song names.
This album is unreviewable so let&#39;s review Kanye&#39;s fandom instead üëç (It won&#39;t be a positive review tho)
everyone&#39;s hating but big respect to you for saying this Fantano. this album deserves nothing and neither does kanye for being the way he is
fantano show us your total minutes of the album consumed
The fact that you literally just skip through the songs and still drop the your review really solidifies the fact that your credit as a music reviewer is actual garbage and nobody should take your opinions seriously
you can indeed like the music and not the other stuff lemme prove it to you<br>Imagine a guy that doesn&#39;t speak english and likes the album for its instrumentals and flow! now tell me you can&#39;t only like the music.
no because this makes total sense on why he cant actually review the album<br>you cant really sperate the art from the artist in this case because kanye talks about all of the deplorable shit hes done in the songs themselves<br>and he doesnt apologize!!<br>this is completely fair and some people dont want to listen to an antisemetic loser talk about how he got away with it let alone fucking review him
Fantano looks like a terribly disappointed teacher reporting a problem child to his momma
I agree with most of what fantano is saying just think he did a crappy job explaining some parts
Just because you didn‚Äôt want to give Ye a ‚ÄúNot good‚Äù
Dude lost it long before 2022. His last good record was almost 15 years ago!
I just need a number pls
The Internet‚Äôs Cringiest Activist Nerd
ü§ìü§ìü§ìü§ìü§ìü§ìü§ìü§ìü§ì
4. fans who loved him for his older work and enjoy seeing his musical evolution as an artist 5. hip hop fans who enjoy seeing a new take on music (u always know you&#39;re going to get something different on a ye album especially compared to the rest of the industry) 6. fans who just like his music!!!
AM FAN NO*3 PROUDLY SO WHO GIVES A F IF HE LOVES HITLER  BRO RELEASED GRADUATION
Half the artists you have reviewed in the past have rapped and bragged about rape, murder and drugs etc. and many have even carried those acts out. Please tell us why that is acceptable but this is not.
review&quot; RUAB&quot; by &quot;dhanji&quot;
CARNIVAL!
Sexy redd got an 8, something is wrong hereü§£
Anthony fantano, living up to his infamacy!
It‚Äôs so funny to me that y‚Äôall are shocked when Kanye - a hateful and petty person - is met with that same energy. <br><br>The guy can‚Äôt get enough of being a terrible person and has ZERO reason to do so. He‚Äôs had an adoring fanbase for the longest time now. <br><br>But y‚Äôall get butthurt when Ant DARES to hold any ill will because of that. Lmao.  This is why people hold resentment towards Kanye fans, lack of awareness and constant white knighting for a mentally ill goofball.
‚ÄúNo more Mr. Nice Guy‚Äù ahh stare üíÄ
&quot;I only care about the music&quot;...you mean the anti-semitic music? Ok buddy.
I wish Kanye didn&#39;t go off the deep end man. He literally defined the 2000s for me and now I can&#39;t even really listen to his old shit without feeling kinda guilty
Calling his new wife a reference is literally him saying she‚Äôs a Kim replacement. The way she‚Äôs standing on the album cover is literally him trying to show off how much she looks like Kim from the back. That‚Äôs the entire purpose.
Sound like Adam sandler 8 crazy nights when you did that jay and silent bob impression lol
Kanye is the GOAT
Does this ‚ÄúHitler‚Äù guy have an album üíø
You gave sexy redd an 8 stfu
Ty said hey man.. I need to just be honest and talk about the check nonstop so people get my side on one song at leasssst üò©ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I was never a super kanye fan, But the fact that he continues to go down this path is just awful in many ways.. I hope at some point, Something wakes him up
Oh boy we have a chatter box
But does his opinion change the show cost tho? üòÇ
7 minutes of yapüò≠
His fans sound like swifties
Wonder why king von is reviewable and doesn‚Äôt offend the Jewish community or the somehow morally just fanbase of fantano that suddenly needs substance from rap artists
&quot;Paid&quot; and &quot;Carnival&quot; were disastrous
You are bald and your wife left you
7 minutes of yapping yet gives the album a 10
If it was called ‚ÄúIn the vulture over the sea‚Äù you would‚Äôve given it a 10
They should have the sane energy towards harv
Quick question. Is this worse than an a zero ?
Let‚Äôs see you put together a better track than Carnival, melon head
ü§ìerm this album is in fact unreviwable<br>man shut up
i dont agree w what kanye says on the album and the songs he mentions the jewish community or whenever he is derogatory i dont like that. but the genuine art and music where hes talking about actual topics is the music i can get behind. anthony will always be a dick rider imo he has certain points in this video
Heard your wife left you üòÇ
Based on this you would think every other artist he reviews are role models for society
Fantano makes mean and crude assumptions and of ye listeners whilst saying that‚Äôs why he doesn‚Äôt like him.
The album is extremely trash in my opinion but can you just shut up and talk about the music
Nice review you got there champ. Probably should change the title.
Man nobody care for you opinion üò≠üíÄ
You‚Äôve reviewed songs about drugs, sex, and murder. It‚Äôs only now that you can‚Äôt separate art from real life.
honestly i feel u, i cant support this guy anymore either
Opinions. Opinions people. Just opinions.
when vultures 2 come out<br>can you just be a music reviewer pls?<br>i wanted to know what u think about the pop-themed but also dark and villanous vibe of this project, not if kanye it¬¥s an idiot or not we all know that he¬¥s an idiot that can¬¥t separate some big jews head in the industry that maybe made him pass a bad time in his life from all the jews in the planet<br>i mean you give TLOP a fucking 8, &quot;famous&quot; make taylor swift fell like shit in that era everybody hated her and u wasn¬¥t dickriding with politics and moral shit like a twitter head would do like come on fantano u better than this :/
If this was called kids see nazis it&#39;d be a 10
Mimimi
Ty saying he‚Äôs just here to get paid is funny asf
bla bla bla i am a clout chasing hypocritical coward basically
What does his public image has to do with you skipping the carti verse for example? Separate the art from the artist if you want to be a respected reviewer
so fantano finally cancels kanye when he otherwise should have done so back in 2018
Blah blah blah I can‚Äôt separate art from artist blah blah blah a strong 9.5/10
YOU ARE TRASH YE IS KING üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Sanctimonious Melon
I also think you‚Äôve misinterpreted the line ‚Äúand my bitch looking like a reference‚Äù I think he means that she‚Äôs looking like a reference for other women to base their style/looks from coz she looks that good, not that he used Kim K as a reference
It is weird that people love him because of the music, but they still love him when the music becomes garbage.
bro got on here to virtue signal. this a music channel, not CNN
Kanye fans are worse than Taylor Swifts fans. I love Kanye&#39;s music but yall are in denial. This album is actual trash, unlistenable waste.
i think the kanye fans vs taylor fans beef is actually about who can be a worse and more obnoxious human being rather than about the music. the irony of them hating eachother over the exact things they do themselves is way too funny
shut up bozo
Big boy mad ye JQed the world ü•∫ü•∫
these comments are so mad LMAOOOO
What&#39;s the point of this? You&#39;re putting out a hate review to eat off the clout of a Kanye drop. Just don&#39;t review it if you feel that strongly. But you won&#39;t, because you&#39;re a hack capitalizing on the moment.
Drama queen reviews!
Melon is ok with Drake lusting after kids but nobody can touch his &quot;jewish fans&quot;
Is there room in your infinite wisdom for forgiveness, understanding or openness regarding his statements and actions? Or do you have to pollute him forever with your onesided negativ dirty view? Isn&#39;t it better to approach each other, talk to each other and resolve issues? Do you have to paint the one who sees himself as the good one as the bad one in order to set yourself apart? Is this the black and white live you feel comfortable in? Do you create the bad, as the seemingly good? He has made his position clear in many interviews. He has stated that he is not anti-Semitic, stated many other things, but you don&#39;t want this Ye. I guess you like him better as a bad guy than as a human being. So I can only tell you to grow up and open your eyes, otherwise your reviews are nothing more than uninformed rants, below the belt, not a true argument. You have no future with that.
Grumpy ahh
I don‚Äôt even know I‚Äôm subbed to you at this point. It‚Äôs quite obvious you can‚Äôt remove the artist from the art itself. I valued your opinion on music and subbed to your channel for your takes on albums I may have never listened to in the past but now a days all that seems to pop up on my feed with you in it are your hot takes and opinions on why artists are ‚Äúless than admirable human beings‚Äù simply cause they share different views than you. UNSUBBED
Wait<br>Drug dealing and killing:üëç<br>Saying something antisemitic and apologising:üëé
shut up and review the music, that is what people watch you for.
He put &quot;eh&quot; in the description, I think that means we can consider the official score to be a 5 or a 6
What mental disability do you suffer from?
When you play the record in reverse, it has Hitler&#39;s speech from 1939 in it!
Butthurt about words but when 26 thousand peple have died and still counting you wouldn‚Äôt say a word.
Like with Pink Floyd&#39;s Dark Side and Wizard of Oz, Kanye&#39;s Vultures 1 album is perfectly in sync with Leni Riefenstahl&#39;s Triumph of the Will movie üòÇüòÇ
God damn the 4th Reich is in these comments fighting for their livesüíÄ
this guy is so mad hahaha
Kanye&#39;s a bum now...
He gave sexy redd an 8 ain‚Äôt no way y‚Äôall listening his ratings a 4 year old have better opinion than this ngaüíÄüíÄ
3 MINUTES IN AND NO COMMENTARY ON ALBUM ITSFELF, GOOD JOB FANTANO!!!
Foucault is the most cited author in recent history, he was also a known pedo
Man, Back to Me is so good though common antony
I love how he reviewed the unreviewable, he is in his final form
He humiliated Taylor Swift on TLOP, he talked sh*t about the MeToo movement on Ye, but now you care SO much about his morality?? You‚Äôre just a scared hypocrite, Anthony
L take from the bald jew melon
this album was so ass
you&#39;re bald
This comment section is not passing the vibe check so I just wanna say that I appreciate you taking this stand, it is important and meaningful to continue to draw attention to how harmful Kanye‚Äôs rhetoric is. It‚Äôs sad that people care more about standing up for a mid-ass album then standing up against n*zis :/
Some people just like his music. I‚Äôm not psycho, I‚Äôm not a lonely teenager, and I‚Äôm not a cultish weirdo. I just like his music. I think most Kanye fans are none of the three things you said, they just like his music. Not him!!! His music
you are BALD <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/W8IfY_bwAfiPq7IPvNCA2AU"></a>
saying out loud &quot;Oh yes Anthony Fantano reviewed that&quot; is the embodiment of &quot;having no bitches&quot;.<br>Nobody ever, that has self-steem and self-appreciation, mentions &quot;the needle drop&quot; outside chronically-online mediums.<br><br>My guy, having a breakdown over an album of someone that doesn&#39;t knows you is (one of the) reasons that you&#39;re balding and looking like a 40-50 y/o in your mid 30s.
You should review the art instead of the artist bald one
You forgot the fourth type of kanye fans, the ones who like his music but not him
Damn you a hater fr
The fact that Anthony can‚Äôt separate the art from the artist is going to be the downfall of the needle drop
The response to this video has really proved the point regarding how Kanye fans wont engage in good faith with your complaints.
This non-review is so embarassing for this YouTuber...
Solid review but you calling him slurs for not calling the album &quot;To pimp beautiful big titty butt naked women&quot; is a bit too far i think
I can&#39;t believe you from now on you gave sexxy red album a strong 8 üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ and kanye album ????<br>This will forever be my roman empire
This is only a take a white suburban YIMBY can have. White Liberals will never shake their internalized racism unfortunately. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll give an out and about neo nazi a good rating again though if he‚Äôs white, he‚Äôs done it before
There will never be anything more entertaining than Kanye fans trying to gaslight us into thinking that his output post-Fantasy was better than a C+ average.  You could probably make a single greatest hits album that covers the combined highlights.
Kanye has never done anything wrong ever
The way my ears started to bleed when i listened to the first track.
We live in a world where Anthony will respect and review murderers, drug dealers, and rapists but if you speak out against gods chosen people you end up on the naughty list.
You‚Äôre a hater and it‚Äôs sad because why would even record yourself ? You‚Äôre mad weird bro and delusional I see.
I mean a lot of the beats were amazing and if Kanye puts crazy lyrics over one of Mike Deans best instrumentals do the chords themselves become ‚Äútainted‚Äù and unreviewable?
If you don‚Äôt like the guy so much why even post a video about the album or commit to a live stream for it? Clout chasing
A dude complaining about kanye with the goal of making money off kanye. His head is so far up his ass he accidently became a kanye grift
Man stfu and review the album. We don&#39;t care about your break up with Kanye.
If the album was kids see vultures it would have got a 10
I was hoping atleast 6 or 7 from you following your other past criticism üò¢
who would&#39;ve thought the guy with the stash would be a flake smfhhhh
&gt; ‚Äùunreviewable trash‚Äù<br>&gt; gives sexyy red‚Äôs album a 9<br><br>Make it make sense
He is speaking facts and people know it but wont admit it. Kanye¬¥s rapping and vocal performances on this album are horrendous
Oh my god I really didn‚Äôt think that Kanye fans would be reacting this sour but these comments are really proving me wrong. Vultures is so bad, so very very bad. One of the worst albums I‚Äôve heard in a long time. You can‚Äôt all seriously be defending this garbage, can you?
It‚Äôs black history month man you could have skipped this review..
Didn&#39;t you go at Tory Lanez without knowing all the facts?
Just give it a not good
If it was called ‚Äúthe vulture store‚Äù it would have gotten a 10
Ure are jarloessx
Reposting from Brad Taste&#39;s review: Pretty disappointed by the way both Fantano and Brad handled this album. If Fantano thought it was that bad and didn&#39;t want to engage with what he considers a toxic artist and fandom, he should have either not reviewed it, or given it a &quot;not good&quot; review with his thoughts on the music specifically. Instead, he made a clickbait review and bizarre livestream, seemingly with the intention of riling up fans by trashing it in a juvenile way. Brad, of course, waited until the Fantano review dropped so he would know what position to take on it. Then proceeded to do the same thing. Parroted many of the same &quot;criticisms&quot;. Problem with both of them is that they clearly don&#39;t like Kanye (fair enough) and went into the album with an agenda, while claiming not to. I saw very little actual critique of the album from either, mostly surface-level objections (many of which are contradictory when you consider other tracks/albums they have liked in a similar vein), and lots of time spent looking for things to pick out in order to dismiss the album. They both argued it&#39;s so bad it&#39;s just not worth their time, while spending time with the album and offering very little in the way of actual critique. (You had one job, guys). I think the way they both handled this album is just as juvenile and substance-less as they profess the album to be. They might argue that&#39;s the point, and I&#39;d argue that puts them on the same level as the art/ist they look down upon so much. I&#39;m taking a break from watching both of them and we&#39;ll see if I ever get back to viewing them as serious music critics in the future.
If the album was called &quot;To pimp a vulture&quot; he would have given it a 10/10
You‚Äôre such a hater,<br>I used to watch and love you but your bias is so obvious
Not saying he‚Äôs entirely wrong, but‚Ä¶ CARNIVAL‚Ä¶
Yk what fantano kanye doesn&#39;t give a crap about other opinions he&#39;s just being himself and so through album you can pretty much get his stuff,i feel like he has always been this way carefree and creative .Kanye has not atleast been contradictory to his fans and mostly himself
Repeating, ‚ÄúBeautiful big tittied butt naked women just don‚Äôt fall out the sky you know‚Äù for 7 minutes isn‚Äôt a review Anthony.
Wasted all that time talking when he could‚Äôve just reviewed this üî• album
MY DUMB OPINIO IS...( hear me out )<br><br>Kanye made this album as a final test. <br><br>After all the crazy things he did and allways coming out on top when he makes music...THIS TIME he is like:<br><br> &quot;yo i literally said i love Hitler, will my fans stand out for me this time?&quot;<br><br>Kanye plays with our moral compase every second, he is getting worse and worse as a person to keep people interested in his music util he can&#39;t<br><br>Many rappers have done something like this before ( eminem ).<br><br>I mean the last song on the album is literally him expressing this idea while the instrumentals are especially shitty. He says that after all the crazyness ( from albumns like MBDTF and Yezzus ) the bipolar ( ye ) and now this.....he still is the KING<br><br>He says all of this to prove a point thats why i like kanye as a artists<br><br>( even thought i know this as some real world implications, he hides behind his freedom of speech kinda like fatano does when he does reveiws which is ironic )<br> <br>This is just the way i like seeing things, that doesn&#39;t make me any less than.<br><br>(Sorry for the bad inglish)
Who gives a shit about Kanye&#39;s opinions or his fans? The album is just dogshit.
Lol your 3 types of fans are not right. The 4th is people who have said stupid before.
Gotta bridge the gap to your audience. Music going electronic and hot take this gonna make a lot of peoples ears enjoy house beats
Kanye fans need to stop sucking balls
Man its your job to review music. Do your job and just give it a 0 bruh
‚ÄúNEVER IN MY 17 YEARS AT THIS INSTITUTION HAS A SUBSTITUTE TEACHER LEFT ME A NOTE THIS TERRIBLE‚Äù
If this was Megan The Stallion you&#39;d have given it a 100
thank you for holding off on reviewing this one melon, now I can listen to it and form my own opinions about the album<br><br>this will be a big first step for me but I think years of melon vids and RYM have prepared me for this moment
Anthony its not April 1 yet
I&#39;ve listened to the album twice.  Do It is the best song on it and I love that track.  But I will say Kanye doesn&#39;t add much to it.   Carnival is cool.  I even like Back To Me.  But the rest of it is disappointing.  First Donda and now this.  I&#39;m over it.
yeah this is all true thank you anthony
This is literally the most lame thing I&#39;ve ever seen in my life
Damn, I remember when you used to actually review music, Mr. Melon.
Why are you still so fat Anthony?
here for fantanos downfall
I&#39;m of Jewish heritage and this shi fire
I think he‚Äôs a mummy, why won‚Äôt he bleed???
What is bro ham yammering about
lol..whatever, the album is pretty dope.
Bro just review the music we don‚Äôt need a 5 page essay on anti semitism and your politics. Would you really give an equally long ramble about pedophilia and its prevalence in our world before saying Billie Jean is unreviewable
this comment section is a cesspit. kanye fans weird as fuck
The album is so great, that this dude can&#39;t comprehend how great it is.
I know one thing for sure he&#39;s playing carnival and burn on repeat üòÖ
From watching this video I have realized Fantano has no idea what he is talking about when it comes to music
This dude so annoying ahaha
Ok so this an incredibly biased review that you openly admit that the second you dropped the needle you were going to look at everything wrong about it. Sexually vulgar, dark thoughts, openly controversial. Thats been the content of his lyrics since Pablo but yet now that he‚Äôs persona non grata it‚Äôs unacceptable. Misogynistic sounding and sexualized. How many rap albums written by men and women fit that category. His lyrics are not different than they have been for years but now everyone is offended by them. You never mention the quality of the productions or the excellent work from Ty  who happens to be the other artist that created the album. It‚Äôs just trash because you want it to be. Personally I‚Äôd never want to meet him and don‚Äôt agree with his views but if I cut everyone out in history that I didn‚Äôt agree with as a person I‚Äôd also be cutting out Picasso (misogynist) and Abraham Lincoln ( who still was a racist) This isn‚Äôt a fair assessment of the work it‚Äôs a character slam. If you didn‚Äôt intend on reviewing the album why even make the video? Why acknowledge it?
jokes aside its a decent album, but definitely not anywhere near kanye‚Äôs best. TLoP might forever be his best work
not being on the internet 24/7 is pretty cool. the only people i hear talk about how much they love kanye or hate kanye is on twitter. i forgave him after the 21 jump street post cuz im jewish and have a sense of humor and can ignore idiots that are to far gone and laugh at them. i think ur looking at this too black and white
If Kanye was slimmer, had a bushier beard, tattoos all over him, and named his album The Vultures Store you‚Äôd be ready to slob him up and down till the cows come home
‚ÄúInsane conspiracy theories‚Äù right because no US politician has a dual citizenship in Israel of all places.
Its pretty weird how he refuses to review ye because of his beliefs and personal things when he reviewed david bowie (famously slept with 15 year olds when he was 28)
i hate this guy so much
This has been Kanye&#39;s trajectory for the last 3 albums, his quality has declined as his mental state has declined to the point where after all the antisemetic shit, I&#39;m not even gonna bother with this one. Loved his first 6 albums, Pablo was a bit bloated but still good but he&#39;s fallen off the deep end. I&#39;ve seen his behavior in mentally ill people I was close to but they didn&#39;t have millions of dollars and fans to enable them, he&#39;s just gonna continue to self destruct as he continues to be unmedicated.
It‚Äôs a lousy album. Just leave it at that.
Paid&gt;fade
Oh so Burzum is fine, but it‚Äôs not okay when you have to virtue signal to your sponsors.
What you had to say about ‚Äúseparate the art from the artist‚Äù really struck me because that‚Äôs the main argument I keep seeing from JPEG stans in his subreddit. And you‚Äôre right, you can‚Äôt separate the art from the artist if they‚Äôre literally putting themselves like that into the art.
Fantano Stop malding lol
Remove the artist from the art!!!!
Rent due
I was very scared for this album bcuz of the vultures single which I think sucks but the album is bumpy
This guy is like the shooter specialist on Instagram who never made it to the league. This guys music opinion is shit, let‚Äôs just talk more shit on the guy that everyone can poke at. You‚Äôre a nerd
heisenberg ahh mustache
Its Jesus Christ, Hitler, Ye !!! What is Anthony Fantano going to do about it from his gaming chair
so youre crying because youre jew and kanye hurt you, what a snowflake fantano
Ye went from holy music to lyrics like these is funny af
Thank you
I don‚Äôt endorse any of Kanyes recent comments, but if you wanna say an album is bad just say its bad, no need to virtue signal and act all offended like he killed someone, funny i mention that since you dont mind reviewing murderers albums but kanye is ‚Äútoo far‚Äù
Bro ppl can‚Äôt just enjoy the music without being in those 3 categories? üò≠üò≠
This is the worst video you&#39;ve ever made on this channel and I don&#39;t even like Kanye. Your channel is a music review channel, either review the music or don&#39;t but don&#39;t ever do this whiney BS for clicks again. If you can&#39;t separate the art from the artist then you&#39;re bad at your job. If you just admitted this people would  at least respect that you&#39;re self reflective enough to know you&#39;re just biased...
bro is big butt hurt the album goes hard üòÇ
Not even gonna leave a comment to satisfy this bald NERD
Thank you
Kanye is the only guy to get 2 10/10 albums and an unreviewable album
I thought you were Jewish?
Bro is so madüòÇ
I miss the old melon. straight from the go melon. I hate the new melon.The bad mood melon. Hating on Kanye melon. I miss the sweet melon.Liking Kanye music melon. I got to say at that time I want it to meet melon.
predictably, fantano exhibits his childish inability to separate his artistic criticism from his political allegiances
HYPOCRITE
kanye is scum. so is fantano.
The video title should be ‚ÄòTo WoKe A MelOn üçâ‚Äô
Kanye fans are a different breed of insane. I totally get why you don‚Äôt want to promote this hateful bigots music and I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre staying strong even though your comments are looking garbage rn. Just know you still have sensible fans and not everyone is swept up in the Kanye stuff rn
This guy hate on kanye just to be different
Dang sorry to see melon getting lazy on us and being a pussy just cuz he doesn&#39;t like ye
Wow, such a bold statement Anthony. You‚Äôre truly making a difference
Trash music
where is your wife?
Where does JPEGMAFIA fit in with the three types of Kanye fans???
I doubt it‚Äôs worth reviewing the next two releases tbh
Finally a Kanye fan who&#39;s saying that this album is hot trash.
Not even based off his music who even watches this guy anymore
Bald
In terms of morality and ethics I agree with melon. The things Kanye has said over the years and recently are unacceptable and unforgivable and any sane person would condemn them. However when it comes to music I think to myself: ‚ÄúWhy should I listen to this idiot, he gave MBDTF a light 6‚Äù.
melon zionist confirmed
unwatchable 1
Either review it or don&#39;t. This is a cowardly way to get clicks
he just called teens that like kanye bored and lonely oh brother he‚Äôs lashing out
Fantano is irrelevant atp
If Kanye was a radical leftist or woke he would‚Äôve got a 10
Hey Anthony it&#39;s okay, we all think you&#39;re a reaaalllyy good person. Calm down.
Say what you will about Kanye but he was antisemitic before antisemitism was cool (oct 7)
Thanks for taking a stand.
Cringe
The music reviewer who can&#39;t separate art from the artist
you look like my ballsack if I shaved it and grew a mustache.
Your eyes are still shut
This guy reviewed burzum and murderers hahaha. How hypocritical üò≠
old boy with a fupa, dress like a little boy smh
no fucking way
False Prophets
Would respect your moral stand if you didn‚Äôt still put up a video for the money. Get over yourself
These comments are so toxic
As a kanye fan I actually agree this album is trash
good take fantano
virtue signaling pandering trash. reviews murderers, cheaters, rapists, but draws the line at mean words. horrible review 0/10 do better and stop farming engagements on twitter
seethe and cope baldi
I wish i would care about what a white man has to say about ANY black folks art lmfao yall be blessed
I agree with everything except for when you didn‚Äôt give the album a strong 6 to a light 7
ü§ìü§ìü§ì
why don‚Äôt you just review music.. you know YOUR JOBüòÇ
Life of Pablo was Kanye&#39;s last album as far as I&#39;m concerned.
the most cringe, 4chan /pol tards are malding at this review
Despite the fact that you didn&#39;t review the album. you criticized the music, the person who created this music, and in essence your ‚Äúnon-review‚Äù is quite a review - but with a strong focus on the actions of the author and the absence of a final score.<br><br>I understand why you hate Kanye West. With his anti-Semitism, Kanye let down not only the companies with which he had contracts, but also his fans, one of which is yourself.<br><br>You stand for ‚Äúeverything good‚Äù against ‚Äúeverything bad,‚Äù which is well, obvious, it‚Äôs normal among left-wing activists today. But at the same time, at the beginning of your YouTube career, you analyzed the album of Burzum, the project of the open neo-Nazi Varg Vikernes.<br><br>I don‚Äôt understand why you spent the entire Vultures promo campaign filming mocking TikToks, criticizing Kanye on Twitter, calling his audience names, and in the end even held a stream reaction to the album. On the stream, you openly insulted the musician, were biased towards the tracks after a few seconds of listening, and even skipped certain verses.<br><br>It seems to me that you had a serious meltdown, as a person who was suddenly betrayed by his idol. And the best solution in such a situation would be to ignore the entire album as an information feed. By making hate content about an artist you hate, you attract hatred to yourself, even if you consider yourself reasonable in the situation. Put Taylor Swift or Nicki Minaj in Ye&#39;s place and you will get the same result, because fanaticism can easily take a completely insane form. And therefore people are hating on u. <br><br>If I hate a musician for his actions, then I would simply ignore him. And if even despite this mental barrier in the form of anger that i have for a person, i try to evaluate his music, then I will simply discredit myself as a critic. Which is exactly what you did in your ¬´non-review¬ª
Fuck antisemitism!
You fell off
Kanye‚Äôs still great, and he‚Äôs still right. That dosent make me hateful at all, that makes me knowledgable.
You know kanye lost alot of fans due to the point he wasted millions in the superbowl ads just to be selling his merch at $20 when people would fumble themselves to get the newest yeezys. And this is purely just the business side to kanye musically this is a pathetic attempt at getting back his fans and embracing the new fox news fans with those antisemitic lyrics. Jpegmafia collabed too late cause I aint listening to that shit
rent was due
Antisemitic wu tang lp in the background. This video is nothing but a grift for attention
Lookin‚Äô like Artie Bucco from the sopranos‚Ä¶
ye fans when someone disagrees:<br><br>grrrr
Imagine giving sexy redd an 8
I feel like this is highly biased. And yes im aware of all the stuff kanye has said and done lately. But this is nowhere near his worst or most unfinished album.
I think im always gonna be a supporter of him,what he said was crazy and this album is like a 4
Youre officially a lolcow<br><br>Wifium divorcio
fantano sux
Holy fuck, this is brutal, and I&#39;m super excited for the inevitable controversy this is going to trigger!
A review like this should be done in a tux and bowtie. Keep it formal for your masters
you fell off miss unbiased fantano
Coming back to this channel unironically as its funny when melon gets political and starts pandering, &quot;taking a stand&quot; by using his reviews as political statements like if he doesn&#39;t have a history of reviewing other &quot;problematic&quot; artists in addition to his own problematic views that have gotten him cancelled before. Hate to say it, but Drake was right
watching this manchild seethe made me like Vultures more...... how far he has fallen.
still only care about the album
Thank you for actually saying this shit and not being afraid of the kanye cult. Can‚Äôt excuse his behavior when he‚Äôs bragging about it in the music
Kanye blows. Stop giving him attention
I want to know if anyone has ever listened to a fantano review and took it seriously
bring back the dislike button
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=221">3:41</a> i mean you have reviewed burzum‚Ä¶the literal nazi artist that kanye has been repping as of late. you‚Äôve also reviewed king von who was a known murderer. you reviewed xxxtentacion despite him being a domestic abuser. i get not reviewing it because of kanye‚Äôs psychotic fanbase but to do this because of your jewish audience would be a lil stupid and hypocritical
800k+ views in less than 24 hrs. Just sayin ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
How to be fantano: review albums of murderers who brag about taking the lives of young black men and glorify the consequences of a violent cycle whose beginnings take root in racist policies. (Something fantano claims to be against but has actually said he sees no problem with this Music and will claim it has no negative impact on the black community) funny you can‚Äôt separate the art from the artist when the artist disagrees with you politically and says things you don‚Äôt like. Yet if the artist is a known murderer whose songs are bragging about murdering black youths suddenly the art and the artist are completely separate entities. Get off Reddit, your virtue signals Ring hollow.
People in the comments don&#39;t seem to understand the weight of someone saying they like hitler. It&#39;s beyond bad. A statement like that shows disrespect for humanity and life itself, because hitler was an evil force of unprecedented magnitude.
Bro dont even like the best death grips album (n word on the moon)
Typical jew hating a black man. Simple as that he is just racist.
No wonder melons wife left
He‚Äôs coping so hard
I actually love that fantano took this opportunity to talk about how Kanye has been using his popularity to spout nonsense and cultivate dangerous people. It‚Äôs insane that someone can get away with spreading really bad ideas just because of their not as embarrassing history
just review the tape baldy
it‚Äôs an album üíÄ
You are such a shill dude.  This record was amazing.
you fell off ngl
So reviewing killers&#39; music isn&#39;t bad yet there are people mourning about their dead family members BUT HEY HE SAID JEWS BLABLAH UNREVIEWABLE grow up bruh you pushing 40
I&#39;m wondering if his manager told him <br>&quot;Don&#39;t say all that stuff about Hitler Kanye  It will be like career suicide! &quot;<br>I think he&#39;s possibly at the stage in his career when as you rightly say, nobody is prepared to tell him no... I mean even his dentist is not prepared to say it... No Kanye don&#39;t do that, just take these pills instead!
Nah this album was good.
So people who like kanyes music. Music May I add, are either, crazy, cultish or stupid‚Ä¶
I thought it was alright
This guy is the YMS of music
How is this Guy still relevant his reviews are bias asf
Ye stans get so mad when everyone else doesn‚Äôt dick-ride him like they do. Most insecure fanbase I‚Äôve ever seen.
the most disappointed review I&#39;ve seen
I share the same opinion, it&#39;s garbage. I hate this chipmunk clone Kanye.
This review was done completely in bad faith, you let your childish emotions and feelings of superiority get in the way of reviewing the album. It is sad that you ignore any of the good songs on the album in the hopes your fans will blindly believe you and never listen to it and hear those songs. You show lyrics to show that he‚Äôs politics are in the songs but show him making fun of the bad things said about him not him being antisemitic. All I see when I watch this is a bitter angry man who has a deep hatred for Kanye trying to grasp at anything to put this album down because you want it to fail. I used to genuinely enjoy your content please do better.
I agree. The album was trash af
It sounds like we are getting a Kanye Worst to Best soon.
You got people reacting to the album as an album, this dude reviews it based of the person. It‚Äôs ye, not the best, not the worst, just ye‚Ä¶
Lanthony
Bald.
and there goes your credibility. or what credibility you had left. be a man and think for yourself instead saying what you think won‚Äôt get you cancelled.
Clownye West
You&#39;re such a fruit cake it hurts lmao
He would&#39;ve given it a strong 8 if it was called hoods hottest vulture
mf VIRAL üòÇüêê
UNPROFESSIONAL REVIEW
goofiest human being in the world
And how is calling his bitch a &#39;reference&#39; the most dehumanizing thing ever, as you suggest? Can&#39;t this mean that she&#39;s important? A reference to others? <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/UW5IY-ibBqa8jgTymoCIBQ"></a>
Might be blissful ignorance but I treat it like hip hop. I enjoyed the music. Thought there were some good flows and I treated the lyrics as Kanye seaking a shock factor. Though, if you look even a tad deeper you do realize the lyrics are antisemitic, misogynistic and probable much more.
Bro is not bad it‚Äôs a 7-8/10
A vulture chose not to review vulture. Funny.
I mean we got to admit that our melonhead really is a hustler, he gotta pay them bills somehow
Ive been telling yall not to take this clown seriously. They seethe from their orifices when someone makes something fun or controversial bc the artists are doing things they wish they did in their lifetime, they jumped when you stood still. It makes sense. They took a chance and you didnt so you dedicate your life to hating and rating other peoples work bc thats the closest youll ever get to success. Its okay man, Jellyroll made it at 38 you still have a chance even if youre divorced and bald.
L channel
bro u look like this fr ü§ì
old man
The cheapest snob &quot;critic&quot; ever
Wanna hear a music review not a review on your political views.
I think any attempt at being righteous or morally above this project went out the window the moment you released a monetized video about it. I&#39;m not here to defend the music because honestly it&#39;s not that good. It&#39;s got some great tracks on it but there&#39;s less hits than duds. I think Kanye&#39;s whole antisemitism shtick is pretty lame, but whats even lamer is people pretending like he&#39;s destroying the world by saying mean things on the internet. Anyone who is dumb enough to take him seriously after over ten years of him saying outrageous stuff like this is probably already on /pol/ to begin with. <br><br>You very easily could of just reviewed the album and given it like a 3 or something which it probably deserves. I totally agree that it&#39;s near impossible to separate Kanye from his music ever since MBDTF, so hell you could of just not reviewed it in the first place, or just said nothing. I don&#39;t think this video was made for any other reason other than morally grandstanding. This video wasn&#39;t about Kanye it was about yourself.
dang
Booooo melons washed up
I unironically love the the jay and silent bob song. It&#39;s my favourite Ye track since Pablo
Honestly tho this is definitely kanyes worst album but its aight
hope your wife gets all your money after your divorce baldy
Im sorry your audience is so immature Athony
Is it Kanye review or album review?
There are the people who like the Musik but are embarrassed about it üö¥
And if you take this stance of refusing to platform him, you shouldn‚Äôt have streamed yourself listening to it in the first place
Actual album review begins at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=423">7:03</a>
You reviewed burzum
If it‚Äôs so unreviewable then why the fuck did you review it and stream your reaction. If you care so much about what he says why are you spreading his beliefs further?
I like burn, problematic and stars, I dislike what kanye says but those to me are genuinely great songs
but King von (serial murderer) literally talking about what he did in his lyrics is fine. nice take
Keep that same energy about the rappers who literally kill or rape people. I don‚Äôt really care about Kanye but this is disingenuous
.
jesus the virtue signaling is nauseating
I was your fan but now you just a hater, close this channel
Kanye is the man üéâ
Thank you for this honest and necessary non-review! ‚ù§Ô∏è
You give SexyyRedd an 8 tho, gtfo man üòÇüòÇ
If it was called VULTURES. It would be reviewable
Alright so Ye can talk ab Jews (nothing explicitly hateful) in the lyrics, and you can&#39;t separate the artist from the music.<br><br>But when another rapper is explicitly hateful towards women or other men, it&#39;s cool, oil and water.
Review the music and stfu. We dont care about your beliefs
buaaa buaaaa cry more about it you liberal nobody
the fact that Ye can say whatever he wants whenever he wants, even though it&#39;s the most violent or straightup disrespecting shit ever and still have people agree with him and encourage it, shows how incredibly stupid and bored people are.
Didn‚Äôt mention burn carnival beg forgiveness or any other highlights or talk about how this is Kanye‚Äôs most independently made album bc he had the least support of his life rn. Not even a Kanye fan like that but to say it‚Äôs all complete garbage is just objectively not true. Ty was great. Chris browns feature was great. He gave kids see ghost a 10 when Kanye had lyrics like she make me say uhhhh Uh like master p and Rick Ross‚Äù is also laughable Kanye has always been Kanye.
Was this a review of the album or kanye?
Ur bald and ur wife left you
I like him because he‚Äôs fucking hilarious
Maybe you guys can just listen the shit by yourself.
Wow so damn gets a 7 but this gets a
kinda sad you let a man dictate your feelings THIS bad. i understand not liking someone, but you‚Äôre visibly distraught over someone who probably doesn‚Äôt know you
Damn this really pissed off the nazi fanboysüòÇüòÇ
Definitely biased, he&#39;s given 0 before and has reviewed several albums that are definitely worse than this one, yet somehow this is his first unreviewable video
I liked the album.
Anthony got an entire Waffen-SS division in the comments pretending this shit was even remotely listenable üíÄ
remember when this dude pretended to be a music channel not just some weird internet political pundit
This guy is so mad at kanyeüòÇüòÇüòÇ you‚Äôre pathetic, the albums dope
drizzy gon love this one melon head! well done daddy will be pleased
King shit
Brilliant artistic decision, that plot twist reviewing it a 10 in the end got me
This mf weird asl bro like he aint even talkin bout the album and why in his opinion it was bad he just straight flamin YE and his fan base
Surely if he actually felt the things he said and meant them, not reacting or making this video would be the thing to do? üòÇ
Haaaaaaaa i knew you would hate it
‚ÄúWho ain‚Äôt cash a check off my name‚Äù
This is not a 10 album. Change my mind
I don‚Äôt even really like this album much, but man if you‚Äôre not gonna review it, stop talking about it. It really stains your reputation as a critic, that‚Äôs something I used to take you seriously for.
Only fanboys think it‚Äôs any good ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Go listen to sexy red again üòÇ
YE KEEPS MAKING EVERYTHING CHANGE üòÖ THE MELON DIDN&#39;T EVEN BOTHERED. WE ARE NOT JUST BACK, WERE A FORCEüñ§
Whats happening in Palestine proved what he was saying. Everyone shocked why the media is covering the  genocide the way they are. Fantano is just another example of an individual thats too scared to say anything
I first reacted to this album without lyrics, I was just clueless with what the hell kanye was saying, after listening to the lyrics I just became even more clueless as kanye just turned from this Guy who made the bear series, kids see ghosts, etc to this shit, late reg is my favorite album and comparing late to this is just wow kanye is a terrible person , and a terrible artist now.
While I do understand separating art and the artist for the most part, at a certain point it becomes too much. I will accept that he has produced great, all-time great music in the past. If you try and separate that, whatever. But this shit that he‚Äôs putting out now with clearly anti-Semitic rhetoric and praising someone who slaughtered millions and brought about an entire war? There‚Äôs no supporting it. There is no separation here. If you‚Äôre listening to Kanye and still giving him his audience, you‚Äôre doing a disservice to every Jewish person you know, every Jewish person in the world, and only creating a more hateful place to live in. There‚Äôs countless artists who produce amazing music who don‚Äôt spew out this kind of shit. Listen to them.
Who da fook is this guy?
What he says might be incredible influence and has an Consequence on the world but you really don&#39;t so stop being the hero no one needs
I despise you so much it‚Äôs unreal
its just like lil dicky, u just cant take the fun and hype and the talent, u just cant
Didn‚Äôt your wife leave you lil bro?
this reviewer is the opposite of Lover
Those 3 kind of Kanye fans you mentioned‚Ä¶ I am neither and a huge fan of his . So you are way way off ‚Ä¶.
bros a jew
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ you are a joke
debil
a mi si me gusto vultures 1 (no se ingles y no se lo que dice el kanye)
you shouldnt have a career built of music reviews if you cant put aside your bias for an album. You literally have no credability
If Kanye wants to call it music let em.
where your wife at?
liberal cringe
You try to sound smart but once again failed miserably. Good Job.
cashing a check off his name? NICE! why not donate the ad revenue from this video instead.
Nice kanye review, when are u reviewing the album
how embarrassing!
L take
Politics aside, it&#39;s unbearable to listen to. And, of course, his stans on social media are like, &quot;oMg, KaNyE! tHiS iS yOuR bEsT aLbUm SiNcE dOnDa!&quot; (Which is also trash, outside of like two, maybe three, songs.) And then, including the politics, his Christian fans are like, &quot;kAnYe, ThIs iS dEmOnIc! I tHoUgHt YoU wErE a StRoNg, JeW-hAtInG mAn Of GoD!&quot;
Kanye annoys me because I started listening to him a few years ago and really do like a lot of his music but then he becomes racist and releases awful music and I can‚Äôt listen to his older stuff without being called one of your 3 categories so idk
fantono is a joke
This video is ironic since he loves Kendrick and drake‚Ä¶
Its so unreviewable he dedicated an entire twitch stream to reviewing it.
TRUEEEEEEE
The industry be racist as fuck with black an brown people but the Jews is where the line is drawn we gotta do better
tf
so are you feeling a strong 3 to a light 4 on this one or???
Don‚Äôt forget that this is the man that gave Death Grips a 10 and MBDTF a 6. He‚Äôs always had a bias for white artists
Kanye would beat you in a fight goofy.
Beautiful, butt naked, big titty women just don&#39;t fall out the sky, you know?
Anthony please, you don&#39;t need to say anymore, you&#39;ve sold me in the first 90 seconds. I already ordered 10 copies but now I&#39;m buying 10 copies more
What if it was called kids see vultures
You are a garbage reviewer
guys i think he&#39;s white.
No way you rated sexy redd but not this album
lmao what a neek. Honestly the album is undeniably good, some of the best produced music he&#39;s done
glad you&#39;re honest
You‚Äôre just mad because you knew making a video about Kanye would be one of the most viewed videos on your channel this year.
Review the album ball man
Album is so awful it went Nr 1 everywhere in the world and is now the most successfull hiphop collab album of all time
based ye
Anthony fantano the type of guy to not like avant garde jazz üòÇüòÇüòÇ. I still love his content. Kinda want to see him make some music
-Number 1 album in the world<br>-20 million in one day from merch sales<br>-Loving wife (unlike you since your wife left you) and daughter (your wife left you before you could have one)
How this man has a platform is beyond me , pisses me off so much always rates albums low cause of personal agendas so pathetic.
L Fantano as always
How this man has a platform is beyond me , pisses me off so much always rates albums low cause of personal agendas so pathetic.
So antisemitism is only okay if you&#39;re Palestinian. Gotcha.
I&#39;m not a Kanye fan anymore but from what I pick up from your reviews is <br>People who rap about selling drugs, doing drugs, talk down on women, murder and most of the time murders they actually committed is all good as long as the music is good<br>But Kanye bad for saying what he thinks but hasn&#39;t physically hurt anyone is bad? Got it
Video starts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=423">7:03</a> when he starts seperating the art from the artist
Yeezus Yandhi Ye! Sponsor that!
‚ÄúWow look at me I‚Äôm am so morally correct for not liking him because he is an antisemite‚Äù. Politics hold no place in music therefore rating an album of of it is morally disastrous. I am not listening to a music review solely based on political opinions.
I feel like topics about zionism and muslim hate woulda gotten this album a 10/10 fo sho. Or whatever this bald dude sounds like atp.
Holy based melon
I&#39;m a huge Kanye fan and this album IS SO G...................GARBAGE! <br>The last...I don&#39;t know...5 albums or something are so bad I can&#39;t even. I used to like him as a person AND as a musician 10 times more, but man.........nowadays he sucks and his music sucks even more...or the opposite?!?! I don&#39;t know.
I‚Äôm neither of the 3 groups you said like the album. But I like the production on here ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Se re enojaban üò≠üò≠
This is why your wife left youüò¢
The unironic slappable jerk
Say his name. Jonah. HILL
Bro stop critisizing him and just talk about the music
This is exactly why white people need to minimize their opinions of black culture. It‚Äôs all fine and dandy when we glorify the horrors of the black community but as soon as we come for the oppressor it‚Äôs a problem.
Liking Donda but hating this makes absolutely no sense
If it was called &quot;DAMN VULTURES&quot; he&#39;d give it a 10 üòÖ
Very ripe very ripe ur becoming,  ROTTEN SOME WOULD SAY üçà
Imagine taking music opinions from a guy with a mustache similar to Adolfü§°
Don‚Äôt forget Anthony used to be a weirdo 4chan edgelord
ZZZ
U look old üçà
Anthony rage baiting for a quick bag never thought I‚Äôd see the day . Gotta respect it tho get that bag u earned it
Guess we listened to two different albums. That&#39;s toughüòÇ
Unreviewable trash yet top of the charts üòÇ
Kanye just prove to us that fantano is limited mentally W can‚Äôt even review a simple 16 song album L
You forgot to mention the group of people who love his music.
I respect you so much for making this video.  Thanks for standing your ground and vocalising an opinion that will be suppressed and laughed at by twitterheads
Honestly, Kanye has said just as egregious stuff in the TLOP/Wyoming/Donda eras and you reviewed and like those albums. I can see if you hate all late Kanye but if you like those previous albums how could you not like this? This is definitely on Dondas level atleast imo
fantano trying so hard to cause a reaction from kanye&#39;s fans, you are not fooling us bald man
You just talking bullshit y&#39;know
No es de lo mejor de kanye para nada pero no es malo
you are a gay man
I&#39;m mad at Ye as a Christian, like people smear us enough with the Natzi bs we don&#39;t need him fanning the fire of that calumny
Why this moustache weirdo with glasses it&#39;s still relevant in 2024?
Deep down melon liked it üò≠üò≠ but scared
Peggy sacrificed his morals for this trash ass album
well said
So you‚Äôre telling me sexy redd screaming over a generic beat is better
Rappers have been racist and antisemites and killing people for decades, why do you suddenly decide to care
YE THE GOAT üôèüèæ
The kanye subreddit is seething so hard over your videos lmao they r pathetic
&quot;Meaningless lifes&quot; is wild
‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt vote for me you ain‚Äôt black‚Äù keep that same energy üòÅ
So he essentially gave it a Bald White Vegan Cuck/10
he somehow still managed to review the album
Idk if this is a troll or no tbh. I don&#39;t like Kanye as a person rn but I can&#39;t lie ,this album is way better than I expected it to be. Imo 9-10/10 for the music and not for who made it.
It would‚Äôve been better off as Ty Dolla $ project produced by Ye
Jesus christ you‚Äôve fallen so far since you were actually decent in 2016
Anthony you are so brave for not reviewing this album! I wish more people were as brave as you. It isn&#39;t like you monetized this video and will still get ad revenue based on the clicks you know you will receive for making a Kanye video. You are so brave! So progressive!
I love the part where he reviewed the album
I think it‚Äôs crazy to live in a world where you can rap about the most degenerate stuff and the minute you insult a minority group we have went too far. Who cares if there‚Äôs racists in this world. There are a bunch of unappealing categories of people that are not nearly getting as much attention. I loved this album. This reviewer already knew how he felt about the album before he listened to it
Hey.. I kinda liked Hoodrats instrumental
I thought your reviews were objective and focused solely on the music, but you spent the first half of the video just hating on him. Then you just tried to make fun of his music. It&#39;s not the best he&#39;s done, but it&#39;s far from bad. I usually come to you for professional and detailed reviews of music, but this was just hate. Really disappointed.
Waaaah I don‚Äôt like fun music wahhh
You would give it a 10 if its name was &quot;to pimp a jew&quot;
I‚Äôm not much of a kanye fan, I liked him when he came out with through the wire and gold digger all those hits. But I haven‚Äôt heard anything good come from him since before the pandemic maybe for me even 2015. His music really isn‚Äôt good anymore, it‚Äôs mostly meme TikTok music. I don‚Äôt really care for needle boys opinion either but I hate to admit his unreviewable review is accurate
I respect your opinion but I came here for a review. You barely covered the music in this and it‚Äôs disappointing. Like I get you can‚Äôt separate the art and artist when it comes to Kanye but I also didn‚Äôt wanna hear you just repeat the same points over and over in these Kanye videos. We didn‚Äôt even hear what you had to say about JPEGs production on this album. I wouldn‚Äôt even care if you hated all the music on the album but at least we would get what we subscribe to you for on this channel.A Review. -10 points
I don‚Äôt like Fantano or Kanye so this js a major blessing thank you Kanye for producing more garbage ‚ù§
If this was called good vulture mad city it would have gotten a 10
this guy stinks
Least objective music reviewer
Good take
This is 2024&#39;s MBDTF. but way worse...
boo hoo
Divorced Fantano just hits different üíØ
you sound hurt seek help
shutup melon
YOU GOT PAIED SO MUCH HUH?
such a small dick energy review, no offense.<br><br>the album is kinda mid, but do have some great songs, ye has nothing to prove to anyone at this point, he just havin fun talking about big beautiful titties and butt naked womans lmao
If the album was called &#39;Kids See Vultures&#39; you would have given it a 10..
i hate you!
&quot;unreviewable&quot; <b>proceeds to review</b>
I think Anthony‚Äôs hatred of Kanye‚Äôs antics created a cloud of hate to make him pre-hate this album before he even listened to it. Then nit picked everything Ye said. This album üî• and he just wont get it.
very good video
virtuesignaling at its finest
Kanye keeps this channel alive
well time to listen to instrumentals
who the f do you think you are?
I think what ppl need to realize is u can still like music and not agree with the things he is saying. Like me, for example. I‚Äôm Christian and enjoy Kanye‚Äôs music, old and new. I don‚Äôt agree with anything he‚Äôs saying, but I‚Äôm still allowed to appreciate the material he puts out if I find it good.
COME ON MAN HE DIDNT MEAN IT HE IS JUST A LIL CRAZY THATS ALL
AF, grandmaster hater.
Yet you give sexy red an 8 lmfaoo gtfoh
kanye has always sucked
So are you a political activist first or a music reviewer?
This bald mf is unbearable. Why do you people need his approval to enjoy an album ?
damn seem like fantano hating and only trying to cater to a specific audience. which ruins the entire point of an actual MUSIC review. I don‚Äôt support anything Rkelly did but that doesn‚Äôt take away from his MUSIC ‚ÄºÔ∏èüñïüèæ
Best review ever boycott this guy
Are you deaf or what????????????????&#39;
didn&#39;t realize fantano was a Jewish name
Do you have enough critical thinking skill to question why anti semitic comments or dialogue is so completely unacceptable that you can&#39;t even lend it 1% of credit and instead it completely and permanently divorces you from the conversation forever?
So rappers who are convicted murderers and rapists and do many illegal activity can be reviewed but because Kanye said something offensive to certain people you can‚Äôt review him? not trying to defend Kanye but your logic is baffling me
I get that Vultures 1 is not the groundbreaking album that people thought it would be, but is it really THAT bad? Stars, Back to me, paid, problematic, burn, do it, carnival, Ben forgiveness, and even paperwork are good songs. And if people don‚Äôt like this record we still have 2 more on the way. Songs like time moving slow, gun to my head, river, everybody, promotion, slide, lifestyle, take off your dress still have good chances of showing up on the other volumes. And we also have a new solo album coming out on top of that. I believe the real flaw of this record comes with the mixing and lyrics. The mixing is bad and greatly affects the quality of the album. And Kanye (other than burn) cant write good, introspective verses. Also Kanye‚Äôs delivery was very bad on this album.
Maybe im in the nihlistic camp but i just want to listen too good music. I mean... Michael Jackson was pedo, Jimmy Page was pedo. Kanye said some ignorant shit... whatever i can handle it  i know good from bad.
Really good video. Imo the album isnt all bad. I really like STARS for example. I do understand your points tho. The lyrics just arent the same anymore. I got introduced to Kanye about 1 1/2 Years ago and didnt know anything about the media stuff. Especially the old albums and songs really appeal to me. I still love songs like two words, crack music and even blame game. The lyricism just isnt the same anymore. It feels like the storytelling he had in his music is non existent nowadays. Together with his massive ego and the media stuff makes the music just so much worse. Donda had way too many songs and Vultures is divided into 3 parts. He makes great music but it just seems as if there is no love in the songs. I think in his case it would really help him to just take a step back for once. I still like the music he puts out and imo you can still listen to it but especially with the lyricism this album is fairly weak. Production is phenomenal and there are only a few exceptions. All in all I would rate the album a 6,5/10 but I have to admit that the features carry the rating. I really think that at this point in his career it is unlikely but I hope he goes a bit back to his roots and focuses more on the lyricism in his songs.
You trying so hard to look serious<br><br>There&#39;s 2 more volumes get ready<br><br>Jesus is King
didn&#39;t you review some burzum shit lmfao
Bros just yappin. Album was dope it‚Äôs not that deep
all you &quot;critics&quot; forget nobody cares about your opinion we&#39;re not children we can like what we like and disagree with you however we like
Bro fantano thank u for saying what u said. At least you know what is right and what is wrong
Bro ur a clown
Looking forward to where this will be in his top 3 this year
he&#39;s his own case, but i also think billionares just can&#39;t make good art. your brain just gets fried all your social relations are fucked - i really dont think its possible
Bros virtue signaling has gone insane since the divorce, he knows in his heart vultures is a 7/10
Lost my respect Fantano. You should review every artists music the same way, despite how you feel about the artist making the music. This &quot;review&quot; is basically 90% talking trash about Kanye and his fanbase, and 10% about the music. You are a music reviewer, so REVIEW the music. Also, you seem to comment a lot on the lyrics. Didnt you say Sexy Redd album was good? You give good scores to rappers talking about k!illing others and r!ping, so where do you draw the line? You seem to be finding every little thing to complain on. I understand you dislike the album due to the kanye bars, but don&#39;t say the production isn&#39;t there. This album is mostly well produced, and I love Ty&#39;s contribution to the album. You try so hard to be different to gain money from your channel. And baldie, why all that negative talk about BURN?<br> The mastering and mixing will definitely be fixed and updated, so you should therefore do a SERIOUS redux review with a OPEN MIND. Dudes almost 40, we experiencing the downfall of this channel...
calling your wife a ‚Äúreference‚Äù is insane
bro complains that artists dont make music that is relevant to their situation and then Ye quite literally does that just for melon to be like nah this is unreviewable
This is an album review not a person review‚ò†Ô∏è
Bro is so bias üò≠üò≠ you‚Äôre garbage Anthony üò≠üò≠
Man&#39;s really yapping
The album is good you should be able to separate the art from the artist
For my review on the yap i would probably give this a 6/10 not enough yapping
Yes i agree to some extent and everyone who is not a Nazi will also. But can&#39;t you just make a full review of the album instead of making Kanye fans mad on Twitter by posting stupid bait?
bros a D1 rage baiter
Yet you still made a video about it to cash in...
damn 5 minutes out of the 7 in the video wasn&#39;t even a review üòÇ
This fucken shit is trash!!!! Fuck!!??!!!!
this reminds me of the tory lanez situation where tory lanez became a garbage rapper and singer cause he got accused of shooting megan thee stallion and at the same time fantano started praising her over nothing
No way is this Kanye&#39;s worst album, shame he didn&#39;t review it properly
the album not bad...
Lmfaooo
I mean you got divorced so everything will be miserable to you from now on
Opinions aside about the actual music, your naive 3 part generalization about the entire population of Kanye fans is quiet small minded. You project your disgust about comments Kanye made yet you are doing the same thing. <br><br>Your bio says you review music yet your video gave no substance to back that up. What are you bringing to the table? A pointless  rant?
i dont like most of the album, but talking and carnival are bangers!!!!
Wow I can‚Äôt believe you support the occupation in Gaza smh
stop back to me is a classic 10/10
kanye is right about the jews tho
kayne mogged melon lmao
YOU CANT REVIEW MUSIC WICH CREATOR YOU HATE AND MALD TO BALD BALD BALD BRO IS TALKING LIKE A 10 YEAR OLD LOOSING A GAME YAP YAP KANYE THE GOAAAAT üó£üó£üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üêêüêêüêêüêê
Dude you are so cringe it hurts. So these are your goals going into a review:<br>1. Give the viewer pause and cause them to think about why it is they like or don&#39;t like music featured in a review<br>2. Excite people into giving the music I&#39;m talking about a try<br>I think #2 is super telling because that is not a reviewers job, that&#39;s up to fans, the label, and the artist. Your goal as a reviewer should pertain solely to #1 or you are intellectually bankrupt.<br>&quot;Neither of these goals are possible&quot; yeah because you have a political and ethical disagreement with Kanye, and you don&#39;t believe you can critically engage with Kanye fans. You say you want to be good faith but the refusal to believe that Kanye fans are being genuine and good faith is not good faith. This album is plenty reviewable, you just think ethics, politics, and art are all intertwined so your judgements are all going to be motivated by your disdain for Kanye but you know that is super antithetical to the spirit of a fair and balanced review. You call it unreviewable because if you gave your honest feelings, you would have to admit that your opinions are painted by factors largely outside of the music, revealing yourself to be completely biased, or you would possibly have to commend art made by someone you think is an abhorrent person. Either way you would lose in your mind, and so this album is unreviewable, not objectively so, but to you. You can act indignant but that&#39;s not a reflection of the album or ye, its a reflection of your character and your beliefs.<br>I agree that the art and the artist are intertwined and trying to separate them is a fools errand, however I do think its possible to separate ethics, politics, and aesthetics from each other. &quot;keep a few jews on the staff now&quot; as if that resolved everything is asinine from an ethical standpoint, but aesthetically, its kinda funny because its so stupid. Either its a bit and its entertaining for its stupidity, or its real and its even funnier that Kanye could be that stupid. You need to have a better sense of humor about this. inb4 &quot;see youre a nihilistic teenager&quot; Im not. I&#39;m 23, I have my own beliefs and principles and I am a firm anti-nihilist, I&#39;m just not paranoid about a fascist coup (I have my concerns dont get me wrong, i dont wanna get into that here but the point is that I dont believe its an imminent threat) and so I think there is room for some insensitivity and stupidity in the world. idk read Nietzsche damn<br>Anyway, yeah this album is super reviewable. Ty carried this project. Kanye&#39;s chaotic personality lends itself to the creative process but without some guidance and structure from ty, i dont think we would have gotten this album in this form. The production is really great, the mixing isnt amazing on some tracks but yall blow it out of proportion, there is some charm to KING. FUCK SUMN is easily the worst offender.<br>Content wise this album is marred with an abundance of sexual themes and an objectification of women. I&#39;m not completely opposed to some light chauvinism, Kanye does it on CARNIVAL and Cardi does it on Up just to name an example. The problem is that the middle section of the album is saturated in hedonism. CARNIVAL, FUCK SUMN, HOODRAT, BACK TO ME, PAID. its too much. <br>Some of the production choices are super interesting like the weird grunting bit in the middle of PAPERWORK or the beginning of PAID with the high pitched EEH AH OOH AH. on the other hand, HOODRAT really pushes the limit for what Ill put up with. the chipmunk section of FUCK SUMN and the riff on PAPERWORK are offensive to my ears. I really love the intro to FUCK SUMN and all of BEG FORGIVENESS.<br>The sequencing is almost incoherent. We have a song with the line &quot;i pay that cash, you shake that ass&quot; followed by the song about fatherhood. You would think VULTURES would go into BEG FORGIVENESS but nope he just threw in the song about getting head and a girl riding the dick like carnival. Why is it there? I can see there&#39;s basically three sections to the album with the STARS, KEYS TO MY LIFE, TALKING, and BACK TO ME that serve as an intro and touch on his relationship with Kim and his children, things that mattered before he turned himself into a pariah. PAID, HOODRAT, DO IT, PAPERWORK, FUCK SUMN, and CARNIVAL i chalk up to post divorce hedonism and mania. BURN, VULTURES, BEG FORGIVENESS, GOOD, PROBLEMATIC, and KING directly or indirectly address the antisemitic break down, for Kanye this section would probably represent some enlightened state, as stupid as that may be. Anyway, the placement of PAID, BURN, and CARNIVAL bother me greatly because its obvious he didnt actually care about weaving a narrative but he wanted it to seem like it otherwise the sequencing wouldn&#39;t be so close to coherent but lacking in the finer details.<br>The one liners are actually the worst part of this album. the problem is mostly Kanye. &quot;at 15 my wife wasnt born yet&quot; has got to be the worst lyric hes ever penned and it actually pisses me off that he would basically end an album with that. Dont forget Ty&#39;s &quot;shes russian i beat up the pussy for ukraine.&quot; is it funny as fuck? yes. its still not great for a commercial release jfc.<br>song structure largely doesnt exist. Im for it to be honest but some people are really attached to a verse chorus verse chorus bridge verse chorus structure but its not the only valid structure for a song. i enjoy the chaos.<br>Overall this album is really entertaining and has few really problematic areas. there are some stinker lines and questionable production choices. is that anything new for any established rapper, let alone Kanye? If you solely like old boom bap, you wont enjoy this album much but if you enjoy any mainstream rap from after like 2000 you will find something in this album that clicks. I would easily give it a 7, I think its way more accessible and to the point than Donda, but not nearly as mature. I think its better than Ye just because theres more content and theres more energy and sonic diversity. its better than JiK. I think its meant to rival TLOP but I dont think its there, TLOP is a wider, deeper, better executed album. As time goes by I actually agree with Anthony that MBDTF is really underwhelming compared to the rest of his discography and to be honest I want to say that these albums are equal. Theyre equally inconsistent, I really do think the highs are just as high, but the lows are significantly lower and that has to be conceded. To say this album is unreviewable as if the state of the album or Kanye&#39;s attachment to it completely disqualifies it from consideration is an absolute farce. You can review and appreciate art made by a shit person, and the album is not &quot;piss and poo&quot; as your adult ass keeps saying. Grow up man.<br><br>As an aside, here&#39;s what I believe is the paradigmatic example of this phenomena. Kids on twitter will post Hitler&#39;s paintings and be like &quot;LOL look he made the stair case cover the window and all the angles are off&quot; but they themselves have little to no artistic ability, they just think its bad by virtue of its creator and are looking for anything to rationalize their disdain. His paintings are alright, they&#39;re nothing crazy but they&#39;re pleasant enough and to say he had no artistic ability would be delusional. To say his work is unreviewable is also ridiculous because these kids are reviewing it, theyre breaking down the coloring and the lines as is standard for a review, the problem is their insistence on being extra critical to compensate for Hitler&#39;s wrongdoings. <br><br>I expected a negative review and I knew you would have this attitude, but this degree of obtuseness is something.
üëé
But burzum is totally reviewable
L
Your biast and suck
L video + ur bald + ur moustache is crooked + LLLLLL
If Kendrick did everything Kanye did and created this album Melon would be give it a strong 8 to 9 but now its unreviewable. Lol
Its unreviewable because it exceeds the review boundaries
Look son, he can‚Äôt separate art from artist
Rent due
His bipolar madness has got the best of him.
Album review or just a rant about Kanye? <br><br><br><br><br><br>Sounds very biased to me lol I thought he would actually review the tracks,beats and producer credits but once again, when was the last time Needle Drop actually reviewed an album.
BALD ü§°
such a edgelord
you lost me at conspiracy theory. there arent any
so basically what you&#39;re trying to say is that you didn&#39;t pay attention through the listening
Can‚Äôt stand the sexism in this album. Going to listen to Future to recover my morals.
I love how Fantano will review albums from artists that promote anti-christianity and blatant satanism but jews is where the line is crossed
Feeling a strong 9 to a light 10
hopefully next video you review some music
Crazy how your emotions can get in the way of art...
hes just a lil kooky sometimes
I agree that the dude is a piece of trash, but I just can&#39;t help but enjoy most of his music :/
7 minutes of whining. Granstandthony fantano
‚ÄúNever in my 20 years of teaching‚Äù ahh stare üíÄ
The only good part of the album was Freddie Gibbs and Lil Dirk, the rest is actually parody.
I honestly believe that Kanye fans are mentally challenged
Stay mad Fannytano, you absolute f slur. lmao
Sometimes, ignorance is bliss.
lost all respect for f*ntano. say whatever abt ye but shitting on bianca&#39;s looks like that? for no reason too real mfs dont do that. this dude is so worried abt being politically correct that he came out the other side lmfao. shit is embarrassing. meltdown on a monday morning üíÄ
It&#39;s so funny/sad to watch someone that has no musical talent nor experience (except for listening to tons of music just for the sake of critiquing it) critique one of the best musicians of all time.
I know there&#39;s the argument that you should be able to separate the art from the person like with R. Kelly or Michael Jackson and now Kanye lol, but the older I get the more I think that&#39;s a wildly ignorant standpoint, but then again there&#39;s a grown ass woman out there right now &quot;Making music&quot; that was offended when called a musician replying &quot;TF that means I do magic or something&quot; üòÇ so some segments of the population are just straight lost man and they are never coming back.
yap yap yap
Honestly, I‚Äôm a big Kanye fan, but I agree with some of the things fantano says here. At least when he actually referenced songs. The first half of the video was just him yapping, but his reviews of hood rat and paid are, I feel, correct
maybe some just like his musik?
but im... still the king üíπüí≤ü¶Öüëë
So, bro is divorced and is terminally online fighting with 14 year olds over politics....
I gave this album an 8/10. Some songs were amazing.
my nuts have more hair lol
Bud only roasted a few songs from this album but didn‚Äôt even mention burn, fuk sum, carnival, or beg forgiveness to name a few great tracks from it and they already addressed the mixing problem at least it‚Äôs not as bad as MM by trippe red but your ok with listen to that Fantano all those songs are terribly mixed but two three songs off this album is like a nightmare to you? We know kayne isn‚Äôt a good person in any means but artists have done far worse things out that I couldn‚Äôt even say in comment section
my balls have more hair then your head, im 4, lol bald
For more than half of the video, you‚Äôre talking about anything but music. ‚ÄúSelf imposed ignorance‚Äù is the shit you‚Äôre talking about, probably the etymology of your name. I‚Äôm sorry because you lost a good chance to shut up, maybe next time ü§ê
I&#39;m confused. Are you reviewing albums or artists?
You won‚Äôt review this album because of misogyny but then you slammed Bianca‚Äôs looks on Twitter and compared her to another woman?? That is totally misogynic.
The argument &quot;I only care about the music&quot; is shit; but you &quot;only caring about the artist&#39;s opinions&quot; is fine? You must agree with all the opinions of every other &quot;reviewable&quot; artist that you&#39;ve ever reviewed on this channel then? GTFO. Why even post this pointless soapbox video? Oh, and you DID review it so that&#39;s a stupid clickbait title.
whack video
You would‚Äôve given it 11/10 if he had called it ‚ÄòBussy 1‚Äô
this is an another publicity stunt from the 38 year old divorced childless music reviewer
Fantano can‚Äôt appreciate anything bro, Big L for the melon
Hes a Jew, take this video with a grain of salt
What about Peggy who‚Äôs now besties with Kanye :(
Thanks for making this video, dude. Very brave seeing such a big name on the internet exposing the nature of Kanye&#39;s fanbase in a mature and honest way. I&#39;m sure people are already giving you a lot of shit for it but more than anything they&#39;re just really sad
im sorry but to me with musicians, and artists in general, you have to separate their art from the person. yes you can not like some lyrics for whatever reason you want, thats obvious, but still you have to separate art from the person. i dont like kanye as a human being, i love him as an artist. when other rappers write lyrics objectifying women its fine and a banger, but when kanye does it about his wife, suddenly its not good. in my opinion if hitler made great art, yes you could enjoy his art, regardless who he was as a person, that doesnt change the fact he was a piece of shit and one of the worst human beings that ever existed on earth. anyway my point is that not liking someones art purely because you disagree with that persons beliefs is childish
rap Twitter is going insane after this review üòÇ
You have done reviews from peolpe who killed, steeled and had similar lyrics bout women but this is where you draw the line ??<br>Pathetic , a hater at this point. And of course you can hear someones music without believing his ideas . You CAN listen something for the music only. MOVE ON
Anthony draws the line with a review about Kanye yet reviews albums where rappers talk about killing people lol make it make sense ü§£ü§£. I wish you could see the dislike ratio on this video.
Melon never recovered from that Fader article üòÇ
Strong zionist vibes
Why is he reviewing the man and not the album?
when did fantano get political lol, havent seen him in 5 years
good to know that the things kanye said year ago makes his music bad great to know melon
If Peggy made it you would give it a 10/10
Bro is doing a Kanye review not an album reviewüíÄüíÄüíÄ also bro reviews people who have murdered people but saying shitty stupid stuff is crossing the lineüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ like whatttt
I respect ur opinion but bro liking the album don‚Äôt make u crazy or weird it‚Äôs a good album ye just crazy, u spoke on him as a person for 7 mins n didn‚Äôt talk about the MUSIC or quality or SONGS‚Ä¶ as a ye fan idc about the personal shit just if the MUSIC is good, could you do another video actually talking about the ALBUM n not him üòÇüòÇ as a music reviewer separate personal bias n music idek if I listened to a song by this video
its a kanye top 5 album tbh just stfu
He sucks and always has
Hate from chileüî•üî•üíØüíØ
Virtue virtue
I give your hairline a light 1
Imagine hoodrat with jadakiss rapping on it
the kanye minions in the comments just proving fantano‚Äôs point. lol you‚Äôre sick
The more Fantano fumes about Kanye the more I am compelled to listen to his music üòÇ
Nr 1 in israel !!!!!!
Fantano you are being too biased here. I understand some of your critiques but others dont make much sense. This album is a 5 or 6 at worst. That being said its a fun album and most of the songs are fun bangers. If you dont want to associate with Ye music and fans that is understandable, but you shouldnt have made this video at all.
lol bald guy bald
Just Fantano having a mental breakdown for 7 minutes like a teenager because people have different opinions than him :D
Wait till he hears the Burger King bar
Fantano is in the minority most people like this album. Also you need to stop with your Mary Sue arc it‚Äôs scaring the hoes. üòÇ
If u still have some respect for yourself or for kanye unsubscribe for this mf
Great for Black History month.
yet melon still makes mutliple Videos about him
You draw the line here because you know it will get you views smh worst reviewer
facts
FactsüíØ
If Kanye was a lib Anthony would love the album.
bald.
Came for an album review, not a rant .
Dudes just virtue signaling
womp womp
If it was called Butterflies 1 it would be reviewable i bet
Kind of insane to think this is the same man who made Violent Crimes less than six years ago
MY GOAT MADE A NEW CATEGORYYYYYYYY
Dislike
Well said. Only his hypebeast fans think everything he does is great
did this guy say he draws a line when rappers start to objectify women? like... has this egghead not listened to any raps before?
Bro cant separate the artist from the music at all üòÇ understandable
Yo ngl Fantano, it‚Äôs a pretty bad time to be saying a bunch of pro-Israel stuff
One of many Fantano&#39;s classic overreactions. I&#39;m NOT a Kanye fan but the album has some great  rpoductions and instrumentals. Lyrics kinda trashb in general but i&#39;d give it a 5.5/10
Giving this yapping session a light 7
been saying this for years, anthony fantano does not know how to separate art from an artist. Kanye‚Äôs music doesn‚Äôt truly include his beliefs with certain things. And if he really didn‚Äôt wanna give this album attention, he wouldn‚Äôt review it. plz stop caring what this youtuber thinks as he believes an album has to have ‚Äúmeaning‚Äù and can‚Äôt just be a good collection of songs. Don‚Äôt make an album review if you don‚Äôt wanna review something buddy.
Fantano it really disappoints me that you can‚Äôt even put your bias aside for a single video and admit when you are wrong. You have lost all credibility that you ever used to have
So it&#39;s a 8/10 right
True, I used to think separate the person from the art but he made it impossible, because Kanye mixes them himself with the lyrics. I‚Äôm still enjoying his old work but I can‚Äôt say the same for the new.
redbar is watching
Are you jewish ? Kanye said i should ask you.
love to see the kanye psychos mad as fuck in these comments
ü§°ü§°ü§°
baldy
Ye rly made fantano famous
How can you stand tall about this one artist when you review other rappers talking about killing others in the streets. ü§° Type 4. Delusional/hypocrite reviews like this one.
bro is still defending a group committing an ACTIVE genocide in 2024. Wow, I didn&#39;t think the needledrop could be ANY worse. How do you people watch this?
Going through these comments makes me realize how much I‚Äôve grown up. I probably would be calling this cringe if I was still 14 and just started watching your channel, but I‚Äôm not. Thank you for making a great video on this.
Paperwork is one of the worst songs I have ever heard
Kanye west is a behemoth an icon a genius and the biggest voice in music. I promise you graduation is better than anything anyone ever dropped in my life time including tayler swift. Kanye can not be canceled he‚Äôs bigger than the program. However he should stop antisemitism and I don‚Äôt think he will continue because he‚Äôs aim was to only be free from contracts that‚Äôs scammed him. He loves Jews I promise he doesn‚Äôt hate them he just needed to be free
I think you misunderstood the reference line
Your supposed to review music, not to talk shit about ye
It was fucks given, now it ain&#39;t no more
Lol L review <br>He stated he already had a problem going in with Kanye prior to hearing the album. <br>If you are going to criticize music let that shit come from the album not your petty I want bitch and act like I‚Äôm  the  freedom fighter of the music review industry üòÇ<br>Do It ft nip and yg is a good ass song. I know it‚Äôs gotta be easy to be a hating bitch but damn dog you really think you are doing something by letting your  morality be the sole reason behind your review lol
you&#39;re sooooo biased man
w antisemit
I mean, I get the approach of only caring about the quality of the music and not the contents of the lyrics and what he himself does. I don&#39;t really care for much kanye that&#39;s post donda so I could personally care less about what he says cause it doesn&#39;t affect me in anyway but ofc yeah some of the lyrics are mental to say the least. plus, if you ask me it seems kinda like out of every famous person thats said something fucked up and got chewed out for it kanye is getting it pretty fuckin&#39; bad so thats enough for me as someone who doesn&#39;t even care for the music and hasn&#39;t even listened to the album, lmfao.
I respect your opinion and ye fans need to back off. I get that y‚Äôall want your opinions validated, I‚Äôm a ye fan too. But at the end of the day no one is forced to like or to listen to something/someone they are simply not interested in or don‚Äôt align with. I completely respect fantanos opinion on this, he‚Äôs not feeling the vibes and that‚Äôs OK. He doesn‚Äôt owe a review to anyone
Comments section bros out here taking it a bit personal for a vid positioned against Kanye and his fans üßê
10 and unreviewable Kanye is a different breed
Mr Clean&#39;s divorce made him salty
Kanye was just ahead of the curb with the Free Palatine movement
The jews in my audience üòÇ Anthony fuckfano
We wanted a music review not his whole life storyüòÇsuch a biased take didn‚Äôt even have to do with music
fantano when the album isnt made by some thai dude in year 1800 and has under 2 listeners.get a job
Reviewing murders is chill tho guys
Kanye is ye
Burn is pretty good . I think this an example of an artist getting in the way of the art
As a former obsessed Kanye fan, current obsessed Kanye fans in these comments are proving Fantano right lmao.
You can easily separate the art from the artist in this case. He&#39;s not spouting hitler/neo nazi rhetoric on the songs lyrics where its unavoidable. I&#39;d say his king like is actually a good lyric describing his massive ego and that no matter what the media accuses him of he&#39;s still the greatest ever (in his eyes) and the other two are funny and completely harmless. Way different than actual anti semitic rhetoric (which he has said publicly prior to this).<br><br>That being said the album is terrible anyway so just review it as such. The biggest highlight was his Hell of a Life sample which is pretty damn sad compared to where he used to be when it came to making music.
Dude&#39;s wearing a shirt made by a pseudo slave talking on a computer battery made by slaves moralizing about kanye LOL joke
#1 in israel
Lol he must be Jewish
Fantano professional yapper
ur old, trumps getting reelected and kanye is uncancellable, your world is dying and you with it
L, ancient bozo
What
the needle goy
This is why not a lot of people respect this guys musical opinion
Looking forward to SunnyV2&#39;s &quot;the rise and fall of Anthony Fantano&quot; video
üîîend
damn this review was so good, you should&#39;ve had your wife do it with you!
Womp womp
Not a massive fan. Yeah, the lyrics are dumb. Yeah, some musical questions are pretty questionable. Some of it slaps though. Come on now.
Whomp whomp talk about the music
am i not allowed to listen to kanye just for his music anymore. damn i cant listen to his songs even if i wanted to because of what he said in his lyrics. also ratio + bald + jewish
Review starts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=310">5:10</a>
Ur weird bro
Shoutout to melon for reviewing an unreviewable album for 7 minutes<br>Edit - guys I&#39;ve watched the video Ik it&#39;s not really a review. This comment is just a joke chill üò≠
Welcome to commie town ü§£ü§£
True, ye sucks
Isn‚Äôt this video a review by default?
Blud
Since you want to get all political why dont you talk about the genocide in palestine by the G people?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=276">4:36</a> if you call him ignorant go call people out that listen to: YNW Melly, King Von, Tay-K, (murderers) and literally any other rapper that has done even less and still have people listening to their MUSIC.<br><br>thanks!
this is the soyest video on the website! good job anthony, i knew you had it in you
Sounds like someone has a personal vandeta wit YE
Bro drew the line at Kanye hating the Jews, but not hating on black people with the ‚Äúslavery is a choice‚Äù sentence.
Awh poor baby
Another case of fantano being brainwashed
soyyyboyyyy
Thank you for sharing your true feelings. I‚Äôm so fucking sick of Kanye‚Äôs fans screaming over everyone saying he‚Äôs some kind of untouchable genius. The guy just hasn‚Äôt made anything relevant for so many years now he‚Äôs washed.
Point out the consequences his actions had on the world
&quot;I put nerds on the map&quot;<br>Prefectly describes this balding loser too well
Your comment on the 2nd type of Kanye fan, ‚Äúnihilistic teenagers who don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any consequences to these things‚Äù is so fucking prescient to me. Thinking back, in 2016 I was a junior in highschool depressed and unsure of the future and I was so into the whole idea of ‚Äúwanting to see the world burn‚Äù and the alt right ideological hooks fit that bill. I only made it out 2 years later when I travelled for college and met real people and touched grass and shit. The number one thing I wanna tell people about that demographic is that their induction into alt right spaces is straight up exploitation of emotion, and it CAN be stopped.
womp womp
This is a cannon event for fantano, this is going to be referenced like the mbdtf review.
At first I thought you would just dismiss this album because you dislike Kanye&#39;s &quot;&quot;&quot;politics&quot;&quot;&quot;, but after this video, I realize that you are just being reasonable and that Kanye fans should unretard for a second and realize that they&#39;re basically part of a social experiment at this point. Outside of the donda 2 -esque moody beats and some barely catchy hooks, there is nothing to this album and I&#39;m kinda stupid to have expected more.
thats why your wife left your ass
Thank you Anthony, very cool!
Lmao pretty sure Jews say worst about black ppl. Talk about it
What a fucking dork. You have jumped the shark.
this is so performative by no means is it a good album but ‚Äúunreviewable‚Äù is such a stretch
but when jews and other artists support genocide u are okay with them
i like his aesthetics best in the game. obviously NOT the nazi stuff but everything else is fire.
Right now Kanye is so thirsty for attention and any promotion he&#39;d probably pay you to review it
Where&#39;s your wife baldy?
this video is unwatchable
BBTWDJFOTSYK
Melon would still review a Tom Macdonald album if he was shouting the n word over and over again an entire album
all my homies hate fantano
Calling out Kanye but not the other people on the tracks? They are choosing to work with him after all the comments he‚Äôs made
unwatchable 1
Damn melon, did you really have to say Kanye hasn‚Äôt been anti-Semitic enough and until he ups his anti-Semitic content you can‚Äôt review his albums?
First major Fantano L frfr
do your job anthony
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=76">1:16</a> shoutout to Handsome Truth and the boys at the GDL‚ö°‚ö°
LIBERAL!
divorced?
#1 in 72 countries...
EmpLemon downward spiral
I&#39;m not even mad at Ty Dolla $ign because he&#39;s just there to get paid
If you had balls I bet those would be bald too. ü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£
Seethe, cry and cope. üçà
The album was good, end of discussion. We don&#39;t need this guys opinion
So reviewing albums made by literally murderers and criminals is okay but reviewing an album made by someone who has a different opinion to you is where you draw the line.
Can we as a society start saying Tyler the creator is the new goat. Fuck ye.
You gonna be hearing for a while. Unless you go deaf
It‚Äôs like you know that critiquing Kanye would get you more internet attention
There are Kanye fans who just want to listen to his music and that&#39;s it lol
should music reviewers be unbiased? cuz the fuck u be yappin bout is insaneüò≠üôè‚ò†Ô∏è
Burn alone should make the album a 10/10
common fantano L
I still like Kanye AND his music, now what sir?
This album fire tho!
I think that‚Äôs a totally fair point and really put what I was thinking about the album into words! Thanks Melon!
if ksg came out today fantano would rate it 2/10 because kanye said some things about the jews lol
Wow I‚Äôm glad I got a lecture on this when I was looking for a music review. Atleast now I hold the right opinion
if it went ‚Äúkendrick‚Äù instead of ‚Äúhoodrat‚Äù it would be a 10
idk. I liked it
Bro is really obsessed with Sexxy Red
Oh MYYYY  GOSHHHH THIS DUDE ANTHONY FANTANO IS SO ANNOYINGGG
What a cop out
womp womp
Kanye did NOT die for this üò≠üôèüèΩ
Fantano still listened to the whole thing.
<b>Artist that Fantano doesn&#39;t like releases quality music</b><br><br>Fantano: &quot;So if you like this album, you&#39;re a either a cult member, a hateful psychopath or a shit-for-brain teenager&quot;... real great analysis there. The hateful/salty tones are giving upset, hot-take, liberal goo - I&#39;m so sorry Kanye keeps you up a night.
Im not a fan of you or kanye but i think its funny how you dont want to review an album cause you are so mad about all the shit that kanye has said that you cant even give honest feedback and review the album, you have reviewed and enjoyed music from murderers (King Von) but now the artist is relevant in the art? can you at least admit that you been jewish has a lot to do with you not wanting to review the album. To be honest I always so you as a guy that loved music and was fair in criticism but now I see you as a mid reviewer that wont even put his feelings aside and listen to the work. The funny thing is even the lyrics that you showed as prove that he was Antisemitism literally said I just fu*k a jewish b*tch how can i be Antisemitism, bro lmao that is not even that bad.
How can you separate the artist and the music. Why do streaming platforms stream his music? Where can you start taking artists off because of their acts.
fantano goated
Bro got degree in yapanomics
Anthony you are here to grade music, not be politically inclined to  make comments about someone‚Äôs beliefs while it may be harmful, the music is what you are here for. Stop acting like that‚Äôs not why you have the millions of followers you have and just grade the music‚Ä¶ this is not a video I wanted to see from you. And to categorize Kanye fans into 3 groups without knowing any of our individuality and our own beliefs is patronizing. I hope this comment finds you well. I will not be back here because you have seemed to not care about your fans and make this video completely about something other than music.
Imagine a guy who loves DEATH METAL preaching &quot;Righteousness&quot; üò≠ that&#39;s pretty hilarious... i give this video a light to strong negative infinity
he took his glasses off for the thumbnail so you know he&#39;s serious
Dwight Schrute ass intro.
The reference verse just completely flew over his head. Idiot it means that Kanye likes that type that Kim was. Absolute fucking fool üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Ye basically said I am whatever you say I am, and in the same breath state, he&#39;s the king.
Lyrics about shooting people and dealing drugs - cool, 10/10.<br>Lyrics slightly criticise Jews - 0/10, irredeemably evil.
Well spoken bruh..
You‚Äôre so disingenuous it doesnt make sense. You draw the line HERE???? But openly accept satanist music, love old Eminem, and listen to a million controversial figures. But you draw the line HERE???? <br><br>Get off your high horse please ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
my boi earned himself a unsubscribe üòÇ
Damn dude you&#39;re really mad kanye won&#39;t fuck you
Im just on my 10th times of looping Vultures today just for few minutes listen to melon and come back to Viltures another ten times life is beautiful
fair review, but the album still fire tho.
Nah. Back to me a banger
the fact bro&#39;s only yapping about the mid songs on the album is crazy smh
In my opinion it‚Äôs 7/10
L take
fantano gets a childish/10
Music reviewer doesn&#39;t review music, lmao<br>Just don&#39;t make a video
Yo unreviewable is wild üò≠üò≠
never seen fantano this close-minded and biased before
I just hope Chelsea&#39;s new album gets the love it deserves.
bald bozo L
Bro is unable to separate art from artist. Sad.
Cringe ü§¶üèª <br>I saw this political shift in the channel a while ago and unsubscribed lol but to refuse to give the album a review as a piece of art as a protest to the &quot;horrors&quot; it&#39;s causing is beyond virtue signaling it&#39;s just sad
Damn, at least give it a score don‚Äôt act like this album isn‚Äôt better than anything drakes put out in forever
Terrible take.<br>Some people just listen to the music, and don&#39;t care about his opinions. You&#39;re clearly unable to separate those two things, unless this entire this was satire.<br>Before you call me antisemitic for liking kanye I&#39;m an israeli jew btw and most of us have a similar take to mine.
Fantano you are a top 5 most idiotic music reviewer in history.
Dude honestly it‚Äôs not that serious <br>Either review or don‚Äôt <br>You don‚Äôt have to bow to the feelings parade. You‚Äôre soft!
How do you expect to change any Kanye fans‚Äô minds by calling them lonely losers with no lifeü§£
Yet you review Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, pollution swift, cardi b , it goes on and on
melon im gonna be real i thought u fell off a long time ago and ur so butthurt over kanye at this point its crazy
Unreviewable yet reviews 4 cherry picked songs got it
This stupid guy about get his first million views after a decade üò≠ü§£ü§£ü§£ I feel sorry for him üòä
What‚Äôs the point of being a music reviewer if you review the person and not the music. Should delete this channel because now we know that‚Äôs all he does. Should‚Äôve known since he tried to sleep with sexy red
Thank you for bringing so much attention to the album!
So ur not gonna review it
Album‚Äôs dogshit<br><br>Turn off celebrity news Fantano
post-divorce rant is crazy
ironically, anthony fantano is letting his moralist outrage blind him to the musical content of the album, while accusing fans of the album of being blind to the musical content of the album.
Are you reviewing music or people?
Womp womp
1. TY Dolla $ign was on this album too<br>2. just because you don‚Äôt like Kanye doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt enjoy his music
Your supposed moral superiority is laughable...
So according to this logic, antisemitism is off the limits right so then rapping about murders, drugs, crime should all be off limits. Cant say this and not go both ways baldy
This guy like most zionists thrives on distress,
clown üòÇ
Hermano, siento que te fuiste demasiado dramatico, Drake puede tirar cosas terribles sobre las mujeres, ha habido rese√±as de tipos que han pertenecido a Gangs, y solo porque Ye debido a su enfermedad mental da comentarios molestos sobre una comunidad ‚Äúno es rese√±able‚Äù no lo s√© Mel√≥n, no estoy de acuerdo pero hey, es tu canal! Abrazos y Amor
Melon got completely ratioed here üòÇ
The fall of fantano
Kanye: My Struggle
Jesus forgives but Melon doesn&#39;t
I&#39;ve been a fan of Kanye since i started listening to music. The first album i heard and my favorite album of all time is the College Dropout. He has such an incredible discography and he pushed the boundaries of music in an incredible way. But he has derailed into something unrecognisable. I think all the great music that he has given us over the years, for me, it&#39;s enough. I miss the old Kanye
hate/10
So reviewing king von a person who murdered 20+ people is ok but ‚ÄúNOO WE CANT TALK ABOUT JEWS‚Äù
Anthony how the actual fuck is this a one? There are atleast 5 or 6 songs that are 7‚Äôs or better. You are just trying to be different by hating on mainstream music. You also go on about his anti semetic views. You have said many times you have to separate the art from the artist. Straighten up and actually review the album.
Great stuff dude
anthony fantano seperate the artist from the art challenge impossible (he admitted it)
So Jews aren‚Äôt the gate keepers in entertainment? Ppl miss the message.
He won‚Äôt speak on Paperwork, Carnival, Burn, Do It, etc though. Certified classics
if kendrick made it 10/10
TALKING is good tho
Fantano&#39;s just passing out hand grenades to his trolls and haters at this point. It&#39;s fine if you don&#39;t like Kanye or his opinions (I don&#39;t either) but just don&#39;t bother making a video at all instead of going on a ridiculous pearl-clutching rant, it accomplishes nothing. People are going to believe what they&#39;re going to believe and listen to what they want to listen to, some melon in a flannel shirt whining about an album he doesn&#39;t like isn&#39;t going to miraculously make them see the light.
Why everyone needs to think about jews and if their feelings are hurt, world is getting fed up with them. They are not the chosen people, they are just people and they should behave accordingly.
I think Melon really likes Kanye.
I‚Äôve never liked Fantano, he gives me bad vibes, like I feel like if you knew him in real life he would always have something to complain about, ykwim?
The least biased music reviewer on YouTube üôåüëè
realest review he has ever posted
You have reviewed da baby and he‚Äôs literally killed a man in Walmart ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
What a lame video.  Just don&#39;t review it, Mr. ReviewMan.
seperate the art from the artist
ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
All Fantano needed to say was ‚ÄúI can not review this album in good faith because the artist has decided to aligned themselves with ideas that I find reprehensible. I believe reviewing this, regardless of score, is unethical. I probably won‚Äôt be reviewing any more of their music. I‚Äôll see you for the next actual review.‚Äù<br><br>Instead we get a rant that comes off unhinged and draws attention to the artist. Essentially accomplishing what he didn‚Äôt want to do.
unironically one of your most goated videos
Bias üêï
unsubscribed
This guy only wants industry and record label tied artists to win
No way twitter got to you üòÇ
&quot;He&#39;s parading his naked wife like some sort of trophy&quot;.<br>At least he has a wife, you know. How&#39;s yours doing Tony?
Because you‚Äôve obviously never been on the recieving end of hate and antagonistic perception. Being black or coloured in America feels like being Kanye and you‚Äôll never understand that
you really missed up on here fantano. I thought you are bigger than that
This guy sucks
Fantano: &quot;u know it&#39;s a review right????&quot;<br><br>Also Fantano: u delusional kanye fans, you guys are so stupid you can&#39;t even listen to me
But where the review tho? I need a number
Bro it‚Äôs a rap album that‚Äôs gonna be widely listened to by most people. Just review it straight up. It‚Äôs not that serious. Chill fantano.
Ofc you start it out with hearsay and associating him with Neo nazis. Remember the Zionist culture is what grew along side the USA and its materialistic and looks based cultures , plus Blanca is happy bro your bugging
There is absolutely no way you genuinely believe this album was worse than Honestly, Nevermind.
There&#39;s only like 1 song where it feels like Ty dolla sign was a apart of the album. Who the fuck wants a rich the kid feature in 2024. Albums ok. Kanye is not ok and as someone who grew up as a fan of kanye through my childhood I wish he was cool and not This unmedicated mess of a person he is. I don&#39;t care about rich persons pov or political opinions just shut up kanye
I dont really like the album that much, kinda ass. But i support kanye because of his ideology and what he says, especially the loving of an austrian painter.
I was just excited for peggys production
I agree, it is trash.
bro u dont matter
anyone else watching this and only hearing ‚Äúhoodrat hoodrat hoodrat hoodrat‚Äù in their head and watching this bald man with a mustache move his mouth and hands?
DO IT and BURN the only good tracks I&#39;ve heard so far. Album altogether was a hard listen. Sadly the record is garbage
we are at the point where the music is suffering. i feel like the first donda was the last decent effort we got from kanye and since then the music has gone downhill.
thoughts on what happens to Palestinians in the past few months?
Would&#39;ve loved to be diagnosed by Dr. Fantano
At the end of the day your listening experience is your listening experience. I personally can separate the art from the artist but I know some can‚Äôt. But for Fantano to make something like this ‚Äúunreviewable‚Äù but has listened/reviewed the music of  murderers, domestic violence, etc is so hypocritical. I am NOT making an exception for Kanye because he hasn‚Äôt been a good person in the last 2-3 years. But we can‚Äôt sit here and act like these WORDS Kanye are saying is the same as the ACTIONS of others who has gotten reviews/listens in the past‚Ä¶
Remember when fantano actually reviewed the music and had unbiased opinions? Now he just reviews things based on the artists character/politics lol. 1st saying Lil Dicky album was &quot;white guy making a mockery of black culture&quot; and now this lmao
Such a pussy standpoint. Where is the rational kanye fan who can distinguish the art from its creator? U guys need to cool off on the feelings side of things, also, saying that hitler has had some good ideas or any good impact on the world is not praising him in general or his character, just pointing out the fact that u irrational beings just attach anything hitler related to the word &quot;bad&quot; like an ad hominem attack of sorts. Praising an idea does not equal praising the ideas creator.
Omg no Tran-sition
bro, you gonna get exiled üò≠
he gave sexxy red an 8.
nice morale high ground
Not gonna lie I didn‚Äôt like the vultures single, went into the album with a not positive mindset, but there was 8 songs I actually thought were decent
i expected this review from your tweets on X but you have an agenda same as kanye fans
Bianca has been dressing like that before ye
The review is one thing, but there was no need to call Kanye the n word that many times.
stop bitching and review the fucking album
Your hating Zionist
I mean, I get it, but a bit weak, it&#39;s definitely reviewable. It&#39;s not a good album though, I&#39;m feeling a weak 3/10 on this.
I miss the old kanye
Kanye made your channel what it is boy
L
Kanye&#39;s awful. I agree with you on all fronts there. But I do think that there&#39;s a fourth group of people like me, who can appreciate the fact that Vultures is inarguably fire, while still being critical of its content and not giving the man behind it a red cent. Much in the same way that, topically, I can love Filsofem while still denouncing Varg. This fourth group is probably a minority though.<br><br>I&#39;ll give you props though for essentially not giving him the platform to potentially gain people who <b>will</b> buy his merch.
Stop seething bro. Its embarrassing
This video is spot on, but if I were to rate the album realistically based off music talent I‚Äôll give him a 3/10
What have Kanye fans done to this guy üíÄ
Finally people are realizing how fucking stupid Kanye is
&quot;you&#39;d have to be delusional to think anything else&quot; i&#39;m sure when Wilde was writing the critic as artist he was envisioning tik-tok brained platitudes like this.
honestly if you despise Kanye and the album so much then maybe perhaps you shouldn‚Äôt cover it on your channel<br><br>Vultures 1 is really mid but this video is straight up stupid. What were you trying to accomplish
how can this guy still be relevant critic with so much subjectivity that is unrelated to music???
Woke guy didnt even listen to every song, instead he wants to preach his own agenda, shame.
I mean i understand kanye is very delusional and says completely insane things, but as a jewish person myself i still found some enjoyment in this album although far from even his last album donda, which wasn‚Äôt even one of his best. it‚Äôs a pretty mid album, and his lyrics are one of the reasons for that, but it feels like your pandering to me about how i shouldn‚Äôt be listening to him with this kind of review. Saying there‚Äôs three types of people listening and not including people who just listen for enjoyment without trying to write off his music immediately is narrow minded.
This video is unwatchable trash
danny fantano downfall gotta be studiedüíÄ
oh just give it a proper review Anthony - ‚ÄúStars‚Äù is just beautiful right? <br><br>And think about the engineers and vocalists who contributed it‚Äôs not just kanye on here - you can‚Äôt taint your whole review on the basis of you don‚Äôt like him. <br><br>Can you not go abit deeper? Can you not think about kanye punctuating his mood and emotions by each album as i have my whole life at 27 yrs old. He‚Äôs not R Kelly hurting people, he‚Äôs just completely delusional and in a horrible horrible place. <br><br>I was excited for your review to digest everything but you are completely dismissive of even tackling anything. <br><br>my review is: The hooks and instrumentals are amazing but the lyrics are bland and tasteless. Kanyes in a very dark place. His followers are aware of the financial media machine trying to make him worse.
This man looks like an adult swim character. Get them views babygirl
Unwatchable 1
The album is great
Free Palestine Movement says it and it&#39;s okay, kanye says it and there&#39;s a problem. ü§îü§î
bro i dont even think the music is good, i will never understand and nfr is pissing me off. they act like kanye is making the same great music
Stop posting on hip hop reviews. You know absolutely nothing about anything. You‚Äôre a plague to the community and you need to keep your options to yourself.
the audio of this video sound bad

Fantano why do you do this for kanye and not lauryn hill shes like openly racist, also if you wanna use the lyrics thing sexy redds whole personality is degrading/sexualising women
stay bald
HOORAYforBOOBIES classic review please
No one cares. you review music for a living do your job. you&#39;re not a politician. We all know the album was good.
Why does the album sound like it was recorded with a potato
8/10
i thought music was about how it sounds?
What about rappers who degrade women and promote violence? They‚Äôre cool right?
Kanye is like the Silent Hill of music, hasn&#39;t been good in 20 years but people with bad taste prop it up.
Is good that you admit you can‚Äôt review this album because you hate so much a mentally ill person.
The yappin is crazy
Fantano isn&#39;t fooling anyone, he&#39;s just hating on kanye to appeal as morally virtuous
I said I thought the album was a 3/10 and people on Instagram just made fun of my hairline lol. You can‚Äôt have a conversation with these kids and I can guarantee no one will have more than 3 songs on rotation in a months time
Came here for the comments, thought the album was great üòÇ
Melon really is washed fkn hypocrite, he is so anti christian it&#39;s crazy
Seriously what a willfully ignorant and pompous video to make
This review is just as cringe
I‚Äôm sure gas lighting your audience will definitely make Kanye miss out on sales. You‚Äôre definitely doing the world such a service by lying and only reviewing Kanye as a person and not the music. Mental health is the most important thing until it‚Äôs the manic Bi-polar Kanye West.  #1 Album in 100 countries including Israel.
This felt more like hating than reviewing. I think it is totally possible to like music without the artist. They‚Äôre not gods they‚Äôre music machines
yeah you biased
You lose your balls in the divorce too?
Sad thing about Ye fans is that they think he is some king of a God lmfao
The biggest Kanye delusion is pretending this album is good
Rate the music not him as a person.
Bruh stop just review the music
i‚Äôm ngl dawg Kanye gets a 10 in my books if sexy red gets an 8.
I didnt think that melons fanbase is so full of antisemitism
i hope this is a jokey joke
you are not a politician
Fantano doesn‚Äôt care about black people.
Perfect, mellow. And aaaalso... The  m√∫sic is SHIT.
this is so fucking cringe lmao. 1. you cant sit here and try to be on the moral high ground being like &quot;yuck this is literally unreviewable because of something this guy said&quot; while you and everyone else will glorify music thats about murder and drugs and violence and abuse, most of which is stuff that the people rapping about it actually DID. you seriously think saying a couple antisemitic things is even comparable to murder? obviously what he said about jews is grotesque but trying to say that what he said is too far while also supporting literal murderers and drug abusers and woman beaters is actually insane. you are a music reviewer. review the music. thats the whole point, not what he might have said or did. if you applied this same logic to everyone else you would never review another rap album again. its absurd. and not to mention how stupid your point about how what he said actually affects the greater world is. again, people are glorifying murder and abuse and drugs in their records all the time and i can guarantee you that is way more impactful on the youth than this dude saying a couple antisemitic things. i give your review a 0/10 and its actually insane how brain dead you really are when for years i thought you were actually somewhat reasonable
thank you Fantano
Man you really just said everything i have been trying to explain to my friends who think its a 9/10, i listened to the album and thought it was one of the worst pieces of music i have listened its is genuinely unreviewable. First time I agree with every part of your video üòÖ
If it was called ‚ÄúSpeeding Vultures to Heaven‚Äù you would have given it a review
Hey but I&#39;mma be honest, most every Ty verse on the album hits
the unreviewable title is just to draw in views, like bro how tf u gonna call a album unreviewable when u are already reviewing it? just give the album a 0 or a &quot;not good&quot;.
My Beautiful Dark Unreviewable Fantasy
#1 Globally.
Whoever likes this album should try out a book called Mein Kampf it‚Äôs a really good read!!!
POV: you‚Äôre addicted to twitter and haven‚Äôt been outside in months
L jew. THesE lYriCs aRE bAd. But will meat ride drug dealers, serial killers and degenerates.
Oh boy we got a yapper here üò≠üôèüôè
I don&#39;t think the reference line is that bad. He just says Bianca is his type. And people have been saying she looks like Kim Kardashian, so that&#39;s just his type.<br><br>I would call myself a Kanye fan, but I am very pissed off about his nazi shit. Kanye is mentally ill (it goes beyond autism from the car crash) and everyone should be aware of that. <br><br>Back to me is catchy though
Halfway in and my boy still not talking about the music. This guy is so MTV next year he&#39;ll be doing prank shows
I thought this was a music review not a Kanye power level
Anyway. Hail <b>****</b> üòä
Kanye has definitely fallen off musically. But there are a lot of artists who are terrible people.<br><br>Jay Z sold crack, then Oprah called him a self-made millionaire.<br><br>Drake has definitely stolen lyrics, flows, and whole song ideas, but he&#39;s considered by many as the GOAT<br><br>Andre 3000 made everyone think he was releasing a new album, but it was just him fucking around with VSTs for an hour.<br><br>You still made a review, even if you called it unreviewable.
Not even Anthony can review this dogshit. Wake up Ye fans. Kanye is a terrible human being.
Bro is coping so hard üòÇ Just another W from kanye
I had to pause my phone after the 5th n word was dropped
BNBTWDJFOTSYKüó£Ô∏èüó£Ô∏è
You are not a real reviewer‚Ä¶ political bias forms your opinion so big L to me boy
I really have no issue with someone saying ,,this person is morally reprehensible, so I refuse to engage in any way with anything he&#39;s done.&quot; Problem is, he said all that, AND THEN STILL REVIEWED THE ALBUM, which was obviously influenced by his view of kanyes persona. Pretty disappointing from melon.
how has this guy become so cringe holy shit
That album suck lol
Keep that same energy for black on black crime lyrics
Which Kanye fan slept with this guys mom? üò≠
L
Totally agree with you. The total oblivion of some kanye fans is really sad. Ignorance runs deep and wild nowadays. Not everything is excusable. Props to fantano to being conscious and true to his ideas, as always, even with some of the bullying that he has to endure.
You don‚Äôt have to support something to give it an honest opinion.
Never thought I‚Äôd see the fall off of Mr.Watermelon him self ü´°
Guys clearly got mentalhealth issues as anyone who craves lime light on personal opinions however crazy probably could do with a reality check. And as for kanye....Nah all jokes aside, terrifying watching a truly great and inspiring artist spiral into insanity where no one appears to want to help.
I listened to this as a last-ditch effort before I all but abandon Kanye. Been a fan since 2005 when my mom bought me Late Registration, and the last few years have been a nightmare. With everything he does, it becomes increasingly more obvious that he‚Äôs unhinged and doesn‚Äôt care to seek help, doubling down at every possible interval he can. Ironically, I think he‚Äôd have to go back to the Jesus is King era before I would think about listening again. Hope he gets the help he needs, but I just can‚Äôt excuse or condone it anymore
I actually feel bad for fantano and have second hand embarrassment for Kanye fans. These psychos are giving the man death threats just for a review. Kanye fans have become worse than swifties
The only good part of this album is the papa John‚Äôs, hamburger helper chili Mac, and aldi shoutouts.
Fantano is a political actor, the worst time of actor. He will throw his reviews under the bus since politics is a higher priority for him, not music. <br>Don&#39;t be this kind of loser, do what you want to do, do not care for politics and if they call you left wing or right wing, just tell them to suck a big one. Your speging about whatever goofy shit is happening in the world will probably amount to nothing but headache.
can you please review the new Declan McKenna album?
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ
Butthurt j3w boy
talking about how Kanye degrades his wife who is an ADULT with a FREE will while reviewing hundreds of rap albums with pure mysogny, is where you drew the line. Just a hater.
Ur on the wrong side of history, people are realising and u just cucked out for people who hate u  :(
So I am to understand that this album probably slaps.
Ah yes he‚Äôs basing this music review on Kanye‚Äôs political views üò≠ these old heads bruh I swear
We know u dont disrespect Bianca like that in her face
After his Sexy red review , i cant take any opinion on muic from him serious
If you can‚Äôt listen and comment on any music made from bad people, then there‚Äôs not much music left.
Says album is unreviewable‚Ä¶continues to review it
Let him cook
Bro stfu quit d I c riding your just hating yeee is healthy
trash video bad review quit
Bro u should just retire at this point
Kanye always in a league of his own 10/10
didnt realize till the end that  it wasnt  a real album cover behind him lol
Melon is such a huge Ye &amp; Vultures fan that he made this video ‚ù§
Say what you want. But Kanye is still one of the best artists out right now. And honestly that‚Äôs sad asf. Even on his worst day he‚Äôs better than 95% of garbage out there
If Kanye made those antisemitic remarks and released this album a decade ago you would have made a video on thatistheplan about how accurate kanye is and how much you agree with him
I don&#39;t think he knows how much he&#39;s messed up. Like something is legitimately wrong with him rn. Did you see his commercial he got for the super bowl? He needs serious help. I&#39;m not saying this is the root cause of his antisemitism or whatever, but it certainly wouldn&#39;t help. This sucks to watch play out honestly. Like, it&#39;d honestly make me feel better if he were in his right mind and was spouting this nonsense like John Wayne so we could all simply say, &quot;Okay yes. He&#39;s a clearly bad person.&quot; and move on. (again not excusing his actions 100%. Just saying there&#39;s clearly more to it than what&#39;s being brought out imo)
I agree with you the lyrics are shit but I have to push back on the production. It feels like a blend of different Kanye era into one project.
Bro really doesn‚Äôt like his life
&quot;unreviewable&quot; proceeds to review it
He protected under free speech rights letting you now
rare fantano W
Imagine if artists from the 70s had access to Twitter, half the classic artist would be unreviewable  by Fantano the righteous
You spent more time talking about his politics instead of the music, think that says it all.
womp womp
Title clickbait king üòÇ
You sound like a jew lover üßê
shut up
Fantano, I don‚Äôt wanna hear it anymore. The more you generalize Kanye fans into either being Nazis or idiots you cannot talk to anymore. It‚Äôs not even funny. I understand he‚Äôs a shitty person but the music isn‚Äôt bad and that‚Äôs what keeps us around. Used to be a big fan of you but now you‚Äôve left me questioning whether biased people  like you even deserve a platform which decides the QUALITY of music. I cannot defend the fans who bombard you with hate because of your takes (which tbh I also don‚Äôt fully agree with but I digress), but you must understand that by labelling all fans of Kanye‚Äôs MUSIC as creeps, depressed nihilistic teens, Nazis or para-social cult members you‚Äôre out of pocket as HELL. I know 16 people who are Kanye fans but some of the sweetest people you‚Äôll ever meet. Shut up and review music, don‚Äôt shoot into the dark hoping that your pseudo-intellectual arguments against will his fandom will stick.
I never really liked when people said bring back the old Kanye, but at this point I‚Äôd rather take any version of Kanye than the one we got now ngl
Just keep moving just keep moving always improving girl I know it in the morning in the morning she&#39;ll be crawling back ü§£
I dont really think the album is as bad as youre saying it is but its also entirely unremarkable which is new for Kanye. Even at his worst before it was interesting or amusing. Vultures is just kinda meh.
More like unwatchable
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=307">5:07</a> Anthony you don‚Äôt get to say that. You gave sexy red an 8/10 just stfu
Everyone just remember the Sexyy Red review üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
L
It‚Äôs BHM, go listen to some soft rock white man
Bro literally says - I want more fame fame fame fame fame fame.
lmao this has to be ironic
If it was called to pimp a bianca it would have been a 10
good review, i agree it has some low points but i think 7/10 is still pretty fair
Duality of man
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=334">5:34</a> what did he just say????
fckng edgy
Do what they tell you
Clearly influenced by his political views it‚Äôs a good album not great but it‚Äôs good
All fantano did is come to an album with his mind already made about it, gave a bad rating, and while hearing it he was acting bored. Why are we still here trying to hear him out if he comes with his mind made
the album is called mr morale and the big vultures change the rating
I guess he couldn&#39;t separate the art and the artist.
i think at a certain point like in britney spears career you just have to seperate the music from the artist and as long as it‚Äôs not terrible people will be happy
Fantano no need to look so stressed
He didnt leave his ex wife‚Ä¶ she left her
didnt even watch the video, but can you grow hair on your head?
u are such a jew
lmao didnt you made a whole video on how what he did wont affect the review üíÄ<br>burzum is reviewable but this is too much i guess
Most of Kanye‚Äôs modern fanbase are Gen Z‚Äôers who started listening to him around the time of Yeezus/Life of Pablo. The off-the-rails Kanye on the brink of a total mental collapse is all they know and that‚Äôs all they want. The relationship he has with his current fanbase is voyeuristic in nature. It‚Äôs a sad sight.
YOU GAVE SEXXY REDD AN 8 BROTHER!?! And she‚Äôs a saint? <br><br>Fk outta here dude you clearly have some deep hate for Kanye and tbh it‚Äôs strange af. Go outside and get some fresh air you look demented
smh this is so racist us blacks can&#39;t have shit
: Big Sean over here going &quot;at least he had something to say other than no&quot;
King Von literally killed people but what Kanye did was politically incorrect so melon says his album is irreviewable aight
What Kanye said is actually true you can look all the info up not sure what this dude is on
u get all your swag off etsy
whole lotta yapping
Kind of constricting to say all the shit about the Jews and how bad Kanye is when you say that WAP was one of your fav songs of one of the years or something like that when that song and that message that female rappers push is to make young African American and American girls hoes and shake there ass and shit it‚Äôs very strange tbh
fantano really hit a new low with this, he just seems very angry about this album. i used to respect him as a music critic but some of his newer reviews are more about reviewing the artist and their politics than the actual music. maybe i&#39;m just weird or something but i&#39;m personally looking for discussion about the actual music in an album review. his tweets about this album were really cringe too like insulting ye&#39;s wife&#39;s looks calling her a &quot;dollar general kim k&quot; was so weird and uncalled for. attacking fans for enjoying an album he doesn&#39;t is super unprofessional as a music critic too in my opinion.<br><br>i also wonder why this is the first album to be &quot;unreviewable&quot; considering there&#39;s plenty of other artists who have done morally reprehensible things. it feels like this is done purely out of a personal vendetta for ye. fantano still reviewed utopia despite travis scott possibly being responsible for a tragedy that caused 10 deaths and i&#39;m sure fantano will still review playboi carti&#39;s new album despite him choking his pregnant girlfriend in 2022.<br><br>i&#39;ll give this &quot;unreviewable 1&quot; video a unreviewable/10 and btw this is all just my dumbass opinions/random bs, love you, bye.
Your Bald &amp; Divorced
cope and seethe lmao
kanye is antisemite and you too Anthony...
Fantano cares about antisemitism when kanye talks about Jews.  When Europe sees an increase in Jewish releated attacks since October then he calls those people Zionist.  Guys using the idea of ‚Äúfighting hate‚Äù to stroke his ego off when in reality he doesn‚Äôt care about Jews he just doesn‚Äôt like Kanye for Kanye
Don&#39;t care about &quot;anti semitism&quot; the albums just mid.
You dont like it thats your loss<br>Your opinion dont change the show cost
Why does Fantano look like such a child r*p*st?
What a pretentious loser
Post divorce fantano being contrarian for the sake of being contrarian is so lame. Don&#39;t lose your reviewing abilities too, it&#39;s the last thing you have!
Aren‚Äôt you the one that called Christian‚Äôs stupid?
Masterpiece of an album üíø
i&#39;m waiting for unreviewable 2 &amp; 3
Your deeping it way to much man haha your farming views tho so respect
Bro is mad because people actually like the album and kanye became top 1 again lmao
Coming from how awkward and sad this comment section is, I gotta at least grant the big Needle that he doesn&#39;t want to give the album anymore notice with the antisemitism shit. He&#39;s granting us (the creatures under his bed) at least something to work with as a review, which is barely even one beyond his broad scope frustrations. When an entire collab verse is &quot;I&#39;m just here to get paid&quot; I am gonna give it to the Ant Knee. Don&#39;t dropkick the Needle for this one, dropkick him for every other take. He is very drop kickable, I admit.
Become unreviewable
you&#39;re gonna get a lot of &quot;music fans&quot; bitching about this, but I appreciate you refusing to separate the art from the artist here. It&#39;s been freaky watching Kanye spout Nazi shit for the last couple of years and having people tell me to just get over it because he&#39;s bipolar and &quot;the GOAT&quot;. There was also the one time someone told me Kanye had a point about the Jews and Jews talk about the Holocaust too much
Rent must be due
So you‚Äôll review other rapers who talk about killing and murder but not Kanye cause your woke and want to signal your virtue
honestly this album was unlistenable. Even the most anticipated song imo Fuk Sumn was destroyed by ‚Äúthe Alvin feature‚Äù. Even though I think the finished album was not good and messy I kinda vibed with the leaks and the demos so I‚Äôm kinda disappointed that the finished product was somehow worse. Too bad that Ye fell off in such a way.
bait

This review is unreviewable you literally gave sexy reds mid ass album an 8. Stop letting bias get in your way
I have no clue what i think of this album im just kind of confused
This channel is now unsubscribable
Ignoring all the lyrics, the context and contents of the album, trying to listen to this on a hifi-system is like cleaning your ears with a cotton swab made from razor blades because of how horrible the mix is.
Can someone give me a timestamp so I can skip to when he stops yapping and gives it a 10?.
Bro doesn&#39;t believe in the 2nd amendment cuz it was written by a slave owner
Anything Fantano here the internets biggest music nerd also my black wife divorced me
The true bipolar!
Its funny watching melon describe the type of audience that&#39;s currently into Kanye and his point being proven from just reading the comments. Fantano is right and people are mad he&#39;s using his platform to speak out against Kanye&#39;s blatant antisemitism in his music.
If this album was called &quot;To pimp a butterfly&quot; it would be by Kendrick Lamar
As if Kanye ever made anything worthy in his musical career. I remember the last time I went to a music festival, it was in 2008, and Kanye, who I&#39;d never heard of, was headlining the main stadge. Playing slow covers and talking shit. I could hear it from the camping area. I thought this is the beginning of the end of good music. I was right. 500 shitty cover songs and a shitload of misogynism later, he has come out on top as the king of hiphop AKA the king of misogyny aka the king of stupid humanity in 2024. Didn&#39;t even know he was a racist lol, that is sorta hilarious. Just steer clear of shitty platic music like this, and be safe. He is basically Eminem with a different ethnicity. They&#39;re all bad, all rappers suck so hard man :)<br><br>EDIT: If you do need to listen to a rap song, there is ONE good rap song. It&#39;s called &quot;Good Friday&quot; and it was made by Yoni Wolf aka WHY. Listen to that instead, that is real music, about looking inside and having perspective and admitting your own faults. Everything that Kanye cannot do. Yeah.
Fantano is such a tool.  He could have just ignored it but he made a video anyway for the clicks...
You&#39;re what every father hopes his son doesn‚Äôt turn into. You wear flannel but never have swung a tool in your life. You&#39;re unmarried without children. You get your bag on the internet, and you cope all alone with your drugs. Your legacy will be meme album reviews that everyone will forget in 10 years.
Really think he is just taking a PC approach. Actually nothing wrong with the album. Not saying it is a 10/10 but burn, carnival, good alone make it more than a 1 and he couldn‚Äôt even give it that. It‚Äôs just moral grandstanding.
listen kanye is a genius, he is one of the greatest artists of all time but that doesn&#39;t take away anything that he said. He is extremely crazy but the music he makes is unbelievably good. I try and separate his music from his opinions cause it&#39;s easier to enjoy his music. favorite artist of all time
‚ÄúBack to me‚Äù is the first great hip hop song in 5-6 years. The rest is not great.  But that track is so great it made me think it was made back in 2017-18 as people just don‚Äôt make music like that anymore.
How does anyone still even watch these bruh
If kanye had said all that shit about any other race, this album would be reviewable to you lmao
We are here for music reviews not your political opinions
Thats bold going for the pedoo look Fantano
How do people take this npc seriously? Even if Kanye is the biggest shit bag, you should be able to separate art from artists and do your job.
Haven&#39;t even listened to the album but this is so funny. Willing to review albums by convicted/suspected murderers who also talk about those murders in their &quot;art&quot; but not willing to review this album lmao
Please do not forget that not only he said he loves hitler he also said that he likes putin. The actual genocide is happening in Ukraine, i was forced to move to another country, and everyday my country is getting shelled by russians soldiers, my people get killed by russians, it is happening right now as i write this comment
Yep, Fantano a liberal for this.
one of your best videos in years
Anthony is so left wing that even his wife left him
Bald music review guy really be like here is sexy redd‚Äôs project that is the same basic sound and no offense awful lyrics with decent mixing and one hit song it‚Äôs one of the best of the year. Now here‚Äôs a Ye album that is dynamic, fun, and way more complete than sexy redds basic pick me project. But since ever since he‚Äôs made antisemitic comments more than a year ago and apologized for his comments I will give the album harsh criticism because I will get views and attention from the Ye fanbase and solidify my opinion on music is the most important and influential opinion in the industry. <br><br>Deep down I want to care more about what you rate albums because you used to have reviews that not only were pretty well rounded but also honest but it seems as if you hav lost your ability to edit yourself. If you went back to reviewing and commenting on shit people will go to you more. No need to act like the behavior that you are basing your more negative reviews on.
Well well well
What a loser
&gt;it&#39;s unreviewable<br>&gt;proceeds to review it
If the album was called &quot;kids see vultures&quot; it would&#39;ve been reviewable.
üéØüéØüéØüéØüéØüéØüéØ
Your norwood is insane.
NO ONE TALKING ABOUT FANTANO SAYING THE N WORD AT <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=334">5:34</a>
&quot;Unreviewable&quot; seems more like an unavoidably bitter review, similar to sleeping in a wet blanket üòÇ
So Kanye was reviewable throughout all his controversy until he spoke about Jews? lol who‚Äôs surprised
Melon unwatchable 1
Lmao. Anthony can&#39;t see past the politics of artists and it&#39;s kinda sad.
This chat on this stream varied between hilariously stupid and just frustratingly braindead
LOL to the guy who game MBDTF a 6 (One of if not the most critically acclaimed Hip-Hop albums ever &amp; one of the best albums ever made), this dude is so clearly an industry plant. You&#39;re a joke and your opinions are stale as fu*k. Unsubscribed.
ButtHurthony Jewtano... The album is bad though.
You just dont get Kanye West
Clown. Y&#39;all need to stop taking this fool serious and judge music yourselves
<b>hears rap album about killing innocent people and taking hard drugs</b> <br><br>8.7/10 i really like what this guy has to say.<br><br>yet he can‚Äôt review a ye album ü§°ü§°ü§°
Hater
yap yap yap..
if it called pimp bianca , you gonna give it 10. dont you
he already apologized baldi
melon u literally do reviews for killers lmao wtf are u talking about
Wow dude, this is some straight pussy shit lmao its music dude youre not a hero
mad + cope + seethe + kanye is based + he is right + tracks are fayaarrrr
Its official fantanos washed
inject those jew tears
Anthony Fantano coming off a bit jewy ngl<br><br>Maybe Kanye is onto something
Fantano is too old to review new music go to the nursing home yapper
Ye but beautiful big titty but naked women just don&#39;t fall out the sky you know
Soythony Cucktano
Bro is delusional
so how can you not review this but review other artists talking about killing people
Doesn‚Äôt matter Kanye‚Äôs still the king
Honestly as a melon fan and Kanye fan this video did not feel entertaining or fun at all. I wouldn‚Äôt have minded if melon gave the album a not good or low score, as long as he presented it in a fun and entertaining way. Then we could all laugh at Kanyes hypocrites and terrible lyrics. Instead this just feels like he is annoyed and angry at fans for even slightly liking the album lol
My Beautiful Dark unreviewable Fantasy
Fantano , you gotta actually review this album , come on bruv you‚Äôre better then this
Then why are you reviewing it J E W ??
People complaining about the cover forgets the music video Bound 2 with Kim naked on a motorcycle.
funny how this the same dude that reviewed a lot of peste noire despite knowing everything that guy is up to lmao, its very clearly a grift and im surprised a lot of ppl dont notice it
Sorry can&#39;t hear you talking over vultures.<br>No this isn&#39;t an insult i actually agree with everything you say i am just being attacked by a vulture right now help
7 minutes of crying. The album is good.
I‚Äôd give it a 4
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=274">4:34</a> These dudes probably don&#39;t want to face the reality that their favorite artist has fallen off from a plane to the depths of hell so they self medicate with heavy grade copium.
You&#39;re such a coward. I&#39;m sure that&#39;s why your wife left
ye doesnt push boundries, he&#39;s overstepping them.
Cope
Bum.
üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº
If melon can back track on his alt-right shitpost YT channel from a few years back, then im sure Ye can backtrack on a few antisemitic tweets. The hypocrisy is astounding in this ‚Äòreview‚Äô
We&#39;ve just reached a rating of bellow 0/10 and &quot;not good&quot;. Kanye truly pushes the artistic boundaries in music!
@peteralouf2680 Summs it up perfectly: I just hate the hypocrisy of still making a review, even if it isn&#39;t an actual review, just for the views, you know it&#39;s still gonna give attention to the album, yet you&#39;re still gonna sit there &quot;morally superior&quot; trashing the artist you&#39;re against, still giving him all the attention tho.
When Dorks&#39; rent is due üòÆ
The most ironic thing is I&#39;ve seen so many kanye fans try to condemn laufey for saying &quot;I might actually hate straight men&quot; which idk the context of but they think what ye is doing is completely fine
lmfao based
First, this is a valid take. Also I don‚Äôt know if you apologized for this but in 2018 when he was being anti black you did excuse his behavior as him not meaning it and only being eccentric, essentially telling your black fans what you now won‚Äôt say to your Jewish fans. Do you regret this?
yapper
Like you said, music aside, there isn&#39;t any justifiable cause to listen to Kanye because of the stuff he said. But it&#39;s funny to me how you stand by the Jews so much and support them when it comes to Kanye, but publicly support the &quot;free Palestine&quot; and &quot;ceasefire now&quot; rallies. Hypocrite
You‚Äôre done bro. Washed up. Exposed. It‚Äôs over
Anthony you didn&#39;t spoke once about October 7 after it happened. you didn&#39;t said a word about the death of the Jews/ Israelis side and only spoke about the Gazans. I know you are invested In one side more and that&#39;s totally fine but not even caring the slightest about the deaths of hundreds  making you not better then kanye
If I see you it‚Äôs on site
<b>reviews many many artists that have violent criminal records</b><br><br><b>thinks icky ideas are too far</b>
Burzum was reviewable tho right?
I belive this video is social a experiment ü§î
Wait this dudes still alive?! Lmfaoooo
How do you not see through the whole ye playing the villain rhetoric? Ye is insane. The burzum shirt all that shit. I highly doubt ye as a person is hateful to people. This album is worth reviewing. You did a video asking can bad people make music if I‚Äôm remembering correctly. You said you wouldn‚Äôt stop listen to burzum because ‚Äúit‚Äôs black metal‚Äù - the dude murdered a friend and band mate with a knife in cold blood, burned down multiple churches, and is a very open anti semite. This review is hypocritical. The dude has almost 70 million Spotify users a month. He can‚Äôt be that un-reviewable lol. Your outlook as a reviewer should be objective. Post this on your personal page then. The bias is insane.
Why the jews are so important, why theyre like 5% of the world at most but theyre treated like unpoluted pearl, but can talk shit of anything but drawing the line on jews?
I think the melon is mushy time to throw it out üòÇ
Man, live a little. This was sucha fun project by one of the greatest artist of our generation.
One thing i keep thinking about it: i really agree with fantano, what kanye does is just unforgivable. But, sometimes at random i find myself humming a famous song of his. And There are songs that i really like made by kanye, so i dont really know what to do with that. What do you guys think about this?
So you don‚Äôt want to review the album because you don‚Äôt want to promote Kanye‚Äôs views, but you still make a video?
if this was called &quot;swans 1&quot; you would have given it a 10
You wouldnt be doing this for any other artist if it wasnt as big as Kanye. Clout chaser.
Get his ass, Anthony.
He wants to ignore it but just can‚Äôt pass up 1mil views.  ‚ÄúWho ain‚Äôt cash a check off my name?‚Äù
Y‚Äôall act so pressed about people saying anything about Jews, but not as much with black people huh?
more like thenerdledrop
What is bro yapping about. No one is here for your political oppinions and morals, just review rhe songs bro its not that deep.
You look like this edgy 15 year old girl I knew as a teenager who chain smoked cigarettes and cried right in front of the doors to the school because Trump got elected when you make cringe like this, Anthony, ok? She was fat too, you really wanna look like her? Shape up, make a non politicized review, and then go do some crunches.
that album was weird , odd and ass asf
you can talk about murder and real life crimes but your album&#39;s unreviewable if you talk bad about the little hat people
We&#39;ve seen the rotten antisemitic shit you upload to your Socials, the Jews need you to guard us from a Kanye West album review.
I feel like even if he dropped the next College Dropout he wouldn&#39;t get a normal review from Fantano
I genuenly dont understand why so many people give a fuck. Its the goat making good music. I dont agree nor do i give a fuck for his politics
It‚Äôs a fun album so no shock that Fantano hates it
Melon please review Lost Prophets - The fake sound of progress
Not even a Kanye fan and i like the album
Not only is Kanye antisemitic, he‚Äôs also crazy anti-black. Like the stuff he‚Äôs said about slavery in the  recent past is insane fr. But hey the white incels didn‚Äôt care then either just like they don‚Äôt now
Bro get out your feelings
L
I mean, the album isn‚Äôt even good‚Ä¶ I never got too offended by Kanye‚Äôs stupid statements because it‚Äôs mainly just internet nonsense, but the way he is completely objectifying his wife is disgusting. Kanye has completely lost my respect entirely (not that there was much there anyways)
I think you have a right to your opinion and that&#39;s okay, you&#39;ll prolly get a lot of hate and a lot of traction too because of this. You don&#39;t like it and that&#39;s okay. At least you&#39;re standing up to what you believe in. But the album is just not trash tony.
This album is number one in like 100 countries. That can‚Äôt be just Ye stans listening to it lol
Makes sense Anthony went this route.
Coward üòÇüòÇüòÇ
And by the way - extract the emotion and just review it, it speaks terribly for itself. Be Professional and go track by track, say what you like and don&#39;t and why. That&#39;s all i have to say, thank you ‚úåÔ∏è
Fantano i hope Kanye lets Sexy Redd do a feature on his vol.2 so you can review it
This was a good album wtf you talking about
Reddit
lol
Theres def a 4th, old kanye fans, not really old but just pre ksg or tlop, not old but before the anti semetic stuff
This is exactly what needs to be said. The man has lost his mind and truly needs help. He shouldn&#39;t be encouraged.
Actually based...
damn this dude annoying
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=210">3:30</a> in and he hasn‚Äôt spoken about a single track on the album lmao üòÖ
Bro ended this video and starting listening to his Death Grips records.
You actually started reviewing the album 5 minutes into this video??? lmao
Time for people to realize Yeezus was the turning point and it was for the worse.
It&#39;s giving &quot;my pussy hurts and I voted for biden&quot;
boohoo angry liberal
This guy is such a dork
I mean you do you but you failed to do your job as a reviewer here. Nobody wants to hear a rant about your opinion on Kanye‚Äôs life choices.
For anyone curious, the album is actually pretty good
Album of The Year üòä
the chat on the twich stream during the review üò≠üò≠üò≠ even his own audience clowns on him ü§°
This is certainly going to trigger the Hitler youth...i mean Kanye fans
Anthony got that registry phenotype
This is my first time ever seeing this guy‚Ä¶why does he try to over articulate himself? He sounds way too invested and personal about the music. Art is subjective but this person is clearly not separating any person feelings from the music‚Ä¶.i like the album. 6.5-7/10. Btw Mick Jagger had sex with 14 year old girls. Chuck Barry had video camera in his studio toilets for the women‚Ä¶LOLLLLL. This guy can‚Äôt really hate Kanye that much. Didn‚Äôt he give sexyyredd 8/10?
As a Kanye fan this is true this album is horrible
Heard it last night - ONE &amp; DONE.
Apparently not only his fans (me) don&#39;t give a shit about his opinions, even if they are in the songs, but even jews don&#39;t give a shit since vultures was the most listened album in Israel.
Unreviewable 2 will be the title for Vultures 2
Ur a bum
longtime subscriber<br>‚Ä¶.until today
Im the 4th type: the people who dont care about the lyrics and just appreciate the damn music
It‚Äôs insane how many kanye stans there are, even now. You really can‚Äôt criticize him or anyone associated with his music without elementary school level insults coming your way. Discourse is absolutely impossible with people who don‚Äôt think
This is ur best put together vid ngl
Anthony fantano after realizing most people don‚Äôt care about what Kanye said:üôÄ
So a strong 7 out of 10. Got it.
Bro might have an extra chromosome
I never knew that rap lyrics were misogynistic and violent. Crazy. Learn something new every day.
unreviewable over a 10?
this is very hypocritical<br>If you are a successful and hegemonic white woman, you can affect the environment, you can fill the planet with colored vinyl and toxic merchandising, you can leave a fan dead dehydrated at your concert due to excessive greed... and nothing happens, even if you affect reality. effectively<br>But if you affect reality subjectively, with some unfortunate statement, you are a non-reviewable artist.<br>this is also racism
That dogshit Drake album was reviewable, but Vultures is &quot;trash&quot;...lol. Fantano letting identity politics totally cloud his judgment.
I completely understand why people don‚Äôt want to support him or listen to his music, but I promise we don‚Äôt all fit into those three groups
bro hating on that kanye line but forgets he loves danny brown who degraded women to the maximum degree in his early music
So funny that he made a video a few years ago called ‚Äúcan bad people make good music‚Äù where he said bad people can make good music, even listed chief Keef as an example. And yet, he‚Äôs refused to review someone‚Äôs music, because they are a bad person
bro is reaching so hard for attention bro knew hes gonna fall off if he likes anything
This album is very very average but the idea it is &#39;unreviewable&#39; is just silly. Once again Anthony Fantano letting political opinions ruining his videos. Review the album give it a score and move on stop grandstanding it is very very boring.
anthony &quot;my wife left me&quot;-tano
I bet if it was called Kids See Vultures you would‚Äôve given it a 10, Fantano.
I think it is probably his weakest album but I love Fuk sumn, Back to Me and Carnival. While the lyrics are pretty bad the production is good and I am happy for Peggy for getting to work on this.
this review makes the album 10 times better
Waaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh/10
I really don&#39;t see any exaggeration in the quoted lines about Kanye&#39;s wife or alleged anti-Semitism. Isn&#39;t Fantano oversensitive?
Womp Womp
So in other words, no matter what Ye put out, it was labeled unreviewable from the start because of his persona and things he does outside of music?
Can&#39;t believe that melon praised ye like that sheesh
Are you not entertained
there comes a time when a young man becomes old, and the subversive becomes dangerous. <br><br>it&#39;s your time now melon nuts. you&#39;re old and lame.<br><br>the reaper grabs yet another
I‚Äôm sure Gandhi would agree with everything you said.
Anthony it‚Äôs not too late to Beg Forgiveness.
Hide behind the obvious massive flaws with Kanye to call the album trash even though it‚Äôs got loads of great music on because you‚Äôve gotta always be 100% politically correct these days and if you step 1 foot out of line then you get cancelled
Music review ‚ùå<br>Politics blah blah blah mess ‚úÖ
Good faith effort is you calling people not genuine hip hop heads because they still fuck with Kanye. <br><br>Nice one
White Joe Budden
Rather get busy reviewing Chelsea&#39;s new fantastic record please
Aguante Burzum
Music reviewer starts his music review video by not reviewing music
Fantano is usually pretty silly and entertaining, but here he just seems so fed up with Kanye and his fans. And understandably so, seeing the comments he&#39;s been receiving these last months on social media.
I just came here to dislike üéâ
bro is MAD!!! üò° like bro just review the album normally who cares lol
mr melon, you fell off. you gave sexy red an 8 and kanye an unreviewable ‚òπÔ∏è
Fantanos a lame for this. Never would he bring up Taylor dating a racist when reviewing midnights. Or discuss Lana‚Äôs ‚Äúquestion for the culture‚Äù nonsense when reviewing ocean ave. He‚Äôs only doing this as a show of solidarity with the Jewish community which is fine but keep that same energy bro. Clown shit
Separate the art from the ist Melon
your point was his public image is ruined after this and then proceed to show this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=77">1:17</a> your now contradicting yourself
Professional hater üòÇ
700k plus views with only 45k likes? Yea this video has more dislikes than actual likes.
beats are insane but the lyrics are so fucking childish for a 45 year old man
Fantano must have soo much Jewish watchers my fault
Thank you (genuinely - I do enjoy your content and like to hear your opinions on things)
you look more and more like my dad
kanye dropped aoty
STILL THE KING
The 3 people that love kanye are fairly similar to the BTS cult as well
Do you even realise how hard it is to convince someone with bpd that they need help, he was literally screaming and crying during the interview were he said he loves hitler and no one even offered help but now because he‚Äôs married and back with his family and doing what he loves, now he needs help
I thought it was a pretty fire Kanye album tbh ü´§<br><br>Ik he‚Äôs crazy but the production, flows, and beats are undeniably top tier on a lot of these tracks.
The production on this album is dope. Opinions and facts are to different things Anthony. Beautiful naked big-titty women just don‚Äôt fall out the sky you know!
I guess him and at least half of his fanbase would be in jail if they lived at my country
Actual Coward.
The fact that ‚Äúbeautiful big titty butt naked women just don‚Äôt fall out the sky you know‚Äù is probably stuck in Melon‚Äôs head right now brings me joy.
What a terribly biased review.
Yappuccino
You‚Äôve reviewed King Von (a literal serial killer who has victims as young as 15) <br>You‚Äôve reviewed Kodak Black (99% chance he‚Äôs a rapist) <br>And then obviously hundreds of rappers who borderline promote drugs and pornography to children. But controversial comments (not defending his comments at all) is where the line is drawn.
Nah i think that the way you explained 3 categories of listeners is generalizing and dumb. This is n¬∞1 in america, you telling me everywhone who listens to kanye is a psycho/lonely teenagers/cultists, nah bro you&#39;re just yapping, most people listen to this BECAUSE IT&#39;S KANYE, it&#39;s not really hard to understand
For me as someone not from the US and not being a Kanye listener, i wanted to see whats the hype about. But when i did listen to that, i thought to myself &quot;there are like 20 thousand instagram rapper that made better songs&quot;
Melon just say you preferred the white mask over the black one this doesn‚Äôt need to be a 7 minute long video
This is the worst album review I‚Äôve ever heard and it‚Äôs gonna age poorly
Have a bath with the toaster pluged in with you‚ù§üéâ
You should consider sticking a fork in the power outlet
The record is really not that good as a whole project, but this review was somehow even worse.

Harassing his wife has nothing to do with the album üö©
You&#39;re approaching Kanye levels of schizo
As much as i disagree with what Ye says the album wasnt THAT bad its just kind of ok. did have some bangers like Back To Me, Problematic and Burn
If melon was on the right side of the cover he would‚Äôve given it a 10.
- 80% of the video has nothing to do with the album, at least the music not a few stupid lyrics.<br>-All of this antisemitic shit you&#39;re mentionning are just part of his persona and not real, even if it was why would anyone hold it against someone mentally in.<br>-When it comes to the album, it indeed is a joke, he better just pull it off from the internet and stop fucking his discorgraphy.
album is a 10,all of his opinions are correct,he made graduation
Fantano hates good music part 78
Shut up man
Real talk Anthony, how much they pay you for this?
Man. When Jews get attacked you get horseshit like this. Typical. Do better Fantano and stop pandering. You not running for Office. There‚Äôs been worse music thrown on your table.
Dude, you reviewed Nicki Minaj. She defended her husband Kenny Perry who was found guilty of attempted rape of a 16 year old. You stand for nothing.
I get he doesn‚Äôt wanna review the album and I respect it but I also think it‚Äôs unfair to just immediately think lower of someone who listens to and likes the album
If this album was called The Vultures Store you‚Äôd give it a 10
Cough cough #1 across the world ü•±
In typical woke fashion, you spent several days making little tiktoks and posts asking others what they think about the project, as a means of forming your final opinion.. instead of, ya know... actually listening and reviewing the project. What&#39;s the  s a f e s t  final verdict. I&#39;m sure this is where you&#39;re thinking to yourself, ahh this could be your &quot;moment&quot;, where some purple haired loser intern from Buzzfeed or Pitchfork writes about your &quot;bravery&quot; for not reviewing Kanye... you&#39;ve lost it, Melon. I&#39;ve watched you for 10 plus years.. You&#39;ve become scared of judgement, scared of ridicule, and I guess of Gen Z now?? This isn&#39;t going to go how you think it is. You&#39;re not going to be hailed a hero, you&#39;re not going to become more successful off of this in the long run...
if it was named to vulture a 1 it would&#39;ve been a 10
Remember when Fantano actually....you know..... reviewed the music, instead of going into political tirades or saying &quot;xyz music is bad because the artist doesn&#39;t agree with my political take&quot;?
Idek what happened to you, but after joe biden got elected/ trump got out of office you became so much more political. But why? Then you bash Kanye‚Äôs wife on twitter when you got divorced yourself. But why? When a music review channel loses subs because it‚Äôs no longer a music review channel üò¢
4 eyes bald ratt
You may think this review is a sign of good character until you realise he‚Äôs reviewed Cardi B, who admitted to drugging people and then robbing them, NBA Youngboy, who was caught abusing the mother of his kids, and 6ix9ine, who plead guilty to CHILD SEXUAL PERFORMANCE. Another case of virtue signalling. Make it make sense.
I have never seen Anthony so seriously pissed
This is what endgame of twitter brainrot looks like.
So... what you said about the &quot;3 types of Kanye fans&quot;: did you ever think about the fact that there are people who disagree with his comments but appreciate him for his music and even though he said some of the dumbest shit I&#39;ve heard he&#39;s still one of the greatest musical minds of the last millenia who has changed hip hop forever? Also a music reviewer spending 70% of his video ranting about the artist and then talks about the music for 2 mins says a lot about how people percieve Kanye nowadays<br><br>and P.S. this comment was written by a jew
dont review it then
Same dude who loved sexy redds album btw
Acting offended by a rap album is weird. DMX talked about rape, 50 cent about murder, Eminem about killing his mom and GF.... But hey, let&#39;s not review Kanye... bro do your JOB....
You&#39;re bald
cry me a river fantano i hope you wake up blind and deaf
It took five minutes to talk about a song in the album. 5 out of a 7 minute long video to get to the point
he gave sexy red an 8‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
oh no guys this guy said bad thing about joos oh no hes terrible lets not hear the message at all !!!!!!!!!! WHY FANTANO SO MAD ABOUT THE JOOS COMMENTS UHHHH EHY U SO MAD
this is the last review of theneedledrop i will ever watch
i&#39;m not in either in the three categories you mentioned in regards to Kanye fans. I don&#39;t love everything he does, but I also don&#39;t listen to him for anything other than music that sometimes hits. That&#39;s it. I feel I&#39;m much better off here.
L
Pete Davidson tried to sell me an electric trimmer for my man-bits immediately after this video ended. Fate&#39;s funny.
Cmon bro. If the name was kids see vultures you would give it a 10
Unreviewable one is aoty
This is supposed to be a music review not a review on what Kanye thinks. I don‚Äôt even listen to Kanye his music isn‚Äôt for me and that‚Äôs fine but this isn‚Äôt a review of the album you are complete shit yes I watched the whole thing. Tpab is a 0 btw
so if i like the album im just a delusional fan? everyone has opinions
Nice yap session bro
This is stupid. The album has a lot of good moments, you‚Äôre just being a dork
You&#39;ve got too woke and unfortunately it really makes this video very cringy. You revieqed artists that have done worse. Review the music. You&#39;re not the internet&#39;s busiest politics nerd. What a shame. And insulting members of.your audience is flat out disrespectful and stupid.
maybe fantano did this so he could talk to Ye face to face...
If this was called wife divorce 1 you would give it a 10
At this point, you can guarantee that any Kanye fans are either: 1) 16-year-old edgelords; or 2) mid-20s minimum wage workers with no media literacy or concept of artistry.
Why did you shoot this video if you hate the album that much. Guess rent is due
I do not like Kanye as a person, I will listen to this album because I like some of his music
Seething and coping
maybe if this album was called ‚ÄúWIFE‚Äù you‚Äôd give it a 10
HORRENDOUS TAKE
The most Dwight Schrute review ever
wish you would react to the music and leave his public image out of it smh
Are you reviewing his music or his views this vid is corny
Bro id rather have you shit all over it and wipe your ass with the credits than not review it at all<br><br><br>Also thank you for the Donda 2 comparison I thought I was the only one that heard it
Album was really good tbh. You‚Äôll be ok Melon man.
Great review, but claiming Israeli missile attacks on civilian targets are justified because of this album is taking it too far imo
So THAT‚ÄôS where you draw the line on rappers degrading women?
if it was called &quot;to pimp a vulture&quot; it wouldve gotten a 1 million out of 10
Says it&#39;s unreviewable...<br>Proceeds to review it
Mad j3w talk. üëÅÔ∏è
¬´You can&#39;t stop me from listening to Burzum.¬ª Fantano
I just hate the hypocrisy of still making a review, even if it isn&#39;t an actual review, just for the views, you know it&#39;s still gonna give attention to the album, yet you&#39;re still gonna sit there &quot;morally superior&quot; trashing the artist you&#39;re against, still giving him all the attention tho
Redbar is watching.    And I‚Äôm sure his review of the album wont be‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.as gay as yours (explosion).
Anthony can&#39;t stand seeing a black man succeed.
i‚Äôm never letting this review down lol ur a 14 year old in a 40 year old‚Äôs body
This could‚Äôve been a tweet.
anthony fantano is the most insufferable person ever lmfao
bro u just a dinozaur
Unironically one of the best videos you&#39;ve ever made.
I think ‚ÄúKING‚Äù rustled a few feathers üò≠
Can you review breakup country from negative xp?
Cope, seethe, also where‚Äôs your wife?
Anthony Jootano strikes again
This is def not kanye&#39;s worst album like you said, but I agree that Kanye&#39;s image and his message now make it impossible to consume his music without a sour taste in the mouth.
why reviewing the album if you&#39;re just gonna talk about how you personally feel about the artist behind it
You made some great points. I think it`s reasonable to say that you can`t separate the art from the artist when it can`t be separated. Great video!
Fantano used to review timbre, melody, texture - now he reviews his feelings about politics.
Anthony I think the far more effective thing to do if you don‚Äôt want his rhetoric to spread would be to just not cover this album at all. Your still getting clicks on this and you still reacted to it and your still getting reacting to ppls takes on the album. You would be missing out on alot of clicks from that but you would actually be doing something. Inaction here is far better than action.
the album is perfectly reviewable tho idgi
Thank you Anthony! I partially agree with everything you have stated. However, Kanye just winging a whole album out of his ass is still better than 92.7% of new rap albums coming out.
So, basically... It&#39;s a 10
YOU LOOK LIKE A PIECE OF HALLELUJAH
I get it but why do you draw the line here? I mean you‚Äôve reviewed people who have actually committed murder and have added lyrics of them committing murder of some sort so what makes murder reviewable
Lol, I can&#39;t even access antnee&#39;s subreddit rn. Wtf
Just review the music melon, doesn&#39;t mean you support his arguments.
7 minutes yapping session
Honestly if he wasn‚Äôt so crazy I think a couple of these songs are good enough to get some traction but a lot of the beats are same old Kanye top their but bro is so crazy there‚Äôs no telling if any of these beat would be made
Twitter really got melon tilted LMAOOOOO
I think the production for the second third of the album insane but I can‚Äôt get past the subject matter. It‚Äôs such a waste of talent
If it was sexxy red you would give it a 10 ‚ò†Ô∏è
Oh boy
I think this damages your credibility as a music critic. If his views weren&#39;t a problem when his ire was directed merely a whites and women, why are they a problem now? Toxic views are either a problem or they&#39;re not.<br><br>Personally, I&#39;ve always found Kanye&#39;s music fairly uninteresting, lyrically it&#39;s standard &quot;im rich&quot; blah blah fare.
Strong 10 üí™üèΩ
bro is having a meltdown
This is probably the most appropriate review for this album that could have went up. Kanye&#39;s views really makes it nigh impossible to engage with the artistic merit of his newer music without in some way platforming or minimising his bigotry.
Free palestina boldy
This whole video is just kinda sad really lol
Elvis should be deposed for marrying a teenage girl. Marvin Gayes discography should be burned, he groomed and impregnated a minor. Why is  black on black violence  in Hip Hop exceptable? This seems like a personal rant.
But Anthony I‚Äôm a TyDollaSign fan
Music reviews are dumb as fuck
Lmao I love people caring about shit that has literally nothing to with them and defend it cause you feel you are the savior for that group
you gave sexy red 8 üò≠
Never rate Kanye music agin lil bro
The reference line is a compliment he‚Äôs just saying his wife is his type
If ye dropped<br>Kids See Ghosts now he would give it a 4
RIP Kanye üò¢
If you were true to your principles you would‚Äôve just ignored the album instead of virtue signaling for views and money
Sonically, the album offered something new. Has kanye been off the deep end, yes. The album actually sounds good, and I am not in any of your three categories. His past couple of albums were poorly done. But the music sounds good.
You&#39;re focusing on Ye more than the album here...
Naaa
If it‚Äôs so bad than why number 1 rn ü§î
hes getting paid for sure
JUST REVIEW THE FUCKING MUSIC MAN. ITS NOT THAT HARD. YOU ARE NOT A POLITICAL CHANNEL
To those who think fantano is overreacting: Kanye is literally siding with our enemy. The only justifiable war America has ever fought was World War 2, our side did horrific war crimes but the nazis were THAT evil. It should be incredibly obvious to anybody who has a basic understanding of the last 100 years of history knows why fantano is handling this record with pure disgust. This is a disgusting ideology that needs to be shamed. It doesn&#39;t take an emotional genius to recognize how embarrassed Kanye should be of this record. His recent extracurricular activities (that you ABSOLUTELY CANNOT SEPERATE FROM THE ART NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRY) have caused irreversible harm to our society. Shame and embarrassment are the proper emotions Kanye should feel and Fantano did an amazing job with this video.
straight up yapping
My guy - you can appreciate something without necessarily agreeing with it.
W bait
Youtube comments are asss
Thank your for standing up and saying what needed to be said.
free palestine now and forever, YE for president
Yeah sexyyred album is better then kanye new album üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ you are reaching a new level of ü§° anthony bet you if ye get kendrick on vol3 or call it tpab you would rate it 10/10 üíÄ
What confuses me is how did a dude like you even come to the position that people value your opinion at all. 10/10 hating, 10/10 attention seeking, &#39;unreviewable&#39; personality. <br><br>And go to Turkey already, that shi looks sadüò≠
Man reviewed Kanye and not the album
I think that it&#39;s not one of his Best albums, but it&#39;s not that bad.<br>There are some good song on it
a solid 8/10 album
imagine categorizing kanye fans into three generalized categories with most of his fans are actually just people who separate the art from the person, as someone who reviews music i think youd know this more than anyone.
For once I wholeheartedly agree with fantanoüò≠üôè
unreviewable unmastered
i dont think its right to take the picture the media paints of someone and then displaying it as undisputable fact if you want to talk about his person. first of all properly inform yourself for the sake of your viewership
The album is number one in Israel!
Dude can‚Äôt do a real music review without getting overly political sadly the music itself is fine, learn how to separate the art from the artist.  This guy reminds me of an uneducated Hasan Piker and just parades around leftist terminology without actually having a full understanding of what it truly is.  If you want to call a Kayne a racist and antisemite I‚Äôd agree but if I were you I‚Äôd just ignore his albums on release if you are going to be review it based on how they act outside of their music.
Bro you‚Äôre so old what are you even doing
Imo Kanye has obviously proven himself to be a fervent anti-Semite these past few years, but I do still think it‚Äôs possible to be a fan of his music. Like he is far from the first guy in music to have done some horrible shit, plus even with the lyrics like yeah it requires some disassociation but I‚Äôm not gonna feel guilty for listening to music.<br><br>But ur right the album is shit
This comments section is only proving him more right. You have to remember that his responsibilities as a music reviewer are different from the average music listeners, whose opinions aren‚Äôt reaching millions of people. If you‚Äôre butthurt by this review than you‚Äôre exactly the type of person he doesn‚Äôt want in his community üëç
Find God.
Most dense reviewer
Next level kanye hating
&quot;separating the art from the artist&quot; has always been an argument that pisses me off and that makes no fuckin sense. NEWS FLASH : You can&#39;t separate the art from the artist because the ARTIST makes the ART
how do you review welcome to the madhouse but you don&#39;t review this üíÄ
Get your politics out my music review üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ just play the damn album
what was I even expecting from a guy who rated ‚ÄúHood Hottest Bitch‚Äù an 8‚Ä¶
4 solid minutes without dealing with an actual note of the music ‚Äúreviewed.‚Äù üëã
you are jewish and support palastine ???
don‚Äôt normally agree with fantano, but he is completely correct about everything he‚Äôs saying here
you could‚Äôve just not reviewed the album and nobody would‚Äôve asked or cared, showing off your massively inflated sense of self importance
bro shut up, you&#39;re going through your midlife crisis. just enjoy the music damnüíÄ
Anthony trying to seperate art and politics *impossible
Divorced.
Hey, wanna a little funny observation from a dude from the not-so-western part of Europe? <br>Kanye West is a cult figure for the rap community and for the United States. In Europe he is also very famous, but I wouldn&#39;t say he has a cult status here among ordinary people who listen to let me say the classic part of Western pop music (which includes someone like Taylor Swift, Dua Lipa and Kanye himself ). And so I‚Äôm sitting at home, reading some music news and seeing the nonsense that Kanye at some point started talking about. And even I, who was far from being fully included in American culture, was hurt (dont know if its really a correct word for this, I more like pissed off or something) by this. You cannot be tolerant of dudes who flirt with nazism, who actually publicly harass their wives and girlfriends, and flirt with racism. And if I were an American, I can‚Äôt imagine my shock at all. Like, one of the key and iconic pop culture figures starts talking some shit about nazism? wtf? <br>Therefore, I want to thank you that you are ready to make such statements, be principled and refuse to separate the artist from creativ process/product if the artist openly continues to cultivate aggressive and shitty nonsense. Pop stars can be apolitical and stand for some universal values and just do their thing, or they can be honest about their views and speak openly about them. The problem is that many of them either do not understand or do not give a shit that having a large audience, they can influence (more or less, it does not matter) on public opinion about some things. And if an influencer or artist starts talking nazi stuff, then he should be held accountable for it. So far we have no effective levers of influence on these people, except for —Åencel culture, but even that still works selectively and not always accurately. So we just have to hope that other people with large audiences will talk about this crap and call it out directly. And that&#39;s exactly what you did. Thanks for this honest review!
tf bro
Sexy Red a 9 tho? Damn bro sad to see you leave us sane people.
I&#39;m a kanye fan that only cares for the music not the person and I can say ... the album is trash
Is this man serious?
Hews are ur masters confirmed
Jumped the shark with this one,fuck your feelings review the album lol
Anthony is actually so real for this
drake was right
Bro&#39;s trying to reason with a mentally unstable person by refusing to review his album. I&#39;m not the only one that&#39;s put off by this, right?
Bro definitely voted for Biden
So you completely copped out and decide to just not review the album lol. Low point Anthony‚Ä¶.
I don‚Äôt like what Kanye has been doing, but I must admit you come off very annoying and whiny, especially considering you could‚Äôve just not made a video review for this album but instead you still wanted to cash in on his name.
Every kanye album is a 8
Never thought I‚Äôd see the day Anthony decides virtue signaling is more important than the music.
He yappin hard on this one
Shut up liberal
The I&#39;m just here to get paid verse is so classic üòÇüòÇüòÇ
bald man showing his age
And after all Kanye&#39;s comments about jewish people this guy still REACT to the single and the whole album, AND DID A REVIEW about it, like... &quot;Who ain&#39;t cash a check off my name?&quot;
Fantano, this video is more about political statements and your relationship with Kanye as a public person and his statements <br>I think you have gone the wrong way in listening to this album<br>Stop mentioning the Jews situation, Kanye is making fun of your anger
I respect whatever you‚Äôre trying to say anthony but u just can‚Äôt change the fact that ye is the biggest artist in the world
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=393">6:33</a> Hating on Jesus is king, definitely a jew
Fantano still crying!!  please stop
I agree 100%
I really liked the album !
Could have just said you weren&#39;t going to review the album instead of this 7 minute overdramatic video
Fantano gone woke. Giving me the ick!
UNSUBSCRIBE , YOUVE SERVED YOUR PURPOSE BUT YOU HAVE NO FURTHER VALUE TO SOMEONE WHO THINKS FOR THEMSELVES . GOOD LUCK BEING A CULTURE VULTURE WHITE MAN.
Kanye is number one globally right now while being independent impressive
i thought this was a music review not a political rant from a wifeless 40year old man who is chronically online
So you wont review this album only because you dont like what kanye says in the past? You cant separate the music from a person?
Do it was good song tho bro cmon. YG verse alone is a good single
im not a fan of Kanye but this album is incredible , he is top 1 globally .
Why would he do anything for us except release music? Why would you do anything except reviewing it? Go back to being best teeth in the game.
Fantano with his one sided beef with Kanye. üòÇ
Kayne Weast has done it again
your personal feud with terminally online kanye stans has biased your opinion. the majority of the album isn‚Äôt good, but there are some positive notes. giving it an ‚Äòunreviewable‚Äô is an exaggeration and your entire reaction VOD was embarrasing to watch. you were geeking and approached every track with a ‚Äòhow can i roast this‚Äô attitude. back to me, do it, and burn are fire. i personally didnt like fuck sumn &amp; carnival, nobody would be talking about those tracks if travis &amp; carti weren‚Äôt on them.
Hating on kanye is so mainstream i expect better from melon
Jesus Christ grow tf up and get a spine
xis name is TND for a reason yov know.... are yov stqrting tv trvst thv plqn???
Dude I don‚Äôt care. Review the music.
You missed #4. The person who thinks he is a good dude who has fallen victim to the temptations of the world.
üòÇüòÇ so now you&#39;re turning the music review channel into random celebrity commentary? Mind you, you already reviewed ppl who beat women and it didn&#39;t seem like you were offended that much to not review their album üòÇüòÇ acting like a damn hypocrite and pseudo moral compass üòÇüòÇ Im too old and reasonable to worship any celebrity so I don&#39;t care about Kanye at all anyway but I&#39;ve never seen a worse attempt at creating a &#39;woke&#39; content coming from a dude whose whole &#39;career&#39; is talking (sometimes shit although it&#39;s all subjective right) about music. It&#39;s crazy how people can literally die defending certain ideologies. Yet at the same time, worried about what he says she says they completely disregard the genocide which unfortunately takes place at this very moment. Okay, I&#39;m done talking. You definitely should too, but judging by this video that should have happened looong time ago.
Just remember that Fantano will happily review thousands of albums about smoking on opps and flipping packs without batting an eye
Let me Guessz Ur A Jew
shame
I love this review üòÇRealist kanye perspective out here
kanye fans are just something else man
Sad to see fantano a music reviewer, not review the music
It‚Äôs not good but I didn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unreviewable
Con esto no la vay a poner Fantanto
is this worse than a 0/10 and not good at the same time because god damn
W Ye
God you‚Äôre such a nerd bro
But black people cant be racist!!!1!!1!!111!!1!1
And I thought I was a D1 hater
Are we going to talk about Kanye saying mean words or are we going to talk about the Jewish state of Israel ethnically cleansing Palestine?
Hahahahaha the world has now birthed a bunch of fake ass heroes. Man what a difference you are making! &#39;Unreviewable&#39; you literally did review it and didnt rate it?
This is why your wife left
So the fact that you worry about what the Jews in your audience think influences the outcome of your review‚Ä¶ challenges your objectivity? I didn‚Äôt expect that üòî
Has antisemitism somehow become unimportant/accepted or is this fanbase a little ‚ú® special‚ú® for some reason.<br>I can&#39;t think of any other reason. I grew up with all sorts of people, and most of them were mindful in addressing this topic. Antisemitism has always been a line drawn with intention. I don&#39;t understand why one would want to cross it so eagerly<br><br>No one is that special
Vultures still #1 album in Israel sooo bald guy can stfu xD
I kept wanting to give him the benefit of the doubt, but his behavior is quite literally too bipolar. One minute he‚Äôs a Christian, next minute he‚Äôs mocking Christ. He needs help and nobody is helping him. I‚Äôm with Fantano on this one, we can‚Äôt validate this behavior. üôÅ
Say he is anti whatever psycho, why u didnt give star a review, which is great fking song only cuz of one line u didnt even mention the song in the video that&#39;s just hating at point. What about carti performance on a song like carnival, ty performance on beg forgiveness, kanye&#39;s verse on the start of keys to my life/burn. You are actually a maniac for mentioning the antisemitism lines and forgot about everything.
We got the first censored baby review
I agree with most of the video, but do think that there are a lot of people who just enjoy the new music. and most songs on the album do sound good and have some decent bars, although some of Kanye‚Äôs bars about sex and women were indeed disgusting.
the fanbase is responsible for all of that shit thar kanye does and says.
Melon just make this video cuz he don&#39;t want to give Vultures a 10
honestly this album is not it how I got through it Idk gues I&#39;m stronger than I thought

Do you make music?

i love how the video is so serious but the comments are just memes
bawawawawa
Fking review the album, don&#39;t review the person.<br>We all know Kanye in his worst and best, that&#39;s not why we&#39;re here tho.<br>But to decline to do the work, simply because you disagree with the artist is absolutely unacceptable
ALBUM OF THE YEAR IT IS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The lowest point on this album for me was Chris Brown having the audacity to say &quot;you should hang your head in shame&quot;, like he&#39;s some kind of victim.
If only vultures had a sexy red feature üòÇüòÇ
For yearsss, in every single Fantano video, he always says in the description, ‚ÄúY‚Äôall know this is just my opinion right?‚Äù We‚Äôre humans, we all have biases and it is his channel. It‚Äôs fine if you don‚Äôt agree with what Anthony always says, but a lot of y‚Äôall in the comments are fucking weird. Get over it
What benefit will Ye get if you review his album? He is #1 in 109 countries in the world! He is the #1 artist on Spotify. He survived cancellation and is topping charts. You know what you are doing, just by mentioning Kanye name have gotten you more views so I am blocking you now and delete you because I don‚Äôt want to come back to your page anymore.
Honestly? Thank you for this. No distasteful jokes here.
I agree with this‚Ä¶I grew up and realized Kanye is washed
Fader article really got you spooked, huh? There is plenty of valid and good discussion on your integrity as a reviewer in these comments. Unfortunately you will blindly label any criticism as a Kanye sympathizer, anti-semite, or a proud boy.
If this was called kids see vultures it would be a 10
i just like his music
this is just sad
Nice to see Anthony gave Lil Dicky higher score than Ye.
I used to really respect fantano even if I didn‚Äôt agree with his takes like mbdtf because hed provide actual criticism and reasoning but this just feels childish
I steer clear of virtue signalling - especially from those monetising eyeballs. But you had a moral duty to eloquent position what many are struggling to formulate. And you took it so fair play. In this the artist has tainted the art.
Separate the art from the artist. That being said this album was trash. Bro put on an Alvin and the Chipmunks filter for a song üòÖ Carnival and Do It go hard tho. 3/10
Kanye getting back on track was Fantanos signal to fall off his own career üò≠ melon didn‚Äôt hesitate to bomb
So what you&#39;re saying is Kanye finally made a good album?
Holy the album is melting behind him lol
I&#39;m a huge Kanye&#39;s fan, since day one. But let&#39;s be real here, this album is bad.
average kendrick lamar fanboy your opinion is irrelevant
I think Kanye needs help like he needs to see a therapist. I‚Äôm a Swiftie and I‚Äôm generally concerned for him.
Finally, the ego maniacs are turning on one another.
I just thought it would be mbdtf 2 üò≠
I give that moustache a pubic 10.
Sexyy redd ain&#39;t gonna let you hit lil bro
Man I love this, as kanye says: whos not entertained by my pain?/ who aint cash a check on my name?... fantano just did both
Whomp WHOMP still jamming to vultures üòÇ
Yo wheres your wife
Kanye be like ‚ÄúI done did the impossible, I went from 10 to unreviewable‚Äù lmao
him dissing carti is crazy like who tf are you men
The rent is due
So this is a Kanye review and not a vultures review? I‚Äôve been clickbaited
Kids are spazzing out over a nazi who put out a genuinely trash album
are we reviewing the album or the person?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=45">0:45</a> i was going to say  &quot;come on everyone is a little antisemitic after the gaza war&quot; but it is what it is .
Great job with the views on this one.
Another proof here, NEVER trust a bald guy
I&#39;m glad I listened this album because now I know ty dolla sign is a great rapper<br><br>Still, this album is pure shit...<br><br>No effort on the beats, no effort on writing some good bars and still, showing the worst side of kanye. A chilldlish, anti-semitic, bipolar, egocentric mother fucker.
This is the definition of ü§ì.
bro has YEDS (ye derangement syndrome)
Holy shit the people in these comments are stupid
melon jew
One thing that bothered me is that there seems to be this weir compression on a lot of the tracks that just makes it sound mushy
review music, music reviewer
Does anybody takes this goofy looking bald man seriously lol
You are 100% correct!
Fantano dropped a 7 minute video of him saying ‚ÄúLook at me, I‚Äôm a good person‚Äù instead of actually reviewing the damn music.<br><br>What a clown.
can you accept that i skip this video all the time?cuz this is  the way you review vulture.totally a mess
&quot;b-but you reviewed albums from people who said/did heinous shit before!&quot; yea but they weren&#39;t <i>bragging about it</i> on said albums<br><br>holy shit, commenters, literally look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=256">4:16</a> before you make asses out of your mouths
Bro didn&#39;t want to review it so people wouldn&#39;t pay attention to the album and Kanye&#39;s opinions and it had the opposite effect üëè
At least he overtook Taylor Swift on the charts ü´°
gayboy taylor fan chants bout the god
Actually the most I‚Äôve ever agreed with one of your videos
im a huge kanye fan when is comes to his music but even i can admit that this album is hot garbage and im dissapointed in kanye for no longer trying to make the best music he can
I used to love your reviews a lot, watched them all but when it comes to kanye you‚Äôre so extremely biased that I don‚Äôt trust your opinions on music anymore, unfortunately‚Ä¶ even during the livestream of this album you didn‚Äôt even listen, you obviously had an opinion before even hearing the first seconds of the album. You should keep making reviews but just skip his music because you will never rate his music, only his controversy
Interesting
You should have said nothing. This makes you sound like a hater.
you are a very brave man
fantano i predicted literally all of your points, stop trying to be so politically correct. do your research
You the king, burger king
Honestly even though I agree with alot the takes in this video hes clearly biased and misrepresenting some lyrics which are really not that hard to understand.
Bit Biased but it&#39;s his channel. Many think this album is surprisingly good af
Seethe more. The album is fine.

cant score art
Is fanteno a Jew? Serious question as it‚Äôll reflect this review
That Koopsta Knicca sample in FUK SUMN is going hard ngl (rest of the song sucks, like wtf)
Kanye as a artist is (or was) one of the best but as a person he is terrible he needs some help it&#39;s sad it&#39;s really sad I loved west but I can&#39;t listen to him without always thinking about the dumb shit he has said.
not gon listen to a guy who gave lil pump mixtape a 7 and sexy redd 8, but gave swimming a 3 and mbdtf a 6 üò≠
This dude has literally given songs glorifying actual murders positive reviews and somehow Kanye acting like an edgy 14 year old is the line for him.
Fair.
So you reviewed the album but didn‚Äôt?
Fantano is an overdramatic manchild
If this came out in early 2022 this would be a 6-8
This is why your wife divorced you
On reddit you would think this was a video where you were frothing at the mouth and making horrible points. <br><br>I now realize it&#39;s just people on reddit who actually are hateful psychos who agree with the anti-semite stuff.
Bro you review music not politics you hate on everything kanye does
The needle drops become so unlikable, embracing the meme culture surrounding him and selling out pretending to have a moral standpoint. Stick to reviewing actual music nobody cares about the other bs
Grown man having a meltdown on a monday ):
Oh look he let someone‚Äôs politics get in the way of reviewing the actual music again. Fantano fall off has begun.
ah yes, a music reviewer that doesnt review music. All I heard is your review and judgment is based on anything but the music... you&#39;re jarring Needledrop.
guys can you give me the Timestamp where he actually talks about the album instead of ye being a nazi ???????? i couldn&#39;t find it
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=256">4:16</a> damn, that&#39;s actually fair
Massive L for you bud. End of your run as a respected reviewer. Liberal Marshmello
Get your political trash out of reviews
so mad
hey yall im a nihlistic teenager i guess üòÖ
Fantano got so triggered and cooked on twitter by ye fans, they altered his brain chemistry and he had to put this out
I can see why u got divorced and got no hair. It‚Äôs karma for being a d1 douchebag hater. All your fans are so wrong for making u someone that ‚Äúknows‚Äù music.
I swear these people would be upset if you refused to review a Skrewdriver record today
1st of April is far away brother
You shouldn‚Äôt review black people music in the first place , what do you know about our culture.
Gotta ignore Kanyes political takes, plenty of artists are weirdos that are still being reviewed<br><br>He worshipped the jews at first, took a shot at the blacks, then loved the blacks and hated the jews again. Lil Dicky came on recently saying he was absolutely loved by Kanye and that he doesnt believe he&#39;s antisemetic either. He&#39;s just an odd rebel that HAS to lean into &#39;&#39;you cant say this&#39;&#39; .. &#39;&#39;I cant?.. watch me&#39;&#39; non sense
Nicki is in the same spiral Kanye is. Not to the same extent, but is well on her way there if she can&#39;t regain her self-awareness. And yes, the hopelessly delulu chunk of his fandom - Nicki has that too.

He‚Äôs kinda right lmao
why don&#39;t you give a damn about the feelings of the J*ws in your audience, thats not your job to protect everyone&#39;s feelings cmon. U can make a disclaimer and go on with an actual review, but, no, lets put on some SJW g&amp;rabge. What kind of nonsense is this anyway?<br><br>I&#39;m not saying to separate the artist from his work. Because what Kanye does on a daily basis and says is all his self-expression. <br>My argument is that you may not like his &quot;h*teful&quot; content or the images he plays with, but to say that this art is &quot;bad&quot; and unworthy of evaluation is already some kind of brainless woke-sh*t snobbery.
Fantano doesn&#39;t care that some rappers he gives some good ratings have killed people, glorify violence, are part of gangs, drug traffickers etc.<br>But he cares when Kanye is problematic and acts very hypocrite, in 2024 he likes Carti&#39;s voice, but in Carnival he mocks him just cause it&#39;s a Kanye song
&quot;my fairy tale is better than yours, and my whole human identity is based on it&quot; -people
this is my favorite music review ever
Woke-fantano
ain&#39;t no way Lool
So Kanye did all these bs as a promo for this album, trying to be like a NSBM project or something lol
Just because you got trolled and embarrassed on twitter by kanye fans
Separate the art from the artist this album was gassss
why don&#39;t you give a damn about the feelings of the Jews in your audience, you are not responsilbe for kanye&#39;s lyrics in front of your audience, you could just make a disclaimer (if u rly care) ang go on. What kind of nonsense is thay anyways, I&#39;m not saying to separate the artist from his work. Because what Kanye does on a daily basis and says is all his self-expression. My argument is that you may not like his &quot;hateful&quot; content or the images he plays with, but to say that this art is &quot;bad&quot; and unworthy of a review is already some kind of brainless woke-shit snobbery.
i get not reviewing kanyes album but when are you going to react to the new Ty Dolla Sign album that just dropped?
The thing is guys like you are the ones that made that fandom how it is now, your fandom for example is exactly like, now suffer with the consequences, with people that become who you appear to be on the internet, someone who doesn‚Äôt accept criticism and is always right
I guess these days who isn‚Äôt antisemitic, these jews have lost their mind with the devastation going on in Gaza.
I hate this woke-tano arc
what the fuck
Atony Melon stop this bullshit. Its not 2010-2019 anymore
Thought this was an album review but he didnt rly talk about the music. Bro is completely biased and can&#39;t differentiate between his music and his private life. If kanye was only making self degrading music and was called sexxy red he wouldve gotten an 8/10.
&quot;I only care about the music&quot;<br><br>utter bollocks. If they only cared about the music, they wouldn&#39;t feel the need to jump to the defence of such a blatant pos.
Vultures is goated
Bro voted for killer mike.
what a simp clown you are fantano XD i have wife, kids im not antisoaps and i like the album
I respect Kanye as an artist. I honestly think he‚Äôs a musical genius‚Äî in the same breath, I haven‚Äôt listened or even owned a Kanye album since MBDTF and the Kid Cudi collab.
shut up bro.... hes an artist. its his job to do what he does.bruh, this some  dumb shit, hit that unfollow, too dumb shit

Your so bitter, I see why your wife left.

talk about the fucking music man idfc
No attempt to separate the art from the artist, bastardization and repression of music as an artform. Terrible, even if you hate kanye.
its okay anthony, we understand the rent is due. üò•

yeah I know, fantano love you
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=41">00:41</a> Bro, are you a music reviewer or fuckin&#39; Jordan Peterson?
Great video, really to the point
I miss when music reviewers reviewed the actual music instead of making a 10 minute rant about the artist...
Nice review Melonberg
Could you be any more of a leftie crybaby? Most don&#39;t care about Kanye&#39;s insanity but the album is objectively garbage, Kanye&#39;s last incredible album was Yeezus, It&#39;s alright though he had an incredible run while it lasted.<br><br>waahhhh wahhhh keep crying
You can try all you can to put hate on that man it will not stop it from being number one on the charts.You&#39;re only helping not hurting üòÇ
dont let da hate get to u ur right
this is a totally subjective review, as many others of yours, that has 0 value if our aim is to appreciate the Art an artist is making. you are basicaly saying that if you agreed with his opinions and if he did a more commercial album then you would&#39;ve liked it? sorry but this is anti-artistic. it&#39;s like saying picasso&#39;s paintings are bad because they don&#39;t make sense. you really missed the point with this one. i dont agree with any of kanyes latest actions or statements, that being said he still is one of the greatest if not the greatest artist of our generation (not muscian or rapper, i said artist), disrespecting him like this is not the way to understand art. having such a closed mind on what art is is not ideal when making a review. also saying that this is just your opinion at the end of the video description to have a gateaway from every criticism seems like one of the things you critiqued about kanye in the first place, ironic
Bro ur a bum no lie, if this album is unreveiwable then don&#39;t talk shit on the music cos you are quite literally reviewing in.
Thank god for 2x speed
you are a music critic not a politician
Kanye will eventually fade out of public consciousness in a really sad way. What a way to tarnish your legacy.
He should just review the music and remove his personal notions
is this a music review or a review on kanyes business?
I see where Anthony is coming from but I&#39;m disappointed he didn&#39;t do a proper review of it. it&#39;s supposed to be his opinions, and that you don&#39;t have to listen to him. Kanye is not a good person and some of his fans are the worst, but I think Fantano is cracking under pressure here. not a massive fan of most of the album tbh, and Anthony probably would have received similar backlash for giving it a low rating because of some of the fans. but still, if you&#39;re going to platform this, at least do it properly? I feel like this is just capitalising on drama and arguing with the people he&#39;s criticising especially on twitter and twitch
rare melon W
BEAUTIFUL BIG TITTY BUTT NAKED WOMEN JUST DON&#39;T FALL OUTTA SKY, YOU KNOW
You know the man is a genius when he can mold his music to both be a 10 and a unique title &quot;unreviewable 1&quot;. Next ablum should aim for 0 or not god just to get all needledrop titles
It definitely isn&#39;t Kanye&#39;s best album, but I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s his worst. Do It was a pretty fun listen for me, and Beg Forgiveness was very solid.
look at what saying the j word does to these fools lmao they too sensitive
Anthony, I understand why u don‚Äôt wanna listen to Kanye and claim his stuff to be unreviewable because of the things he‚Äôs said. But you can just not review, even though you say it‚Äôs unreviewable u still reviewed it in this video.
it&#39;s okay bald man we understand your divorce hit hard
So this is what getting divorced by a black woman does to a man...
So pizzahut beard-man is rambling about a black jew hater?
He reminds me of one those odd balls that&#39;ll say Beyonce can&#39;t really sing or halle berry isn&#39;t beautiful üòÇ
stop yapping and review the album not his background brah
blocked
This review is trash! He is so triggered by Kanye that all objectively disappears.
seperate the art from the artist.
nobody cares
Uh oh the melon man angryüò†
Big mad
Unreviewable but still makes a video to rake in the ad revenue shekels. Sanctimonious clown with zero integrity.
bro just flew in from yappington city
You only dislike this because of his politics
As a fan of Kanye west&#39;s music am supporting Anthony, Kanye should not be making music right now he should go back to his ranch and spend a lot of quality time with his family and fix the relationships with his close friends
So, Im not going to entirely disagree with you. But i do think youre buying a bit too much into the sensationalism of it all. I dont think Kanye&#39;s antics and supporting it indirectly by buying and listening to his music old or new creates anymore harm than lets say buying a Jordan shoe that was very possibly made via slave labor. So ya i think at a certain point youre splitting hairs, and listen if what he is doing for you is too much for you, i get it and in fact i support you, because i dont agree with what or who he is either. However, i dont support what youre saying here in the sense that listening to his music is unjustifiable. Ive been a fan for a long time and its all been about how great the musical genius is, and a facination with him as a person, rather than a worship, bc i do aknowlege and agree with his personal flaws. But i see it for what it is, and i do think both good and bad people can make great art. I would suggest overall trying to support good people art of course over the ladder. However, i dont think art from tbe perspectove of the consumer should have to be this big political virtue idea where you can only listen to music by people who are good guys or girls. I think if something gives you a passionate feeling, draws you, inspires you, puts you in whatever desired mood you seek, then thats all you need. And listen Fantano, even if you disagree with me on the lot of this. I at least hope ive convinced you and others (assuming you may read this), that there are more than just the 3 fans you listed. There are people who are just general art consumers who enjoy art from anyone. Hell, i listen to Charles Manson&#39;s Look At Your Game Girl song infrequently. Because its a vibe. And hes not the only one. So ya, i think you shoukd get off your high horse a bit and not put all of his listeners down so heavy.
if carti was on this album you wouldve given it a 5/10
L
This dude is something else
I wish the like to dislike ratio was back on
we came to a point where he cant objectively give albums a score anymore
dawg nobody cares about your political views but if you keep virtue signaling like this instead of reviewing music people are gonna stop watching this channel or stay just to troll you
tracks 4-12 are trash, the rest is amazing
bro stop being woke, why u caring so much about what he is saying, thats just his opinion, thats part of his artistry.<br>album is a banger, kanye is very entertaining guy, love what he is doing.
After it, I will stop watching any of this guy‚Äôs review because bringing politics into anything happening and any content is something I don‚Äôt want to see in my life, especially when it comes from Americans who live their life destroying other world‚Äôs politics but OMG! Kanye is fascist. Yeah‚Ä¶like it is such a huge issue when people are dying and you don‚Äôt cover it at all
You are just projecting your own hate and you are using that as a generalization to discredit his genius.
Fantano really the kinda guy to bash an entire album for a few goofy lines but love Ye and Kids See Ghosts
Liberal melon doesn&#39;t rock with good music
ugh, not this bald guy again. Get out of my feed please
As much as peoole pretend to hate Kanye. Its telling his still getting 65 mill listeners on spotify. Donda has been at the top of the gospel chart. Which is propbably caused by people still listening to it. Clearly people can separate art from artist when it comes from Kanye. Clearly hes not going anywhere the best we can hope for is music from a man past his prime
i separated the art from the artist but the art was still bad if not worse
He gave MBDTF a 6 so i never know how to take dude&#39;s Kanye reviews.
you got 30k dislikes lil bro, better start praying
Anthony got paid for this review
Your music reviewer, ur not politician, your whole job is to review someones music, and how can that same music effect the world and the artist, thats all.
If the artist who made it wasnt kanye fantano would be here calling it a 10/10 album
The hoodrat outro is aimed at you fantano
There&#39;s no way a single kanye glazer in these comments is over the age of 16
Jezus man, Melon you&#39;re way too far gone. Stigmatising a whole fanbase with absolute black or white toughts. Can&#39;t you just leave your personal hatred on the guy out of it?
This ain&#39;t a review of the albumn this is a political message
Good work mate
If Fantano didn&#39;t want to farm drama, he wouldv&#39;e just honestly reviewed the album. But instead he calls everyone who likes kanye unhinged at best and antisemetic at worst and then ignores anything good he had said about the album  in his reaction stream. While Kanye undoubtably has antisemetic fans and is antisemetic himself, to so closely relate his recent actions with the album and then discard an entire 16 track album because of 3 bars is craaaazy. Every album has bad bits people ignore so they can enjoy the rest of the album, otherwise every album would be 1/10. Its a shame that when so many mindless kanye fans will defend every little bit of the album no matter how bad, that you weren&#39;t willing to give it a fair look. Maybe next time.
My fav part of the vid is at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=423">7:03</a> when he stops talking
Ik ur famous and dont care but im sick of you not rebiewing js cus of his political views bro ur a joke of a reviewer
‚ÄúWhat is even the purpose of a music review‚Äù to review music dumass
Rewatching the Kids See Ghosts review and then watching this is jarring
I think its the glasses
Woketano
but sexy red is reviewable?
Love your reviews
the hate for the music feels pretty extreme but everything outside of his actual review is completely reasonable<br><br>kanyes fans are atrocious
Feels more personal, less then a Music review. Barely spoke about the music like u would usually lol.
Cornball
JEW MAD?
Nerdy boldy Melon Head again Hating Kanye,again.....
Very bad take
üòÇüòÇüòÇ I love this review
You speak about him almost daily and then don‚Äôt actually review the album‚Ä¶pathetic stuff
The album actually isnt that bad at all. Sure some of the mixes are bad, Kanye cant rap anymore and some of the songs are kinda eh but the instrumentals are all fire, Ty really sang his heart out and the features are bangers. Im all for opinions but it sounds like you just want to hate for the sake of hating
this is a left wing pawn .   don&#39;t listen .   Anthony is trash .
fucking disgusting what kanye&#39;s been up to, dropping the joke comments for a moment, absolutely horrible
If it was called Welcome to the Vultures House you would have given it a 0
imagaine having working ears and not liking back to me
I agree with everything you said
Yeah, after his comments, I just can&#39;t look past that, I actually tried, but his comments just keeps popping in my mind. I fucked up. I&#39;ll be waiting for real &quot;I&#39;m sorry moment&quot;. Till that, I&#39;m just off in Rap in general.
These comments give me an aneurysm. If you hate fantano so much and dont like what he says dont watch. Its that easy. Coming here and defending Kanye‚Äôs honor like that actually matters?
lmao bro called it a dubpsterfirre what a goober
Pure üí©
This is funny yoh üòÇüòÇüòÇ
I&#39;m generally a &quot;separate the art from the artist&quot; guy but if you can still do that with Kanye you&#39;re the type of mf who could enjoy a Hitler painting of Auschwitz. This guy&#39;s purpose is to be racist, antisemitic, and to harass anyone who wrongs him for the last few years and he will not stop putting it in his music. You cannot ignore it even if you wanted to. Also the instrumentals straight up suck.
Don‚Äôt care just wanna hear about the music man
The album is number 1 in charts in Israel btw
Common Fantano L
Would love to see the dislikes
Someone‚Äôs a little obsessed
this single album rating is the reason your wife left you and that you dont have any kids
If he really cared about all the things he was saying, he&#39;d completely remove all his Kanye reviews
Spot on! The album is trashhhhh
I stopped listening after the first 3 songs, never been this disappointed
didnt think kanye west would drop any music anymore after the antisemitic stuff<br>it shouldve stayed that way<br>perfect fall of a guy who went crazy cuz his mommy died
Why do we give a shit what this Guy has to say
30k dislikes now lmao
I‚Äôm a Kanye fan, and a Fantano fan. As I‚Äôm not friends with neither of them, I‚Äôm a fan of their products and not them as a person. <br><br>I enjoyed this album except for some absolutely pointless things in it like Alvin the Chipmunk lol. (6.5/10) And I think the initial tweets of Fantano were kinda unnecessarily provocative against the stupid ‚Äúdie-hard‚Äù fans. <br><br>I would have enjoyed a real review where musical aspects were also touched on instead of a 7 minute slander. <br><br>Yes, Kanye said a lot of stupid things that I would never defend, I still think we neglect his mental issues because he is a famous billionaire and that does not seem fair to me. <br><br>BUT, this is Fantano‚Äôs channel and he reserves the right not to entertain lifeless idiots who are sending him death threats over an opinion about a guy none of us will probably ever actually know. <br><br>Even though I‚Äôm disappointed that there is no actual review, I understand where Fantano is coming from and I respect it.
you won&#39;t review the latest work of arguably the best producer because you don&#39;t like him?
GO GO GO GO GO GO GO
bro fantano you have to decrease your dpi,  cuz you got waaaaay too sensitive
I feel like I beat a murder murder
JOOISH
bro you ok?
Someone please turn that thumbnail into a soyjak, put it in a collage or compilation of every deranged angry tweet and tiktok he‚Äôs posted since Vultures dropped, it‚Äôs been hilarious to watch
The album is fire and at least 8 <br>you forcing yourself to hate the album
I agree that the hate on you is absolutely disgusting but don&#39;t say that the album is unlistenable and only people that enjoy it are delusional kanye stans. Your frequent collaborators the nfr podcast gave this album a &#39;good&#39; and &#39;great&#39; rating. i think you respect their opinion since you collaborate, stop saying about this album like its a antisemitic scandal, because it isn&#39;t. You were so biased that you didn&#39;t even hear the lyrics of king. Kanye clearly says &quot;After everything THEY said&quot; and then &quot;Crazy, bipolar, antisemite&quot;. he&#39;s not admitting to being antisemitic but saying that is what the &#39;headlines&#39; are saying. The album is nothing special, its mostly club bangers but you made it seem like the worst piece of trash ever.
Idk why normally I&#39;m a fan but right now you just sound like a hater you sound like I&#39;m listening to a 150 year old talking about stuff who cares I&#39;m here for the music
shut up man
So it got a 4?
You‚Äòre pathetic, get some sleep.
Oh hell deah preach brotherü¶æü¶æ
I think he just dosent like kanye
Wow. You are something.
this shouldnt have a voice in the music industry afte giving mbdtf a light 6.
Ye wife is an icon only because of ye
i just wish he would actually stake a position and give it a not good like he really wants to. super annoying that hes pussyfooting around these political points and just calling it unreviewable when back in 2016 he was totally open to taking tlop seriously even though im pretty sure he was disgusted by the taylor bar in famous and had some gripes about how kanye was handling the marriage side of things too iirc
you are just hatin at this point
Wha wha review the album review boy
Listening to this album made me realise Kanye cant write bars no nore. Lokey is there a single good one?
Okay fantano we get it you&#39;re a liberal and have the style of a 9 year old,youve literary reviewed music from killers and people who have physically hurt people,but oh no no words are more harmful
Lmao melon, i dont think thats the only ppl who listen to this, i enjoy some tracks, n some other was trash, i really like carnival n fuk sum fr
Open letter from a Kanye West fan. I started listening to Kanye 2 years ago and now I&#39;ve racked up over 14,000 minutes of his music. I&#39;ve always turned a blind eye to his personal life, the antisemitic comments, and all the other controversial stuff, choosing to focus just on his music. Even when these aspects of his life were hinted at in his albums up to &#39;Donda&#39;, I didn&#39;t see them as a big deal. Plus, since English isn&#39;t my first language, I don&#39;t always catch the lyrics unless I really concentrate, so I was able to just enjoy the beats, music, production, and flow without any issues. But with this new album, I&#39;m finding it hard to enjoy. At times, it feels a bit dull, and audibly, it just doesn&#39;t hit the mark for me. I&#39;m not quite sure how to articulate why it feels underwhelming since I&#39;m no music expert. Sure, the cringe moments do bother me, but like I&#39;ve said, I usually brush them off. I came looking for a review knowing it would be critical, hoping for some in-depth explanations, but didn&#39;t find what I was looking for. I get why you&#39;d react the way you did; Kanye fans have been through a lot, with too much personal life drama and unnecessary insults. So, I understand the passionate review. But still, I wish I could pinpoint exactly why this album doesn&#39;t do it for me.
Hahahaha. Does anybody even still care what Fantano says? Reviews nowadays are based on his oppinion on the political views of artists or his personal relationship with them (Kanye and Drake). What music critic reviews based on what kind of relationship a man had withbhis wife? Shameful to speak on somebodies marriage like this. Fantano had become irrelevant for hiphop music reviews. It‚Äôs sad. Used to enjoy these.
lol 30k downvotes, yall so salty about opinions. cry more yeezers
This is just sad
hmmm, time to get overlooked in the comments.<br><br>i‚Äôm a different type of fan than the ones listed in this video. i can say that yes! he‚Äôs batshit crazy whom is saying antisemitic rhetoric, who is basically using this new wife of his, and being unapologetic about it all.<br><br>yet with me knowing that and forcing myself to acknowledge it, doesn‚Äôt make the music bad for me personally. comparing it to his other bodies of work, yes, it‚Äôs not even close but it‚Äôs not a bad album either. it‚Äôs a catchy album. <br><br>i don‚Äôt wish to support hate, i don‚Äôt wish to support his acts in life. i do wish to support music. i‚Äôm not a huge lowlife diehard Kanye stan! i‚Äôm just a casual music lover who loves what i heard knowing the man behind it.
Bro listened to burn and thought yeah this ain&#39;t it
King Von kills 8 people nothing gets said, but oh no Kanye said some mean words :(
bro are you okay? i would suggest taking a break from social media‚Ä¶ you spilling a lot of shit
we truly, and i mean this, do not care about your political opinion. <br><br>You grew on musical takes but this is embarrassing, unsubbed.
i mean it was mid
This the most retarded review I seen
I always liked fantano but these pc-fueled high and mighty rants are exactly what makes people lose relevance, contrary to what they might think. Just give it a low score, admit that you dont like Kanye, nobody comes here for the newspaper article snippets and comments on your inner code of conduct
fair
Do you guys remember when music reviewers reviewed the actual music?
clown
Anthony fantano was a 4chan fiend back in the day. He got hate and was so scared that he continues his white savior schtick even now.<br><br>&quot;Guys, sorry for being edgy in 2016. I&#39;ll support the agenda from now on. PLEASE ACCEPT ME!&quot;
this has to be your best video of your entire music review career, unsubscribed üòä
Can&#39;t wait for <br>unreviewable 2<br>And unreviewable 3
Lmfao why would you ‚Äúhave to tell the Jews in your audience‚Äù anything? If you like how something sounds it doesn‚Äôt mean you agree with the artist‚Äôs lyrics or personal political views. Why even make this video if that‚Äôs how you feel? üíÄ
Instead of soapboxing he could have actually reviewed the album. It‚Äôs a shame because it‚Äôs some of Ye‚Äôs best work of late.<br><br>Y‚Äôall more obsessed with Jews than Kanye is.
Lthony ltano, because this is a L take
Fantano you review music not politics
dont lose your ability to review music with no biases. theres no need for hate
Imagine making so much content off of someone you absolutely despise and don&#39;t want to platform, but end up giving them the most platform. If you actually care, don&#39;t give him a voice. Don&#39;t make tik Toks. Fantani=h3h3 of music now
So we are not listening to Richard Wagner from now on i guess <br><br>thank you soytany soytano
3 minutes in and he still hasn&#39;t talked about the music
Kanye fans are having a meltdown on Twitter over this video, good
just be normal and stop doing this shit because you hate Kanye‚Äôs personality/politics. <br>everyone on the Internet has treated this album normally and so should you, you need to focus on the art and stop being entitled to think it‚Äôs ok to just cry about the political shit all the time (you do the same on insta again and again and no one likes it)
Fuk Sumn is dumb, but slaps hella hard. CARNIVAL is genius, sorry. I&#39;m a hip hop producer, and I could never even imagine making a sample like that actually work. I had to pretend somebody else made the music, just to listen to it without feeling guilty.
ü§ìü§ìü§ì
if this was called MBDTF you would have given it a 6/10
Subhuman trash
If I was melon I would have gave this  light 7 to 6/10
I don&#39;t like ye, like at all, but calling all the people that like his songs losers and fringe racists is definitely one hell of a take
Honestly if you didn&#39;t made this video a lot of people wouldn&#39;t know it&#39;s out. Consider just completely ignoring kanye in the future and not giving him free marketing.
Antisemitism is horseshit, just like racism and homophobia. You have no argument, you‚Äôre just saying don‚Äôt talk about this period. That‚Äôs not going to work.
This dude is Kanye‚Äôs Skip Bayless lmao
Not going to lie it‚Äôs a bit hypocritical of you to refuse to review this album yet you have reviewed Burzum (the neo nazi rooted metal band that Kanye is referencing in his current merch) and gave them a 6/10.<br><br>Edit: after watching the stream of you reacting to the album, you absolutely went into this fully intendeding to hate on it. I‚Äôm not even a fan of Kanye or his music, and even I can see what you did here.
Fantano is a evil deep state Jew
The comments just prove you right its crazy
I can‚Äôt believe I ever watched this dork years ago. I stopped when he tried becoming political as if his views were relevant or informed
You know you could have just let it slide and not review it right
W Anthony
I agree with a lot of things you ve said but as a spectator I can tell the review is kinda influenced from everything ye has said and done. there a lot of artists that have done a lot of horrible things, for example beating their wives and you keep talking very good about them and their musical projects, so all i m asking for is to actually separate person and music at least when you re reviewing something, think at thoose lirycs like a jokie jokeüòÇ
If you only care about the music then admit that it&#39;s trash
I miss the old kanye
ALL THESE PEOPLE MAD AT DUDE<br><br>THIS FOR WHO IT MATTER TO
So you want to ignore someone&#39;s music because you dont agree with what they Say (Just 3 jewish jokes here for example) no matter how good the music is. Is this third Reich or middle Age ?
A hate vid masked as a ‚Äúreview‚Äù ?üòäüòä we all know you dont fw him but good daamn
you are in your feelings üòÜ
Nerd emoji video
if the album was called kids see vultures you wouldve given this album a 10
Yh but Carnival tho‚Ä¶
Yeah I think ye stans are really annoying in recent years. Having Kanye as a profile picture shows that I am a fan of his, yet I can‚Äôt stop others from being stupid and ignorant. I know you won‚Äôt be bothered by these melon but just keep moving on it‚Äôs all good
Fantano you are not gandhi, we just want you to review albums, not preach bs
A minute in after saying it‚Äôs trash and all you‚Äôre talking about is politics
Okay to be fair I am a huge hiphop head and even more a huge Kanye West fan. But I think out of all people, Kanye fans kind of hate Kanye the most. We mostly know he&#39;s fucked up and we also know it has been like this for some years and it&#39;s getting worse, the only problem is that we love his music and are still obsessed with his musical talent this doesn&#39;t take away from the fact that he&#39;s a horrible artist but we try to just live with that while trying to enjoy his music and be his fanbase no matter how wrong that actually is.
you&#39;re looking too much into the person rather than the music and the sound, I like the sound of the album, I don&#39;t care for his personal circumstances or lyrics relating to them, it does not affect me directly, I just enjoy the music
carnival go crazy
Why he is mad on a album tfüò≠
Album dope af idk what you‚Äôre taking smh
Why do kanye corny ass fanbase dride in the coments, with or without the fantano review the album is still a trash snoozefest. Kanye fell off hard after 2018
Kanye wins if you give the album a review like this. If I made music that one of the biggest critics in the industry called &quot;unreviewable&quot;, I&#39;d probably die a happy man. That&#39;s seriously one of the apex goals of artistic production
if it&#39;s somehow morally wrong to enjoy this record, is it also morally wrong to enjoy Getting Better by the Beatles? or any sexually charged Led Zeppelin song? or is it maybe that when these artists put controversial things in their lyrics, they&#39;re intentionally playing their audience and critics like you?<br><br>Also, rappers have been making (ambiguously) serious death threats and talking about r**ing women in songs for decades, but when Kanye jokes about his antisemitic controversies in a song it is now morally unreviewable This shouldn&#39;t be a hot take, but murder and r*pe is worse than being antisemitic (not to downplay n*zism, obv).<br><br>Not a fan of kanye (the man) but you have to apply the same criticism to everyone else as you do him. If this record is unlistenable, you should have hundreds of more reviews like this.<br><br>@clarkzzz
re fucking lax melonhead .
love seeing this guy ruin his reputation
woo
Verdict: Jesus is King 2 leaked last year, just listen to that if you haven&#39;t already.
Now Im just here waiting for Drake to drop his new full lp project &#39;Anita Max Wynn&#39; üíÖüíÖüíÖ
Why he attac peggy ü•∫
look i get that there are a lot of ye fans like that but i just like his music especially the old albums and some of the songs have had helped me and calling me a cult member with a meaningless life just cause i like someones music is a little too much
Okay, seriously though, ignoring the contentious portions of this album and its release, this album feels so unspecial. It feels like a nothing burger of an album, something that will be forgotten about within a week, and that&#39;s not a good thing when it comes to Kanye albums. It felt like it was dropped with no hype or build up, and what we got was so demo quality to boot. This did not feel like Mike Dean was in the studio mixing for months on end, more so it felt like Kanye just cobbled together something and put it out there for everyone to hear. I mean, seriously, on Carnival, you can&#39;t even hear Carti. I don&#39;t know what the fuck they were thinking by thinking this was okay to put out.<br><br>Honestly, this doesn&#39;t rank very high for me either in terms of Kanye&#39;s projects, but it&#39;s not for the reasons that Fantano seems to have. I think Fantano&#39;s opinions this time around are obtuse and biased.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=270">4:30</a> how is the top left one antisemitism? He‚Äôs literally just quoting people calling him antisemitic
Biased
Can you spare me the libtard whining please? Apparently when someone says something that&#39;s actually controversial they&#39;re music is suddenly unreviewable but when someone says something that&#39;s pretend cotroversial like &quot;i&#39;m a hoe&quot; or &quot;i&#39;m gay&quot; their music is amazing and revolutionary and if you disagree with that you&#39;re a snowflake lol
We all have bad takes I guess. Not even a huge kanye fan in general. But numbers don&#39;t lie. The charts say what they say and I have not even listened to the whole album but even the songs I have heard which is 4 or 5 were decent to actually very good.
Dork
Historic review
I think you forget that for the average person music and an artist‚Äôs career is something that they connect with on a far more personal level than how fantano is treats music. Like people grew with and grew up listening to Kanye which probably had a significant impact on their life while you listen to albums once and never listens to it again no matter how good it is cus due to your career he has to move onto the next album and the next album<br><br>To categorise all Kanye fans as either being obsessed cult members, nihilistic teenagers with meaningless lives and hateful psycho is incredibly insulting to most Kanye fans who are actually normal and just resonate with his work on a deeper level. Literally taking the vocal minority that are chronically online is the definition of a generalisation and insanely inflammatory.<br><br>Like I‚Äôll never forget listening to something like ghost town when I been in the shit before or relating to kanyes mental struggles in the past, you dont have that same connection to the music or the career at all so it‚Äôs far easier for you to view Kanye fans as some rap equivalent of the KKK<br><br>And surely fantano knows how people can connect to Kanye like that cus he gave astroworld and rodeo 8/10‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt get astroworld or rodeo without Kanye west. Astroworld, telekinesis, never catch me, 90210, nightcrawler, dysti,etc don‚Äôt exist without kanye
Bias
Actually fuck off, you&#39;re so moist üòÇüòÇüòÇ
you know it&#39;s bad when he starts laughing to himself like idubbbz
yet if you really were against this you wouldn&#39;t promote it at all but what gets you the most engagement KANYE as much as you hate him you can&#39;t keep his meat out of your mouth
If u hate him so much why keep posting abt  him even in ur streaming u still giving him exposure<br><br>Got to get the bag m I right
The gaslighting here is crazy, I agree Kanye is batshit crazy but you can‚Äôt say there‚Äôs quite a few bangers here. How is this album number 1 in over 100 countries and trash. I think if literally any other artist put this out, fantano of course wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs a masterpiece (I do think the mixing is whack and some songs like hoodrat are a bit mind numbing) but it would at least be a 7/8. Please people that disagree with me share your opinions because this video basically told me, as someone who likes this album, that I‚Äôm an antisemite, sexist, narcist who doesn‚Äôt care about other peoples opinions.
thatistheplan enjoyed it üòà
It is funny when fantano reviews properly when  the albums done by criminals or lyrics about murdering and raping but not yeüòÇüòÇ
MY GOAT REALLY THE FIRST PERSON TO GET AN UNREVIEWABLE REVIEW üò≠üò≠üêê
I love you
If you really felt this way why would you even review the album? Given the left field format you‚Äôve used in this video you know it‚Äôs going to get A LOT more views than normal. I would have just not given it any attention period. A leftoid always gonna still get the bag regardless of morals lol üòÇ
Unfortunately there is a large portion of &#39;normal&#39; black folk who also feel the need to pretend that Kanye did nothing wrong, merely because he&#39;s a black dude and apparently it&#39;s criminal to criticize &#39;one of your own&#39;.<br><br>I find this tribalism unfortunate.
This is actually a super based review. Thank you Fantano for not giving Kanye the satisfaction of a score for his horribly conceived album üëç
Honestly i agree wit him
Unreviewable, but he made sure to post it because he knew it‚Äôll likely be the most views he gets this year.
After everything said huh.
You just introduced a higher standard of reviewing art. We&#39;ve been lacking this for too long as a society. Thank you for showing humanity and integrity.
This, kids, is what you call peak virtue signaling.
Fantano showing his age unfortunately
If it was sexyyreds ass instead of Bianca censori&#39;s he would&#39;ve given it an 8
Y&#39;all know this is just my opinion, on sight?
Remember guys, art is no longer art if the person who made it has a different opinion than you!
Fantano losing his credibility as a music critic.
Doing this and refusing to take down your Burzum reviews is paramount to hypocrisy at best
try fent
You just completely invalidated yourself as a reviewer.. You&#39;re spouting this altruist shitfit about how bad Kanye West is because of his anti-semitism... The irony is that you promote and review highly artists who&#39;s behaviours and opinions have more of a detrimental impact on the general public... Highly vulgar lyrics about justifying sex and murder is gonna effect the trajectory of more people&#39;s lives moreso than Kanye&#39;s Antisemitism. And we live in a geopolitical climate where we are watching jews in Israel relentlessly murder and genocide palestinians.. I think the era of &quot;Oh the poor jews&quot; has come to an end... They are just as much open to criticism as any other religion..<br><br>Also 7/10. Carnivals slaps.
smh .. lol
I&#39;m glad we can all finally stop pretending he was ever objective in his views.
Kanye says he hates jews, and gets bashed for it. Meanwhile most of the country are rooting for the Jews to lose against Palestine but that‚Äôs completely ok. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Honestly im scared for his wellbeing
Nah I have to disagree with you on Back To Me. That song is one of my favourite&#39;s Ye has put out in years. Ty&#39;s chorus has been stuck in my head since November. Yeah Ye&#39;s verse and the sample is goofy but I still think the overall track is great. The drums are very MBDTF era
For me Hoodrat was a nice play on repetition fading out the word of the sample and leaving only the sound of it, which is kinda interesting. Other than that - terrible mastering, every bass farts in your ear, weird noises in the vocals. It sounds like he was aiming at deconstructed music, but instead probably had to deconstruct his monitors after blowing them...
you reviewed burzum albuns what do you mean its ureviewable
Israelis public image is forever altered dude, and they made it aallll by themselves, sorry but face it. Stop talking politics here and your pretty shallow and partly misinterpreted psychoanalysis please, this is about music and art . I understand your hurt feelings, but try to give a neutral review. I too think he is uber provocative ON PURPOSE and I&#39;m SURE he doesn&#39;t treat his wife the way yall imagine it. She&#39;s smart an an artist, some ppl don&#39;t get it. I&#39;m not especially a Kanye fan but album is great and your &#39;review&#39; is ridiculous you just dont get him and dont get art, sorry... :(<br>btw.... if you mention again and again that Ye must apologize but you seem completely ok with those supporting ethnic cleasing and bombing kids than you are the one being delusional :(((. I&#39;m so tired of this hipocrisy. I&#39;m no hater, no teenager, no occultist like you want me to be. I&#39;m a 40 year old pretty happy woman, designer, artist, music lover and I&#39;m genuinely shocked you refuse to see the value or read between the lines :(

Burned 8 billion to take of my chains
The guy is the guy, the music is the music, period
album was ass but still deserved a proper review
As the biggest Kanye meat rider ever this ‚Äúalbum‚Äù is fucking terrible
the albums ass but i dont really agree with ur message
i cant explain it. i hate kanye. but... i lowkey love back to me....
Since when did Anthony become so unbearable
Damn, he should&#39;ve give this album an &#39;nicht gut&#39;
just came to dislike this mario mustache looking white boy
Dude&#39;s gonna call every kanye album unreviewable from here on out cause he doesnt Like him anymore lol
Kanye&#39;s best work since TLOP. Fantano&#39;s just a hater. Just like the people he talks about that will defend Kanye to the death no matter how bad the music, Fantano will hate on Kanye to the death no matter how good the music.
This guy dropped a video of himself hating for 7 min straight üò≠üò≠ who pissed in this guys cheerios
Boo hoo carnival 10/10 the album is a 8/10
north west deserves a review how u gonna shun up and coming rappers
<a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/G8AfY6yWGuKuhL0PlbiA2AE"></a>
Hes right. This album mix is atrocious
was hoping you‚Äôd whip out the spaghetti or a smoothie
I&#39;m back to hate on you again. I don&#39;t fall into any of your categories. I&#39;m the farthest from hateful, I am not nihilistic or bored, and I am not a fanboy. You claim that it is US who are not capable of having a discussion, but you wouldn&#39;t touch a decent conversation in a million years. Your kind will silence, talk over, slander, but NEVER converse. <br><br>I&#39;d seriously talk to you with a mind ready to be changed. There&#39;s no way in hell you would offer the same courtesy.
Atleast kanye has a wife
Yo ex wife still getting pounded by another man as you review these albums.
fantano himself said it was unreviewable then reviewed it lmao<br>the power of ye
This is a review of kanye, and not the music. Get out your feelings and do your job. You‚Äôre not going to cancel him or persuade ppl to cancel him. Stop being so triggered by ye and review the music and leave your libtard politics out of it
Amazing album, ANTISEMITE BUT I‚ÄôM STILL THE KING
COuld have just not reviewed it.
I just dont get how melon can&#39;t seem to understand how a mentally ill person that doesn&#39;t take his meds can come to wrong (antisemitic) conclusions over his own anecdotal experiences. <br>And instead of trying to guide or help him, people like melon proceed to condemn and banish him into a corner, where he finds bad influences like Fuentes who just amplify any antisemitic thoughts he may have.
whre&#39;s your wife?
aplasticplant showing up in the video its just comedy
What n*zi imagery is in vultures ?
You can‚Äôt say all that and say carnival wasn‚Äôt a banger tho
Fantano what did you think of the intro track and GOOD (Don‚Äôt die)? You can‚Äôt tell me that was trash
Separate art from the artists
2EMOTIONAL/10
üëèüèøüëèüèøüëèüèø Looks like no one else is gonna say it. Thank you Anthony.
bro went dramatic with this one, the closer reminded me of a classic youtube apology video
Are you divorced?
Get a life
Until Vultures 2 üò≠üò≠
Another episode of white people deciding which flaws a black man is allowed to have: Murder is totally fine, lame/ opposing political views are unacceptable!
Brother is welcoming the impressions with this one
GUYS.............. the album is trash....it has like 3 good songs i&#39;d rate above his other stuff i jus can&#39;t keep defending it is definitely his weakest project( jesus is king looks good in front of this)
Comments proving exactly what Fantano said in the video
Cringe liberal
I totally get the anger he feels after Kanye now even infused his music with his crazy and disgusting, sometimes even antisemitic thoughts. But that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that this album definitely has some highs that are worth reviewing. It sure is bloated and unfinished in many parts, but tracks like ‚Äúf**k sum‚Äú are just fun and ‚Äúburn‚Äú or ‚Äúgood‚Äú might be some of his best work since 2016.
Timestamp:<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4">0:00</a> yapping
I like the album and I like Kanye&#39;s music, but I condemn what is happening around you on X right now and I respect your opinion and feelings, nerd
This mf gave MBDTF a 6 and Yeezus a 5, opinion rejected
Fantanos off his meds again ü§ßü§ßü§ßü§ß
Okay so people are delusional for liking something you don‚Äôt.
I feel like it‚Äôs weird to conglomerate all of Kanye fans into just 3 kinds of people. As a someone who is a fan of his music, and also understands some of the heinous a disingenuous things he has said, I feel like he‚Äôs an extremely complicated, troubled, idiot, genius. His music can‚Äôt justify his actions, but they are also a part of the character that is embedded within his music. We enjoy his music because so much of his own story is inseparable from it. In short, I like his music and hope he helps himself and also takes real, genuine accountability for his actions. <br><br>Also, kinda disappointed with this album. I think you said it best when you said it‚Äôs a better Donda 2. Who knows, maybe it‚Äôll grow on me.
Fantano doesn&#39;t even show the entire cover with that gorgeously shaped butt imo...I only know that look from the so-called &quot;Last Generation&quot; who demonstrate against combustion cars in Germany. But he gets them clicks so who cares
Fagtano being a smug liberal again? Check.
Talk about the music
your on the polar opposite of kanye its just as annoying. tastless virtue signaling, its corny.
This is such a dumb ass take lol. You review rapests, and murderers
fantano when everyone in the crowd sings &quot;carnival&quot; and have a nice time listening to &quot;burn&quot; : YOU GUYS HAVE TO STOP!!!!!
Calling kanye fans who like his music ignorant teenagers with meaningless lives is a bit harsh, they are just uneducated
If it&#39;s unreviewable you wouldn&#39;t be here farming engagement off of it. You don&#39;t like Kanye, stop talking about him. This &quot;oh I have to talk about him because people ask me to&quot; excuse is complete and utter BS. You own the channel, you own your brand, do something with it that you like.<br><br>You were never going to give this album a fair review because of your vitriol against its creator. If you really cared as little as you did you wouldn&#39;t have covered the rollout, listened to the tracks on stream and &quot;reviewed&quot; the album. This isn&#39;t a review, it&#39;s a statement of personal attack. Insanely unprofessional.
I miss the old melon before he got woke and political
If it was called to pimp a vulture you would give it a 10
Kanye really that guy that can turn jpegmafia into a hypocritical lapdog and fantano into a sorry excuse for a music critic that cant even critique music. Truly a one of a kind artist
review so bad it gave me aids
Fantano has reached full ‚Äòhater‚Äô level. His points/opinion hold no weight anymore.
The comments are so funny, proving Fantano right while saying he&#39;s wrong.
will review murderers rapping about murdering but god forbid kanye talk about some conspiracy theories
This is a totally understandable reaction. Problem is, the album ain‚Äôt that bad ü´† it‚Äôs hard to not listen to it cuz the good ones are really good
Inconsistent moral laws üòÇ
and I thought fantano is a person who can review music on its own :D
why even bother making this video if you are not even going to review the album. What is the point of this video?
Melon forgot the fourth type of Kanye fans : Carti fans (ik it&#39;s a mix between type 2 and 3 but you get it)
The brain rot is real in these comments.
Bro do your job as a music reviewer and review ye‚Äôs music not his politics
What is this guy yapping bout fam alright bro ur the most righteous one here‚Äôs your üç™.
Fantano is a huge loser‚Ä¶trying his hardest to pretend to not like the album because he trying to do a moral dance to not catch backlash. What an absolute puss.
at this point, i think im done coming to fantano for kanye related reviews.<br><br>I agree wholeheartedly that the songs with antisemitic rhetoric on this album are unlistenable for that reason, but Im not going to pretend i hate the production or singing on the other tracks just to feel like im doing the right thing from a moral standpoint.<br><br>This album has MUSIC on it, not every song is antisemitic garbage, and not every kanye fan is crazy. <br><br>If you don&#39;t want to recommend the album to people because of the dumb bigotry on it, just say that. Thats valid. <br><br>But save yourself some time and don&#39;t make a review video on something you clearly had no intentions of giving a chance.
7 minute yap session
I can‚Äôt help but feel like not reviewing his album is just letting him win. It only differentiates him from the other artists and just gives him the reaction he‚Äôd want from a music critic.
the tone-deafness of the people commenting &#39;i bet he loved burn though&#39; astounds me LOL
Sooo like a 4?
Na as a music critic, you need to be able to separate the man and the music
BASED FANTANO
You&#39;re biased.
Weirdo review man is triggered
This is happening in real time. Bro just reviewed 2/16 songs and told us why he don‚Äôt like Ye for 6 minutes‚Ä¶..
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt hate Kanye‚Äù Proceeds to refuse to review his album for no reason
Nathony Zitano here
How am I supposed to take a music reviewer seriously if he is THAT biased üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠‚ÅâÔ∏è‚ÅâÔ∏è‚ÅâÔ∏è
Kanyes lyrics on king wasn‚Äôt him being proud of the labels, he was just addressing them and his destruction of cancellation culture
I think you spend too much time on twitter
This dudes face screams music üòÇ
Trying to call atention, ok
why the hell is his &quot;antisemitic doings&quot; affects his music? man just review the album and not him as a person........
The frank ocean pfp commenter is exactly why kanye fans are so corny lmao
I like how you review music and just yapped 7 minutes straight about Ye<br>Shut up melon man
Bro i really appreciated your input as a music reviewer cause you always had a fair approach to every album. Wtf is this? ü§®
Fair enough if you want to not cover the album, but covering it in such a disingenuous way makes it hard to place any value in your opinion on it.<br><br>I&#39;ll continue to watch your other reviews but I think it&#39;d be better (even for your mental health) if you avoided albums like this.
To think of all the great rappers we&#39;ve lost in the last 10 years. Yet no marks like Kanye is still walking about lol what an injustice!
Your points were 100% valid until you started reviewing only the things you didn‚Äôt like. At least keep the same energy or make the full review. This is not your best look and it‚Äôs coming from a fan of yours.
GO GO GO GO
lol wtf Im jewish and the album was lit to some extent
Get your popcorn fellas
All my heroes are cornballs, so disappointed in peggy on this
Just fucking review it, I dont want your political take
&quot;Unreviewable&quot; proceeds to review the album
I hate js but i hate kanye 2 the devil controls him
Thank you, Anthony. &lt;3<br>You&#39;re doing important work!
Shut up nerd
invalid opinion 1
<b>ex-wife he mercilessly harassed</b> It‚Äôs insanity that after over a decade of supporting this guys channel he‚Äôs now painting narratives when he knows only what he sees on Ye‚Äôs Instagram posts. You do not know this man‚Äôs life. You know his music. Review his music. You‚Äôre not inside this man‚Äôs phone, you do not know what Kim or any member of the Kardashian family has said or done to Ye. Drop that solid 8 and keep it pushing.
I hate this man.
Bro barely even talked about the music. He just got offended lmao. Ye the goat
It&#39;s crazy how so many people seem to not gaf about any of the things he has said in the last couple of years the moment he drops an album. Like Kanye is always gonna be a musical genius but at the same time it&#39;s gone too far. there should be nuance and a longer attention span. BUt yes all the weirdos too and parasocial weirdos. :/
Bros oppinion so bad his hair started separating
Kanye is the only artist now days he makes appreciate music
What&#39;s the music like though?
&quot;unreviewable&quot; goes on to do a track by track review. It says a lot about your morals when you use something you supposedly don&#39;t agree with for your own benefit. As if the hypocrisy of reviewing all kinds of artists who talk about and actually do kill each other, abuse women, sleep with minors etc, but not this.
Why even make this video. Your opinion is completely valid but you come across as deluded and brattish because you make points that in other Kanye videos you praise? The mix is bad the lyrics are bad but it‚Äôs meant to be a dance, club and r&amp;b album so that‚Äôs why it sounds like that  üòÇ
This is the clear example of how many people start to hate famous people when they fall to the mentally bottom publicly (thanks for the social media)
I miss the old Kanye
I think it‚Äôs a fantastic album and definitely worth the listen
if dude didnt make good music you wouldnt care so much about what he has to say
I defended Kanye for some time cuz I thought he just wanted to get rid of all his deals just like it happened with adidas but I stopped after seeing what he is up to for the last months. I know that he said he hates the powerful jewish families but the problem is that he doesn&#39;t higlight it. I still think that there is something different coming since the only people that didn&#39;t want to help kanye were the ones he didn&#39;t work with personally but for example jpeg changed his mind completely after meeting with him so there is still hope
just review the music broüò≠
Fantano hate Kanye a bit too much
I&#39;m not gonna review this...<br>Proceeds to review it.<br><br>eh... 10/10
Wow, I always thought that Melon was a professional and could leave his political views aside (which he does for other artists) but it‚Äôs the first time since I‚Äôve started watching him (since around 2016 I think) that I am genuinely disappointed in his work.
romanian ass review here
they made this album to be a comeback club banger, I don&#39;t get this take, music is subjective and I don&#39;t get this whole &quot;you listen to Kanye? How dare you, don&#39;t you know he&#39;s a Nazi?, this music trash&quot; thing your going for.
At least he has a wife lmao
youre just asking to get cooked not only on twitter but youtube too  üíÄ
Kanye just dropped his best work since Pablo. Fantano is old and out of touch
Calls it unreviewable and then gives the album a 0 on Album of the year. I get your point, but if you cant seperate the art from the artist then how about you dont review it or give it a score, because you made up your mind about the album once it got announced. And this is coming from someone who didnt even like the album.
Real this album is dogshit
Kanye needs to put an Anthony Fantano UNREVIEWABLE warning sticker on his Vultures albums.
yet you still made a review of it.
Kanye has always been right
Idk I‚Äôm none of those types of Kanye fan. I‚Äôm a fan of his music and hate him as a personü§∑
Even if you try to seperate the artist from the person the lyrics are still horribleüò≠ which is really unfortunate because in terms of music there&#39;s huge potential
Yeah, well, that&#39;s just, like, your opinion, man.
It‚Äôs always white people being offended for someone else lmao
You‚Äôre wrong! This is not an objective review- your personal bias is showing
Seeing people I respect liking this dumpster fire of faeces and I&#39;m crying.
Why everyone mad at fantano... Like listen to shit mid ass album if you want but i think he&#39;s made it pretty clear that A the album sucks in his opinion and B its hard not to think of Kanye&#39;s antisemitism when he&#39;s rapping about it proudly
kanye derangement syndrome üíÄ
What the fuck
‚ÄòThis is unreviewable trash ü§ì‚Äô
if this was called my wife divorced me 1 you‚Äôd love it
wack
If it were titled To Pimp A Vulture, you would‚Äôve said it was reviewable
BOOO THIS MAN!
Vultures is AOTY üî•üî•üî•üî•
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=116">1:56</a> I can&#39;t tell if I&#39;m delusional or you&#39;ve just gotten hate raided by Fuentes&#39; audience for a long time but I remember most Kanye fans being disappointed, sad and angry that their favourite artist became an antisemitic schizo. Everyone I talked to on- and offline struggled to listen to his stuff, even the older material and I remember the r/kanye subreddit turning into a holocaust awareness sub for a while.<br><br>I agree a lot of his antics have left a really bad taste in my mouth and I&#39;ve struggled to get back into his music for a long time but I just can&#39;t help but feel like you&#39;ve got a very specific hate for Kanye. Why is it that you can give normal reviews to albums like Tyler the Creator&#39;s Bastard, R-Kelly&#39;s I admit, Chris Brown&#39;s Heartbreak on a full moon and tons of others without getting this preachy about disavowing the lyrics or actions of the artist. You can just say: &quot;I didn&#39;t like the album, the topics, lyrics and theme&#39;s don&#39;t do enough for me to be able to separate him from all his horrible remarks and associations&quot; and then give a 2 or 3 and most people would&#39;ve probably agreed with that.
there is at least one more type of kanye fan: the nostalgic one, who loves his old stuff and is willing to give him the benefit of the doubt with every new release and just hopes it will be great ‚Äî even though he hates what kanye says and does
This album was low key disturbing
You always write that ‚Äúeverything you say is just your opinion‚Äù but deep down you‚Äôre always acting like your words are the objective truth<br>This was a video about Kanye‚Äôs persona and recent years views, you‚Äôre talking about ‚Äúmisogynistic shit‚Äù but that didn‚Äôt stop you from reviewing The Life of Pablo and saying that the Taylor Swift line on Famous was ‚Äúfunny‚Äù to you<br>You choose what you want to be offended by and you‚Äôve been yapping for months about how Kanye has lost his mind with his personal and political views <br>Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and standing by your opinion even if you risk losing 6.5 billion dollars is not something many people would do <br>Just stop yapping about Kanye if you don‚Äôt care about his music anymore because at this point I don‚Äôt think anyone gives a shit about you being offended for 7 minutes straight
Kanye the goat üêêüêêüêê
this album is just so boring and sad. I&#39;m genuinely surprised by how one of the greatest musicians in the whole genre destroyed himself so much. the only thing left from Ye ‚Äì a husk of a real person and an ego size of a jupiter. I still don&#39;t get it how JPEGMAFIA was okay with working with this guy, even if it was one of his biggest influences
Loser
are people still using the argument &quot;separate the music from artist&quot; here in the commentsd? Fantano just said in the video, the MUSIC itself contains those wrong ideas Kanye&#39;s been spilling out so we can&#39;t possible separate from him. How do you proudly listen that type of music in the first place weirdos? it just contaminates and rules out any good shit he could&#39;ve done
&quot;ma pussy ma pussy&quot; - sexxyred
Why make a video at all?
I fw with da album solid 7
This is factually wrong
agree, kanye&#39;s music is getting more and more degraded. only kanye fans just can&#39;t accept it
womp womp
its so over
Nah you&#39;re tripping the Jay and silent Bob chorus is fire, only good part of the album
Kanye He‚Äôs becoming irrelevant ‚Ä¶but you‚Äôre still a dork and all these heavy opinionated platforms are becoming BS WHY ARE YOU EVEN GIVING KANYE SHINE ? YE WASHED ‚Ä¶LET HIM FADE ! You‚Äôre upset cause he‚Äôs talking about jews . STOP COVERING KANYE ! BUT YALL ARE JUST AS THIRSTY AS THESE CORNY RAPPERS .
I fully understand your stance and I don‚Äôt even disagree, but why didn‚Äôt you just say all this in a separate video and then make an ACTUAL review of the musical content? This is superfluous.
not a 0? W
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs give sexy redd an 8 &amp; shit on the best record in a minute.‚Äù You‚Äôve officially lost every single bit of credibility you‚Äôve ever had.
Melon is clearly afraid of reviewing Ye ... its career suicide. That&#39;s why he will never be great. Deep down he is a chicken üêî and a Jew
It&#39;s okay bro, listen to coochie rap, we get it, Kanye bad. In my opinion you shouldn&#39;t give bad people like him a platform, but hey get the bag tony. Your platform is more suited for feminist rappers who inspire all the young women in the world with their coochie !! YOU LOOK LIKE A PIECE OF HALLELUJAH.
Holy shit. Someone broke theneedledrop. The record player needs a new needle.<br><br>(Yes I know tnd is the name of the show. Just go with it for the sake of a bad joke)
As a diehard Ye fan i am glad you listened to Vultures and i love you. Ignore the hate and keep doing what you love to do.
the jews got to him
thought this was a album review what are you yapping about
mal wieder ein affe der keine kunst versteht und seine kritik nur √ºber ideologische themen und unangebrachte statements begr√ºnden einfach idiotisch. Vorallem wenn man wei√ü das keine psychische st√∂rungen hat
Fantano has never been the same ever since that fader article
im sure if SexyyRed was on it you&#39;d give it a 10
BRO&#39;S A CERTIFIED HATER üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Loser
I thought you review albums?  You‚Äôve turned into the next pitch fork
how are you a vegan and still fat
I think this means that MBDTF is a 10 now
So this is &quot;unreviewable&quot; but other controversial artist like X or 6ix9ine were fine at the time, despite the allegations AND court documents? Don&#39;t really get why this crosses the line. Not saying it isn&#39;t disgusting what Kanye has done and the culture he has provoked, it clearly is far beyond what is ok, but why does this cross the line? I feel like this is more something to get &quot;social points&quot;, since you easily could&#39;ve adressed this in a community post / tweet: &quot;Guys not doing the new Kanye abum, I think you know why&quot;.
Bro has officially lost the plot
In my opinion the thing that upsets him most, is that he expected Ye to fail, but sadly for him, he didn&#39;t. He cannot review the music, because he know that he put out a good album. Not the best of his discography, the lyrics aren&#39;t in any way shape of form deep/good, but it is a fun listen and the beats itself are mostly fire. I don&#39;t understand how much someone has to be attached to a certain  perspective, that they cannot see things objectively or accept something that contradicts said perspective.
L Melon y u mad Y u programmed
wah wah wah, stfu and review the album. Your job is to review music not review people
Dude can‚Äôt separate the artist from the music but was a punk rocker in high school bumping burzum back when he thought he was different.  Hypocrisy, biast, and political messaging in this review rather then just talking about music
Being a kanye fan is one of the most harshest experience in my life tbhüò≠üò≠üò≠
Guys and Gals ü•Åü•Åü•Åü•Åü•Å I think we&#39;re entering a new era of needledrop ratings: &#39;the mysterious beyond of a zero review&#39; üòÖ perhaps fantano might make a new negative rating system - it&#39;s an exciting time to be alive ü§ì
To this day, I don&#39;t know how you can enjoy listening to death grips. That&#39;s not to say that Kanyes new album is good, but it isn&#39;t worse than that experimental trashcan clanging
If this album was ‚Äòto pimp a vulture‚Äô you‚Äôd give it a 10
You have officially lost it
I don&#39;t really agree with the &#39;three types of Kanye fans&#39; personally I love his music  and i wish he would stop being a racist/antisemitic  attention seeking child.
You‚Äôve turned so lame and out of touch it‚Äôs not even funny
This isn‚Äôt freedom
The History.
Bro didn&#39;t even review the album. He just spent the video speaking about kanye&#39;s problems
Jew?
Thank you for standing for the right thing with your review.
I thought it was pretty good, I can understand ppl not liking it but this is next level. I mean you were probably gonna call it trash anyway regardless of the actual quality of the music
If this album was called &quot;To Pimp a Forever Story College Dropout Ok Computer Kid A Abbey Road Minecraft&quot; he&#39;d give it a 10/10 lets be honest ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
If it was called To Pimp A Vulture it would have gotten a 10
I love this, not the record but your morals
Me crying after I have to remove all Kanye songs from my playlist that were made after 2021:<br>(Kanye, please, don‚Äôt do this)
melon fell off
at this point you‚Äôre not even a music reviewer, you‚Äôre reviewing artists‚Äôs political opinions
NEWS FLASH there are a lot more rappers that share kanyes views on albums he has given 8s and 10s just saying
Album is fucking fireeeeee
the moral grandstanding is unbelievably inconsistent and cringe lmao
Someone help me out. The &quot;reference&quot; thing is going over my head.
can‚Äôt say i agree with the melon on this one when he literally reviews rappers who have killed peoples albums no problem. i can‚Äôt agree with someone who doesn‚Äôt even adhere to the own ‚Äúmorals‚Äù assuming this isn‚Äôt just a play at appealing to the left. for the record, i am a raging liberal and i didn‚Äôt even like the album that much.
How is Kanye still getting booked ANYWHERE!? Is it under an alias? I understand that some clubs and venues will still see booking him as a mountain of cash. But wouldn‚Äôt they get crazy backlash after that? That can‚Äôt be worth it. If I‚Äôm a touring musician I don‚Äôt want to play at the spot Kanye did. As a fan I don‚Äôt want to give those places my money. If I were the owner, I wouldn‚Äôt want Ye there because I‚Äôm ideologically opposed to what he now stands for, and if I wasn‚Äôt I‚Äôd still be afraid of the hate I might get. I don‚Äôt really follow Kanye close but there has to be places out there that have refused to have him preform or be part of an event. Just‚Ä¶ ugh ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Fantano are you okay? You‚Äôre like actually going insane over this minuscule thing.
I agree with this sadly - a really disappointed Kanye fan
Kanye is a true genius. smh convinced right wing nuts to listen to his music and now is punishing them with terrible unlistenable shit.
bro chill out its corny
Shit review I don‚Äôt give a fuck what he is doing in real life <br>I just rate hit creativity and music
Quit Yapping and talk about music what the heeellll
Did you get your pat on the head and a good boy medal?
Man I feel sorry for Bianca.<br><br>Also these comments are smooth-brain af.
Thank you Anthony....well said.
Thank you this is how I feel
See you guys in 5 years for the rereview
Love you Fantano, this was so fucking needed.
just review the music blud nobody wants to see your corny hater video
This guy reviewed Burzum, let that sink in.
Can&#39;t wait for the redux version to get an upgrade to NOT GOOD!
this mf a hater fr fr
You have reviewed the work of murderers that talk about murder in their music but a mentally ill man‚Äôs shitty fringe histrionic political views are too much lol what a spineless coward
Dehumanising women?  In hip hop?<br><br>I don&#39;t believe it.
i am excited for the future of the &quot;unreviewable n&quot; series
Ye living rent free in this guys head
Where&#39;s your wife lil bro?
I do agree with a lot he said as most of these are facts but first of all yeah some songs arent great but the album has very very great songs and secondly kanye isnt the worst person he reviwed so far so why do you despise him so much all of a sudden ? (the reference line is no near worst than a future line üíÄ)
Thank you for the position. nazis like Kanye mustn‚Äôt be tolerated. Lyrics are shit. Instrumentals aren‚Äôt too good either. Music and art overall cannot exist in a vacuum separate from societal life.
Internet&#39;s busiest crybaby
Great work. You did what needed to be done.
Yeah the whole discography of sexy red is better than this
this is embarrassing lol you‚Äôre a music reviewer not an activist
you sir are nothing, you don&#39;t create things you only label other things this video costed you noting yet you demand respect, I feel sorry for you
Who asked or forced you to review? If you don‚Äôt like it so much why even waste your time. So much contradiction in your actions vs opinions.
Keep in mind this review got a more contextual background than MGK‚Äôs album. So there‚Äôs that lol
This the type of guy that would have been appalled Elvis was shaking his knees back in the day lol üòÇ
Separating art from artist is only ever used as an excuse to listen to shitty people, but really it means not taking the context of the person into account when listening to the music.
Fantano top 10 yappers of all time
Im Jewish. I like this album. Saying someone is crazy to like some songs, or saying it‚Äôs impossible to separate the art from the artist isn‚Äôt fair towards those who actually like this music. Calling people who like his music ‚Äúcult members‚Äù or saying they have ‚Äúmeaningless lives‚Äù, especially when you‚Äôre referring to ten of millions of people, just says a lot about you. I am allowed to like a song.
im surprised burn and carnival dont at least bump it up to a 2
He‚Äôs all about heat and you seem well heated up ü§î
actual dork lmao
&quot;Im unable to separate art from artist because its fashionable currently&quot;
Be quiet lil bro
there&#39;s a 4th kanye fan that Anthony didn&#39;t mention: young suburban youth who have no frame of reference for hip hop outside of the biggest movers and shakers, and enabling millenials. the prospect of nostalgia is more important to them than the art or the artist. they don&#39;t keep up with his new stuff, and they don&#39;t care, it&#39;s all about feel good hits and karaoke sing-a-longs. the idea of removing a handful of tracks from their playlists is more disturbing to them than what he has said and done.
melonhead must appease his handlers.
Fantano reviewing albums from people who beat up others, k1ll, bvrn down churches, are sex off3nders:<br>&quot;Thats fine üëç&quot;<br><br>Fantano reviewing album from someone who says controversial things:<br>&quot;How could he? üòÆ Thats unreviewable üò†&quot;
What is wrong with This man
I think people should stop watching this type of videos where a (music GURU) gives his opinion, and that somehow should be affecting your own judgment. If you love the music, then don&#39;t look for someone to confirm that your love is on point or not. Just enjoy it, that&#39;s it.
bro i be like waiting anthony to drop a exact number on Vultures then is fcking unreviewable
Dude, I&#39;m only here for the music, and it is üî•üòÇ, the production is pure quality
bruh u either review it or not, don&#39;t claim ur not gonna then do it... just slimy behavior my guy
this guy has any credibility?
fantano gitte get off youtube. his opinion doesn‚Äôt matter
Damn bro why u attacking usü§£
He salty
I‚Äôll listen to Lil Pump 2, thanks Anthony
What if Kendrick made it? üëÄ
If this album would has been released by literally anyone besides kanye you would atleast have given it a score
Drake should of been on every song and they should make a song called kissing men
you forgot &quot;4. I&#39;m coping, He made Graduation&quot;
Blud is a 40 year old man having a full mental breakdown over a good album, if you didn&#39;t like it you don&#39;t like, quit feeding your hexagon glass wearing delinquents poison that this is a bad album, chill out Unc.
Coward
I hate to join the hate mob because frankly I mostly don&#39;t agree with them either, I don&#39;t even like this album very much, but Fantano sounds genuinely unhinged in places here. Since when is he so concerned with &quot;convincing people&quot; that he makes a clown out of himself instead of merely reviewing the music?
But carnival was still dope
Melon would give it a 10 if the album was called Scaring the Jews
This album as a whole was sadly trash. North had the best song hands down
So out to lunch. If you poorly review the album you get 20x the views
I love you Anthony.
anthony doesn&#39;t care about black people
respect
nah L take
He has lost it
Im a fourth type of fan. Music good guy deludedüëç
like stick to your words and dont make videos about him no more but free views so stfu and just stop making vids about him
If Ye called it &quot;To pimp a vulture&quot; it&#39;d be a 10.
Album is mid at best but &quot;Stars&quot; is one of Ye&#39;s best openers ever.
God you&#39;re insufferable.
Ok, now give us the real review
As an empath, i get the feeling he doesnt like the album
Carti on Carnival &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; melon existence
Soyboy üòÖ<br>Stop cry and do your job. Leave your emotions at the door before your next review. So unprofessional.
TBH I‚Äôm surprised we even got this. I‚Äôm still laughing at comparing this album to a dumpster fire
Not very rare fantano L. Who agree?
This has solidified in my mind Fantano is a clown. You&#39;ve reviewed more despicable people music, but won&#39;t review Kanye because of the &#39;Jews&#39;. Absolute joke.
Carnival though? With that Hell of a Life riff?
This dude needs to get off twitter and stop checking YouTube comments. <br><br>It wasn‚Äôt an amazingly mind blowing album but it wasn‚Äôt complete trash either. Not even Kanye West is an anti-semi or blindly agree with everything Kanye West does. Kanye is very cuz for every crazy and wrong thing he does he also does something good. Look at how much his daughter loves him over Kim.
This Ty Dolla $ign album featuring Josef Mengele is a solid 3 in my book
4th type of fan here. just here for the vibes and I thought the vibes were fun sometimes angry but also triumph. sing along to the album in full blast it feels good.
To Pimp A Vulture.... 10/10 - Fantano probably
Oubobubu oboupbobu
dude can‚Äôt even listen to music he‚Äôs so brainwashed by media
I get this stance on the music but as a music critic i think you shouldnt get so caught up with the bad feelings you have about the fanbase because that isnt the music. Also this moral highground is kinda wierd like death grips for example have some songs that are rapey asf (bottomless pit) or a song about choking someone out (two heavens). Dont get me wrong i love death grips but thats just art, sometimes its provocatory but honestly i dont want stale art which doesnt challenge me in any way. And im not antisemetic its just i want artists to fully express themselves and not to be given a unreviewable. Like thats just unproffesional as a reviewer.
I didn&#39;t even know there was a new Kanye album until I saw this. I listened to it and I really enjoyed it. Thank you Anthony!
Mad cus Jew üíÄ pathetic
This is crazy edginess from Fantano, we get it dude Kanyes a jerk but this isn‚Äôt half as bad as you‚Äôre acting, you‚Äôve reviewed and given scores to much worse
just here to remind you that he is sitting on a chair while filming this vid
I dont even like kanye or the album, cause he&#39;s def an idiot but to actually think hes anti semetic is crazy. Despite his wild antics, celebrities have to do things like that to retain theyre fame. But when it comes to straight anti black lyrics like majority of other artists you never have anything to say. Youre not a real jew, youre more of a zionist.
Then don&#39;t review it. You can&#39;t stop supporting Nazis can you? You want to, but you just can&#39;t help but make money off the back of him. Stop. Talking. About. Kanye.
This why your wife left you üíÄüíÄüíÄ
Bro lost his mind after sexy red album review
Just watch the review of the NFR guys and read the comments there‚Ä¶ it‚Äòs embarassing
If its unreviewable then don&#39;t post a video of it! Why give time to something you disagree with? Is it just to virtue signal? I will never understand some of these people.
Fantano being the great moral being that he is REFUSES to review Ye‚Äôs new album in solidarity with Jews over Ye‚Äôs numerous comments against them.<br><br>However, what he failed to mention was that he was silent after Jews were slaughtered on October 7th. In fact the only comments he‚Äôs made since the attack have been against Israel‚Äôs response. Bashing the evil zionists as committing a genocide.<br><br>I find it fascinating that Fantano can find the courage to defend Jews against Ye and profit off this virtue signaling but when it comes to real world violence against Jews, he, in many ways, enables it. <br><br>Never change Anthony. ü´∂üèª
If it was called TPAB then it would be reviewable
It‚Äôs obviously not just Kanye fans listening, as it‚Äôs number one in the WORLD. not just the USA. And to think he‚Äôd say Back to me is cheesy and awful, but Boys a Liar pt. 2 is good is nutso
The 3 fans stereotypes is so wrong, can‚Äôt someone just like his music and someone who grew up with him?
Didn&#39;t JPEGMAFIA produce like 5 songs on this album. He didn&#39;t give it a 0 NOT GOOD cause peggy was on it
I aint gonna lie this album wasn&#39;t it but it still deserves a review ....this only shows that Anthony is becoming more and more biased ...from giving an &quot;artist&quot; such as sexy red who made a degenarate album an 8 to constantly hating on ye....i mean this channel reviews music not personalities....what he says shouldn&#39;t stop you from reviewing the music unbiased....if an artist talked shit or mocked chrisatians you&#39;d still review thier shit but now that its jews you wanna act like its the end of the world and be a hero to your very few jewish fans by protecting them from a music review...wtf
üëèüëèüëè
So the antisemitism made his music gone to shit lol okokok
Fantano would rather listen to the sexyy red album <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/oPgfY_DoKfSXkNAPq8-AgAo"></a>
good vultures maas vulture and you wouldve given it a 12
Even with ‚Äúseparating the artist from the art,‚Äù the album‚Äôs still ass
i‚Äôm not sure but GOOD (DONT DIE) is a great track, with ‚Äúnormal‚Äù lyrics and production/sample wise is amazing
I&#39;m not gonna hold you, I thought this was some of Kanye&#39;s best production in years. That alone warrants it at least a 4 but since we&#39;re basing albums off of individuals and their perspectives now.. I guess that&#39;s we&#39;re doing then
Those songs are mostly ass. Kanye sounds like its his first time using loony tunes.
I found this project to be very meandering.
if kendrick made the album he would‚Äòve given it a strong 8
Good way to handle this album imo! Great non-review
oh kanye how far have you fallen
&quot;Unreviewable&quot; Kayne wins
Disgusting review
I can‚Äôt stand fantano in this video
I feel this response is a bit over the top, I do think a good chunk of the songs are unfinished  but there&#39;s still some ideas here and there, some worked someday definitely didn&#39;t work. That could all be talked about and could still be considered a review
Being a critic is really simple, you have to separate the piece of work from the person that did it. <br>If you don‚Äôt want to review something because your criticism can be corrupted by you not liking the artist, you simply don‚Äôt review it.<br><br>I would‚Äôve maybe respected you more for not posting or streaming about this album but obviously you want to get paid with minimum effort.<br><br>People come here for reviews on music and not to hear that you dislike someone politics or ideology. <br>Since when we give soo much attention to someone that is bipolar disorder?<br><br>Good job on your fantastic job as a ‚Äúcritic‚Äù.
You so pressed lol
Memes aside, this is one of the most stupidly biased reviews you have ever done, your job as a music critic is to put controversy aside and speak about the music without letting the artists political opinion get in the way of your opinion, that rant you did on twitter should haunt you for a while and make you realise how much of a karen you were, i did not enjoy the album as well, but that doesnt mean i have to cry about it lol.
Hot take: I don&#39;t really care about either the album, or Kanye&#39;s controversy. I&#39;m just here to enjoy Fantano pretending to be mad about this.<br><br>This is melon&#39;s best character since Cal, maybe even better ... cause he&#39;s been method acting since that Fader article. 10/10 effort.
You seem very against Kanye. Keep that same energy when anyone says anything about black people. Or do you only care about one group over all others? Just review the music man, we don‚Äôt care what you think of these artists personally.
i mean in comparison to Donda, this album is ass trash dooky
I NEED THE BRITTANY HOWARD REVIEWüò´
You just hate Kanye
Unreviewable (while recoding a review video) üóøüóøüóø
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=423">7:03</a> Of Yapping Pt.1
Has nothing to do with the album. Garbage opinion and garbage video.
I have not listened to this album.<br><br>The objective of a review, any review, is to give the viewer a general idea of the objective quality of whatever may be the subject of the review. If you were to review a car, it&#39;s not to make people think about why they like or dislike the car, and it&#39;s not to bring awareness to a car you believe more people should drive. That is not a review, that&#39;s a soapbox, a blog post. You have a fundamental misunderstanding of what a review or reviewer should be.<br><br>To review an album poorly because you fundamentally disagree with the political beliefs of the artist, because you want people to reconsider why they like it, or because you want to reduce the amount of potential listeners the album may have, is shallow and manipulative. It indicates a deep seated bias and hatred towards the subject matter and calls into question your ability to impartially review anything. If you know for a fact you wouldn&#39;t be able to properly review something, it would do you far better to simply not review it.<br><br>With this video you have essentially admitted that your review process is based entirely around the popularity you believe something deserves. When something is too popular, you rate it poorly. When something isn&#39;t popular enough, you rate it highly. It has nothing to do with the objective quality of the art, and instead what you believe does and doesn&#39;t deserve a platform. That means you&#39;re not a reviewer, you&#39;re a complainer. You complain when people like something, you complain when people don&#39;t like something.
Virtue signaling is a hell of a drug.
Haven&#39;t seen a sadder review. Looks like you liked the album but couldn&#39;t say it üòÇ
I agree when you say it feels like a more finished donda 2 there&#39;s songs I like on it but completely agree ye is trash basically thru the whole thing ty is okay I guess then the fts are the only parts I feel like give me a reason to listen compared to every other ye album this dosent follow a theme or narrative it just feels like a bunch of sad attempts at songs to play at a club
If he thought the album was bad he would review it ü§≠
Eminem and Kanye both are trash but Fantano is a true artist
valid üëçüëçüëç
Kanye broke this fellow hahah, look at the eyebags hahaha this is so funny
seperate art from artist
yap
Kanye should be honored to be the first person to get a unreviewable video by Fantano
Fantano is angry
Speaking of vultures how have you been Anthony?
You a fucking hater üíÄ
aside from the terrible music; its kind of interresting to see his mental state in every album, where it started of all ambitious and kind of uplifting with Graduation etc, anger with Yeezus, redemption with Life of Pablo, then the bipolar shit and then a new sort of redemption with Jesus is King, now hes in the gutter again mentally and this album is a display visually and lyricly of how hes basicly cast out of society
4 songs actually hit the rest aint worth revisiting. Second worst album he ever dropped.
what
bro heard carti go a little out of pocket with his flow (nothing crazier than almost any kanye song) and immediately shut it off üíÄüíÄ complete clown that was 100% personal no critic whatsoever
Skip to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=305">5:05</a> to hear about the music
okay, i wouldve been happy with a 10, i wouldve been happy with a 0 hell i wouldve been happy with a not good. but i disagree on the reasoning here. i think would be understandable  to make the &quot;you cant separate the art from the artist&quot; argument if the albums CORE was just about promoting antisemitism, but i feel like the album at its core is many things... but at the center of it all ye is doing what he does best... making an album about himself (whether intentionally or not) and some of that may be anti semitism... but boiling down an entire person (in this case album) to a small fraction of their ideas i feel is criminal and harmful. <br>.<br>i know i couldve maybe worded that better and more concise but thats just harmful
Number 1 in 103 different countries but yeah only ‚Äúcult Kanye fans care about it‚Äù
you would‚Äôve rated it 10/10 if the name was: sexy vultures
ALL YAP NO REVIEW
morality police ü§° (when he wants)
OMG thank youüò≠ you are the first person since the beginning of 2023 who called Kanye out on his crap who ive seen. Its so crazy that people find it funny that he cant be cancelled but its just so sad. Thank you for reminding usüôèüôè
I hated this album despite being a huge Ye fan and liking his comments about Jewish people. Melon letting the Ye fans troll him into oblivion. You are a music reviewer, review the music, do your job you bum lmao. Why are you yapping so much about irrelevant shit. You look tired.
This is so brave of you Anthony üôè
I wonder if the new Mark Kozelek record comes out and Fantano does this, because I love this concept.
on god bro I don&#39;t care about allat nazi shit runaway still makes me cry
But Anthony, he made graduation.
You know its funny when people are madder at fantano for not reviewing this album than they are mad at kanye for what he said...
cool, now play off the grid
Such an insightful music review
bro couldn&#39;t even made an album but just trashes, not only on kanye, but on everyone make an album and then you can talk
Kanye ain‚Äôt thinking about your feelings melon boy üòÇ
Bro got famous and became a hollyweirdo. Listen to the music you fanny
Melon is a D1 hater
this is the worst fantano oppinion oat
Anthony, i understand your point of view and complitely agree on kanye behavour out of music. But when i listened to the record i had a pretty good time, yes there are some lows in the record (the chipmunk verseüòÇ) but overall i found it pretty funny and enjoyable. Obviously this is not one of kanye‚Äôs best album, but if you ignore the lyrics and go song for song, as if it was a playlist, result in a musically enjoyable project
BOW BOW BOW‚ÄºÔ∏èTHATS THAT BOOTY MEAT‚ÄºÔ∏èüó£Ô∏èüíØ
f off with that anti semitic BS
You said a whole lot of nothing. You are acting no differently than kayne.
Fix your green screen lil bro
I don&#39;t like Kanye but...Fantano is so desperate for attention and sooo want to have an unique take on shit... Lol He&#39;s literally blasting this all day trust me
Y‚Äôall draw the lines with Jews but except ALL bullshit and mockery said about Black people and Christianity. <br><br>Selective outrage
i just like the sound of the music bro chillüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
You&#39;re pathetic
Young Thug album was not &quot;unreviewable&quot; even though he literarily killed people
You sound butt hurt ..
It really sucks. I was a huge Kanye fan and I listened to every album and almost memorized all of his songs. But I‚Äôm Jewish and I haven‚Äôt listened to him since he went Nazi. I‚Äôm sad cus he was one of my favorite artists and now I get upset whenever I hear one of his songs in a resteraunt or at a party.
What kind of satire is this?
BROO Melon. can we just talk the music
Aye y u say that about his fans man, I‚Äôm not either of those things I just like his music
Hilarious
Kanye has never said anything antisemetic
I love you
Bro how could you score the album so low? you really need to sort your ego out because there&#39;s no recovering from this
Don&#39;t forget that fantano loves burzum and defended his review and enjoyment of it , giving a racist a 6/10 but a black man&#39;s music is unreviewable lmao ok, racist melon at it again
Fantano is a naziüò°üò°üò°
dude there isn&#39;t only 3 types of Kanye fans lol. what about people who think the things he&#39;s saying are horrible and unacceptable but on a music level consider him to be the best artist in the world? like holy shit this is a pathetic video. review the album like any other album and grow a dick.
Just because Ye didn&#39;t name the album Untitled Unmastered doest mean you give it unreviewable.
But if he called it to pimp a vulture‚Ä¶
baldy baldy ova there whats it like 2 have no hair is it hot or is it cold idk cos im not bald HA
Lefty
i wanna see u make a song lil baldy
i dislikje you
this is very rich coming from you,
i disliked
Aah true I forgot he reviews people, not music
fantano tries to review an album not based on the artist&#39;s controversies challenge (impossible)
I miss the days of Forever.
Just unalive yourself atp fam if u this unhappy üò≠
so you‚Äôre not going to review the album?
I didn&#39;t even know a new project was coming out. Makes me question if you should have called attention to it at all ü§î
What if Kanye becomes Malcom X within the next 3 years
Im still trying to figure out why Ty Dolla $ign is facing the wall
Jesus, thank god I‚Äôm not living in USA, wokeness and retardation only around there.
Needle drop dude a culture vulture always has been
Fantano got reverse-buckbroken
–µ–≥–æ –±–æ—Ä—å–±–∞
fantano when kanye said something about jewish people: üò°üò°üò°üò°<br><br>fantano when every rapper to ever exist is homophobic and says homophobic things in their songs: üßë‚Äçü¶Øüßèüßëüèª‚Äçü¶≤
cant take any of this kid&#39;s reviews seriously he&#39;s a total fraud
I just think the power went to Kanye‚Äôs head, he talks about how he is the king and Jesus because he‚Äôs just not able to be canceled. I think he also just keeps pushing the boundaries on how far he‚Äôs able to go with his actions. And I think he generally gets enjoyment out of pissing off all the media. It‚Äôs just how far of the boundaries will he go
You‚Äôre a racist Anthony
Yeah, Anthony, and Sexyy Red got top-10 album of the year, yeaaah, we got you <br><br>Can‚Äôt focus on reviewing but focusing on how his wife is half naked and his ‚Äúantisemitism‚Äù, yeeeaaah
Shame he used to be one of few objective reviewers and ended up like this eh
Fantano is a sheep
I do not care about what kayne says or does you fucking sperg, is the song good or not?
Kanye needs to stop pretending like Ty Dolla Sign is Kid Cudi
Why even make this video?
I think way too many people are coming into this way too emotionally invested, including you anthony. I quite liked the album, but it&#39;s not incredible. I showed it to my girlfriend who listens to very different music and who doesn&#39;t know too much about Kanye, and she liked a lot of the songs on it as well. So I guess I just don&#39;t see your view here that everyone possibly enjoying this record must be some big Kanye fan that praises everything he makes because the album is just so terrible. This album is not worthy of all these strong opinions. It isn&#39;t horrible and it isn&#39;t amazing.
you can tell this guy is salty about losing his wife, no review just a soyboy yapping for 7 mins, once again the melon shows us he has no clue about anything related to music and just wants engagement, do yourself a favor and block or unsubscribe
This guy is so sensitive lmao. I&#39;m ethnically Jewish and I could really give less of a fuck what Kanye West of all people thinks about Jews. He apologized and the album is at least a solid 7
Ladies and gentlemen, the busiest music nerd gets offended by music
He should never of put this out
Trash trash trash album <br><br>He just simply dosent care any more producing these fast boring ass albums. <br><br>Give us a project he really cares about go to Africa again and tap in and be at peace.
You didnt even like kanye back before he went off the rails, youre just gleefully hating him and blaming the current stuff when you always hated him, weak
Wait... a MUSIC REVIEW with absolutely NO musical or artistic analysis present beyond parody?<br>This is NOT the channel it once was for sure...
YOU SICK ASF FOR TALKIN BAD ABOUT HIS WIFE GANGY
As far as TND sparked my interest in music for which I am forever grateful for, I can&#39;t agree with your take on this. I understand that all of this is just &quot;Your opinion, right?&quot; which I respect and you are entitled to it, I&#39;m just worried with how preachy it has gotten. I have distanced myself from the /mu/ shitposting cesspit and overall music and my taste has pretty much solidified with some new instances popping through (mainly thanks to your channel, so once again thank you) and I very much respect your opinion as a music critic and still hold you in high regard as one of the most influential content creators on the planet. <br>That being said, in the recent years, mainly through your twitter, I have begun to feel some sense of distaste whenever viewing your posts, I&#39;m not one to dump people over their worldviews if what they offer is of significance to me or the world and I see their motivations as at least somewhat pure, but I have had to wonder a few times if you haven&#39;t lost a bit of humbleness and are allowing yourself a the same type of ego trip that Kanye has visibly been having for the last 20 years. It&#39;s weird, but I used to percieve you and the way you carried yourself as more of a humble, no-opinions guy who just cares about music and shows his personal opinions and views only scarcely, mostly not relating it to the review and using them as a fuel for humor. God I loved your vegan smoothie videos, they were amazing. The whole fantano channel. <br>I understand that Kanye has been under some heavy commercial fire and his whole brand of being a contrarian is kinda fucking him over right now, but I don&#39;t necessarily see how he is any worse than Alexis Marshall or Varg Vikernes, on an artistic level at least. They all are human being with a very complicated and oftentimes questionable personal life that have produced some really good music and you gave them a fair review. I understand that retroactively taking down your videos is probably a bad idea so maybe the idea of taking down the vids is there and it just isn&#39;t a viable option and now you feel that you &quot;know better&quot; and are actually voicing your opinion on this Kanye record. Are you sure that this sort of reaction isn&#39;t just a little more motivated by the sociopolitical/drama situation surrounding Kanye and maybe a bit of your opinion? Even if so, it&#39;s your right to do so, I just find it kind of meh. If that is the case, I  wonder if you stepping away from the musical/artistic side of the project as the main mover of the review and using some sort of unrelated/personal reason for rating it the way you do isn&#39;t something that a person like Kanye (or at least the way the media portray him to be) do. Unless the music is really as bad as you claim, which I don&#39;t agree with. The instrumental on Hoodrat seemed strange at the beginning but it grew on me, the instrumental on Talking is really nice too, I don&#39;t find the sample on Back To Me bad or grating. I agree that Kanye&#39;s rapping on this record probably isn&#39;t the best and I wouldn&#39;t go as far as to call it &quot;the best Kanye record&quot;, I&#39;m team Yeezus and always will be, but I don&#39;t find it such a hot mess as you are describing it to be. But what do I know, I don&#39;t have a education in music theory and I definitely am not as much of an enthusiast as You or any other fans of the channel are. In hopes that you managed to read, or anyone managed to read this giant wall of text, thank you. I feel that youtube comments are not the best vehicle for long-term discussion but I&#39;&#39;d also feel weird hitting up TND DM&#39;s or writing you an e-mail and for some reason I really felt compelled to comment.
I think he just doesn&#39;t like to be told what to do.. and really leans into that rebellious carelessness as an F you. to that note i also i do think he is mentally unstable
If you really felt that way you would of not even made this video. Just had to grandstand and virtue signal. Kanye isn&#39;t all that but atleast he doesn&#39;t lap up Isreal propaganda
very extreme but understandable and dare i say a good move.
You know what&#39;s strange to me? A lot of these comments say Anthony is being inconsistent for hating on Kanye and not other criminals or other such accused abusers.<br><br>Like, it&#39;s as if just because you are technically able to separate the art from the artist that means you are now forced to. I think you get to draw that line wherever the hell you want, in the same way Anthony does.<br><br>I think it&#39;s fair Anthony draws the line here. Like, first of all, we don&#39;t know if everyone accused is even guilty, but we do know kanye genuinely believes the racism he&#39;s espousing. second of all- listening to music about by someone who actually did heinous shit has way more artistic intrigue to me, than Kanye throwing a meltdown because his wife dated Pete Davidson. <br><br>Kanye&#39;s meltdowns bring very little new to the table, and j genuinely don&#39;t know how anyone with a brain can sit and listen to ‚ÄúI&#39;m Just Here to Get Paid‚Äù and think-‚Äù wow- Kanye is really exploring something real here.‚Äù<br><br>Yeah, I would rather listen to Charles Manson than Kanye, and I would find it weird if you liked and defended Kanye.<br><br>Like, there is a deep and rich darkness to Charles, Ye?<br>Ye sounds like a literal child at this point lol.
‚ò∫
bro really ended this like he just made an apology video by reaching up and turning the camera off
Just begging for attention at this point anthony could just review the album as you normally do or if ur not gonna review it because u dont like kanyes personality outside of music then dont upload. A video about it. This is just embarassing
twitter mascot
Its possible only if you tried to review the album in the first place, instead you reviewed kanye ü§¶<br>Kanye is not the first bad rapper in the world....i don&#39;t see you giving them a head to toe review<br>Net time try to keep the artist separate from the art.<br>This shit is not even close to an art review, more of a documentary on Kanye&#39;s life recently lol
im more interesed in your wife&#39;s opinion on this
ah cala a boca
fantano reviewing other albums: &quot;the synth waves and the drums mixed with the keys and vocal performance...&quot;<br><br>fantono reviewing this album: *skips songs while reacting AND reviewing * &quot;kanye bad and kanye fans bad&quot;
Just review the album, its pretty simple considering this is an album review channel. No one cares about anything you just rambled on about in this video.
How soft. I&#39;m not even a Kanye fan like that but unsubed. Keep eating up that Israel propaganda.
L
I feel like this is a huge hit to Fantano and his credibility as a music critic.<br><br>I admire the strong stance that he&#39;s taking against an incredibly popular artist that has said some incredibly damaging stuff but it&#39;s all to the detriment of his professionalism.<br><br>How can I as a viewer possibly take any of his upcoming reviews seriously? If you come out of this video feeling anything other than super disillusioned with how biased he is then idk what to tell you.<br><br>The ability to handwave a solid album like this just because of the artist involved is beyond me. I care about the music on display and clearly Fantano doesn&#39;t in this case. The discourse has completely melted his brain. <br><br>I rate this video unwatchable.
Bro relax kim Kardashian isn&#39;t gonna let you hit üíÄüíÄ

4. People who can separate art from the artist
There is a lot of misogynist content on the album.  Which is very unlike Ye. Couple of great tracks though.  Not overly impressed with that they did to Chris Brown&#39;s vocal. The original was such a lovely melody.
Heard they were having a Album Listening Party in <b>GAZA</b> to scare off all the colonizers. Maybe Israel will leave Palestinians alone after that- food for thought Anthony-dork-tano.
kanye is my favorite artist to ever walk the earth, but at some point the fans need to realize he isn‚Äôt God. some of the stuff he‚Äôs said has made me question my ability to separate the art from the artist and i respect what you have to say and agree with tons of it. he rly does make it so hard to be a kanye fan üò≠
I‚Äôm so glad that other people hate this album too because I thought I was the only one
Used to be a huge kanye fan but hes lost his mind now. Fuck that guy.
If this was called Melons 1 you would have given it a 10
Thank you for this passionate review
Unreviewable because this album is so mid it puts me to sleep
stunning and brave
Also you should have mentioned how this album literally has a feature of a rapist ( chris brown )
&quot;Separate the art from the artist&quot; definitely doesn&#39;t work for a genre that&#39;s identity driven (i.e. most lyrics are overtly about the artist)
OK I genuinely think that if Kanye West ‚Äòtwas to drop a project better than late registration, mbdtf or the College dropout Anthony Fantano would say it‚Äôs a terrible album and say it‚Äôs a zero out of 10 even if he didn‚Äôt make any anti Semitic references or anything like that. I‚Äôm not saying this because I thought vultures was good. I thought it was quite mid if not worse than mid it‚Äôs just the fact that there is tracks on here that are actually pretty decent and Anthony Fantano just completely says all the half decent tracks are complete garbage and it seems like he‚Äôs doing this out of spite for Kanye‚Äòs anti-Sematism and I get it how do you  review someone that is constantly saying shit that is horrible and using his platform to spread hatred, but if you‚Äôre not going to try then why talk about him at all
None of the three types of Ye fan, but was genuinely looking forward to Melon‚Äôs viewpoints on the music. Seems way too emotionally/politically/morally/ethically (whatever you want to call it)-reserved to give a fair assessment. Nevertheless, I respect Anthony&#39;s right to think, act and feel as he does. Definitely think Ye takes it too far on occasion (today more than ever) but he has made a career of maneuvering close to and often over ‚Äúthe line&quot;. Would be great to see him (Ye) reflect more on this publically and actually acknowledge his mistakes from time to time, but seems unlikely...
Idk, I think this album is totally overhated
Won‚Äôt review an album, because he has a different political review.
Melon actually doing a great service for Kanye with this video. Offending liberal critics is a badge of honor and will only drive more people to the album to see what the fuss is about.
Well we knew a rating like this was coming. Once you hate an artist, you become unbelievably biased
Bald
Back to me is a banger can&#39;t lie.
ahhh melonhead fell off
i love the part where the music reviewer talks about the music
Kanye crashing and burning is funny as fuck luckily i don&#39;t gotta give him money to play an old CD
If you&#39;d actually give a fuck to really research all the &quot;conspiracies&quot; he talks about you&#39;d realize there is truth to some of them. But no you&#39;d rather save your public image. I am not agreeing with everything he says, he says a lot of really crazy shit, but there is truth to a lot of his statements.
What a lovely political review Hassan
We‚Äôve all been waiting for a Kanye review
this man cooked
Melon is such a clown now.
lame ahh
cool, is this video monetized? because if it is you are profiting of all that pain you are talking about
5/10 Album
The üëÉ&#39;s got to him
maybe if it was called to pimp a vulture
The best thing we can do for Kanye, and for the people who are marginalised by his messaging, is denounce and divest. We keep tuning in to find out how deep the hole gets, but we only do it because of what Kanye used to be. Let him shill his crap to those three groups Anthony mentioned, and let the quality go to shit like it has been for years. Eventually he&#39;ll be like any other mediocre artist with whack views.
What you say makes sense but I don&#39;t care too much
you review the music of criminals, murderers, and statutory rapists. but this is where you draw the line lmao
Kanye is so obsessed with the spotlight that he has to hold his total meltdown in the center of it.
I agree that this album is by any standards unreviewable because even by kanye standards this album is very bad kanye doesn&#39;t bring forth any incredible or new sound scapes to the album or is it a very philosophical album or introspective in any ways its just kanye being a crazy person because the world believes he&#39;s a crazy person which he may be with lines like the bill cosby one just not helping his case in anyway but the thing is he&#39;s thrown him self under the bus with his comments and there&#39;s no way out so rather than fixing those problems which he cant now he just shoves him self down more into the ground playing the villain every one wants him to be the anitsemite the racist he&#39;s playing all of the roles even if he does or does not believes in them and so he&#39;s just having fun at the expense of other peoples sanity as people try to rationalize his thoughts and work but you cant cuz its clear as day what he&#39;s saying and implying there&#39;s no way out and so were not gonna get a good project from him cuz he doesn&#39;t care he knows whatever he does will be in the headlines will be talked about will be praised cuz he has the catalog to back him up and the career and so my message to fantano is don&#39;t review the next 2 volumes there&#39;s no point you will only receive hate and negativity we may get some good songs from this but in the end it doesn&#39;t matter so save your sanity fantano and f=dont talk about these projects.
Kanye on Burn: &quot;burned 8 billion to take of my chains&quot;
some part in me wonders how much kanye or his team paid to infiltrate the comment section
Kanye West&#39;s current actions may have influenced his current music...I wonder if anybody is listening to it right now...üê±üê∞
The things people do to get attention
i&#39;ve sure he liked the album but will stand up by his positions because of the anti semitism Kanye episode, the album isn&#39;t that bad, bro just want to paint as horrible by politics reasons and it&#39;s understandable, but i&#39;ve sure that for him it&#39;s a solid 7 at least
the downfall of fantano needs to be studied.
Anthony we wanted your thoughts on the album not on kanye
Why is this mf even relevant, why we watchin some pasty ass mf review rap music
I didn&#39;t expect this üò≠üòÖ
Bro doesnt wanna admit he liked itüò≠üò≠
Always cringe when fantano does virtue signalling... If Abbey Road was pro-hate and anti-semetic then it doesn&#39;t suddenly become a bad album or unreviewable
Fantano has lost it
I want anyone who likes this album to name me an ty dollar sign album
You‚Äôre an actual fraudüòÇ And I don‚Äôt even like that many songs from the album. How can you consistently hate on albums acting like you know what your talking about. This shits like food critics, think they‚Äôre the greatest and try to hate on every single little detail <br>The normal dude who likes rap will like this album, your opinion is so invalid and stupid
üòÖüòÖüòÖKanye been trash for a while
Finally everyone can see clear as day that theneedledrop is a complete idiot
like say whatever about Kanye but his wife is an ADULT woman, he ain‚Äôt a puppet and if she‚Äôs there it‚Äôs cause she wants to. You remind me of Drake when he spoke about your wife too
brother cannot seperate art from the artist. tf he talking about celebrity gossip in a music review channel for
Still Kanye has 66 million monthly listeners on Spotify<br><br>This train is unstoppable essentially
yapping 1
Fontano getting paid bags by the media‚Ä¶
go listen to vultures instead of 7 minutes of utter trash gibbering fantano üòÇ
The head your mom gave me last night was an unreviewable 1
Good on you melon, to paraphrase Jello Biafra:<br> &quot;Nazi stans fuck off!&quot;
This album was soild 8.5/10 few more listens can probably go up to 9
if the album was called ‚ÄúTo Pimp A Vulture‚Äù, you wouldve given it a 10
My brother‚Ä¶ you literally have a patera vinyl. Only bad when black men are anti semetic ??
I‚Äôm the biggest Kanye Stan, this album is trash if any album I have heard. BY FAR
Salty
I do not like this dude at all he&#39;s just hating on every album for no reason
Thank you Anthony.
Talk about the music, not the &quot;InSaNE!!!&quot; conspiracies, which regardless of merit are identical to what you&#39;ve allowed people to say about white people on your channel. I know there&#39;s tofu blockages in your brain preventing you from seeing that. <br><br>Anyway, I heard a new track and it was shit. Like, not even music.
FANTANO WWW
If this album was called &quot;to pimp a vulture&quot; he&#39;d instantly forgive kanye and give the album an 11/10
You keep saying you can‚Äôt separate the art from the artist in every Kanye video, yet you keep posting Kanye videos. If you can‚Äôt review something just don‚Äôt do it. There‚Äôs no need to yap for another 7 minutes about Kanye being unlistenable due to his political views. Then, when I look at the views you are getting from this video, I understand why it‚Äôs so convenient talking about something you don‚Äôt care about. <br>At least give the album a rating, it‚Äôs not good but it‚Äôs far from being a 1.
Seems bizarre to now be unable to enjoy the music, especially when you were happy to give Kanye a 10 after he said &quot;slavery was a choice&quot;. As for the &quot;anti-semitism is in the music&quot;, as far as I&#39;m aware, that&#39;s only three lines in the whole album; don&#39;t understand how that ruins it for you.
Wouldn&#39;t making a 7 minute video on the album draw people towards listening to it? I&#39;m not a kanye fan after all the anti semite stuff but I think leaving it alone or making a single statement about the subject instead of live streaming the whole album and making a whole rant video about it would make more sense.
üòÇ üß¢
&quot;I can&#39;t separate art from the artist&quot; <br><br>mf your wife already separated from you, what&#39;s so hard to understand üò≠
melon fell off like in 2013 idc im unsubscribing and not crying over 7 minutes XD
this is a worse review than Pitchfork Lateralus
Kanye could&#39;ve wrote mein kampf, but Hitler couldn&#39;t make Graduation
saying someone looks like a reference is worse than saying they owe him sex?
&quot;Who ain&#39;t cash a check off my name&quot;
You are not a public service but your own voice. You can review what your feel like. Thank you for the explanation but wasn‚Äôt necessary. Do what you want &amp; we still listen your awesome channel. Thank you!
Not being able to separate art and artist as a music reviewerüòÇ
His mustache looks like the Pizza Hut logo
After i listened ti the first 4 tracks on the album i just stopped. It was trash, hes right
You couldve just ignored it , instead you have to talk about for the views
But‚Ä¶.Kanye just said things. How does that make him a nazi ? Vikernes murdered someone‚Ä¶
I really want to know the dislike count on this one
Is melon going bald ?
L review
Hopefully next you‚Äôll criticize the use of adderall, since the Nazi‚Äôs created it to keep the soldiers alert. Hmmmm no? Use away? Ok
Broski it called a review not YEAH I 100% agree with his beliefs. Also u rated lil durk album who is straight up talking about irl murders but yk u cant seperate the artist from the music at least from what u said. IDC if u hate kanye i just wanted u to review it and not go on a yappin spree about how hes antisematic okay hes a bad fucking person half of of the industry is ur here to rate not to cry about it. Also abt arguing with kanye fans cuz they dc bro did u care for any other fans what they thought of ur review exactly...
Can‚Äôt separate the art from the artist but is seemingly fine with references to gangrelated black on black killing in other music
You are pushing 40 and balding
worst takes ive since ever
Worst take even worse than the divorce
i listen to a lot of black metal, really dark nihilistic stuff, i definitly think its possible to both enjoy the music and still dissociate from the messege presented. I think this is a really good album, i my mind the best since yeezus. (again really really dont like Kanye and the stuff he stands for)
Bro, the reference line is an art term. Like she would be the reference for the female form. That‚Äôs not a misogynistic line.
Kanye stands stay seething.
Totally agree with you on Kanye as a person
COMPRESS THOSE &quot;S&quot; SOUNDS YOU SOUND LIKE OLD MAN HERBERT FROM FAMILY GUY
Well handled.
lmao @ the nihilistic teenagers u got their asses
You actually want to review music because you cannot make it yourself and be successful. Dry your tears talentless subjective man
Stfu ur not cool or quirky üòãüòã
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=423">7:03</a> minute of crying
bro is just mad about Kanye and taking it out on the album bruh, someone&#39;s biased. literally your job is to talk about your opinions on other people crafts like that is important and judges others for liking Kanye&#39;s music like what is this. This isn&#39;t even a review
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=304">5:04</a> proceeds to start reviewing the album
Giving this a 14/88 was a bit on the nose Anthony. Do better
You gave it a 0/10 because you&#39;re a jew
Free Nick Fuentes
Did not like Kanye a single day in my life. Now I gotta say that to me the man is simply mentally ill, he‚Äôs not actually a Nazi, he does not think of women as props, he‚Äôs just the representation of what an ill person will do without medicine and boundaries. Somebody close should help this man. On the other side I would like to point out that rappers like Chris Brown, Young Thug, TI, Chief Keef have done concrete and bad things yet they are still in activity and people seem to forget.
One thing, that is outstanding in  ‚ÄûPaid‚Äú ist the Mix and the Master, especially in the Chorus
You didn‚Äôt have to make this video, but you did. You said it‚Äôs unreviewable, but then reviewed it. You literally just wanted to make a fit about this.
This review is not going to age wellüó£üîäüíØüî•‚Åâ
based
I can&#39;t believe this album made it to No.1 in The Jewish Billboard Charts
I have no interest in listening to music made by a madman who clearly needs help. I&#39;m doing the Beezy 430
Sooo when are you going to rereview MBDTF?
biggest kanye hater on the planet, been saying this for a while
Nothing conspiratorial about Kanye‚Äôs evil doctor the text message proves his doctor is legit evil only a moron could read those texts and call KANYE the bad guy or conspiracy theorist why dya think he ain‚Äôt been cancelled?üòÇ
üòÇüòÇ Biased ass mf get the politics out your head and listen to the music... Supporting an artist like Sexy Red who&#39;s in controversy for telling young impressionable kids to listen to her music then turning around and talking about kanyes album politically is completely biased
As much as I love Kanye&#39;s music, im on Fantano&#39;s side here. This isnt Kanye at his best
Snowflake
How you keep saying you&#39;re not reviewing to change anyone&#39;s minds but now say you won&#39;t review it because you wouldn&#39;t change anyone&#39;s opinions? U not making sense
fantano is the dumbest and worst contect creator
i mean like... paperwork instrumentals were pretty good, and the beginning of fuk smn with the phonk bit. But come one we knew it was gonna be trash. I simply just can&#39;t take kanye seriously and never have he was always for me a goofy dude making interesting creative tunes. Thats why Im not really mad or disappointed
it‚Äôs not mixed that well i feel like you can‚Äôt hear bros voice over beat
Cant i just say the stuff he said is completly out of pocket and wild while still enjoying the music. I can overhear the lyrics sometimes cause the production just feels so refreshing and different.
Fantano is right and the album wasn&#39;t that great anyway
This man has never been and never will be part of the culture. He is another vulture just like the others in the industry.
How can Kanye be anti-Semetic when black people are Jews?
Isn&#39;t this the same guy who reviewed a Burzum album back in the day?
Ye talks facts that‚Äôs why everybody loves him apart from mainstream shills
Unreviewable? You literally just reviewed it so that‚Äôs a lie. And no that‚Äôs not a smart comment, you literally just cried about how you refuse to engage with it and then engaged with why you didn‚Äôt like it outside of its rhetoric. While I do agree most of the time it‚Äôs paradoxical to separate the art from the artist in terms of critically examining its content, this entire video is just a virtue signal. Kanye is incredibly influential and given the hateful things he‚Äôs said and encouraged I completely understand viewing him in this light, but how is this worse than reviewing literal murderers man? Complete lack of transparency.
You know the video is crazy when fantano gives you the thousand yard stare
Yo melon, didnt you just have an emberrasing fucking meltdown on twitter reaching speeds of 10 tweets an hour about the album you dont care about, insult the man‚Äôs wife, turn on stream, pause the album every 2 seconds, bring up the sexxy red review a hundred times and then act like the most hilarious meltdown of your entire career didnt just happen? <br><br>Oh well. At least you are happily married, am i right or am i right? Go get them tiger
Yedolf
Most well adjusted leftist
Honestly fair enough. People want to hear what Anthony has too say but then get annonyed and actually angry (?) at what he has to say. He doesn&#39;t want to touch this thing with a 10 ft stick and that&#39;s fair enough, professionally and personally.
I cant believe Fantano ended up giving this album a 10/10! what a surprise, was not expecting that going in
Gay
Get over it, album is good, stop virtue signalling
This is literally a review lol
Coming across as such a loser
Your opinions are not worth shit since sexy red got an 8
Option #2 of listeners hit too close to home bro
babyboy better start reporting the news, because this is very neutral right.
When I&#39;m in a gaslighting and demonizing competition but my opponent is anthony fantano
head so good she honor roll
You‚Äôre pretty fucking insufferable üòÇüòÇ
AOTY getting unreviewable, we are so backüßò
Fantano said it like it was !
God forbid a man has a hobby
&quot;I have been searching high and low and I can tell you one thing beautiful big tity but naked women don&#39;t fall of the sky you know &quot;the best bar of 20¬≤4
i feel like he‚Äôs been holding this in for decades
Yo Fantano remember when Radiohead performed in Tel Aviv in 2019 and you said it was a non issue?
I feel like everybody is more hurt than jews themselves cause they don&#39;t care and vultures is number 1 in Israel
Okay but what about the music tho?
Never Fight A Man With A Perm, Melon.
yuhhh
I don‚Äôt want your social commentary, I am here for an objective review
Becoming shawn cee
this is big dick energy. fuck ye
I cannot believe kanye can say he literally loves hitler and people are still here acting like fantano is wrong. I wouldn&#39;t wanna review this trash either. This album sounds like a 2009 black eye peas ahhhhh music. but it&#39;s kayne so i guess that makes the album great? like wtf
Wow, what a review! I&#39;m sure Mr. Fantano will apply the same standard to every other controversial artist in the future! =)
Anthony you‚Äôre a pick me girl
Let‚Äôs gooo! Nav, MGK, and Justin Bieber no longer the worst characters in the Fantanoverse!!!!
just review the album and the music
Why do people still listen to this guy for music? He‚Äôs a professional yapper
burning like a candle light
The biggest hypocrite I‚Äôve seen in a while
bro is white lets move on <br><br>criticising someone or hating someone dif
Bro reviewed Burzum but didn‚Äôt review Vultures<br>Being racist to jews is worse than literally being a murderer lmao
Four minutes in and haven&#39;t heard a single word about the music
Fantano is the biggest pussy all time not reviewing this album
How are you gonna take a stance now you have done reviews on rapists and people with rap sheets but a viewpoint is where you draw a line kinda dumb if you ask me.
Fantano I don‚Äôt like this album either but your meant to separate the music from the politics uno üòÇ
im 100/100 with kanye btw FREE PALESTINE
Bro thought he Ezra Pound fr
Fantano based once again
Melon sold out wow. Even though Kanye has made some controversial comments, his music still deserves a fair chance. It wouldn&#39;t be right to ignore the album just because of Kanye&#39;s behavior outside of music. People were really looking forward to Fantano&#39;s review, hoping he&#39;d give an unbiased take on an album that many see as artistically strong. So, it&#39;s disappointing when the review seems to miss that mark. But just go with the flow melon go where it&#39;s safe.
Nothing new. Fantano did the same with the nsbm band peste noire a decade ago...
womp womp
Bro doesn&#39;t know where bbw fall out of the sky
The album is ‚Äúunreviewable‚Äù yet you still did a stream listening to the whole album and spent a whole day live tweeting how bad you thought each song was one by one? So you used the album for clicks and views and then topped it off with this video for a home run. You also aren‚Äôt being very considerate of your fans like you claim to be if you‚Äôre exposing them to the album by streaming it?
But when Ozzy said he loved Hitler you said nothing. But then again you&#39;re the same guy who gave saxy redd a 8
I thought ‚ÄúHOODRAT‚Äù would‚Äôve been a pretty good beat if he took the piano melody out and put a hard 808 and was rapping instead of singing
We live in a country that gives us the right to the freedom to believe whatever the fuck it is. The production is good and good music is what I go to kanye for first. I‚Äôm not going to criticize it for someone exercising their first amendment right. The album is good and he ate on the production that‚Äôs what we want for the review.
I like how most of these comments have the exact same arguments as he punctures in the videoü§®
i actually went to listen to the album, so it is a review after all XD (ofc it&#39;s crappy album)
Am I the only person who hear Mo Bamba sound in the Carnival song? This choir just singing Mo Bamba
crazy bipolar antisemite and he is still the king
If your not gonna do your own job I‚Äôll do it for you <br><br>the album was alright personally I‚Äôd give it a 6 or a 7 the worst track on there is beg forgiveness and the best song on there is fuk summ
Just review music why take a political stance üò≠
He didn‚Äôt say he liked hitler he said he was a great leader witch he was he led an entire country to commit irreversible atrocities
Making a collab album with Ty dolla sign, of all artists, makes for a pretty generic album with some decent moments of production sprinkled throughout it. Donda is easily better.
Appreciate you Anthony.
You should review the new westside and conway album
Tonyyyy
kanyes fall from grace is truly one of the most fascinating things in music
motherfuckers become people reviewer when it comes to kanye
Bro maybe it&#39;s ok., and you purjoritvely categorizing your fanbase  as Obsessive, or cult like fan is problematic as fuck ok. As a supported of you since when you reviewed Yeezus. It&#39;s just insane this album had reviewers calling out their fanbase, and no Jesus King, was a complete retreat and compromise from Yanhdi. Anthony this is weak as fuck sure you have dumb bootlicking unironic Nazis in the world, and then you have people who listen to the new Kanye to hear subjectively if it&#39;s good or not. Insanity. You just called Everyone a nazi, you baby. I just want you to know that&#39;s weak sauce, and your half ass attempt at a review blows.<br><br>Best song Do It <br><br><br>Why is no one Talking about This is A spiritual Successor weather you like it or not To My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. <br><br>With Back to me Having The Jay sample before Chris Rock falls out of the sky ass out. What happened in Blame Game Kanye&#39;s girl is cheating with Chris Rock. Now he has the girl, and Chris Rock is ass out. k<br>Kanye through the use of the sample reversed his situation. <br><br>In Carnival, The Guitar Lick for Hell of a life plays + The Black Sabbath Iron Man crowd chant, sounds like Mo Bamba by Shek Wes. <br><br>In Problematic, he ended, the song with a callback to Fuckin Ridiculous <br><br>The fact you refused to catch simple details about the record about lyrical, and production, means you sucked hard and delivering a substantial critique. <br><br>Worst track was King, even that had a Hell of A life/ vibe Who Will Survive in America, with the collage of samples. <br><br>Have a good day.
im a mix of number 2 and number 3
Bro ur job is to fucking  review music not to defend any race or religion . And about that please stop reviewing üòÇ
This time you preached, great video!
i agree but also the album is crazy
If the album was called ‚Äòkids see vultures‚Äô you would give it a 10
embarassinggggg
Most unreasonable video to be posted
this album is a 8/10 ur crazy
Kanye is so cringe
To get it straight music is subjective and your career is built off your opinion. You made this to spark something and enrage kanyes fans. This is a completely reviewable album like if you don‚Äôt like it just say it‚Äôs bad like you think ppl care
Meh, you liked burzum back in the day w/e
I just unsub
im wont review kamyes art cuz politics- but i will make a monetized video to signal how im not reviewing it.
Misogy wasn‚Äôt a issue when it was Sexy Reds album?
Unsubscribed 1
I have big respect for fantano, but he probably reviewed albums about people bragging about kllling and SA in their music
THEN DO NOT REVIEW IT?????????????????????<br>IT&#39;S JUST THAT SIMPLE.
It&#39;s just an opinion it&#39;s not giving meaning you&#39;re defensive as hell
English isnt my first language so please forgive any grammar or writing mistakes!<br>I find this very frustrating to hear because i wound&#39;nt count me to 1 of the 3 groups of Kanye fans which fantano named here but i like songs on this album. To be clear i dont support any antise*** views or generaly any racisim as a mather of fact. I hate that Kanye got these views but its like it said in the video &quot;seperate the art from the Artist&quot;. It is possible in my opinion. I dont like songs of the Album like King, Hoodrat and Vultures and their f&#39;d up lyrics but I think there is some really great music on that album like Beg Forgiveness, Do it, Burn,Good etc. . I dont think that this should get an unreviewable. I get that there is stuff said that is very problematic but at least give the music and the art a chance before writing it down as unreviewable. i would like to hear a honest review of the songs and not a 7 minute Rant about kanyes mistakes and f&#39;d up Opinions on religion and race. <br>But Fantano i like watching your videos keep it up but im a bit disapointed rn. <br>hope yall have a nice day.
if it was called to pimp a vulture you would of given it a ten
Unsubscribed reviews getting worse
This is why he&#39;s not a real music critic, too many personal political ideas that nobody really cares about
Worse than yeezus? This is an effortless review
Can someone explain to me What happened? I‚Äôm genuinely confused
6/10. The album is fun and if he put this out before any controversy or listening without anyone knowing who this artist was I think they would agree. It‚Äôs a music album, not a full length essay on why you should think Kanye West should be viewed as a good person, so why is Fantano giving us a recap on these events? I understand that he references his views in these songs yes, but the album is more than 3 songs and if you don‚Äôt want to platform an artist any further than why review it. I‚Äôm going to be called salty or a Kanye apologist which isn‚Äôt true, but Fantano went into this album with an already biased view point, so it‚Äôs no surprise he said these things.üòä
enough of this guy. unsubscribed
came here for a review not for a rant lol
Ye fans mad afüíÄ
Ahhh yes, I love when the music reviewer reviews everything but the music! Anthony complains about Kanye fans that ignore his public statements and are obsessed with the music, while Antony is the other side of that coin. Completely obsessed with Ye‚Äôs public statements that he ignores the music.
What I&#39;ve heard I don&#39;t like, he clings too much to being &quot;controversial&quot; when hes just been repeating the same old bullshit antisemetic conspiracy theories that the neo nazis do. And bevaing badly in public is nothing new either. He can produce still but lyrically it&#39;s trash.
The album was actually good too, this man will do anything but review music fairly LMAO
Lil B has not gotten an unreviewable. Based God &gt; Kanye. TYBG
This is not even about music anymore. I haven&#39;t liked Kanye for the past few years but you&#39;re just delusional. Your channel has changed from being a music review channel to &#39;&#39;political views of Anthony Fantano&#39;&#39;. As a music critic you should be objective and actually talk about the music. <br>You act like ignoring his album drop and giving it this treatement is a manifest towards his fucked up behaviour but you actually do the opposite by publicing this video. But no problem, you&#39;ve got to get those views after all.
SOOOOOO, Dude that abused and beaten Lingua Ignota gets a 10, but Kanye that went crazy and talks bullshit gets &quot;unreviewable&quot;. What a time to be alive.
I know Fantano loves carnival and burn üò≠
I think bro doesn‚Äôt like Kanye
Imagine ever listening to Soytano
Kanye is a horror person and should never be forgiven, but Im gonna listen to this album over and over because I like the music
Pre-Fader article Anthony would‚Äôve reviewed this properly.
I actually agree with most of this and think this was a good and important video on the main channel.
Grow up why are you mad over another persons opinion and life choices?
I get what u mean, melon, BUT I JUST WANTED TO KNOW UR OPINION üò≠üò≠
A somewhat review starts at starts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=303">5:03</a>
yapskies ü•¥
Update: The hardest ‚Äòwoking‚Äô music nerd.
Crazy how Kanye‚Äôs music became ‚Äúunlistenable‚Äù once he went off on Jewish people, but all the wild shit he said about black ppl was perfectly fine
Thank you for not supporting Kanye‚Äôs antisemetic bullshit like the rest of the world.
Or you know‚Ä¶the number 4 group. The group that believes in free will and getting to say whatever you want. Cause words can‚Äôt hurt you. Also I thought this was a channel for musical analysis, not a political commentary. Even if the lyrics garner hateful or surprising things, they aren‚Äôt meant to be taken literally. Does every rapper that raps about rape and drugs, live that life, should we go back and cancel Eminem for rapping outrageous shit? Fuck no. He said sorry for saying what he said, should his words of apology not matter? if his words about Jews matter so much? Hate on some actual evil people like Chris brown and Tory lanez for abusing women, which is way worse than mentioning your wife in a song in any way, shape or form.
&quot;this that shit that make rap n****s maaaad&quot;
Why is Kanye unreviewable, but you gave Burzum a regular review?
There are dozens, maybe hundreds of philosophical papers on separation of art from the artist. I find this whole argument, &quot;What would I tell my jewish fans,&quot; Incredibly demeaning and wholly ironic. Jewish people, great academics have written about aesthetic judgments in reference to Richard wagner&#39;s music, for example, and how even art can be great whilst at the same time be harmful.
Most cringe review on earth.<br><br>Your point on the antisemitism being spread through the music is absolutely stupid. What about when he said he hated the Nazis in early albums? <br><br>If you didnt wanna review the actual music why do this video. Cringe
JEW JEW JEW JEW
What a drama queen
Can you just review the album?
This has to be one of the worst reviews from you Melonhead üò≠
He misses the old kanye
If only it was called to pimp a vulture
Welp, I guess we&#39;re no longer getting album reviews of &quot;problematic&quot; artists on this channel from now on. I&#39;ll see myself out.
He should&#39;ve asked his wife&#39;s boyfriend&#39;s opinion
‚Å†‚Äã‚Å†sorry but varg killed his band mate, is a white nationalist, is a terrorist and arsonist, is a Nazi, and has made loads of anti-Semitic comments, yet his music can be reviewed unbiasedly, while Kayne‚Äôs cannot. I am not a Kayne fan nor a Fantano fan, but the amount of bias that I can see in his ‚Äúreview stream‚Äù and this video is extremely laughable all the while sad. I personally do not agree with Kayne for the last 2 years because of all the major headlines on him, and what he‚Äôs said is extremely disgusting and rightfully so he‚Äôs lost a lot of opportunities within music, fashion, and perhaps it‚Äôs best his divorce went through. but to call yourself a professional critique is just untruthful at this point
Yeah, this video is pretty jarring to me, with all due respect. I completely understand his entire argument; if anything, I actually agree with the all-around sentiment. Where my issue mostly lies in, though, is reviewing the music he‚Äôs been churning out as of late while also being completely aware of his antisemitic rhetoric, General lunacy, and just straight up bigotry. If your argument to not review this album is that, then why review the music he‚Äôs been putting out? Furthermore, I think it‚Äôs weird how you summed up kanye fans, as a whole.
You feel off
I think everything you said is definitely true. Well said. But you had like 25% this energy when he was talking about black folk letting slavery happening, cozying up to trump, Candace Owens etc. that started in 2016.
ur job is to have wrong opinions on the internet, it‚Äôs funny üòÜ
For me, all the drama surrounding Kanye makes his music unlistenable. It‚Äôs just not fun to listen to at this point. Music is supposed to be escapist. I‚Äôm not getting that here
This isnt a music review, this is Fantano obsessively talking about antisemitism and his opinion on Kanyes public image
Another ass fantano review üî•üî•üî•
This feel like a review of Kanye as a person and less of a review of the actual music
Damn, Fantano Just can&#39;t stop crying when Kanye Is involved
Hope the black girl your fetishizing on twitter sees this bro &lt;33
If you pretend that instead of saying &quot;The music too, is shit.&#39; at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=304">5:04</a> Antnee said &quot;The music is NOT GOOD&quot; this actually isn&#39;t really any different than I was expecting a review of this album to be.
Yeah, he a jew fr
Who actually listens to this goofy ass clown XD mf so salty cause Ye exposed the Jews üòÇüòÇüòÇ
You cant just give it a 10 because of the album cover, Fantano
Biased
I want to feel bad for Kanye because he has a serious mental health disorder. But I think my empathy ran out after his last presidential run.
Valid. I don‚Äôt judge people for playing his music, and genuinely great people still listen to him(example NFR Podcast) because they like his music for the art it is, or because Kanye in his past music helped them through their lives <br>But I also don‚Äôt judge people for completely distancing from his new music, even his older music, since I know many people need to have a positive attachment to the artists they listen to. <br>For me, I‚Äôll play a song that has Kanye on it if it‚Äôs made by an artist I listen to, but I don‚Äôt go out of my way to listen to him. I recognize his artistic brilliance in the genre, and he has many undeniable classics in his early to middle part of his discography, but he‚Äôs not somebody I choose to listen to that often, and given how he‚Äôs acting in the last 2 years, I think I‚Äôll keep it that way.<br>Whatever you choose to do, just remember that what Kanye is saying/doing is not okay. I don‚Äôt think you need to feel guilty if you want to listen to graduation, College dropout, MBDTF, TLOP, or whatever Ye album means a lot to you, but realize that the man who made those albums is at best forever altered, and at worst completely gone.<br>And Kanye, please get some help.
Crazy how these ‚Äú unbiased ‚Äú review channels changed their tune on Kanye after he made remarks about the financial position of the ‚Äú chosen people ‚Äú lol
i think the problem isn&#39;t inherently with kanye but rappers as a whole. We vibe and fuck with them but once they make anti-semitic comments we draw the line like they haven&#39;t been involved in domestic abuse, murder, extortion and other sub categories of violence. Rappers are taking over the world along with a generation that grew up with unrestricted internet access, thought doing the n*zi salute in school was the pinnacle of comedy and is a generation that is the most desensitized to the idea of people getting hurt without having ever been exposed to it. of course they&#39;re gonna revere kanye because kanye is that one kid in class that talks back to the teacher and gets sent out. theres always kids (mostly men) that will look at this and think of him as the coolest kid ever. How do you seperate art from the artist when a primary feature of hip hop is being real? People are glazing because he&#39;s being real no matter how wrong or offensive he might be.
really disgusting to post this video the day after Israel murdered thousands of innocents,  maybe just wait a few days before flying the Jewish flag on your channel
BEAUTIFUL BIG TIDDY BUTT NAKED WOMEN JUST DONT FALL OUT THE SKY YOU KNOW??!?!??!??
I miss the old Fantano
this is racist
If it was called kids see vultures you would give it a light 9 üíØüíØüíÄ
hater such a vanilla bean take
This is album of the decade
Where are the jew&#39;s kanye fans
I was hoping you&#39;re gonna review at least the &quot;reviewable&quot; part of this album. Saying that Freddie Gibbs &quot;somehow made it flow&quot; is such a discredit. His verse is one of the hardest things I&#39;ve ever heard. Also the beat from Carnival is exceptional. F sumn in my opinion also deserves a mention even though it was basically ruined by the chipmunk part and the effortless Travis verse. And I&#39;m not trying to defend Kanye, but he&#39;s clearly mentally ill which should be taken under consideration.
Bros mad üíÄüíÄ
You are less than worthless, Melon.
but got some bangers tho
Not that I care but saying his wife is a naked body with no personality is one of the most chauvinistic thing I heard from you (how you know thats not her own personality?). your morals are all over the place and splash inconsistenly into your &quot;unbiased review&quot; more than any kanye album üòÇ
I am a Ye fan and i agree :D
Anthony being immature and being unable to separate the art from the artist is unsurprising tbh
I totally agree with this but where&#39;s this energy when youre review literall murderers condoning gun violence copious drug use and objectifying women. Alot of them do that in one song. So if your going to do this you&#39;d better not review all the stuff worse than kanye no like jews.
whenever you miss the vibe you just say the mix is not good
I watched the live reaction last night and people literally called Anthony fat, bald and divorced. Uhm??
Fantano an L for this
You are disgraceful Fantano
what about music mf?
Tell &#39;em
If he called this album ‚Äòto pimp a vulture‚Äô you would‚Äôve given it a 10.
Thank you for sticking to your morals and explaining why Ye can‚Äôt be seperated from this Album- thanks for keeping it real as always despite his crazy and delusional fans ‚ù§‚ù§
A fan of hip-hop music for 7 years running. I&#39;ve heard some of the old and a lot of the new. Hip-Hop was always misogynistic, racist, homophobic, consumerist, misanthropic, voyeuristic etc.<br><br>It was only acceptable coz it aligned with a worldview, that&#39;s also acceptable. Ye just crossed newer boundaries of acceptable. Now, all the misogyny and racism and anti-semitism is a &quot;problem&quot;. <br><br>Knew this was coming. Ye is just the start.
Oops wrong video I thought this was a Pizza Hut ad
Idk the reason i like listening to kanye is becaus it makes me feel good
i dont care about his personality i only care about his music
Bro made the classical mistake of video game reviewers, thinking he&#39;s something more to us than... just a reviewer, and decided it would be a good idea to be a moral compass.<br>Well, what won&#39;t he do for clicks
uh oh
‚Äúguys look how much of a good person i am i hope nobody calls me out for being openly misogynistic to Bianca‚Äù
Okay you&#39;re good. Can you talk about what happened and still happening in GAZA ?
Yeah no Vultures 1 had maybe one or two good songs. Maybe three. Unlike Fantano I actually enjoyed paid. Enjoyed the starting track, and Burn went hard. Otherwise Album‚Äôs mid as fuck. (I don‚Äôt make it a mission to moralize shit, sorry but I just care about the music).
You&#39;ve been cashing in on him, just like Kanye said in the lyrics of this album. The least you could do is give him a review.
If you say any truth about JEWS, your life is over.
The whole video is &quot;Separate the arts from the artist, buuuuut...&quot; in a nutshell
Fantano unfollow you this trash review just lie on platform how great album this was.
7 minutes of nothing but politics I came here for a music review came out completely confused
Yap
This unreviewable but sexy red has a strong 8?!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Okay.üíÄü™¶
Kim isn‚Äôt letting you smash chill
But hes right what hes says
Basically a 8.5 out of 10. Great album
But you‚Äôll give actual murders better reviews??? Make it make sense? Why are we crossing the line over words and not actual action? Your moral compass is skewed.
Fantanoüóëüóëüóëüóëüóë
You can tell you have low testosterone by just looking at you.
this ‚Äúreview‚Äù was NOT GOOD
IF you refused to do the review, ask LOGIC to do it, YOUR TWINS
why don&#39;t you have this morality take when you review gangster rappers (actual gangsters who really harm people), baldy?
Fantanoü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°
where is your wife baldie
If you not gonna rate it why bother to make the video your opinion is yours but do your job and review music you  not a Sociologist you can‚Äôt review people its not your profession
Anthony: this album is unreviewable not because of the quality of the music, but because no matter how detailed my reasoning, nihilistic Kanye fans will just pretend I&#39;m hating for the sake of hating, and deliberately ignore any attempts to get them to think about the negative impact of an influential person&#39;s increasingly aggressive downward spiral<br><br>The Comments: i bet he secretly liked it, he gave this album i didn&#39;t like a better score, negative bias
keep the art away from the artist
Fantano looks like a resentful alcoholic
people shaking and crying and seething because some bald guy on the internet didn&#39;t give an album a score because he dislikes the lyrical content and imagery in and around the album (literally exactly the same as the &quot;not good&quot; reviews no one has an issue with) is genuinely hilarious. people need bigger things to worry about in their lives istg
those lyrics he posted as examples of not learning from his mistakes dont really support his argument. they were either intentional punchlines, quotes, or irrelevant
I like Kanye Because when I interact with art, a major aspect is      Looking at the artists mind.  I don‚Äôt like music I cannot understand on a conceptual level, or music that doesn‚Äôt have a deeper layer that a person is expressing through the music, as in all art.  I like watching Tarantino movies because they are good, but there is another level of how the director goes about making a movie where you can see where their mind goes.<br><br>Kanye is one of those people for me, I was never into his stuff and thought he was a douchebag <br><br>After the nazi stuff I was really curious how someone who was seemingly one of the most outspoken progressives in hip hop in 2005, became an anti-Semitic nazi in not even 20 years.<br><br>My experience listening to his albums is the mind of someone who had everything in place and then lost everyone in his life he trusted, all while becoming, at a certain moment in time, the biggest artist there was.<br><br>TLOP is a painting of Kanye losing his grasp on sanity<br><br>Ye is him on a better track, accepting the fact that he is manic bi polar<br><br>And after that it‚Äôs off the rails religious stuff that really hurt him and his family<br><br>That shit evolved into the Hitler shit<br><br>If you listen to him speak for long enough there is actually rhyme to his reasoning<br><br>It usually doesn‚Äôt isn‚Äôt a reason<br>I would use, or something I would agree with, but it‚Äôs interesting to get an insight into how he thinks<br><br>That being said I think he has one of the best ears in music, he knows intrinsically what sounds good and he has a message, but often isn‚Äôt able to follow through in order to communicate it<br><br>I don‚Äôt think he would lie about changing his mind on the Jews<br><br>If he actually did change his mind, is there anything he could do to make you listen to him again?
All politics or anythinga side. I agree. This album is a straight disappointment.
bro is a music reviewer and can&#39;t review musicüíÄüíÄüíÄ
Thank you. I tried my best with this album. Absolute trash
Why does anyone care about what this guy says? He&#39;s just an old white guy who thrives off of hatred and controversy, giving atrocious ratings on purpose, that for some reason people have decided to listen to and give credence to his opinions. People wouldn&#39;t care as much if he gave MBDTF and Swimming 9s or 10s. This video itself shows how he doesn&#39;t care about being accurate and objective, giving a clickbait title and rating an amazing album a 1 because he didn&#39;t like what Kanye said (despite him being &quot;objective&quot; in ratings of albums by much worse people) to get attention and controversy (which worked, since this is the first I&#39;ve heard of him in a while).
If deathgrips made this album you‚Äôd be on your knees with your mouth open
i don&#39;t mean no disrespect but he was right about the Jews ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è they have they&#39;re hands in allot of dirt in the game and our hiding something. this album and him are weird tho. it&#39;s not even artistic and those lines about Jews isn&#39;t cool. it&#39;s really wrong and not of our god yahweh.
We get it you hate nazi shit you think kanye is unhinged but why is mtdf a 6? It&#39;s a 10
How u gonna give an album with Carnival an Unreviewable/10, Melon?
yeah fr this shit was trash
if this album was titled To Pimp a Vulture you would give it a 10
At this point, as long as the beat is good dawg
This album sucked but seeing you react to tracks and hating on every single thing was embarrassing, why even go through the trouble of listening to something if you are not gonna like it?
JUST REVIEW IT
I like kanye but kanye fans are the male version of taylor swift fans, I wont elaborate.
You&#39;re irrelevant bro üòÇ
Ye brings conversation about the jews to the table in the only way he knows how, and youll have to have a conversation about it eventually one day or the next ir you can choose to stay ignorant just not to offend anyone
Pushing 40 years of age
Wat I just want a review? Chill dude.
Unsubscribing finally after 6 years. You suck.
Definition of a snowflake. Stop being political. If you truly believe in what you‚Äôre saying you wouldn‚Äôt give Kanye a platform, yet here you are, using his name to get views and financial gain. If you truly cared, give all the proceeds of this video to charity. It‚Äôll be a good write off, snowflake.
Melons mad
man, these comments are just proving fantano right
bro&#39;s moustache turned blue
Very cowardly
They hated him because He was telling the truth<br><br>The fact that Kanye has so much influence to drive so many people insane though is horrifying. As much as I agree with Fantano here, I was following his situation on twitter yesterday and thought this man is gonna collapse at any moment now. The comments I&#39;ve seen, here, on twitter and especially reddit are crazy. In fact I believe the fantano sub got locked due to how terrible the situation has become. All of that for an album about someone doubling down about his immorality and incompetent production skills. Ye has nothing more to offer, but his demon cult is gonna eat it all up and do &quot;death threats to anyone who says anything bad about their god&quot; rituals.
Guys I think that bro is mad
If it was named My beautiful butt naked fantasy then he would review it and give a not good.
You‚Äôre so salty Mr.Soyjak
melon hit the nerve of those kanye fans
womp womp
Only a no no if you say something against the j word
Yo you sounding like you support Israel b careful
great review, kinda summer up my thoughts about the kanye fanbase,  hated this album mostly but i do like some parts of it
Bro you sound like you‚Äôre having a manic episode üíÄ
Barbra Streisand effect tho
Crazy how far kanye fans go to defend him. They are equivalent/worse than the cult that is Taylor swifts fans
I completely agree with this review for the first time. Even if you separate the music from the artist, it is utterly trash. The music sucks asssssss. Compare this to Pablo or Grad or MBDTF. Hell even compare it to JIK. It doesn‚Äôt stand a chance. It‚Äôs all over the fckn place. The mixes sound terrible, the song structures are random, the production choices are silly (the hoodrat sample is a great example), the features feel desperate just to keep the tracks going somehow‚Ä¶Idk man. Also the lyrics are straight up something that‚Äôs gonna give you mental problems xD. Those kinds of things will subliminally fuck you up. The women are portrayed as nothing but rags that are nice to look at and then you get hit with a track talking about daughters. That‚Äôs just bad taste isn‚Äôt it? Overall, I gave it two listens, nothing stuck on me, not even one hook. Also the demonic visuals and outfit choices just put me off. Weird shit. There‚Äôs better music to listen to guys, but to each their own I guess.
I just want to ask a question what do you use as a reference to define what is moral or immoral. I‚Äôm a Christian so I go by the Bible. Since you are preaching morality may I ask are you also a Christian?
YOU ARE LITERALLY THE ONLY ONE WHO THINKS THIS ü§£ü§£ü§£ STAY MAD BALDY
One of the reasons why I can&#39;t get into hip hop or don&#39;t respect as a serious music genre it&#39;s bc, apparently, this individual is one of it&#39;s greatest, if not the greatest, representatives ever.
ü•±ü•±ü•±ü•±ü•±
if kanye wasn&#39;t antisymmetric, you&#39;d have given it a 10
Can there be a Kanye fan that just likes old Kanye‚Ä¶
fantano doing everything he can to trick people into thinking he doesn&#39;t like the album
God I agree with fantano a lot but his coverage of this entire album is such man baby behavior. It‚Äôs fine if he dislikes it but saying an album that‚Äôs bad at worst is completely un reviewable is so stupid and just ignores anything this offers because ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt wanna like it‚Äù attitude
Yeah of course its &quot;unreviewable&quot; when u skip the songs out of spite
I love how you tell us why you‚Äôre not reviewing the album then proceed to review the album
FACKING PRONOUNS except replace Pronouns with Vultures
You thought you ate but you shitted yourself instead
I don&#39;t think you want to accept that kanyes still fire
‚Äúi can‚Äôt review this album it‚Äôs not right‚Äù posts a review and profits off of it
Melon nailed the Ye stans demographics
So when the review?
he talks about reviewing an album then say how antisemite is ye, and talk about his doctor. i dont know if he knows that ye is cool with jewish people and vice versa. bald ball will get a comment from me and many people but not watch time
WOMP WOMP
He‚Äôs trying so hard to pretend he‚Äôs not vibing with it üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
Let‚Äôs be honest Kanye meat riders. He‚Äôs right
fantano, you are... political
yappstar
Fantano is gonna get so much shit for this video, but I‚Äôm honestly happy that he speaks about his own feelings for the record. Call him inconsistent, call him biased, but what I can call him is human. Human in the way that his heart is speaking for him here no matter what weird ass teenage Kanye fans tell him. Fantano is not perfect at all, many of yall have pointed that out, but he‚Äôs more human and reasonable than half of the commenters here. *incoming glazing comments
Is this album the same rating as your marriage?
tru
Is this the first ever woke/10 review where anthony wont rate the music because of his politics?
You can‚Äôt tell us this is worse than any album you‚Äôve given a 0 come on man
worst review ever 1
As a Potterhead, separate the art from the artist.
At least Kanye does his job, but you‚Äôre reviewing his life. I miss the old melon.
Those arent his type of fans, those are yoursüòÇ
You&#39;ve reviewed records with plenty of sexist, homophobe, racist etc. claims. Why now stop here
I can‚Äôt be the only person who genuinely thinks the album is trash, fuck what Kanye has done, the album is BAD
What an idiot. Album was good.
I never thought I would see Anthony take things so personally.
Bro made such a good album that fantano questioned everything
Shut up baldy
Damn Anthony, you made a lot of teen boys cry over this one.
oh it‚Äôs a political review
Your tears are hilarious baldie üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
7 minutes of yappin is crazy
YUNOREVIEW ‚ùå<br><br>NOT GOOD ‚ùå<br><br>0/10 ‚ùå<br><br>Unreviewable ‚úÖ
What I got from the reference bar was that she‚Äôs the standard(beauty). She‚Äôs what some women wish to imitate looks wise
It‚Äôs good that fantano has the ability to discuss and inform about the context of music. If you have such a big problem with this, you need to check your bigotry.
Fantano: what I&#39;m going to do, tell Jewish people in my audience &quot;oh, he didn&#39;t mean that, he&#39;s just a little crazy&quot;?<br>This comment section: oh, he didn&#39;t mean that, he&#39;s just a little crazy
we all know you like burn and carnival melon head üòäüòä
Naw I just like his music
Bro not even a zero? This is really bad lol
&quot;I&#39;m the new Jesus Christ&quot; completely outted for that one
Your wife left you baldy
can&#39;t even enjoy music anymore ffs i guess i&#39;m anti-semetic for liking a kanye song now
your actually weird coz you stay reviewing literal murderers and sex offenders on ur page. ur lame and im a fan , decide wether your a politician or a music reviewer , honestly dont care if u review kanye music or not just dont try twist it into some fake moral code dude
this guy thinks he is funny and is the biggest Kanye hater alive. jealous much? what a F-ing Loser! his full review was unbaerable to watch
Now you pissed off JPEG -Ty Dolla $ign - Playboi Carti - Gibbs....you are cooked.<br>You reviewed actual gang music w no issue.<br>You have to own your own dumpster fire now.üòä
I don&#39;t know Anthony, this rant felt as forced as that preachy speech in the Barbie movie. Just say you didn&#39;t want to review it man, I don&#39;t think any of us, your real fans would be mad about it. Don&#39;t let all those deranged Kanye cultists get to your head
Unwatchable 1
U Only do this to rap albums
This loser is so triggered
The Hasan Piker of music reviews... trash!
This album is so vapid.
Just say NOT GOOD and continue. Wtf is unreviewable.
At this point, I really hate fans of Ye. Back in the day at least his music was somewhat good, but now everything just sucks: Kanye&#39;s personality, his music, his political views, his clothes, his friends and his family suck also for not trying to hold him back.<br><br>I was a big fan once. Kanye&#39;s music inspired me to produce beats myself, he was a hero to me for pushing boundaries. Now it&#39;s all gone, it&#39;s like having a good date, get along well, you think you&#39;ve met a soulmate and suddenly out of the blue this persons smacks you in the face and insults every aspect of your life. You can&#39;t get over it just because 99% of the date was good. It ruined everything.
Should be titled* I RANT ABOUT KANYE‚Äôs IMAGE *
guys i dont think he likes kanye
It&#39;s worse than Yeezus
&quot;Good&quot; politics review but I think you should stick to music
As a Kanye I agree with you vultures is trash
This was a bold video to make. Light to decent 7
this review is NOT GOOD
Bro just hating
This album is complete ass
Virtual signalling by even posting a review, not a big fan of this.
You&#39;re just not ready for love, melon
Bro nobody gives a fuck about your political perspective. Nobody cares about your hurt feelings. If it&#39;s a bad album, give it a bad review ffs.
Damn if y‚Äôall can‚Äôt see that mainstreaming/normalizing/encouraging many hate crimes is much much worse than an individual hate crime, ya need to re-examine the reality of the situation
The only good part of this album is (some of) the production
Anyways... GO GO GO GO<br>HEAD SO GOOD SHE HONOR ROLL
Can&#39;t wait for the next Prurient review, Tano
Stay off the internet
4 minutes into the video and he didn&#39;t even mention a single song about the album.
Cornball lol where your wife at
Day 3 of asking fantano to listen Dreams by Aaron May
100% Agree. Damn this eases my mind so much.
Ngl, bad take
So your political stance and opinion of Ye makes this album &quot;unreviewable trash&quot;?
bro has the hitler stache while actively hating on hitler<br><br>i mean, atleast hes getting his bag which is so obviously why this was made. Thank god for adblockers!
i mean, a bunch of philosophers contributed to nihilism. shouldn&#39;t we be happy that the youth are sharing the feelings of philosophers back them
i love this album
why cant you just review the music‚Ä¶ who cares about what kanye has done if its good music its good music. your a old head stop looking so deep
Taking a L
Wow the Kanye fans really outdid the Nicki fans as worst fanbase in existence huh
you don&#39;t hate album, you just hate kanye
He def likes carnival lmao
For a review all you had to do was just say if the songs were good or not, and then say Kanye&#39;s a piece of shit. English is my second language and I barely even hear the english lyrics or understand them most of the time but still listen to english songs if they sound good if they do, stop being a poopoo head and just say W or L
It&#39;s crazy how you just take lyrics from his songs out of context just to prove your point.  What you haven&#39;t realised is that you are the same as the &quot;kanye fans&quot; you just described or maybe worst.  Nothing i hate more than someone so biased to the extent he has to bend and make up shit to fit his narrative.
Who knew he was gonna do this in one form or another üëá
this is one of the most spot-on opinions you ever stated
Fantano hates black people and wont allow people to talk about how jews kidnapped them.
Die a hero or live long enough to become the villain great arch fantano
Just review the music‚Ä¶.<br>A hate piece like this will still be good promo for Ye though lol
You almost seem like someone who didn&#39;t like MBDTF
Melon just put this album over so hard to me, a Jew
That wedding ring tattoo was a bigger L than vultures...
what happened to this guy
Ngl there were good songs on this album, hes a giant hater for this and its kind of cringe
Coming from a fan of Kanye wests music from the beginning, first this album isn‚Äôt good. Lyrics suck. The beats suck. 1 listen through and didn‚Äôt like any song really and on top of that he‚Äôs a sick fuck and anything he makes from here will be tarnished and gross. Finally the music is suffering from his manic behavior
I actualy only wanted to know what he might think of carnival.
Ur cringe
Honestly, i am trying to figure out which is worse, Listening to the waffling on of this pseudo intellectual......or the album......... Genuinely having a hard time deciding.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=334">5:34</a>
Melon could not just do his job and review music, had to get political, lame
Not going to bother listening to this album
head so good she on honor roll
Ignoring the point that Kanye is a terrible person (which he is) I agree with you on the album review. It feels thrown together with random parts assigned to different parts in each song for no reason whatsoever. The best I could say was Donda leftovers. And there‚Äôs no real highlights on it either. Not a standout song. It‚Äôs all either average it really bad. Even on albums like Gunnas a gift and a curse that was NOT a good album there were like 1-2 good  tracks
if the album is good say it&#39;s good you&#39;re a music reviewer not a person reviewer
Damn no ‚Äúforever‚Äù at the end hits hard
üòí
Dudes trying to not scare the hoes. PR stunt. Just do your job and rate the music itself based on its structure and its quality
Kanye makin this bitch famous
Kanye and Kid Cudi are in a league of their own. From 0 to 10 to unreviewable. What an accomplishment for making Speeding Bullet 2 Heaven 2.0.
Still doesn‚Äôt make up for the MBDTF review Melon
The album is #1 in the world bro how can you even keep a straight face saying only parasocial weirdos like it? ü§°
i mean kanye did apologize‚Ä¶anthony hates that fact.
Weird that he went number 1 with just the fringes of society ü§îü´†
Anthony is personally upset with Kanye clearly.  He can&#39;t let his Jewish friends down. I get it. Peace to all.
who made melon so mad lol
you straight up just played politician instead of being a music critic and thats a blatant step down and a public display of your views and standpoint. learn your job.
Wish this guy would cut the political commentary. You&#39;re a music reviewer, your political opinion means literally nothing dude.
are you jewish ?
give an honest detailed unbiased review ‚ùå complain about things that have nothing to do with the actual album for 10 minutes just to not even give it a rating ‚úÖ
Por eso, pero cu√°l es la calificaci√≥n?
Called it
Where is your wife, are you jealous because he has a wife and your&#39;s left you?
why doesn&#39;t melon look like he is about to cry?
If &#39;I voted for Joe Biden and I would do it again&#39; was a person.
&quot;He&#39;s an antisemiteüò¢üò¢&quot; meanwhile melons tl is flooded with palestinian and anti-israel/jew propaganda  ü§°
Bro much of what you said here has been a lot of artist&#39;s albums that you have reviewed (Drake) and you&#39;ve at least given those 3&#39;s, you&#39;re as back and for the as Ye lol
Album was okay. Definitely near the bottom of his catalog for sure
I liked it?
He just couldn&#39;t help himself. He had to review just a little bit.
but you‚Äôre gunna monetize this video and use his name üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ hypocrisy
bald
Words are so bad!!!!! What about all the music talking about murder, sex, drugs, and misogyny? Some of these rappers include lyrics about murders they have actually committed. Words are worse than literally killing people?
Crazy bipolar antisemite and he still the king
I wholeheartedly agree with everything that he‚Äôs saying, but we have to consider the many artists that he has reviewed who are undeniably terrible people; r4p15ts murd3rers, people who promote gang violence, people who promote r4pe, misogyny, people who promote murder, etc. he never really bats an eye (to this extent )when it comes to these, or perhaps he just accepts it as the culture the hip-hop industry (which is true)<br><br>I feel like behind the scenes, there‚Äôs a deeper connection to his anger regarding Kanye and this album because this is the first time he has ever been this angry and informal in an album review before . even if there are similar situations with other albums, he kind of addresses them in a neutral standpoint, or he will acknowledge what is wrong, but this time he‚Äôs downright furious. furious enough to simply not review it, and deem as unreviewable.<br><br>at the end of the day, if it is an album, and it has music in it, it is reviewable, and he knows this. I think it‚Äôs important to separate political views and ideologies from a simple review and that he should‚Äôve left these opinions for a separate video.<br>but to be fair, I feel like that would also be harmful because it would just enable people to continue to listen to the album and support Kanye. Maybe this form of making an unreviewable review was in protest of kanye‚Äôs disgusting acts, so I can still understand where fantano is coming from
stay mald and bald
Trash review this why I don‚Äôt watch yall shit ever. Twitter brought me here and I‚Äôm gonna continue to never watch your videos.
damn bro you&#39;re such a good person, the amount of virtue emanating from you is incredible.<br>thanks for uploading this so you can make sure we all know it
The kanye stans definitely didn‚Äôt like this video
leak something horrible about fantanoüôè
get him melon GET HIM
I think you have to seperate the art from the artist melon. Yeah this jew topic is very problematic but Kanye objectifiying women isn‚Äòt only a theme of Vultures 1? I personally love some of the tracks from the album but still think that Kanye is an absolute goofball who shouldn‚Äòt have such a big audience who he can communicate his ideas to which clearly come from a mentally ill person. As long as you are able to do that, why shouldn‚Äòt I enjoy great music?
Tf this baldy yappin
But he would call it the finest piece of art if taylor swift made it.
Rents due
those antisemitic lines are supposed to be one of those over the top edgy shit that kanye usually says in his songs plus all of those examples that you brought up have a humorous undertone to them and no hateful intent can be seen. mentioning antisemitism doesn&#39;t always make a statement antisemitic
So you put down Bianca then claim he is dehumanizing her right after you dehumanize her‚Ä¶you‚Äôre a weird fucking person bro. I hope the feedback from this helps you realize most of us aren‚Äôt ‚Äúcultish weirdos, hateful psychos, or nihilistic teenagers‚Äù. Would be lit as fuck if you were able to give an unbiased album review (focusing on the art) without throwing your political views and your little personal stories where you‚Äôve been attacked two or three times on twitter üòÇ
stop glazing kanye
fantano the only guy that could rate a fucking 10 a 1üò≠üò≠üò≠
stop with this rage bait bro. It‚Äôs embarrassing. Just do your job
Oh great the nazis are here now defending their leader.
Agreed, Kanye will make good music again someday lmao
came here for the music review and hes just ranting about how he doesnt like kanye as a personüò≠üò≠
The album production wise is not half bad, so I give Kanye credit for that front. There are some actual bangers. But I never wanna hear Kanye rap ever again. He might literally be the biggest rapper of no substance of all time. Kids See Ghosts is the last album in my personal timeline. Fuck Kanye
L take and I&#39;m not even getting past the first ads , DORK
At the time of me posting this comment, the album cover for Vultures on Wikipedia is Burzum - Filosofem ü§£ü§£ü§£
That&#39;s why you got divorced
Fantano loves music about blacks killing blacks but once a black guy mentions Jews‚Ä¶‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a problem. Ok
politcal views and music reviews dont mix well melon
They thought reviews were his kryptonite
make an album and we‚Äôll review it buddy
bro didnt even rate the albumüë∫
Fantano is a simp
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=334">5:34</a> fantano says nigga.
Is this an album review or a Kanye review?? bald.
Never seen your channel until this 1 video and by far everything you said in this video is a load of fucking garbage + Bald
Lol
bro you debate politics with 14yo on twitter and your wife divorced you‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏èü§£ü´µ
I enjoyed the album. The art is there. He displays bipolar disorder sonically perfectly.
This mf only likes oldschool shi or sumü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
this isnt gonna bring your wife back bro
Siri play back to me
I don&#39;t have any feeling about melon at all but the whining in here is off the fucking charts
Vultures is a solid 7, its pretty fire but Donda is greater. <br>Melonhead is trolling for views again
Dude.. bashing his entire fan base is wild.. im a fan of his music. I always have been and always will be.. im am not any of those three things you named. I obviously disagree with the things he has said about jews (and multiple other horrible things he has said and done) but hes simply not mentally normal, i dont think people are looking to music artists for their geopolitical opinions.. van goh was probably a piece of shit too, multiple artists have absolutely shit opinions but that dosnt change their art, you can hate him all you want but his music will live well beyond majority of artist of our time, the only other one i can think of from my lifetime is michael jackson‚Ä¶ his name will be more remembered than older artists even, 100‚Äôs of years from now his name will still be one of the biggest names in music history, thats just factual
I&#39;m the 4th type which is I miss the old kanye
Review was okay but saying, &quot;I would have totally shaved a Hitler &#39;stache but now Kanye made it too mainstream&quot; really showed your true colors. üò¢
Baldie talking like kanye fucked his mom üíÄüíÄ How tf is this so personal
This guy is a joke, like hating Kanye this much when he‚Äôs basically just mentally insane is crazy. Like Kanye clearly just needs help severely and this dude is talking like this is a guy of sound mind and body, get off your fucking high horse you don‚Äôt know better than us
This is going to be a sigificant event in the &#39;theneedledrop&#39; timeline, we will be hearing about this review for centuries to come
This is fair, i never really thought about why you review music, and I totally agree with you. This album does not deserve to be taken seriously, as it just enables a completely delusional man with &quot;great influence&quot; (what&#39;s left of it) to keep making his rounds and being not only anti-semitic but also racist towards black people.
im goiung to go listen to my little forest folk music and be joyous and frollocking i would rathr not listen to mr west thank s you
This is hilarious
I guess the 108 countries with people that made this number 1 on their charts are all summed into 3 groups?
does this guy ever have a good take?
Kanye getting bipolar ratings from a 10 to an unreviewable. Incredible
Stop yapping
#2 fans has flooded the comments üòÇ
It‚Äôs an 8 idc
how many shekels did you get fantano?
The majority of ppl listening to Kanye are not any of those three types<br><br>But if you want to let a vocal minority of dumbass children on instagram trigger you to the point of not even reviewing an album, then I guess that‚Äôs that
I respect fantano for handling the unfair backlash well , ye‚Äôs fans need to get some fresh milk and go to sleep
Surprised he didn‚Äôt pop a blood vessel in this one
Skill issue
review the album unbiased u baby
unlistenable, i agree witchu big dawg this album is poopoo
This is blowing up! Good job Fantano.
Man i genuinely liked the beat and chorus in Back to Me, and Freddie Gibbs did a sick verse, but Ye literally ruins the track by doing some of the worst verses I&#39;ve ever heard from him. Like he&#39;s unbelievably washed, and all the toxicity of his life has genuinely robbed him of his creativity. Sad to see
just rate the music dawg stop yapping
Bald man angry
‚ÄúGrown man has tantrum for 7 minutes‚Äù would be a better title
Dude why the fuck are Kanye fans so pressed that Fantano hates nazi anthems
you absolutely failed as a music reviewer
completely lost ur objectivity as a music reviewer üëé big L nobody wants to hear ur  complaints about anti semitism bullshit stfu nd review music wtf
So what youre saying is, the entire world is hating jews but kanye doing it is wrong.
Fantano is of Sicilian descent
At least u gave Revival a score.üòÇ
Fantano less offended by literal rapist and killers
I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs his worst. Imo this is his best since Pablo
It&#39;s weird how Kanye just stopped making music after My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.<br>Wonder what he&#39;s doing now?
Man will literally review albums from murderers and wife beaters, but this one hurt his feelings too much. How fucking soft can you be? Youre only &quot;job&quot; is to review music. You cant even do that without bitching
You could have not posted any video if you are not going to review and shared the reason on twitter or before the release of album. But you used the hype of album to gain views on this video, and will take revenue off it..not such an ideal person you are melon, ain‚Äôt you?
Sensitive society made a video about you fantano
Music fucking sucks dude
waaaaa waaaa waaaaa baby bald boy
The more music I produce and improve upon, the less I respect him as an artist. Bro makes shoes.
Your examples of ‚Äúantisemetic‚Äù lyrics are really comical.
Bro doing human review
Yaponi Fantano back at it üó£Ô∏èüó£Ô∏è
YOU SHOULD BEG FORGIVENESS
For someone who said they wont review any future Kanye stuff, this looks quite funny
I hate that I actually fuck with the ‚Äúbeautiful big titty women‚Äù track as much as I do. I feel like it‚Äôs a great track so long as you don‚Äôt actually speak English and can‚Äôt tell what the fuck any of it means because musically and sonically it‚Äôs pretty well put together in my opinion. Just a shame it has to be mired down by literally the most insane shit I‚Äôve ever seen in my entire 28 years of existing on this planet as a music enjoyer.<br><br>Ye fans be living ‚Äúin interesting times‚Äù rn for sure.<br><br>Who knows though, maybe they‚Äôll make a 23rd jump street and Ye will rekindle his faith in Judaism. We‚Äôre all counting on you, Jonah Hill!
Thank you Anthony for telling me that Kanye‚Äôs music sounds bad because he‚Äôs a bad person. Great review.
so no one cares when von and other rappers literally kill people and laugh about it on there songs but they care when kanye said the wrong things?
The sole reason for this video is your negative experience with Kanye fans on social media
You are a music reviewer not a political talker + You literally reviewed sexual predators and killers
This guy used to be a professional but he&#39;s become such a rotten person over the years. Acting like a child on twitter, extorting companies for huge amounts of money, and being endlessly self-centred. Hint: I&#39;m not describing Kanye...
Americans making everything about politics and world views back at it again
Why not just make it a not good without talking about any of the controversy, you have a second channel dude.
Jewisshhhhhhh - YE
Damn, they really be disliking the vid
yappin fantano
this guy is so painfully desperate to be liked by everyone it‚Äôs just crazy
That Freddie Gibbs feature tho
Bro only 2 minutes is a Music review
Starting to realize Fantano is a weirdo and Kanye is the one person he doesn‚Äôt mind bashing mindlessly in order to get some clicks when his relevance is fading. Holy shit what a weird fellow.
Yeah, pretty much this
ü§ì
Gotta review the new Mk.gee album
Trying to impress Jews ehn üòÇ Make people aware of the rapist and criminals and murderers you review happily . Kanye eint your father neither does he owes you anything. You&#39;re the one using him for fame and clout
It&#39;s just odd bc personally i don&#39;t think the album is unhinged at all. Most of the album is just going for club bangers with a few cuts taking a different direction. It knows exactly what it is, and i had fun with it. Strong 7 for me.
He&#39;s making them at night
bro get off your high horse and just review the damn record. you ain‚Äôt hasan, u ain‚Äôt destiny. jfc.
eh, imma be real hes pretty far gone. that freddie gibbs verse was fuckin hard tho
I don&#39;t even like Ye but damn Fantano is kinda losing it lmfao
I love how the guy who built a career on ‚ÄúMBDTF is a 6‚Äù is now somehow above reviewing Ye‚Äôs music. Your pathetic bro. But you‚Äôll keep making monetized videos every time Kanye makes headlines. Your not above making money on the guy‚Äôs name but can‚Äôt get yourself to say ‚ÄúBurn‚Äù is a good song ü§°
This is a really weird video to make. The start was good but to say that anyone who likes it is one of three people is reductive. <br><br>I&#39;ll give it to you straight. The album is pretty good. Production is great and there are great tracks. Can I totally separate that from Kanye? No.<br><br>And the sample on Back to Me is awesome.
Review starts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=304">5:04</a>
Bro I&#39;m a Kanye fan who doesn&#39;t really like this album or a lot of the stuff he&#39;s said recently either. But you are clearly letting your opinion of him influence your review.
When you say &quot;Kanye called his girl a reference&quot;, he actually meant his girl looks like a reference to his preference.ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Read the text.
here&#39;s what i think: i gave this album a listen in hopes that it would be good. while there were a few decent songs on it, it was just a dumpster fire. i have always hated ye&#39;s personality. i disagree with his politics and won&#39;t ever defend his actions. however, i still find myself returning to his older music. i don&#39;t know if this makes me a part of the problem.
Haven&#39;t watched a fantano vid since like 2017 but had to see his opinion on this albumüòÇ
came here for an album review, not an analysis on kanye himself
kanye raps a lot about himself and his circumstances. it is impossible to separate his music from his ideas, as it is impossible to unhear the lyrics. i am for separating the art and the artist, but only when the art isn&#39;t such a blatant reflection of the ramblings of a nazi. fantano has done nothing wrong here
He just wanna piss off kanye fans. Hood hottest Princes an 8. But this unrevievable? ü§°ü§°
Chill melon, literally ripping his fans a new one despite the fact that a lot of his fans that aren&#39;t delusional or agree with his opinions.<br><br>Nice to know you&#39;d rather review rapists, pedophiles and murders tho.
Never make another review thanks
Didn&#39;t you say you gave Eminem a low rating on one of his albums because of one of the reasons being &quot;not enough n-words&quot;?
This dude‚Äôs Politics consists of him just virtue signaling. He‚Äôs so cringe üòÇüòÇüòÇ
CRINGE
He also said his wife was his soulmate ‚ù§
Yep
Anthony it would be a 10 if it was called Penetrating the deep blue sea from underground artist Mc HammerCock
Womp womp this album is a 8/10
nah this is the end of fantano fr what a clown
All this is funny coming from the dude spewing hate at Christian‚Äôs on Twitter
Damn the comments are terrible in this video lmao
And Kanye‚Äôs number 1 in the world üòÆ
blud jus hatin üòÇ
My god, so many of these people in this comment section are mentally ill. <br>Have you guys looked up the lyrics to this album? It‚Äôs actually horrendous
bro youre not supposed to review kanye youre supposed to review the album üíÄüíÄ
this is the first time i‚Äôve seen him this angry/disappointed
Fantano the type of music listener to not be able to separate art from artist
clown yo old
I been watching you since the mbdtf review and you‚Äôre def upset lol cause you say this but reviewed burzum ? cmon melon head
I cannot possibly take this seriously from the guy who gave a burzum album the same rating as dark fantasy
Dude the majority of Kanye fans are normal thinking humans like me who just love and appreciate Kanyes music but don‚Äôt approve/like/defend everything this bipolar mf does üíÄ <br><br>Tbh it‚Äôs kinda mean &amp; unfair to put millions of people in 3 equally terrible categories. <br>I actually agree with many of your points about him but you seem way too emotional and triggered to take you seriously
Let the record show that a Kanye West album has officially been given the same score as Limp Bizkit&#39;s Gold Cobra. There&#39;s something so fitting about this
which is why you‚Äôre divorced
you review music, get off your moral police bullshit fantano
i think bro doesnt know how to separate art from the artist
Stop yappin
god i hate you so much
Dude ruined his music credibility when he gave Donda a 7 and Clb a 3 in the same week, music fans realised he is weak and follows trends. Kanye fans will never accept anything he says because Drake was the benchmark then and now it&#39;s sexy redd . This album was  terrible btw
Kanye had always been my favorite music artist because what he did was interesting. Even when he was abrasive, arrogant, condescending, an asshole, etc., I loved listening to his productions because nobody did it like him. Same goes for his writing and flow to an extent as well.<br><br>However, Vultures isn‚Äôt doing that. What he‚Äôs saying isn‚Äôt interesting. What he‚Äôs doing isn‚Äôt interesting. It‚Äôs just garbage. And it‚Äôs offensive garbage at that. And, no, it‚Äôs not offensive in the entertaining way it sometimes was in the past either.<br><br>Like, I didn‚Äôt <b>love</b> Jesus Is King or DONDA in the same way I did his older music, but I was at least content with how it retained what I felt was the Kanye flair. Unfortunately, that seems lost now.
I feel so validated these Kanye fans are out of their mind<br>Most of the record is mid or just bad<br>And the songs that are good are badly mixed so it doesn‚Äôt have any punch at all<br><br>Like Carnaval I‚Äôd rather listen to Mo Bamba and I don‚Äôt even like that song all to much<br><br>Or Fuck Sumn just gets ruined by the chipmunk vocals and people are out here calling it the best track just plugging their ears for that second<br><br>The only song I did genuinely like is Burn but one good song doesn‚Äôt make the album good<br><br>For me it is a 4/10 even if Kanye going full Nazi wouldn‚Äôt have happened
Just do a damn review, ur nobody teacher.
Appreciate you sharing your opinion, it was interesting to listen to
I see people in the comments saying that fantano has made music about criminal and gave david bowies albums a 10/10 and he said anti semite things before.<br><br>Firstly, I&#39;d argue that kanye has caused more harm than any or these rappers or &quot;criminals&quot;. Kanye caused antisemite violence to spike up a bit. From a forbes article, 32 counts of anti semite vile occured because of kanye. Thats excluding the other stuff you could find about what kanye has inspired in people. Sure kanye didnt directly kill or hurt others but he was linked to the cause of such actions. I don&#39;t think fantano has reviewed anyone who has really done more harm, at least not to my knowledge. I also would like to know who these &quot;criminals&quot; fantano reviewed are because just cause someones commits a crime doesnt inherently make them evil.<br><br>The david bowie comparison is one ive seen a bit. Again though, kanye has said worse than david bowie did AND david was supposedly on a fuck load of cocaine at the time. He also apologized and regretted saying those things. To my knowledge, I dont think david has ever gone out and said &quot;I looooooovvvvvveeeeee hitleeeeerrrrrrrr&quot; so I dont think he is as bad. <br><br>Its just weird seeing so many people get mad at melon for not wanting to review this album. Why are we all of a sudden defending kanye for releasing a shitty album? I truly do think people love for kanye is just blinding at this point.
Reading the comments to this review and my dog will not shut up with the barking what&#39;s with that?
Ur so whack
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=334">5:34</a> accidental n word drop
Bro more delusional than Kanye üò≠
To pimp a vulture
just review it
Better then anything playboycarti will ever make
i‚Äôve never seen you miss harder
blud knew he couldn‚Äôt give it more than 10 so he gave it ‚Äúunreviewable‚Äù
If ye was contributing to the genocide in palestine you wouldve given the album a 10
Incredible how pretty much EVERYONE is calling this album bad yet when he does it all of a sudden people are butthurt üòÇ
same guy who rated the sexy red album over utopia btw. but this is &quot;unreviewable&quot;
you choose u didn‚Äôt like this album before it even released because of political reasons<br>also what u said about bianca is bs she‚Äôs beem having these type of outfits since her modeling days
bro is reviewing kanye fans rather than the album
conflicted conflicted conflicted
Great take on the three types of current fans. It‚Äôs sad to see
Thank you for pointing out your own flaw. You are a music reviewer. We are here to hear you describe how the music SOUNDS and what you think of those SOUNDS. Maybe even describe the sound of each track or standout tracks. Instead what we get is a political / moral virtue shpiel no one asked for. If you don‚Äôt know how to separate the art from the artists, even when the lyrics are questionable, don‚Äôt listen to GG allin. The lyrics could be the most horrific thing ever, that doesn‚Äôt make the music inherently bad or unlistenable. It‚Äôs really surprising how the fader piece turned you from a music reviewer to a partisan hacksaw.
You&#39;ve reviewed albums of pedophiles, murderers,facist, racists,anti trans /homophoes  and literal Zionist ..also I love your hilter stash while finger waving Kanye&#39;s anti semitismüíÄü´µ
I am a Kanye fan, and I accept all the criticism about Kanye has a person. Hes batsh!t crazy. But the fact you couldn&#39;t cough up one good thing about the albums just proves youre not actually reviewing the album, youre just reviewing Kanye. And to compare this Album to Donda before comparing it to Yeezus or MBDTF is absolutely insane.
Huh? Incredible album
I agree. But ngl, I wish y‚Äôall tweaked as hard y‚Äôall do abt Jews abt black ppl when they speak on us. <br>ü´≥üèæüé§
Lol you‚Äôre so corny man
Kanye went from rapping about being self concious to comparing himself to literal sex offenders. What a lifeüòÇ
the thing is you had no problems reviewing Ye and giving it an 8 after the slavery is a choice comments. double standards af
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=423">7:03</a> tears in his eyesüíÄüò≠
I had a feeling he would do something like this. Predictable
I‚Äôm not even going to listen to this guy this time. What a disappointing take from the jump‚Ä¶
Ye is such a Genius critics can not even understand his music anymore wow wow Mr West wow
Fantano. I still like some of the songs on the album i am sorry  üòî
I spot some hypocrisy in your review just like the blank spots you have in your melon head
Absolutely
Hot take I agree with eveything he said but  still think the album is pretty good
Even though the album wsdnt that great the reason I love Kanye is the impact he had in my life the creative process the message he wanted to convey troughout his albums. I also think people around effects him negatively
The album was fantastic. You clearly have a conflict of interest keeping you from having an unbiased opinion
If Sexyy Redd made Vultures and was Antisemitic you would&#39;ve given it an 8
For being such an chronically online and experienced internet troll bro for sure gets triggered easilyüíÄ
What about the North West track?? Burn? Carnival? Beg forgiveness? Good (don&#39;t die)? Is everything here really unreviewable?
The salty ye fans in the comments are hilarious
Excuse me, how exactly is Jesus is King an unhinged album? It&#39;s probably the most hinged album he has ever released. It knows what it is and does not pretend to care about people who don&#39;t care about Christianity
Fellas. Does it really matter that this random guy doesn&#39;t like some other guy?
If it was named &quot;To pimp a Vulture&quot; you&#39;d give it a 10
üß¢üß¢üß¢
Album is mid at best, and a badly produced non creative mix of a bunch of different ideas glued together at worst. His fans don‚Äôt have a good comparison of what a good hero is so anything he makes ‚Äúsounds‚Äù good to them
This guy fell off
Yeaaaa he&#39;s jew...(just kidding, good Review tbh)
Homie saying all this and gonna go turn on some Mayhem later
Uh oh, Melon finally having a mental breakdown about Kanye
See the issue with this video is where your stated goals when doing a review actually require you to have some sort of influence on what people who listen to hip hop think and yet you should consider a new career because you have become one of the most discredited reviewers in the game and dogged on Kanye way before any antisemitism. Also categorizing whole swaths of his fans as cult members instead of people who enjoy things like his production or his older work is kinda ridiculous and pettyüòÇ
Platform everybody, coward
2 minutes of reviewing or criticizing music 5 minutes of just talking about how ye is antisemitic and a nazi &amp; talking about his opinions on politics
Low t behavior
Sold almost $20 million in $20 merch in 24 hours and the album is #1 in 100 countries. I&#39;d be fuming if I hated the man too. üòÇ
womp womp
blud 100% percent was head banging to back 2 me
The album is a fun time, it&#39;s not that deep bro you review Chris Brown who beats women lmao
I think watching you unravel over Kanye is pretty funny.
atleast he has a wife
We&#39;ve finally found the level below NOT GOOD
I guess he was not entertained üî•
But you‚Äôve reviewed burzum and metal bands that have burned churches. He doesn‚Äôt agree with you politics and that‚Äôs why you didn‚Äôt review it. I‚Äôm not saying that it‚Äôs a good album because honestly I didn‚Äôt like it to much but I think your logic is a bit skewed. Respectfully of course.
Why is Anthony yapping about jews and apologizing? I thought you were here to review the album, mr &quot;internets busiest music nerd&quot;. Busiest music yapper.
Nah dawg. I don&#39;t gravitate towards any of the 3 restrictive groups of fans you bucketed up, Fantano. There is a fourth: old fans who think the artist is a fucking idiot and am pissed at how he&#39;s immolated his reputation with his antisemitic bullshit. But I still find it possible to detangle music from person. I still listen to Michael Jackson from time to time unironically, I still watch movies that Shia LaBeouf&#39;s in, I still laugh at Chappelle. That doesn&#39;t make me any of the above demographics, it just makes me the demographic that does not participate in cancel culture. We are a MASSIVE demographic. We&#39;re not obsessed with Kanye, for what it&#39;s worth I haven&#39;t made my mind up yet about whether or not I like this album (so far, it&#39;s a very mixed bag, tbh, but Ty Dolla $ign is putting some interesting sections out, both PAID and BACK TO ME are bangers from a production perspective even if, as u say, the bars are cheap.) A whole team of people made this. Good or bad, you CAN review and listen to music by a cancelled artist and not be a neo nazi racist hater or obsessive fan. I understand why YOU reviewing it might be &quot;irresponsible&quot; given your platform as an influencer. But that doesn&#39;t apply to the rest of us. Stop ignoring the fact that there&#39;s a 4th group.
Homie was supposed to review a fucking album and instead went on a seven minute rant about everything related to Kanye except the fucking music. Your not a fucking news channel or left wing journalist bro I don‚Äôt know who told you that anyone gives a fuck about or needs your opinion on anything but music. Unfollowed
Bro relax Kim Kardashian isn‚Äôt gonna let you hitüíÄüíÄ
Then don‚Äôt review it. Don‚Äôt give it attention lil bro but you need views ??
At least he has a wife ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
broken this man
First of all fix your goddamn greenscreenüíÄüíÄ
Sounds like a guy who didn‚Äôt see Kanye live in Orlando ü§£
Do you know what I‚Äôm not surprised üòÇ this is the same man who gave the new Sexy Redd a strong 8 üòÇ he says what‚Äôs acceptable to say these days and tows the line. Idk why anyone is surprised by this anymore üòÇ bro couldn‚Äôt even stay on topic and talk about the music without spewing the word ‚ÄúAnti Semite‚Äù every 2 seconds to try and hide the fact he‚Äôs a salty hater üòÇ
He has officially lost itüê∂üíî
I hate what Kanye has said no doubt, but I find it strange you are so quick to hate on Kanye fans for the actions of the artist, when you yourself are a fan on The Wu Tang Clan, who are responsible for the sale of drugs, illegal guns, weapons possession, murder, carjackings, and other types of violent crimes. Just seems hypocritical to judge people for separating art from the artist when you‚Äôre doing it yourself
The face of reality and honesty, thank you Melon. This is the same fandom that accuses swifties to be annoying, then they do the exact same shit but worst, because at least they don&#39;t endorse a fucking antisemite.
biggest yapper of the year
you are a disgrace
Yoooooooo imma 3! That&#39;s crazy how smart you are everything you say is on point can&#39;t lie.
you thought you ate but you shitted yourself instead
Did Fantano stop reviewing Kanye albums after he said ‚Äúslavery was a choice‚Äù ? Did he think about how his blk fans would feel ? No he didn‚Äôt. All of a sudden this is ‚Äúunreviewable‚Äù lol whatever this dude‚Äôs opinion has no merit anyway, he gave MBDTF a 6 or something.
ever since melon got accused of being alt-right and racist in that FADER magazine article he‚Äôs really made sure to be careful and not associate himself with that shit, <br>dont blame him tho
Are you reviewing the album or him personally? Sounds like you hate someone you&#39;ve never met mate
So if I listen to Kanye I‚Äôm an anti semite now ?
bro is not beating the sexy red allegations anytime soon after this
‚ÄúI think he‚Äôs a mummy. Why won‚Äôt he bleed.‚Äù
L take
I bet if the album was called HAIRS you would have gave it a 10
Still buck broken so many years after the fader incident. Never Change fandango. What a sorry loser...
these comments making me grin... they&#39;r all like &quot;ooh quit yapping and talking oooh i am going to admit that i left a comment without watching the whole video&quot;
It would be interesting to see the like to dislike ratio on this video
you is trash
Zzzzzzz
Virtue signalling at its best
My man tries so hard to be different üò≠
Kanye stans are some of the most degenerate members of society I&#39;ve ever come across. I couldn&#39;t imagine being obsessed with some of the most lukewarm, entry level garbage 200 people wrote, doesn&#39;t show it, and can&#39;t go 5 minutes without Ye spouting some of the most cringeworthy bars or bitching about why no one likes him; that they whiteknight him like the sex-starved incels they are.
Hypocrity hyptano
Music so bad ecen the green screen don‚Äôt want nothing to do with ut
4th kanye fan: The disappointed old fans who genuinely hope he gets help.
I Love Kanyes first 6 albums as a producer myself. This one was dissapointing. I miss the old Kanye üòÇ
How does fantano not see irony in some of these tracks. This album is so lit and I‚Äôm not on an island saying that. You just love to hate ye. I‚Äôve been tired of your contrived approach to musical taste for a good year now and you sealed the deal with this one. See ya ü´°
get some bitches
lets all unsubscribe until anthony starts reviewing music again.
honestly after watching this video i now completely understand where you‚Äôre coming from. for quite a while i had an issue with you being upset at kanye for his remarks solely because in the past you‚Äôve positively rated a peste noire album (you specifically gave it a 7) and i have seen copies of filosifum, aske, and det som engang var, all by burzum, on your record shelves. both of these projects were created by nazis, but the key difference is that, at least on the records mentioned, nazi rhetoric is not mentioned at all, therefore allowing the art to be separated by the artists‚Äô actions. my dumbass should‚Äôve realized the moment kanye dropped the single vultures, i should have thought ‚Äúwell, i can‚Äôt really separate kanye from his words because he‚Äôs bringing it into his music‚Äù. people shit on you too much, sometimes i understand, but in this instance you are totally correct. thanks for the insightful video
I‚Äôm terrified of what this comment section might hold
Dawg could you just review the fucking album ? No one gives a fuck about your political opinion on wtf he says and does. Your supposed to review the fucking music. Nothing else. If you hate Kanye so much as a person at this point just don‚Äôt review his shit but don‚Äôt just make a hate rant video cause your so butthurt about his viewpoints outside of music that you can‚Äôt objectively judge the music anymore
We love you Melon!!! Ye&#39;s lyrics have taken a catastrophic downfall
Bro this dude gotta be one of the most dedicated hater‚Äôs out there
Lemon probably bumps R Kelly non stop
this actually perfectly sums up my thoughts on kanye ngl
Melon punching the air right now
are you jew?
I‚Äôm gonna be honest this is unironically a 8/10. It‚Äôs a fun album.
Bro is turning to swiftie so fast that is indeed unbelievable
If Fantano won‚Äôt review it for moral reasons, it‚Äôs gotta be fire.
the category 2 thing he was talking about is real
Hoodrat is good (ngl I thought it was produced by Jpegmafia when i first heard it)<br>Two other tracks I liked was King And Burn<br><br>Other than that, yes <br>The album trash
unwatchable video
If you&#39;re here for an album review, start at about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=262">4:22</a>
But beautifulbigtittybuttnakedwomendontfalloutheskyyouknow¬ø
I thought u r just a music nerd why r u bringing politics init
üòÇ cope harder melon
K dude you&#39;re just hating now keep your politics away from music reviews atleast on your main channel
lol.... better blacklist every rapper thats bodied someone before ! better blacklist all the RICO charged rappers ! no Cardi B she used to rob men in one night stands !! you hate to see success - be humble bro...........
You can review rapist‚Äôs and murderer‚Äôs music with lyrics about rape and murder but stop at racism??? Bitch made
Anthony you can still be politically correct while liking a few Kanye songs
Aaaaand you still made a video about it.<br><br>Stop giving this overrated, garbage music figure any attention.
well I like the album and I don&#39;t like juice either so.
If Fantano were to rereview The College Dropout he would probably give it a light 1
GO,GO,GO,GO,GO‚Ä¶
but Anthony, beautiful big tiddy butt naked women just dont fall out the sky you know??
No wonder your wife left you üòÇ
Framing and labeling all his fans. Classy!
Your a waste of oxygen
This baldie is just mad about YE politics. SAD!!!
<b>The review in a nutshell:</b><br><br>&quot;This album is unbearable trash and kanye&#39;s worst album but i will refuse to elaborate on why it&#39;s bad because I don&#39;t wanna review it. But I will review the album&#39;s 2 weakest songs and continue talking about Kanye&#39;s politics and his fans but the album, also if you liked this album, you are either a Kanye cult member, a neo nazi or an edgy teen with no friends&quot;<br><br>edit: YouTube won&#39;t let me reply to comments below, so here;<br>I&#39;ve been watching fantano for years, he&#39;s a good guy but this ain&#39;t it. I&#39;m not even much of a kanye fan, but I kinda enjoyed the album, It&#39;s nothing great but it was a really fun listen and I see myself going back to it, But considering Fantano&#39;s argument on why he gave sexy red such a high score, this is just hypocrisy.<br><br> if fantano didn&#39;t wanna review it then just don&#39;t do it rather than making a video literally spending more time addressing twitter trolls than talking about why he doesn&#39;t like the music. He said like 3 things about the music itself , 90% of the video was just him making personal attacks and freaking out at people for enjoying the album.<br><br>&quot;Business is Business&quot; isn‚Äôt considered ‚Äúunreviewable‚Äù even though Thug is currently fighting a genuine RICO case. It‚Äôs dumb. He‚Äôs always been hypocritical like this. He‚Äôll review a murderer‚Äôs music, and music that murderers listen to, but ‚Äúoffensive‚Äù language towards certain groups he won‚Äôt tolerate. <br><br>Also, the lines about jews aren&#39;t even antisemitic, it&#39;s only addressing the controversies or making jokes about it.
fantano yap session bro not even talking about nun
Kinda sad that there&#39;s this many people defending Ye&#39;s nazi arc, Jesus Christ what&#39;s wrong with y&#39;all
We&#39;re here for the music fantano, keep it about the music
I‚Äôm not gonna say what kind of reviewer made this video‚Ä¶ it was a Jewish reviewer üòÖ
This is an embarrassing video.
damn fantano fell off
i agree with you
You just waste oxygone for 7 minutes
It‚Äôs unreviewable, but you reviewed it? Please choose a side, either ignore the album or do a full review.
Thanks for the sanctimonious speech Anthony, you should start talking to that Johnathan Goldstriker guy again I think it would help you.
He unleashed the villain arc after getting divorced and giving Sexy Red an 8
Nah but keep banging music made by murderers rapists gangbangers and fentanyl pushers, we draw the line at antisemitic remarks tho üôÑ ye hasnt said anything plenty of other people in the entertainment industry havent said before
imagine being so soy that you can&#39;t review an album(would probably review an album if someone did something far worse).
Holy this is a whole manifesto
best teeth in the game
Do I hear a white man criticizing a black man during black history month? ü§®üòÇüòÇü§°
You‚Äôre pathetic
why you hatin off rip ik its Ye but seperate the art from the artist, grow a pair
bro at this point ur just making music a math problem, just enjoy it for god sake
Kanye is the only artist to get a review as a human. You don&#39;t like things he&#39;s said...okay...you&#39;ve reviewed artists who have raped and murdered people without ever bringing it up. I understand the engagement angle but have a modicum of shame before mounting your high ass horse. You&#39;re a music critic, not a morale compass.
Do your job
Holy shit fantano you‚Äôre a music critic not a politician. Just review the damn music. Your words will not change anyone‚Äôs opinion on him. This is so pointless. Review the fuckin sound waves. Stop trying to be so damn righteous all the time no one is gonna cancel you.
Kanye is a terrible person, a womanizer, antisemite, crazy, and out of control Fanono is right.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>But he made graduation.üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üêª
I agree with this. I‚Äôm normally good at separating art from artist and have done this multiple times with Ye‚Äôs music in the past but I‚Äôm struggling with this one because there‚Äôs so much antisemitism and hate in the lyrics that I literally can‚Äôt enjoy this album
If this is unreviewable, then what music do you suggest us listening to then?
Oh brother üôÑ
Anthony, you forgot about the category of Kanye fans who agree that his behavior is unacceptable and pray every single day that he will turn it around üò≠üôè
lol so many kanye fans mad in these comments
this album is not good and anthony fantano has completely lost his mind
Kanye living in his head rent free ü§£ü§£
cornball. it‚Äôs always these fake-woke white dudes that swear they‚Äôre not racist‚Ä¶ yet tell black people what they can and can‚Äôt say. sounds parallel to a certain era of time in America which black people had to break free from.
review the music not the man is it that fucking hard I swear
I miss the old kanye. That&#39;s all.
The hypocrisy in this video is insane.
‚Äúunreviewable trash‚Äù<br><br>proceeds to review for 7 minutes for the ad revenue
32k/22k likes ratio is crazy
Just review the album wtf is this political brainrot
He&#39;s goated
W YE AND W TY WE ARE THE VULTURES ü¶Öü¶Öü¶Ö
Talkin&#39; shit bout Bianca when yo wifie divorced You is the real jokey joke üíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ
I was shocked you even went live to listen to it (i didn&#39;t watch, sorry) . Being a fan of your reviews, i was hoping you would skip it all together and not give it any spotlight.
Unsubscribe - no taste just my op
Sincere question: Is Fantano Jewish?
this might be your best review thus far
Melon has surpassed the levels of corny I thought were unachievable
I don‚Äôt like Kanye but You insulted his fans and his wife as part of the review when she wasn‚Äôt involved. Is your wife any better? Oh wait.
It‚Äôs funny and weird to take any review of a black rapper or  about any music from white Urkle ‚Ä¶.smh
i will never wish death on anybody, but this guy makes me so fuckin pissed off bro .
Kanye new album is trash
Just a hater
Horrible vid
Kanye is severely mentally ill, so his &quot;antisemitism&quot; is questionable. Let&#39;s see how problematic he remains if he ever accepts help.
this thing is his best work in a looooong time!!! if your channel is about reviewing music, REVIEW MUSIC!
The greatest melon man &quot;review&quot;
It is okay to be an actual killer, murdering people as a member of a gang, Fantano will review you unbiased, but you say you dont like Jews and its the end of the world?? Is not liking jews worse than literal murder??
He&#39;s started his emo vlog apparently.
Anthony you really are so sensitive bro just review it stop bitching.ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
finally people are seeing this guy for the yapper he is, he allows his politics blind him from objectivity
3 first songs are bad
Womp Womp Melon gave MBDTF A 6 he‚Äôs clearly a Kanye hater from the jump
Then why make a video about it? If you don‚Äôt want to review it then don‚Äôt review it, it‚Äôs that simple. Don‚Äôt profit off of something you find so egregious. Don‚Äôt attempt to publicly posit yourself as virtuous while using this as a platform for your brand &amp; inevitably promoting the very thing you‚Äôre so against. It‚Äôs disingenuous and you know it.
We can shit on Kanye all day, but can we keep that same energy for Kendrick, Jay Electronica, Ice Cube and dozens of others that support the Nation of Islam and Farrakhan? It‚Äôs stupid to believe Kanye got these conspiracy theories and views from listening to white supremacists, it just happens to intersect with it.<br><br>He literally named Ice Cube as his inspiration for the antisemitism, it‚Äôs blatant as day who he‚Äôs listening to when coming up with this. Kanye is the loudest voice and the most relevant, but he‚Äôs far from the only artist that peddles this junk, he‚Äôs just more blatant about it.
bros balding
Why is this bum relevant?
actually insane how so many of kanye&#39;s fans are nonchalant about the fact that he&#39;s a nazi
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=320">5:20</a> same guy that likes sexy red btw
i knew he would rate kanye as a person instead of the album
Fantano just ate this album didn‚Äôt even try to taste it. üòÇ
agree. kanyes worst work.
You&#39;ve gone too far
Maybe you never read this comment but Recently you‚Äôve been on this thing of hating Kanye. Which is cool because it‚Äôs your opinion but it‚Äôs really damaging your brand because it‚Äôs clear you can‚Äôt be objective when making reviews. Music is subjective but what made your reviews dope was they seemed analytical. It‚Äôs also unfair that your personal opinion of Kanye means Ty Dolla doesn‚Äôt even get some recognition from you at all. But carry on having fun making fun of the album. Just helps it be more successful.
Weak mental melon boy
yap
Unfortunately Amazing: <br>- TALKING<br><br>Good:<br>- DO IT<br>- BURN<br>- BEG FORGIVENESS<br>- PROBLEMATIC<br><br>Good with a trash Ye verse: <br>- FUK SUMN<br><br>Forgettable:<br>- BACK TO ME<br>- PAPERWORK<br>- VULTURES <br><br>Trash: <br>- STARS<br>- KEYS TO MY LIFE <br>- PAID<br>- HOODRAT<br>- CARNIVAL <br>- GOOD (DON&#39;T DIE)<br>- KING<br><br>Antisemitic:<br>- STARS<br>- VULTURES <br>- PROBLEMATIC<br>- KING
BRO HE LOOKS LIKE HITLER
So many pissed Kanye fans here lmfao
Is there a kind of fan that strongly disagrees with everything kanye has done in the last year but can still enjoy his music? I&#39;m not saying this album is good, fs it&#39;s his worst or second worst album, but there are some highlights. Obviously what ye has said and done recently is very problematic and with how influential he is, his rhetoric (that I&#39;m not even sure he himself believes) is creating bigots, but if I think a song is good then I think a song is good. I feel like there&#39;s a difference between being delusional and either blindly ignoring or agreeing with what he said because you enjoy his music, and listening to his music but rolling your eyes whenever he says some stupid ignorant shit.
Guys, he&#39;s morally grandstanding again.
This guy is the #1 jew defender. They might be minority but they dont need your help.
Dude needed to pull up receipts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=46">0:46</a>.<br>Anthony just get over yourself and review music fairly. Cardi B was a professional whore before her ‚Äúmusical career‚Äù, and she got a Grammy OVER TRAVIS. Just grow up old man.
Melon sold out. How much did Pizza Hut pay him to shave their logo directly onto his face?
Gonna cry?
this is the start of your falloff, melonhead.
Compared to every other kanye Album vultures is trash. For real üòÇ
You&#39;ve reviewed music from people with MUCH worse morals/ethics, why draw the line here???
Instead of reviewing you called his wife dumb and ugly and called anyone that likes Kanye‚Äôs music retarded, psycho, and part of a cult. Nice work üò¢
Who would win in a fight, swifty army or ye army?
This is so disappointing seeing how we can‚Äôt all just appreciate some decent tracks and realize Kanye is never going to be the ‚Äúold Kanye‚Äù. Fantano needs to review the music, if it‚Äôs music it‚Äôs not ‚Äúunreviewable‚Äù. We can all agree Kanye‚Äôs political takes are bad and a bunch of his fans are just natzis who bandwagoned his comments, but man Burn is a good song. I‚Äôm sad that I‚Äôm leaning towards the side full of trolls and diehard fans but this really isn‚Äôt as bad as you say, and chocking up all Kanye fans to three categories is crazy. The irony of Fantano commenting on how political the music is and at the same time only talking about Kanye politically is nothing shy of ominous. I came looking for an honest review and got lectured, you suck.
Not reviewing based on the objective released music is a huge cop out... walking towards irrelevance when you don&#39;t do your job.
Fantano looks fucking drained. He wanted to like this so bad I bet. Kanye being an anti-semite doesn&#39;t help...
If this album was to pimp a vultures 1 it was a 10
Bro is just yapping
Anthology Fantasia you sound like a hater
Firts ever reviewer to post a twitter rant on youtube somehow. Really shows how much you care about the music itself and not just getting hype and money from this shit
stop supporting genocide
Most biased hater shit I‚Äôve ever seen from you yet. Do better.
You need Jesus üòÇ
If the hoodrat beat had been copied and pasted onto a Peggy album he‚Äôd be raving about it lmao
The internet needs a new &quot;busiest music nerd&quot; because over the past few years it&#39;s been clear you care more about politics than music.
fellas is it anti semetic to like a song
I dont like Kanye or his beleifs but holy fuck you gotta chill a lil.
stop bitchin
The album is mid
cringe
We&#39;re here to listen to your opinion about music, not your political comments.
Kanye the greatest. You‚Äôre just some bald guy. Lol Tf
Kanye fans out here proving Fantano right in the comments
I miss the old Kanye‚Ä¶
This dude and virtue signaling, name a more iconic duo
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4">0:00</a><br>The hairline is crazy
nah. ur too triggered to focus on the music.
i officially don‚Äôt value fantano‚Äôs opinions at all anymore
fantano gotta stop being an npc voice for the npcs
Un private your subreddit coward
The jews dont need u as their defence minister. But the alt left still need ur help
I&#39;m beyond disappointed that he didn&#39;t give the album a fair chance and just decided to virtue signal. Kanye is a musician that makes entertainment. Only an idiot would take anything he says seriously. The album isn&#39;t his best but there are good songs, production, verses, and guests. To say otherwise is to be disingenuous.<br>7/10
It went #1 in Israel... ü§£
You can like Kanyes music but not agree with what he says. Seperate the art from the artist
All this cause he&#39;s mad someone else is clapping his ex cheeks
He did the &quot;I&#39;m emotional&quot; camera grab
You‚Äôre a sad little man Tony
I very much enjoyed this album
people still listen to this melon?
love sjw cringlords like this guy
I look at the whole trajectory like this; Kanye‚Äôs mind is in a weird, weird fucking place. He is hurting and coping in his own fucked up way. But beacause his head is from another world, his music is aswell. Unearthly. And it is still mesmerizing to be able to listen to it, depsite all the weird shit he does. So thats kind of how Im able to seperate the two. So Im kind of in box 2, ‚Äònihilistic teenager‚Äô even though Im am not a teenager AntonyüëçüòÇ.
Yap yap
if the album was called to pimp a vulture he would give it a 10
My guy you literally reviewed music made by convicted criminalls , murderes , homophobes and this is were we draw the line. I aint defending kanye for what he has said but it is just straight hypocrisy coming from you.
The fact that he will review an album of a rapper who has actually killed people but as soon as Kanye MIGHT be an antisemite bro does this
Dude, are you really sure about pigeonholing everyone who listens to the album in one of those three categories? When you see music from this album bumping in the clubs, would you think everyone there is a nihilistic teenager or a bad person? How can you not understand by now that music as a medium, at least on its mainstream level, does not cultivate the most thoughtful or critical audience? Most people listening to the album will just be normal people vibing, not caring about the lyrics or even the artist&#39;s past controversies.
get a load of this guy üò≠üôè
i can hear the soylent sizzling in your veins
The fact that there are rappers who are literally murders and get less hate than Kanye is insane. Other than that, Kanye fell off as a rapper (he still has glimpses, but then he just uses that weird high pitch voice too often now). I still like the producing side of Kanye, but the album had way too much Ty Dolla Sign on it, he is just monotone.<br><br>Certainly not one of Kanyes best albums, but i still enjoy this more than the BS mumble rappers who are popular right now.
Ok but was the album good tho
This has been the worst review of all-time.
It‚Äôs the #1 record in Israel, brother. Typical, baiting NoFuntano. Made sure to monetize the non review while engaging Twitter trolls.  Gave MBDTF a 6. Just stick to the Indy reviews.
Keep yapping
Ol Oglee hitler loookin Ah Wigg
The day you start to review music based on your personal view of the artist is the day your critical opinion no longer holds its weight.
you really rumbled the feathers of the 12 year old suburban white kids with this one
Hmmm<br><br><br>Fair tbh...cant hate ure opinion..
This guy has to be Jewish
Y‚Äôall he‚Äôs prob just tryna get as much watch time out of us as possible
My favorite game in this comment section is finding people hating this video and managing to perfectly fit them into one or more of the 3 Kanye Fan types. Fits like a glove. Bonus points if they try to argue they&#39;re being pigeonholed as they portray traits from one of the 3 fan types.
Bro Kanye is moving closer to death grips tier every production
Libthony Cucktano back at it<br><br>Just replace &#39;jew&#39; with &#39;police officer&#39; in the albums lyrics if it helps you tow the party line bro<br><br>&#39;I CanT sEpeRaTe ArTiSts FrOm thE ArT if iTs in ThE lyRiCs&#39;<br><br>I&#39;d rather be a billionare jew in this album than the man kendrick murdered in his 10/10 reviewed albums
It&#39;s surprising that Frank Ocean has so many trumpist fans...
Haters in shambles they stay lickin the peanuts outta my shiet
New potential most disliked video of 2024 just dripped
Melon will call this trash but convince himself that Death Grips is genius. no one takes mr potato head seriously come on
So if i like the glorious ty $ vocals, the majestic production of many songs in the album, dont really listen to the lyrics beyond certain specific cases, and think this is a good album because im a fan of Kanye&#39;s music beyond his own personality, im either a Nazi or a dumb teenager... Of course...
Review music as if it was Beethoven and whatever they said doesn&#39;t matter cuz you only hear the music.
Endless yap Session
avoiding on a whole another level
King von can murder 23 people but kanye says some shit and hes unreviewable
Melon has become too far-left to have an unbiased opinion.
Your lips are running from your nose.
Fantano won&#39;t be reviewing this record for ethical reasons, but still wants to upload a controversial video about it because of the money
Bro is big Kanye hater
It&#39;s 100% phoned in and it is Kanye&#39;s worst
when fantano gives a 10 you are the best in the game
I dont know what to do i like his music
GO GO GO GO
yedolf stans mad
Looks like most of the comments are from the #2 kind of fansüòÇ
This album is legit the big day but with a tad bit better beats lmao, ye is off his rocker lmao. Listen if you just want to laugh at some shitty bars lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=327">5:27</a> for the fake smile thats hiding furious anger
üòü
Kanye keeps innovating so much that it leaves people stunned &quot;unreviewable&quot;
mf only talked about 3 tracks, the ones he hated and would support his hate for ye. I mean the album is not perfect but why you ignoring the good parts of the record ?
This man is so far in the minority of the opinion of this album. Vultures goes hard af. Kanye broke this man lmao
Thank you for your video, as always, you gave a well-reasoned answer. Kanye has crazy fanatics
This is the closest I‚Äôll get to listening to the horrid man or his terrible album
you didnt even review the album
The album was horrible.
anthony fantano<br>- doesnt review the album for its music  in a so called &quot;music review&quot;<br>- claims this is the case since doesnt want to review music made by &quot;immoral&quot; people<br>- claims kanye only treats his wife as an object<br>HOWEVER<br>- fantano has reviewed albums from rappers with actual criminal records like x and benny the butcher<br>- calls kanyes wife a &quot;knock off kim kardashian&quot;<br><br>where do your morals lie?
came here for an honest review but quickly i realized you cannot put your hatred aside and do an honest review. nobodyy cares what u say anywayy
Keep queefing
Carnival is too fire
U JEALOUS AS FUCK ABOUT HIS WIFE BRO !!
U funny bald man
I feel you neglected to consider black fans whom feel empathy for serious chronic mental illness might see a retreat from public life and an apology as significant. <br><br>We see how willing white folks are to trash a black artist down to his family in defense of other white people as more hateful than having a mental health crisis and apologizing, dealing with real consequences and persevering.<br><br> It&#39;s kind of obvious how being hateful of a mentally ill black person is always easier and safer than saying nothing or taking time to understand that black people don&#39;t have the luxury of making mistakes like white people, even if they say delusional things in a mental health crisis and apologize.<br><br>You might not realize how this hateful review and a bunch of others, especially those by other black people, perpetuate stereotypes and stigmatize black people with mental illness as competently bad and evil. <br><br> Man, I like your vids, you put me on to good stuff, I even like when I don&#39;t agree with you, but this is just personally hostile and not about music. It&#39;s your right to say it, but man, this is more racist and hate/fear-mongering/stigmatizing of mental illness and people with it than anything. <br><br>That&#39;s why this felt more like an attack on me and people like me than you probably realize. <br><br>That&#39;s why I and other black folks stand with him, especially if he can apologize. <br><br>You probably don&#39;t care, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be giving you another view without an apology to people of color and people with mental illness.<br><br>You might laugh at that suggestion, but I hope you think more about what&#39;s going on here.<br><br>Sorry about the jerks.
CRAZY<br>BIPOLAR<br>ANTISEMITE<br><br><br>AND IM STILL THE KING
You&#39;ve reviewed artists who have committed literal crimes and have spat on other religions. You could&#39;ve just ignored this record but because Kanye gives you views you had to make a video? It&#39;s actually idiotic and very hypocritical. What? Fans would&#39;ve been nagging you to review it? Put your morals ahead of what some fans may say then instead of bringing attention to an issue you personally seem to have. An artist who went #1 in 72 countries it&#39;s clear that people are fine with him.
At the end of the day.. this dude is still a malding antifa kid and he‚Äòs punching air rn with Kanye doing so good. hahaha
Common Melon L
His panic like he knows Spanish
Thank you so much for actually taking the fact that he went on camera and admitted to loving Hitler seriously and not deciding to contribute to the normalization of this kind of trash. I appreciate it.
4. Fan who just likes the music
just absolute bullshit ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£melon ur taking an L bro. theres shit to talk about in this album dont even chat shit. even if u dont like it (or him which is what it is) u can still talk about it
All of yall melting in the comments just proving him right
I got off the train before dood went all the way nuts.  I stopped after MBDTF (that is still the best one, by a long shot, imho).  It is no coincidence that it is the last one where he actually followed through in conception, effort, presentation, commercial release and performance as an &quot;album.&quot;  In others words, it is most impactful taken as a whole.   Only a rare few artists can consistently make albums that hold up over long periods of time - over long periods of time.  With every pop-cultural shock treatment he attempts, Kanye disrespects his audience, his past work and himself.  That is by no means saying he is irredeemable, but supplies of patience and good will are finite...
L take
You‚Äôre meant to review the album melon
Mmm no music review, social commentary review mmm
Curious does this mean if Kanye is ever featured on another artist album or is even credited in the production does that also make that project &quot;Unreviewable&quot;?
Now replace all kanye with Taylor Swift
You&#39;re a clown.
Nothing after tlop hits imo but people don&#39;t really care about the music they care about him as a public figure to idolize beyond music
this album is undeniably fire no matter what your vulture overlords expect you to say melon
Then why even make the video? U know ur gonna get views as long as u have Kanye in the thumbnail, and as a music review channel, u jus shit on him the whole time (for a convenient amount of time too, just enough so u get more ads). I am not on Kanye‚Äôs side in the slightest, but all I see is u using Kanye‚Äôs drop as an opportunity to gain viewership and comments just so u can make a couple extra dollars. If u actually did feel the way u say u do then u wouldn‚Äôt have even recorded the vid to begin with
thank you for your solidarity melon. as a former kanye fan i will definitely be passing on this album
I can‚Äôt believe people actually think that this will win album of the year‚Ä¶
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=193">3:13</a> This is exact whats going on in the comment section I STG. Like it&#39;s his opinion Kanye isn&#39;t gonna give yall front row tickets with VIP passes for defending his album....
This album was quite a disappointment and even worse because we know what Kanye is capable of. Big sad.
Holy fuck people are dumb, y&#39;all come to Fantano for his opinions, and then get one they don&#39;t like and act like some cardinal rule was broken because he didn&#39;t give the album a number. Its like people dont actually care about art, artists, discussions, or anything, they just want McDonald&#39;s.
Te diste color pelao fantano ü§∑
The fact that he didn‚Äôt do transition thats how you know he did not fuck with the album
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=48">0:48</a> My favourite part was when Fantano referenced hitler and then stroked his hitler moustache
Dwight really went off on this one üíÄ
Really thought the melon was a music reviewer  not a political commentator.
This comment section is so FUCKING childish I swear
Bruh fantano go see a dentist u have periodontitis frl
Didn&#39;t expect from Antony to be this much UNPROFESSIONAL
&quot;bro separate the art from the artist&quot; and it&#39;s just a copy of mein campf
Jews cut his check obviously
This review actually sums up my feelings really well. I would do anything to snap my fingers and not hear about this deeply unhinged, self absorbed, anti-semitic, irritating blowhard ever again at this point. I&#39;m speechless that people INSIST on defending Kanye West&#39;s recent music and public persona, he&#39;s terrible, and the music he makes these days isn&#39;t even good. It&#39;s lazy.
He‚Äôs a god fantano stop trying to be woke to make money
I liked the album??
i know being this miserable nemesis like character brings value to your life.
Bro this album is great‚Ä¶.<br>Great production <br>Great lyrics <br>New sounds <br>New vibes <br>Old Kanye vibes <br>Open your ears Anthony
He‚Äòs absolutel furious that this Album is so successful lmaoooo
hey hi n eff u everyone
Yo man review the album and not kanye and his fanbase next time
New album is fire Fantano fell off
Alright I‚Äôm done watching your reviews thanks for the temporary fun
I love how fantano laughs at his &quot;jokes&quot; and thinks that he is funny in some way
or theres just kanye fans that like his music and honesly dont care about what his personal life is like, we just here for the beats and vibes bro
Ty Dolla Sign does NOT DESERVE THIS üò≠üò≠üôè
The dorks that call stuff ‚Äúbased‚Äù will go crazy for this new album
Holy shit, why does he look like he‚Äôs about to pout over a album?
love the cope surrounding this album. even if you ‚Äúseparate the art from the artist‚Äù you still get the worst album in ye‚Äôs entire discography by far
Ironic that u have a hitler stache
Cry more
Legend. I refuse to listen to music by open bigots and abusers, especially if they are currently releasing music and benefiting from it. <br><br>I respect you for taking a stand on this despite the hoards of men in the comments who don‚Äôt seem to have any moral decency or empathy even when it comes to a group who were subject to the most famous and horrific genocide in history. And no, just like Fantano I am not jewish, I just have principles.
as someone who does listen to Kanyes music which i will ashamedly admit, my reasoning for listening to it at this point in time is purely because i like the way it sounds, I do not support Knaye at all, Im not a Kanye fan, but I do like the stuff he has put out. Anthony is 100% correct when it comes to the argument of &quot;separate the art from the artist&quot;, its a stupid argument in a situation like this, the only logical and reasonable argument that someone who does listen to Kanye has, is that the music he has made sounds good to their ears
damn they&#39;re really mad this time lmfao, good on you melon man
This is your worst review
This man will find anything just to hate on Kanye‚Äôs music.
clicked play and hes talkin bout non music related shit for a minute str8 . L  take
What if ur none of the ‚Äú3‚Äù fans and just listened to listen and now it‚Äôs number 1 album in the nationüòÇ
Ye broke this man
ultimately hater vid
This is exactly why people don‚Äôt like this guy, why would I continue watching him if his reviews are just going to be biased. Obviously he can do whatever he wants and this wont matter at all but its just corny, and honestly I don‚Äôt like Kanye‚Äôs handfuls of decisions lately but damn this just is not it. Why even post this if its clearly a biased personally effected review, it just lacks legitimacy for actual first time viewers that could be watching
Yeah bro we didn‚Äôt ask for your opinion on kanyes politics review the album or don‚Äôt but this weird hate train you‚Äôre on sucks
Nerd
Can‚Äôt wait for unreviewable 2 with Playboi Carti‚Äôs ‚ÄúI AM MUSIC‚Äù
This album &gt; every other mainstream rapper‚Äôs album you ever reviewed (Yes! Even Kendrick!)!
your completely wrong bro, you gave sexy redd an 8 this is at least an 8
Back To Me is fire though...
bro did not cook üî•üî•
The album went #1 in 60 countriesüòÇ cope harder big nose
Idk why you guys are surprised. This guy has always been political and it clearly affects his ability to separate art from the artist. Sexy Redd, Meg The Stallion, or Ice Spice could fart into a microphone and say the word p*ssy 75 times and Fantano would call it a banger. But anytime someone does something that pisses off the people on his side of the political party, his bias GLARES through in his reviews. I don‚Äôt endorse anything Kanye has done publicly recently. And I don‚Äôt really even think this new album is even that good, but I can admit that there are objectively a few good songs on it. Fantano, however, is pissed off at Kanye lately (justified) and can‚Äôt keep his emotions in check to give a good faith review. Or he possibly knows it will draw the most attention to his channel. Who knows.
For all the 12 year olds (and older than 12 year olds in a state of arrested development): kanye is not going to notice you.
Ughhh shuttup dude. It‚Äôs just music. It‚Äôs art. Your grandparents are probably racist and u probably still love them. I‚Äôm not even the biggest Kanye fan and was critical of Donda but this album is his best since The Life Of Pablo and one of the better hip hop albums dropped since the pandemic. And that‚Äôs impressive since he‚Äôs 46 years old. Your views just sound like what you read was ‚Äúmorally right‚Äù on Twitter from cancel culture posts. If you were saying some original thoughts this video might be a little more interesting.
Shut up u jew, always yapping blah blah
There are only two types of reviews by Anthony which don&#39;t have final rating in the end: Taylors version and Ye
‚ÄúWho ain‚Äôt cash a check off my name‚Äù
Vultures 1 Garbage/10<br><br>Donda 2 Garbage/10<br><br>Donda Garbage/10<br><br>JESUS IS KING Garbage/10<br><br>Yandhi Garbage/10<br><br>ye Garbage/10<br><br>The Life of Pablo Garbage/10<br><br>Yeezus Garbage/10<br><br>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy Garbage/10<br><br>808s &amp; Heartbreak Garbage/10<br><br>Graduation Garbage/10<br><br>Late Registration Garbage/10<br><br>The College Dropout Garbage/10
I think this is a totally valid opinion. But it is objectively hypocritical to review albums by artist who literally murder people and rap about it. (yes murder is worse than antisemitism)
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs un reviewable I think you just don‚Äôt want to review it
I know he said you can‚Äôt just separate the artist with the art especially with kanye, but for me I can. I could care less about what kanye does as long as it doesn‚Äôt affect me, I just wanna hear good music. I‚Äôm happy that I like plenty of songs on the new album
Melon
Thumb this up when you Thumb this dumb ass review down
Music is such a personal artform. Artists put themselves into their music.  If Kanye made a pastiche of another genre or was playing some character maybe I could separate the art from the artist, but these lyrics are clearly a reflection of who Kanye is and where his head is at. His music has always been a reflection of who he is. How do you separate the art from the artist in that case?
how&#39;s your marriage going?

And yea if you guys didn‚Äôt already know anthony‚Äôs jewish, now you know
But when a rapper raps about the devil and being a devil worshiper he doesn‚Äôt care
Sounds like a other Kanye album that would be better without Kanye on it. Features trying to carry it
&quot;I&#39;m not allowed to examine this music because he says bad things&quot;
Not gonna lie, this makes me actually respect Kanye West more.. He broke a reviewer
You literally said what lil nas x did with Christianity was fine, your logic is flawed dude. Can‚Äôt discriminate based on religion!
bros d riding kanye smh
i love the way you pretend to dislike the album just because you hate his political agenda üò≠ youre as embarrassing as peggy all on ye‚Äôs dick on his twitter
i think it‚Äôs okay to listen to his music and it doesn‚Äôt mean u agree with everything he says. people fell in love with what he once was. with that being said‚Ä¶ THIS ALBUM IS HORRIBLE
If this album was called hood hottest vultures he would give it a 10/10
By all means I&#39;m not a super fan on Kanye, however there are three songs that are  at least audible Back To Me, Burn and Carnival In my opinion. It&#39;s hard to separate the art from the artist with this guy. Maybe with other artist can I can do that, but with Kanye I can&#39;t he has gone too far with his ways. I used to have a Kanye phase when Donda originally came out a couple summers ago but now I can&#39;t take or listen to his music seriously. They either need to get better producers/mixers on his team or spend more time on your music to make it listenable and the merch isn&#39;t that great either.
Commenting about peoples wives being plastic and fake but wheres yours? Keep clout chasing fantany
Thank you for standing up to hate and saying no, that being said I like Kanye&#39;s music anything from life of Pablo and prior are classics. The &quot;Graduation&quot; is probably my favorite album of all time and a top 3 or 5 hip hop album period. Even there are a select few songs off Jesus is king, ye and Donda that are fantastic. This album is not it. And I&#39;ve always been a separate the art from artist person as well but as stated in your video it is impossible to do in this album and what Kanye represents now. The intro song was ok but after that the album sucks. It&#39;s pretty sad seeing this super talented musician spiral to where he has, and it&#39;s too late now you can&#39;t blame it on the death of his mother anymore. This is who he is. He&#39;s a grown man. He&#39;s just a shitty human being
The album is so good he can‚Äôt even review it with an existing number
Do your JOB, lemon.
Kanye‚Äôs the type of anti-semite to say ‚Äúof course I respect Jews, I love Israel.‚Äù
i don&#39;t care about the Jaws ngl
It‚Äôs funny how you are so pressed about ye‚Äôs recent antics that you let it dictate how you feel about his music now. Considering the Jewish community who you would think had the right to be upset with ye after all he said seem to not care anymore  being that vultures is the #1 album in Israel rn ü§£ü§£ü§£
Get this jewelry off youtube üòÖ
This is not a music review. This is a review of his character. Have you been balding thinking about Kanye this much?
Yeah that‚Äôs too bad college dropout, late registration, graduation and even some of his later projects got me through so many hard times.
Is career is comin&#39; full circle. Started and ended talking about Kanye.
Another L take
Im a kanye fan, and at this point, I kinda agree
Review it<br><br>EDIT: eh, he kinda did at the last minutes, I guess I&#39;m satisfied
This is way worse than I could have ever imagined
Finally, an album has transcended even that of a NOT GOOD.
this should be enough for you to loose all credibility forever.
I thought we were talking about music
the record is not awful, you refused to review the music and instead got pissed about kanye‚Äôs life and what he has said. you even skipped a verse on a song yet you are a music reviewer, does not that instantly make your opinion invalid? Instead of acting like the album is shit how about you give an actual review. You just ranted about ye for 7 minutes.
Fantano‚Äôs morale and ‚Äúobjective‚Äù review is so freaking bouncy man
You spent 7 min giving this more attention than it deserves.
Keep yapping ain‚Äôt you divorced that‚Äôs why you can‚Äôt keep a women cuz you don‚Äôt respect Kanye
ye never said anything wrong
I&#39;m 3!!!!!!
Holy shit just stfu and review the albumüíÄ
I just think some of the songs sound awesome
i think the fact that ty dolla $ign isnt even on the album cover but kanye is says everything you need to know
You are just a coward.
The first news article you used was not a conspiracy. His trainer threatened to over medicate him into oblivion for his speech
If you hate him so much why you giving him the time of day? But hey click bait can help bring in some alimony right? light 1 review.
It is so bad
You just made me want to listen to this
‚ÄúMy bitch a reference‚Äù - disgusting, dehumanizing <br><br>‚ÄúTaylor Swift owes me sex. I made that bitch famous‚Äù - I‚Äôm feeling a light 8 on this one

It‚Äôs a semi decent albumüòä

u review music not politics
You&#39;re trippin, liberal. Vultures is fuckin awesome.
You‚Äôve reviewed burzum albums and defended it‚Ä¶.. bit odd.
Is a music review?
Just miffed that JPEGMAFIA was involved. Shit mad me sad.
Congrats on successfully pigeonholing half of your fan base into 3 categories of terrible people.
Makes it easy to not like Kanye anymore when he puts out shit like this. In a vaccume it‚Äôs just a pretty boring record but when u compare to his older stuff‚Ä¶ yeah this album is trash. Like he‚Äôs barely trying.

Anyone who isnt laughing at these songs, and taking them this seriously is just idk... a little to left for me to be friends with i find his mistreatment of his friends worse then this crap. Im white and jewish, Dave Chappelle says some pretty racist/antisemitic stuff sometimes but its true and funny even with the little bit of offense im taking, p much how i view Kanye and my goodness this album is fantastic, 8 or 9.
Shouldn‚Äôt let woke views change your opinion on anything.
Didnt he give the Daughters album a 10/10?
Where yo wife at
‚ÄúWho ain‚Äôt cashed a check off my name‚Äù
This video is cringe, eh? Mellon?
Psychologists need to observe this guy so that we can truly understand the effects of being chronically online.
You dont get Kanye
Our local hip hop station still regularly plays old Kanye hits.<br><br>So Kanye is still mainstream, and people just ignore all the shit anyway.<br><br>Kanye has goat level music but there is so much good non-Kanye Hip Hop music that there is no justification for keeping him in the playlist unless you support Kanye&#39;s views.
Yea whatever
Why not criticize artists that demean women or harm women?
i had no idea about this album until seeing this video. might have to check it out now
When you are so left leaning you can‚Äôt function anymore.
Kanye is washed üò¢
I agree with almost everything you said here but I‚Äôm also curious in the sense that there are tons of  rappers that aren‚Äôt good people but yet those albums are being reviewed and given the time of day, shouldn‚Äôt the treatment be equal?
love how the comments are proving his point exactly üòÇüòÇ people care sooo much about a melons opinion on an album.. borderline gay shit right there.
Biased review L Fantano you broke my heart
Ye made fantano glitch.
just watch the music video and mute your audio then say its some indie designer coming up with a visual masterpiece idc it&#39;s visually striking as a painter im down its fire. now lets get a needledrop on ice spice lol
Shit take Baldtano
It‚Äôs also morally wrong to review and make ad revenue off of a review for an album u say is ‚Äúmorally wrong to listen to‚Äù üòÇ
lol nice title
Reckon this is album is so bad because none of the good artists want to work with him anymore?
U mad frfr
I‚Äôm Jewish and most straight up don‚Äôt give a shit/ they don‚Äôt even know since they don‚Äôt check the internet.<br>No one bothered asking us how we feel, most who know what‚Äôs going on know he needs help instead of constantly being berated<br>Also who tf asks someone if their wife has free will? That‚Äôs just disrespectful
Anthony you&#39;re being unfair here
Free Palestine
cease your pretension baldy
The Internet&#39;s biggest edgelord and lately minted moralist strikes again...in 2024... For some reason üòÇ
if he called this album &quot;hood hottest vultures deluxe&quot; you would&#39;ve given it an 8
Im going to eat a melon
W video
Kanye.<br><br>Is Always.<br><br>Ahead of the Curve.
I feel like he&#39;s in pain...      As a person, I&#39;d love to see Kanye have &quot;his own version&quot; of what Kendrick did- go to Africa for a couple years, have some genuine moments, connect with the earth, meditate ... ... and heck, maybe even have his own experience of therapy, peace, and growth similar to &quot;Mr. Morale and The Big Steppers&quot;.       It&#39;s heartbreaking seeing him... -or any person act and feel this way, and have this level of frantic, fragile, and distraught equinimity - {mental or emotional stability or composure;calmness; equilibrium}       I would love to see him have some time for peace and rejuvination. &lt;3
such a baby
Blud said it&#39;s unreviewable. Soon, after some mental breakdown on Twitter, he just rated vulture a 0 in Aoty website in 20 minutes ago. Good job, Anthony fantano!!! Definitely not a hypocrite move!
If you want to use your platform for good then you should refuse to feature all music that degrades its listeners: at least refuse to feature music that promotes fornication, and violence, and drug abuse. Take a real stand or accept that your cop-out review is a sententious cash-in.
Im pretty sure 90% of the people in the comments are just kanye dick riders and refuse to acknowledge the fact that it just wasnt a good album even in Kanye terms. Like, ok its #1 in like 79 countries but popularity does not equal critical acclaim and thats fine. Critics are entitled to their opinion and if the general public seems to disagree thats fine.<br><br>The fact that theres such a negative backlash against this proves fantano‚Äôs point. Theres no point in reviewing this because of the rabid fanbase and his personal bias against kanye‚Äôs public antics (which was warranted). <br><br>Anyways he does have a point about the lack of cohesiveness and that usual effort kanye puts to his projects. Not every artist could put out critically acclaimed bangers anyway.
kanye dont know you bro üò≠üò≠üò≠
Jpeg disappointed me w this one and not in a good way
If the album was called ‚ÄùTo pimp a vulture‚Äù he would give it a 10
Fantano is based for this. His fans are the most dumbest group of individuals on this earth it‚Äôs kinda crazy how dumb they are
I like you Anthony, but the way in which you chose to handle this situation speaks volumes about how ideologically possessed and terminally online you are. Objectivity flew right out of the window, i see.
Yeah you are a hater
This album reminds me of an nft
MBDTF review made him, Vultures review gonna sink him. This man&#39;s opinions are equivalent to mainstream news
I just like the production bru
just make another YE.
What a cornball. This actually was Ye&#39;s best since Pablo or Yeezus.
Bro yapping
Bud is a good rage baiter
Album is a classic
He does this then gives a sexxyy red album a perfect score LMAO
saltyyyyy
chronically online: the review
partisan stooge
Fantano taking a L on this take. Album is üî•
LOL YOU&#39;RE SO BUTTHURT HAHAHA
I am number 3. Kanye is the greatest artist of all time
Sexyred is ass
You‚Äôve made a career off taking things personal u sound like a real loser here not a good critic
So it‚Äôs ok to review music from people who are criminals and degenerates and brag about it, but this is somehow worse?
Bro u gotta separate the art from the artist duuude
I‚Äôd say there‚Äôs a 4th type of Kanye fans that you neglected to mention:<br><br>4. Normal people who enjoy some of his new music while recognizing that his best days are likely behind him, and can also acknowledge that his anti-Semitic antics are gross and bad.
Just know bro your opinion will never be validated and no one cares abt your music opinions. Get some head bro
did you at least like stars and burn??
but he made graduation
Fantano fell off
so like a 6/10 or what
Seeing this + the music that fantano has been praising on socials lately is hilarious üòÇüòÇ <br><br>Trying so hard üòÇ
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=263">4:23</a> so you just want normal music? <br>How is ‚Äúkeep a few Jews on the staff now‚Äù insulting?
Just review the album we don&#39;t care about your opinions towards ye
im eating boogers rn
I think we should separate the art from the artist and keep Kanye out of music.<br>This is one of your best reviews yet, and it&#39;s a non-review, so that&#39;s saying something.
Ye stans aren‚Äôt happy about this one which makes sense if you think about the average IQ of anyone still braindead enough to defend Ye.
It‚Äôs weird that he is solely attacking people that like the music and lableing them as friendless sad losers. I feel like it hypocritical to say that and he‚Äôs just saying anyone who calls him bias are in a cult and that he can‚Äôt do no wrong.
But like out of 10?
mans having a breakdown haha
Fantano doesn‚Äôt beg yall to watch his reviews. If you‚Äôre mad you‚Äôre literally making yourself that way for no reason
Wife check
üö®üö®LIBERAL ALERTüö®üö®
Didn&#39;t u review Marilyn Manson?
I think you&#39;re over thinking this...<br><br>Kayne was always garbage. His lyrics always offended, and were trash. Most hiphop lyrics are save a few... so yeah, no big whoop. He&#39;s letting his flag fly high.
if this was called kids see vultures you would have given it a 10
this doesn&#39;t come off as a real review, more a hate-rant on ye meant to drum up clicks
What if Kanye&#39;s whole career is just one big decades-long production of Pink Floyd&#39;s The Wall? . . .
facts
Kanye still making history. First unreviewable!!
Bro is reviewing this like Ye a convicted serial killer üò≠üò≠üò≠
Really great album listen, but after this ‚Äúreview‚Äù I have changed my opinion. The album is straight garbage, thank you. üôè
From <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=305">5:05</a> on you quite literally reviewed the unreviewable.
Bros just salty this isn‚Äôt ‚Äúto pimp a vulture 1‚Äù.
Cracka!
How about 4. People who can respect the music and not the person? To categorize anyone listening to his music as the three you listed is embarrassing as a &quot;music reviewer&quot;... he has endless addictive songs that are genuinely some of the greatest tracks ever released and yet you try to shun people who enjoy those tracks. What do you say to people who may have been helped through certain times in their lives by old Kanye tracks? Really lame take man
Fat-thony Virgtano
A real life soyjack.
#1 in 100+ countries
If the album was called ‚ÄúHood Hottest Vulture‚Äù it would‚Äôve gotten an 8
I agree with everything except for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=140">2:20</a> this. Its not like some insurmountable task to listen to music without paying much attention to the lyrics.
sorry to say this, but your opinion is wrong.
ur so gay
Cancel this nerd
Kanye da üêê no üß¢
Damn all these Kanye stans out here in the comments, and not one of Them Can make a single cohesive argument
OH LORD THE FUCK
Man can‚Äôt stop talking about Kanye because he needs Kanye to survive
I strongly dislike the things kanye says, and Im not even a big kanye fan. I just put on these songs because they‚Äôre fun and catchy.
Hey Melon, I am Jewish and I appreciate your views &amp; refusal to review this album. What Kanye did and said in the past few years has left me disappointed and upset. My take on Ye is that he is a mentally disturbed individual, who makes and has made some incredible music. Vultures, like Ye himself is a bipolar mess of an album, but the highs on this project are some of the highest highs I‚Äôve heard from his discography since 2018. I think Ye &amp; collaborators have made some exceptionally good music here, along with some really bad / mid songs. I hope Ye will truly ‚Äúfind god‚Äù and apologize for spreading his hateful &amp; misguided rhetoric, but the shit he says won‚Äôt sway me from listening to this album or any future music he makes.
Godamn the Kayne fans are triggered (whats new) so youd rather come here and cry about a bad review for the next 10 years like you still do? Hes being honest, cope harder.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=125">2:05</a> tag yourself i&#39;m all three of them
You have gone downhill this year and your videos are unwatchable. Get a grip fantano just review the about and dont push politics on us.
You‚Äôve made a career off taking things personal u sound like a real loser here not a good critic
Should check out rens sick boi album.
All i saw was a hillary clinton supporter spew semantics 10/10 review
Unsubscribed üî•üî•üî•
respect to melon
I think it‚Äôs kinda fucked up for u to say those teenagers have meaningless lives. Their lives have barely even started at that age, u don‚Äôt have to shit on kids, that just makes u look bad bc ur like twice their age. In five years those same teenagers could hold the polar opposite sentiment about ye than they currently do
the album goes HARD... on mute.
what a loser üòÇ
Bruh I get not wanting to listen becuse if some<br>If the lyrics but aside these songs are great and have amazing production. Hoodrats actually my personal favorite. Only skip for me is the title track.
i liked this review. you should do more reviews like this
Just review the shit bro, thats the whole point of your channel. We aint wanna know about your political views too, damn. Hasan collab soon?
Thank you for lying your ass off üòÇ
FUCK YOUUUUUU YOU FED <br><br>All this guy does is hate on Ye, we won‚Äôt forget that you tried rapping and it flopped hard. I bet you mad as hell that JPEG worked on the album and loves Ye üòÇ. I rate your review exiled/10. Give up on your hair that shit ain‚Äôt coming back.<br><br>Love everyone.
Stop yapping, YE 2024üôå
still had to make a video on it ü§£
Anthony, your line was: ‚ÄúHey guys, music nerd Rantony Rantano here‚Äù
If Kanye talked more about beautiful, big titty, butt-naked women you woulved given it a 10
‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt conform to my political views so his music is bad‚Äù <br>Great work, Anthony.
Extremely soy take
I personally like so much the Kanye music despite he‚Äôs so fuckin stupid about the things he publicly says, but damn day after day it becomes more and more difficult , my man is craving his own grave
Arw you really complaining about the lyrics after you gave sexy red a fucking 8 fantano? c&#39;mon your bias is just too obvious now. And the lyrics aren&#39;t even antisemitic, it&#39;s literally just jokes
now there&#39;s ANOTHER TMZ interview...kinda weird the timing of these things
thats a fat L anthony üòÇ
I listened to it and can review it. It‚Äôs like a 4/10.
Bro fell off
Watching the comments prove this video right is quite entertaining
okay dude, redact all of your reviews by rapist murderers and worse. I hate kanye but like cmon dude
Time to go see why Shawn Cee thinks Fantano is wrong
OH MY GOODNESS SHUT UP AND JUST REVIEW THE MUSIC JADEN SMITH. I DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC STATE OF THE WORLD. just review the album damn.
Album is a 10/10 tho
Bruh i thought fantano was a music reviewer? This was just a Kanye rant and his bias clearly implicated his experience with this album. Kanye and Ty Dolla are both in my top 10 favorites, but as far as Ye, I haven‚Äôt been too into his music since The Life of Pablo, however since his last album and his recent dramatic turns, I knew he‚Äôd come back with a new inspiration, especially with Ty being one of the most underrated all around musicians around. I do not fall under any of these 3 ‚Äúcriteria‚Äù that crythany unfactano spills out here. I am not a Kanye defender, his vocal opinions are his and the blowback he receives is his problem, not mine, not yours. I am not a nihilistic teen, I am in my early 20‚Äôs and my life has been turned around the past year on a much better path than when I was a nihilistic teen (and less of a Ye fan). And being in a cult of any shape or form is strictly against my core beliefs. I listened to this album knowing it would be a good step in the right direction as far as sound, beats, lyrics and rhythm. It‚Äôs been a long time since I heard an album with 0 skips for me, and even longer since I heard an album made my 2 of my top 10 favorite musicians. The more people make Kanye West‚Äôs drama their drama are only negatively influencing their own lives at this point, not his. I would think after being divorced and losing a however many millions of dollars deal with adidas, there would not be many more fucks left to give. Sorry Mr. Fantano, once in a while I tune in to a review of yours, but this one just seems like something you would make while you stare at the shit in your toilet with your nostrils clamped wide open. This is why rappers who actually rap constantly diss you. I always respect the grind of content creators of any medium, as I started being a part time creator myself a year ago, it is not easy. You spent well over half the video relisting past controversies that we all know Ye could give a fucc about, then you bash a handful of tracks and don‚Äôt even give the album a rating, which might be a first for you. How disappointing. This album gave me the small bit of inspiration I‚Äôve been looking for for the last few weeks and you look like you‚Äôve been awake for 36 hours while you recorded this half ass mumbo jumbo. For me this is a heavy 9 with 0 skips. The song Carnival had me head banging, which is super rare for me, back to me was actually my favorite song as far as the first listen goes. A verse from his kid that went way to hard for a middle schooler, problematic and good (don‚Äôt die) brought a tear to my eye, the intro track was perfect for the intro, Do it was a seriously great mix of Ty‚Äôs west coast style and Ye‚Äôs Chicago style, not to mention the Nipsey Hussle hidden feature. As much as I dislike playboi carti he wrecked both his features, plus every other track and feature that was a highlight. This album had every side of hip hop on it. Trap, gospel, rage, drill, west coast, east coast, even some shit you play at the club. I‚Äôm sure there could‚Äôve been another album you reviewed today instead of churn out this dog muck. I hope in time you can redo this review and approach with objectivity, because I just wasted 7 minutes listening to your rant. I knew somebody would post some shit like this, it‚Äôs not surprising it‚Äôs you. So that‚Äôs why I typed this little essay. If I were to take anything away from this if I were were an up and coming artist, it would be to not listen to a word you say about my music, and to do the opposite of what you ‚Äúcritique‚Äù. I bet Logic would‚Äôve taken that advice years ago if he could‚Äôve.  You mentioned self imposed ignorance of some average Kanye fan, but you don‚Äôt look inward at your own ignorance. In conclusion, to clarify, I‚Äôm more of a Ty Dolla fan than a Kanye fan, and that‚Äôs part of what annoyed me. I‚Äôve never once seen you review an album from Taylor Gang, but that‚Äôs another story. Many of the cards on the house you built have fallen off with this video, and I hope Kanye continues to ignore shit like this and keep the noise away when it comes to‚Ä¶ literally creating noise. Peace.
no way you gave hood hottest princess 8 and call this album trash
Bro grow up your just as bad as Kanye desperately seeking attention with this video, either review it or don‚Äôt u man child.
If you wanna not listen to him whine and get somewhat a review of the music and not a review of the artist who made the music, skip to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=308">5:08</a>
You had valid points, but why did you say the album was unreviewable, and then proceed to review it?
This much hate in ur own comments section is very telling you loser üòÇ
fantano&#39;s falling off the wagon
You&#39;re such a moronüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Not personally a fan of Kanye anymore but it&#39;s hilarious how his fanbase is making twitter seem like world war 3 for this dork
preacher or music reviewer?
Out of spite, Drake&#39;s next album will be a 10/10.
Ik u liked at least 1 song, the album is a let down but there was a few hidden ‚Äúgems‚Äù in there
man i got into kanye in like 2020 or 21 because of i wonder and a couple other songs and im very willing to admit i don&#39;t pay a lot of attention to most music artist presence in media and what they are saying but like i keep catching tidbits of the shit storm kanye is and its a turbo mess.
U stinky
Ye&gt;
ye will fw u for this
Didn&#39;t even get a &quot;Forever&quot; at the endüòÖ
What about the kanye fan who is just sad about all this
fantano only says this album is trash because everyone hates kanye right now, he cant say taylor swift&#39;s albums are trash because he knows he will be cancelled. fantano only cares about his reputation and knows he wont be slammed if he calls kanye trash now, he knows he will be slammed by swifties if he calls taylor swifts music bad
Since when did melonhead become such a fake woke softy?
If you disagree with someone&#39;s behavior or politics you hate their music. It&#39;s very obvious behavior and getting more and more pathetic.
Estrony Transtano: BLM Warrior
I don&#39;t think anything could make a Fantano comment section take something seriously at this point.
Nice virtue signaling
This was a really good video that articulates extremely effectively the whole problem with reviewing Kanye. So I&#39;m glad the comments are filled with unfunny jokes and unhinged weirdos still intent on defending the guy.
you literally need to quit reviewing music
but peggy produced on it
theres no difference between kanye fans and fantano fans
Kanye makes it so hard to be a fan of him, can‚Äôt even listen to graduation anymore without fearing a mf will hear it
i never thought this day will come, fantano is officially a hypocrite now.
can someone give me a tl;dr because i don&#39;t feel like watching a seven minute video
if anything, we cannot disagree this man can make drama
This ain&#39;t Twitter. Do your job.
1m views less than 24 hours cash out bif lmao
I came to use all my 20 accounts to dislike your video and remind you that your wife left you. Baldie ü§£
Im a Kanye dickrider, dont care bout the politics, album is boring and weak af<br><br>And I hate this guy as well<br>But yeah I see his points
Ok I would be totally down with your opinion if you didn‚Äôt say that there‚Äôs only 3 kinds of people who like the album, and all of them were negative. If your moral code is all about stopping hate, then maybe look in the mirror Anthony, the guy who will say terrible things to anyone who disagrees with your opinion. What happened to respect. I would have respected you way more if you gave this a not good. I just wanna hear your music opinion, not your justification on why you‚Äôre so morally higher than us. Btw I think this is Kanye‚Äôs second to worst album if your curious and he has some terrible lyrics. But I wouldn‚Äôt call it a bad album. I don‚Äôt agree with any of his hateful comments either. I just realized I wrote a paragraph. Btw I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair that people are harrowing you, Anthony, either. I just want some love.
damn ur so woke bro ur really eating &amp; slaying &amp; fucking it up right now we invite u to the cook out &amp; whatever else u thought u‚Äôd gain from this üò≠üò≠
I‚Äôm Jewish and I still listen to Kanye
Lmao im jewish and like kanyes music even tho ik i probably shouldn&#39;t
Fantano it&#39;s time to BEG FORGIVENESS
Kanye made your career
Anthony, as a fan, I know, that Kanye is a bad apple, but I really dont care to hear you tell everyone what they already know. I and many others come to hear your opinions on the songs not the political surroundings of the record or how the lyrics dont align with your values. This video was pointless.
everyone has something special about them to offer
Kanye sold his soul to farrakhan. That&#39;s literally it, I can&#39;t believe no one has realized this. If Kanye backpedals on any of the shit he said, the cult will kill him, simple as that. They&#39;ll sick the FOI on him just like they did to Malcolm X.
So if you like kanye you are dellusional?
Bro literally no one takew your opinion serious anymore
you saying paid is hilarious, its almost as hilarious are you calling yourself a music reviewer. you ever think maybe the people you can&#39;t reason with about Kanye won&#39;t listen to you because you picked a side just like they did.
how did he get this
crazy that 100 countries and $19M of sales in 24 hours is comprised of people that fit into these 3 oddly specific and demeaning categories. Maybe some of us just know how to separate the music from the person. he is the greatest producer ever and has changed the way music is made. and those lyrics you put up are all him mocking and quoting those words your not even able to read between the lines. listen all people are flawed in some way and yea he said some wild stuff, but when someone has a gift that special all the other stuff isnt going to outshine that. this is low and unprofesional on a lot of levels. treat the album and the work (that ty dolla put in crazy of btw) with respect man it makes alot of ppl in this world feel something.
one of the few times i agree with the melonhead its absolute ass lol
Reviewing music made by people who drug rape and murder people is fine but yeah hating Jewish people is wayyy too far. Dissapointed in the double standar melon
Ye 2024
What a stupid fucking take lol like you haven‚Äôt reviewed endless albums from actual literal gangbanger murder felons<br><br>But he said muh insensitive thing!
Honestly I hate new Kanye. But he‚Äôs onto something - beautiful big titty butt naked women just don‚Äôt fall out the sky y‚Äôknow? Only song I enjoy on the album. Plus no antisemitism on that track so there‚Äôs a plus
lmao people being offended by Kanye and him being controversial is what he has always beenüòÇ
le poto ferait une crise cardiaque devant les lyrica a Freeze Corleone
i wrote a review for this album recently on albumoftheyear, gave it a 0/100 and i got death threats and was called a jew for not supporting kanyes antisemitism
unfortunately here is someone who was once a creator with sense consumed by political correctness. rip anthony fantano
you look like you didn‚Äôt sleep in weeks
woke review L Cringe fantano youve flopped and now only review artist more than the music now smh dude
People think Fantano won&#39;t review this album because he hates it but it&#39;s really that he doesn&#39;t want to review it because y&#39;all will be insufferable no matter what score he gives it.
what did fantano say about WSG Hitler wears hermes ?
Blah blah blah
clown
lol you‚Äôre so goofy
bro only talk about like 3 songs, he forgot to talk about the elite production on beg forgiveness, back 2 me, carnival, do it, and like 3 more
bro hating because the truth hurts
Why you so madüò≠ chill out bro seperate the art from the artist<br>Also Womp womp cry it‚Äôs not that big of a deal he‚Äôs not hurting anyone except soft people who take everything seriously
The point where Kanye projected his  political beliefs into his music is when EVERYONE should Let that affect their score.
Bro has that mom look when you misbehave
this guy is so wildly out of line
Haven&#39;t you done songs with rappers being just as anti-white as Kanye has been anti-Jewish? What&#39;s so special about them?
yeah but if sexyy red made the same exact album you would have loved it. and somehow you dont even know how to review music although youve been doing it for so long. youre just being ignorant because you have some undefinable hatred for kanye.
‚Äòwon‚Äôt review‚Äô but begging for that ad revenue
i bet a 38 year old balding man feels like a really good human when he put this review out. I thought this was gonna be a music review but it‚Äôs just his political statement about kanye, and trying to look like a good human being by saying his album is terrible because of what kanye has said in the past. He also only took like 3 songs out of 16 tracks and really only said bad stuff about those three songs. so if balding fantano could keep his head out of his ass and rate the album on a fair scale he would give it a light 6 and not unreviewable when we all know that the album was actually decent. anthony please make actually good music reviews and stop trying to look like the good guy
The fact that you refuse to review this album just proves how much of a biased and spineless coward you are. Would be better to not make this video to begin with really.
4.we dont gaf just like his music, seperate the art from the artists
The fall of Fantano needs to be studied
yes, kanye has said insanely stupid stuff that is very wrong, and that he should be rightfully criticised for<br>you still sound unhinged and desperate in this vid üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Just review the music. Isn&#39;t that the point of the videos, the reviews. To focus on the music. Move past the celeb garage and trash that all singers have and just get to the music.
4. People who simply enjoy a few of the solid songs onto the album that don‚Äôt have to agree with his views
thank god fantano‚Äôs never reviewed someone antisemitic before. someone like burzum who fantano gave a 6/10 would never do anything against jewish people.
it&#39;s unreviewable but he&#39;ll still upload a video on his main channel, stream himself listening to it, and upload the vod to youtube <br>ü§î
Politician
your wife left you lmao
So then dont review it? This is posturing.
@theneedledrop you are the worlds biggest embarrassment
Good Vultures m.a.a.d fantano üò¢
Lowkey the falling out the sky and half the rest of the album is just cringy and the other half is mostly lower mid<br><br>Edit: and I‚Äôm a big fan of Kanye‚Äôs earlier stuff (aka pre 2022)
Hey there&#39;s an in between man
at least it wasn&#39;t called &quot;The Big Vulture&quot; and got a 0!!!
geez bruh look at ur dislike to like ratio, maybe ur f*g friends arent 100% mentally there like you think, kinda proves ur whole point abt this album wrong huh
Kosher Melon
crazy, bipolar, unreviewable....but still.. the KING üëë
video should be titled deletable 1
I don&#39;t care about Kanye or the album but fantano has fallen off. He&#39;s no longer a music channel its just a political channel that uses music some times. Review fucking music dawg idc about your political leaning that you call other people assholes that don&#39;t agree with you (literally the worst personality trait a reviewer can have)
carnival, burn, GOOd (don‚Äôt die), paperwork, stars, do it? like bruh the album is not bad, i‚Äôd actually consider it good
fun fact . you have reviewed multiple albums from actual criminals and gave them a serious review  , but you know that if you do do that , its not gonna get views .......... i feel sad for you man .
‚ÄúAt least he‚Äôs honest‚Äù üòÇüòÇüòÇ

He has lost the plot
SAME GUY WHO GAVE MBDTF A 5
‚ÄúUnreviewable‚Äù - then reviews multiple songs, lyrics, compares albums, states it‚Äôs the worst album, etc. <br><br>Of course this leech will have ad revenue enabled to mooch off of black culture more!
I would argue that it‚Äôs not the music that is awful. (Peggy actually did enhance some of these beats pretty well and it‚Äôs more decent than Jesus is king.) this is no we‚Äôre near as bad as Tom McDonald. What makes it awful is the permanent thought that this is made by an anti-Semite; that spoils the music and it doesn‚Äôt help the Kanye throws dog whistles in there too. <br><br>Like yeah the beats are cool but I don‚Äôt really care to finish this the same way that I wasn‚Äôt bothered to finish or watch the Super Bowl.
Anthony WILL review white racists.<br>Anthony will NOT review black racists. ü§î
I legit like 2 songs on there, but the rest I‚Äôm turned off by
assuming he is just hating
u brought politics and feelings into it off rip LMFAOOOOOOO invalid review.
i‚Äôm a fan of kanye‚Äôs music, i‚Äôm not that much a fan of kanye
This mf being mad about the reference line when he dickrode kanye on multiple albums in which he said absolutely , OBJECTIVELY worse things about women is insane.
He didnt even talk about the record. lmao. There are so many artists that have done much worse but never got a video like this. bias. we dont care about your personal thoughts on his controversy. never would have watched if u were just gonna bitch and moan.
fantano still dosent understand that the gay friends you have are 100% percent in a victimhood mindsent simply for the financial gains, he choses to accept their ideology bc he is lonley, its fucking pathetic
the amount of dislikes on this video is embarrassing
created this video because you know youd get shit for reviewing this album because it could be seen as &quot;supporting him&quot; but if your not gonna review the album just dont make a video at all  lol this shits just for a quick buck kinda lame
Fantano is the biggest piece of trash on the internet
I think we already knew fantano wasnt going to give this a good rating but guess what he still made a video , because like it or not anthony , this will probably your most viewed video in a looooonngggg time . U hate kanye rn but deep down know that without this review your viewer count is pretty average ...
Kanye can say whatever he wants, as long as he keeps making bangers üòå
you&#39;d think a critic would be capable of separating an artist from the art
I‚Äôm confused? What does Kanye‚Äôs personal problems have to do with his music? It makes no sense lol and talking about his wife is so ironic it‚Äôs insane
This is embarrassing as a long time fantano fan I can‚Äôt stand by this, you‚Äôre a music reviewer, you refuse to draw the line when reviewing music from rapists and murders.  You let your politics and self hatred effect the thing we all love here which is talking about music.  If the music is bad, so be it discuss the music the art.  Spreading more hate doesn‚Äôt solve the problem.  Very disappointed in fantano
how did they pay you for this?
Nihilistic teenagers üòÇüòÇüòÇ
I cant believe kanye unintentionally destroyed fantanos career üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
These narcissists are going crazy, Ye, Carti. They truly feel like gods, doing everything they want cause everyone just keeps letting it pass. Narcissists 2024 the new wave.
#1 Kanye Hater
White man over compensated with social justice warrior talking points.
Kinda wish you called it Vultures 1 ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
Actual clown
album so bad bro intentionally fucked the chroma key for this review
You‚Äôve sucked for a while now
Thought you were a music nerd. If you felt strongly about Kanyes views and didn&#39;t want to review this project why even make this video? For a cheque? If you truly stand by what you&#39;re saying in this video, you shouldn&#39;t have posted it.
Worst review ever dude ngl
hehe now the Kanye fans or should I say meat riders get the wrath of the MELON
Bros just yapping üòÇ
Hahahaha, this is pathetic even for you!
Admit you like &quot;Burn&quot; tho
The hypocrisy of this guy is crazy. He deems Vultures unreviewable (yet still reviews it lol) and bashes the album not for it‚Äòs contents but because of Kanye‚Äòs anti-semitism yet on twitter he retweets and spreads anti-semitic rhetoric.<br>You literally couldn‚Äòt make this shit up. The guys a joke.
I think most people are #2 but our lives aren‚Äôt meaningless. That‚Äôs a weird thing to say.
there was some good points made except about the 3 types of kanye fans. can‚Äôt put a blanket statement on millions of people.
It went well until you decided to review, even uf you said you wouldn&#39;t
great review anthony!
BEAUTIFUL BIG TITTY, BUTT NAKED WOMEN JUST DONT FALL OUT THE SKY YOU KNOW <br>- ye 2024
Keep this same energy when ur reviewing rappers who promote gangbanging and rapeüôèüèø
Biased review not helpful
Bro couldn‚Äôt resist virtue signaling and collecting money from something he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt like‚Äù lol
the albums a 6/10 i never paid attention to the lyrics until now but the lyrics dont really faze me so honestly idk i kinda fuck with the album tho
Bro was definitely blasting Burn after this video was taken üòÇüòÇ
Bro, just review the music and shut up about how problematic you think the lyrics are. I don‚Äôt care even slightly if Kanye offends people, and nothings going to change that. And fyi, when I click on a music review I don‚Äôt expect some bald sjw to cry about how offensive the lyrics and substance of the music is.
If the music is unreviewable then what is the purpose of this video? ü§î
Lemon still spazzin about how he wouldnt fangirl Kanye if he met him (which he would)
I know we‚Äôre getting the real review when Vultures II comes out
uh oh fun police
hah gay

This is the review people are mad about?
This is embarrassing for Anthony. He used to be respected in the music community but continues to shrink his fanbase with his childish arrogance. I‚Äôm no ‚ÄúKanye Stan‚Äù, but Anthony has lost me in the last few years
do you like ozzy?
Rap is full of artists like King Von who have (allegedly) murdered others, yet you‚Äôve still given them a review, while I understand why you‚Äôre doing this here, it‚Äôs a weird place to draw the line given you‚Äôve reviewed a Neo-nazi on this channel. If you really believe what you‚Äôre saying you should retroactively change the other reviews to unreviewable as well
buttlick—ñng j–µws from a sicillian man is crazy
Use me as the dislike button üëéüèΩ
IF THIS WAS MBDTF YOU WOULD&#39;VE GIVE HIM AT LEAST A 6
unsubscribed, youre a music reviewer. artists are notoriously fucked up but you as a professional should know better and learn to seperate the person from the music
fantano sm0kin. this album is fire
ü§ìFagtano
Its a stretch fantano. give him his humanity atleast
So the review is more politically then about the music? Secondly why do yall hold a man with mental health issues up to the same standards and take what he say seriously, he is clearly calling out for help?
Kanye fans really have proven themselves to be in the top 3 of most unstable fan bases, Jesus.
I wonder what edge lord 2011 Fantano would‚Äôve thought about this album.
I think ur  jeww ü§îüí≠
You bald tho‚Ä¶
This is propaganda ‚Ä¶
So instead of reviewing the music (which is your job) you just made a rant about kanye controversy and slapped the vultures title for views. Just review the fucking album no one is here to hear what you have to say about shit other than music.
Review the music, not the artist. If every Kanye fan is the people you listed, explain why the album is #1 in the world. You basically insulted anyone who has listened to this album. And called them terrible people. Great way to ruin your relationship with your audience.
Who&#39;s gonna tell melon that his chat is cesspool no matter who he is reacting to?
Im neutral to all of this bc i really dont care for either side of this but this vid has 30k likes to 20k dislikes and the gap is closing by the hour üíÄ
Wait so you can review music that advocates for you black men killing each other in the streets or doing drugs but not this.
they thought headlines was my krptonite, but im still the king
just review the album bro
It is his worst album lol. It‚Äôs production trying, flow trying, but it‚Äôs not music. It‚Äôs unfleshed out experiments. Just like FATD
I haven&#39;t disliked a video in a while but this definitely deserves it, dude is a clown.
Here come Kanye&#39;s cockriders. One of the worst, most deluded internet fandoms ever and that says a lot, but still not enough to convey the degree of meatriding.
Considering this will most probably be a number 1 recod you really commited to insulting a lot of people while you really just had to not review the album.
Imagine calling every Kanye fan an antisemite and a lonely teen when you&#39;re literally a washed up divorced music reviewer that only stays relevant because you beefed with Drake that one time and now trying to start controversy with Kanye to try to be relevant again while making money off of Kanye&#39;s name and new album release despite saying hes an antisemite and a piece of trash (something i dont totally disagree with) how about you get off your high horse and either dont review it and dont try to make a scene if you really dont want to support &quot;hatefull&quot; art or do what your dwindling fanbase come here to see and actually review the album fairly while ignoring outside controversy, something you&#39;ve done for albums made by actual killers, drug addicts, rapists and gangsters, stop trying to be a beacon of morality and utterly failing at it and just do what you have done for years now
You just had to say you don&#39;t like it    You call everyone who likes it piece of shit and delusional   and you&#39;re the guy who&#39;s is first arguments when you have bad take  is the opinion
bro forgot to seperate the music from the artist
Kanye is a piece of shit but i like his music. Fantano has praised many artists that have also said and done horrible things. why is the line drawn with kanye? like genuinely why is he the line ?
that ‚Äúhow I‚Äôm anti-Semitic?‚Äù line is like the anti-Semitic equivalent of ‚Äúhow can I be homophobic? my bitch is gay‚Ä¶‚Äù
fantano shouldnt have even listened to this he clearly was going into this album wanting to hate on it
‚ÄúUnreviewable‚Äù but you literally just reviewed it. I‚Äôm not going to defend Kanye, but the music was pretty good. Hate tinted glasses makes you not like it
J.Cole said all of this about Kanye fans 8 years ago lmao. He was right then, and even more right now.
ppl just talk about bs that was twisted by the press but not even wanna mention the love and music that got KANYE to No.1, this isn‚Äôt freedom at all
Wow you&#39;re such a good person thank you for telling use how good of a person you are you&#39;re so humble, I definitely want ego stroking instead of reviews out of music reviewers
It hasn‚Äôt been the same since she‚Äôs left has it?
Yeah the album is kinda trashy. Is it unreviewable? Really? Even though what he supports or supposedly supported or whatever it&#39;s objectively bad, do you really think that the albums you review aren&#39;t as bad? That your own political ideology is harmful to society? It doesn&#39;t need to overly be hateful to actually be hateful and detrimental to society. You are just being a hypocrite. This is not worse than reviewing a degenerate punk/pop/alt or whatever. And ironically, this album is extremely degenerate. I don&#39;t like this either
nah youre right
Kanye said things about Black and white people, no one bats an eyelid.<br><br>He says that the Jews rule the world, and now everyone wants to cancel him. <br><br>So was he wrong?
Bro this is sad - just review it or don‚ÄôtüòÇ
From all the bad to truly heinous shit done by musicians and entertainers, Kanye, is where Fantano decides to get on his ‚Äúhigh horse‚Äù &amp; take moral umbrage. Give me a fucking break dude. üòÇ Goofy.
Hoodrat is the worst song I‚Äôve heard in awhile
This is literally music history right now. Kanye has had one of the biggest falls from grace in music history EVER. And at the same time Taylor Swift is the largest recording artist breaking every record in music history EVER. If Taylor Swift is &quot;White People Jesus&quot; as some people say, then Kanye is &quot;Black People Satan&quot; no question about it. To quote Bill Wurtz &quot;Damn, you could make a religion outta this!&quot; followed quickly by &quot;No, don&#39;t&quot;
Bro just shits on kanye cuz he gets attention for shitting on him.
Comments here just prove his point<br><br>Dumb nitriding kids
You have reviewed music by actual murderers, people who have caused multiple funerals.
You are politically corrected right now!! Good job Anthony fantano!!!!!!
If it was named Vultures see kids, you would‚Äôve given it a ten
womp womp
oh so its political... cool
SHIT IS, FUCKING RIDICULOUS.
That‚Äôs coo, don‚Äôt have fun
You know Ye&#39;s a good artist when Fantano rethinks why he does interviews lol
Just review the music man, you reviewed burzum, why is this any different? You&#39;re not a political activist, you&#39;re a music reviewer.
What a fucking crybaby loser fantano has become. He&#39;s a grown man still doing this big production about the music man has opinions he doesn&#39;t like. He looks like he&#39;s going to cry, what is wrong with this man.
Kanye released the best free Palestine album and the people get vexxed
Damn, at least give the album a Not Good
Who tf js Fantano to say anything. Whatever bro, stick to reviewing music and leave the personal stuff out of it. So yeah, had to cook yo old a$$ 1 time. You know. Carry on.
&quot;this album is unreviewable!&quot; <br><br><b>Proceeds to review album</b>
BEST TEETH IN THE GAME
Anthony has all the right to choose not to review and have his own opinion, and Kanye‚Äôs antics should not be validated. My issue is he clearly picks and chooses who he decides to thrash when half of the music industry is a POS. I just ask for consistency. Would he say this if it were Death Grips? Who knows
When you are brainwashed by a left wing echo chamber on twitter, this is what you get. Soft as Charmin.
anthony fantano 7 minute tism attack lmao, embarrassing how personal this was
Bro is so mad Kanye can just get a new wife like that üòÇ
IM CRYING THIS MAKES ME SO CURIOUS
Like why does he even try to make a review at the end here, obviously ur not gonna mention any of the good cord progressions or Beg Forgiveness as a song concept. like u have ur opinion I agree wit u shouldn&#39;t listen to this on face, but u just vehemently denying there are no good innovative ideas on this project is bonkers if ur actually gonna list songs and shi.
If Sexyy Reich made this it would be a 10
hahahaha
Review the MUSIC loser!!! It‚Äôs not hard
Interesting.
This is a fantastic album. Sucks to see this gremlin hating
If this album was named &quot;kids see vultures&quot;, you would have gave it a ten.
I listened half way &amp; turned it off so bad
bro the replies need to go outside
The rent is dueeeee üò≠
Hi Anthony,<br><br>I hope you&#39;re open to some honest feedback. I want to acknowledge that I respect your opinions on Kanye&#39;s new music and your perspective on the recent controversies. However, it appears to me that there&#39;s a certain intensity in your approach that comes across as more driven by negativity than understanding.<br><br>I heard about the challenging online stream you had with trolls, and I understand it can be frustrating. Still, I believe it&#39;s essential not to let those experiences lead to insulting others&#39; tastes or dismissing different perspectives. There&#39;s a sense of pride, disrespect, and closed-mindedness that comes through, which feels ironic given your criticism of Kanye&#39;s actions and his followers.<br><br>While I appreciate your stance on separating art from the artist, it&#39;s crucial to recognize that those finding something meaningful in Kanye&#39;s work deserve respect, even if it&#39;s not something you personally connect with. Let&#39;s try to approach these discussions with more openness and empathy.<br><br>The silent majority of your viewers (who still enjoy Ye music) don&#39;t think or behave the way you described in the video.
Hypocrite
womp womp
Thats cool fantano but have you heard the new YE album!
The Jews got to this guy
Cringe
Loser
he looks like gay walter white
ok so this confirms that you definitely have bias on certain artists‚ù§
Guys do you think he likes the album
kanye has been overrated for far too long
I feel like the fourth category of Kanye fans are the people who just ignore the terrible things he said and just want to listen to genuinely incredible music.
The Irony.  The lack of self awareness.  The hypocrisy.  Hilarious video.
Thank you so much for this ‚ù§
Im tryna eat man and you just ruined it with all that salt
this comment section feels a lot like &quot;shut up and play basketball&quot; with a nice dose of the fallacious &quot;you reviewed X, so it&#39;s hypocritical you didn&#39;t review this.&quot; kanye is massively more mainstream and relevant than burzum and fantano has been criticizing ye&#39;s descent into alt right mania for years up to this point
Bro is jealous that his wife divorced him and ye has a new one
I really enjoyed the part where he said its unreviewable but then makes the video anyway for the money üí∞
Wow you are so mad.
I just like his music :( where is that kinda of Kanye fan
This is hypocrisy at its finest. He stated he would not review it, yet five minutes later, he begins the review. Furthermore, his argument about listeners agreeing with opinions based on the music they listen to is invalid. I mean, this guy listens to Death Grips and Daughters, with their disturbing lyrics, and somehow finds it valid for them to make that assertion? I didn‚Äôt enjoy the album either, but producing a video stating he wouldn&#39;t review it demonstrates how he is a very poor reviewer, who relies solely on his feelings rather than conducting a thorough analysis of the art
I feel like I&#39;m watching my English teacher pull me aside and absolutely dismantle my essay.
If it‚Äôs truly unreviewable why would you post this video in the first place and give it attention? Seems like you just wanted to flaunt your opinions
This was cringe to watch
Anthony, you have reviewed music made by rapists, white supremacists, serial abusers and everything in between. You have recommended music with legitimate threats and calls of violence. You&#39;re virtue signaling. If you really didn&#39;t want to platform Kanye&#39;s new album you wouldn&#39;t have made this video.
I love how Mike Myers is standing off camera for this one, just as he should have all those years ago.
nice unbiased review
Bro why even bother making a video? Do you review music or artists?
While I think the discourse in these comments is cringe, if you don‚Äôt want to talk about the album then don‚Äôt make this video, all you‚Äôre doing is bringing more attention to it, and makes you look like you only made this video to bank off the fact it‚Äôs ye.
Been watching fantano for years now, and i have never seen such a polarizing comment section before.
BRO STRAIGHT YAPPIN
Fantanos like that dude who pretends to like communism and social justice so that he can get laid. It‚Äôs an act.
I don&#39;t get you Fantano. You sound close minded. And, it&#39;s a shame: I get what you are trying to say. I&#39;m sure a good portion of Ye&#39;s &#39;delusional&#39; fan base need a wake up call, but I mean, really, about 99 percent of society in general needs a wake up call. The other unfortunate is this idea that somehow there are only three types of fans for this guy, and you&#39;re either one or the other, or a venn (sp?) diagram... The only way &#39;racism&#39; (Do you use the word? I don&#39;t know, but you shouldn&#39;t; it&#39;s a misnomer and just gives power to the bullshit...) can ever be addressed is honesty. Ye is pretty honest as far as I can tell, especially in the league of artists out there today. And, are you sure he&#39;s an antisemite? Or has he just said things that might sound antisemitic to antisemite ears? Do you really think he supports Hitler and the mass extinction of peoples? Cuz it seems like a stretch to me. You site some lyrics sure: where he addresses the accusations and even calls himself an antisemite. But that&#39;s what everyone&#39;s calling him. What if everyone was like &#39;Fantano&#39;s&#39; gay -- and said it in a very hateful but bombastic way; all the time. (I know, juvenile example. It&#39;s all very juvenile at this point. It&#39;s amazing no adults seem to exist in the world anymore to hold a reasonable conversation. No, not &#39;finger-pointing&#39; conversation; &#39;reasonable&#39; conversation.) Wouldn&#39;t you just be like, &#39;yeah, I&#39;m gay, so what?&#39; What&#39;s chilling about the whole state of the world is that people think words are the same as realities. So do you like chocolate? Do you stand on principles? Literally 99% of all the chocolate in the world exists on the back of child slave-labor. Look it up. Do you eat chocolate Fantano?<br><br>Oh, to live in so simple a world. Where accusations solve everything. Where things are so cut and dry. But it&#39;s not; and someone needs to be responsible. <br><br>There&#39;s a LOT to talk about regarding Vultures; but unfortunately, no one&#39;s really talking about any of it, at least not yet. <br><br>All power to all the people. Earthlings forever.
Yeah this is 100% fair, I think so if the beats were pretty good, but basically unlistenable
L take I just care if music sound good
I guess this is just another moment where Anthony can‚Äôt separate the art and the artist. Idk why it‚Äôs so difficult for him to do. There are more than just those three types of people that listen to his music that was such a weird way of boiling down everyone into being a piece of sht no matter what
Didn&#39;t you give a full review for a Burzum album before?
The review of all time
funny he say&#39;s all this when he gave You Won¬¥t get What You Want a 10 and also Burzum (this reviews are still up by the way).
Sir! Your ex wife won&#39;t see this and come runnin back to you! Such bait is unnecessary!
Womp womp
Are These all bot comments?
Ok, now, when are you going to post the review then?
held my space bar during this whole vid, did not order a yaperoni pizza
Melon if only teenagers or cult members listened to the album then it wouldn&#39;t be #1 in 100+ countries.<br>Accept the world runs in this way only.
If it‚Äôs so unreviewable then why did you made a whole 7 minute video and took time of your day to do This video üòÇüòÇ you do this to get engagement on your channel and make people talk about you cause that‚Äôs been your whole career
Ye lives rent free in Fantano&#39;s head.
Dude spoke my mind
How are you commenting on Kanye saying &quot;disgusting&quot; things about his wife when you were on Twitter talking shit calling her a dollar store Kim earlier today?
Burn is, fittingly, fire, that is enough for me
That is the most Italian gangster intro I&#39;ve ever seen from Fantano.
Of course the neo-nazi hates black people
Lol, clown.
No I don‚Äôt think people want you to separate your brain from your skull, people want music critiques to separate their self imposed ego and their world views from their music reviews
You see the issue is, he&#39;s right. <br><br>Excpet for the part about the lyrics. When he said, &quot;Crazy, bipolar, antisemite.&quot; Hes saying that no matter what you call him, hes still the king. Hes not saying hes a proud antisemite. <br><br>When he says, &quot;And my bitch lookin like a reference&quot; I think the word &quot;reference&quot; refers to the model that fashion designers desgin thier clothes around.
Get a life bro Kanye‚Äôs the goat
Was hitler not allowed to create great art ?
I really don&#39;t understand American rap culture and the way Americans relate to it. Fantano says calling his partner &quot;a reference&quot; is &quot;one of the grossest and most dehumanizing&quot; things ever, but then the whole line says &quot;my b*tch looking like a reference&quot;, and he doesn&#39;t bat an eye to the &quot;my b*tch&quot; part ‚Äî I guess just because rappers do that all the time, so it&#39;s... fine? Still, how is that not gross? I am not American so maybe I just don&#39;t get it, but I just wanted to express my puzzlement about it.
Genuinely curious: did fantano gave good reviews to artists that were proven to be actual convicted murderers? Oh wait ...üòÖ
If I knew nothing about all the gross, weird shit Kanye has said over the last 2 years, this still would sound like a middle-aged man off his meds rapping over iight production. It‚Äôs post-divorce-dad-bummer-sex-rap. Went into this with high hopes due to the hype, the first six songs are unfinished at best or actively causing me to cringe at worst. It just left me kinda sad for Ye. He‚Äôs not getting better. Shout out to Ty though, he‚Äôs carrying on this album. <br><br>Hope Kanye can get himself some real help, it seems like most of his fans care more about getting remarkably mid music out of him than seeing him healthy at this point.
Just review the actual album give it a 0 if you want bro
totally unbiased
rofl
how did it feel once youu seperated the pen from your devorrce papers?
this guys wife left him, he‚Äôs bald, and he‚Äôs pushing 60, i‚Äôd be mad too
Kanye West is Salman Khan
Ever since the Fader incident, you‚Äôve been overcompensating with performative and disingenuous left wing virtue signaling. It‚Äôs just weird that you‚Äôre not consistent with it. Sexyy Red has multiple transphobic and homophobic bars but you don‚Äôt seem to care about that.
Giving a Kayne opinion is now equivalently polarized as giving an actual political opinion.<br>At least he isn&#39;t running for president anymore.
Notice how they never say YE was wrong.  Just that he was &quot;bad&quot;.
Lol don‚Äôt worry there‚Äôs 2 more coming üòå
If the album was called Kids See Vultures it would be a 10
As someone who doesn&#39;t like Kanye but is interested in the music, who also thought this album was bad; I do wish he talked about the tracks some more.<br>There were heaps of moments on this record where Kanye just took something he did in the past and repeated it but worse.
Album is a 8/10 . Some great tracks , some tracks that might need tuning . You are blinded by rage , have a day off foolüòÇ
Fantano, fame is getting in your head.<br>When you lose it, do remember your hot takes like this one. Absolute trash opinion.
Ni se gasto en que se vea bien el croma, lo detesta con cada c√©lula de su cuerpo
pathetic
bro just review the album..
Burn kinda fucks tho
Wait, so are we pretending Kanye doesn&#39;t have a genuine mental illness?
So he&#39;s too anti-semitic that you can&#39;t support him by reviewing the album. But you can make a clickbait review sure to stir up a conversation surrounding kanye and do a live stream listening to the album which is sure to promote it. Fantano just wants to cash in on his chunk of the mentally ill rapper while virtue signaling. If you genuinely cared about his negative impact you wouldn&#39;t even acknowledge his album outside of some twitter replies instead of doing exactly what Kanye wants you to do.
Tell me you live in LA without telling me you live in LA. Guy hates kanye cause of his fans. Rate the music, not the politics. Its satire lyrics
CLEARED him
So i listened to the album 5 times and I have come to the conclusion that though people have different music taste but no true music lover can deny the greatness of this masterpiece.
Kanye COOKED ON THIS CLASSIC
Your wife divorced you lol
average L from fantano
Finally giving Kanye a 10
what a cop-out
Womp womp cry about it
Okay I‚Äôll review it for you. I liked it, but not that impressive. 7.25/10. See how easy that was?
It‚Äôs hard for me to imagine fantano listening to some of these songs and just shaking his head instead of vibing to it. Like yeah it‚Äôs not Kanye‚Äôs best work but it‚Äôs definitely not his worst album. It seems like the negative bias has distracted him from some of the actual good music on the album. üòÖ
Kayne is absolute trash
Bro is allergic to fun, so lame just review the music broüò≠
Bro review the album not the person you‚Äôre such a bad music reviewer fr
No way dude is yapping about politics in his video
so what do you rate it
This album was so bad that he didn&#39;t even give it a NOT GOOD or a Strong 0.
People‚Äôs personal beliefs has not always stopped you from reviewing their music. You only do that selectively. Doesn‚Äôt seem fair so to speak.
You must melon, so bradtaste in music has content
I used to be a big fan of Fantano, but he just exudes bias towards Kanye<br><br>If you didn‚Äôt want to review the album you wouldn‚Äôt have. You cant act like you dont want to promote this kind of music while you collect ad revenue on the clout from dropping a review.<br><br>Also the vernacular is entirely disrespectful on a personal level where it seems forced, and it always has been for Kanye. Have to believe hes just leaning into not liking Kanye as being his ‚Äúthing‚Äù at this point<br><br>Also didn‚Äôt mention the songs he couldn‚Äôt pretend not to like at all
It&#39;s unreviewable because he secretly likes it.
And Michael Jackson fucked kids but everyone loves his music
This gotta be the most biased review I‚Äôve seen
Art can be transgressive and offensive, Anthony has became such a sell out its insane
ÏßÑÏßú Í∞úÏ∞êÎî∞Í∞ôÎÑ§
How the divorce goin?
You have reviewed actual murders yet you clutch pearls at this. Bfr
Honestly all I wanted to hear from Anthony about this album is how good Freddie&#39;s verse was and I still managed to get that.  Thank you Anthony
The album was so good that it had Anthony contemplating and conceptualizing what a music review even is
you gave sexyy redd a 8 you lost all credibility
God fantano is so unbelievably wokescoldy it‚Äôs embarrassing
ok
‚ÄúUnreviewable 1‚Äù‚Ä¶. <b>Reviews the album from </b><b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=307">5:07</a></b><b> - </b><b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=423">7:03</a></b>
Bro went full Karen in this review LOL
Thumbnail gives off disappointed father that couldn&#39;t be less proud of his son vibes
i actually got to agree with fantano on this. Listen to kanye how much you want but  to me he is a very big antisemite and a general weirdo
shit takes like these are why your wife left u
good promo for vultures ngl

But still makes a video cause Kanye‚Äôs name will get him views
Not really the biggest Kanye fan, but I do enjoy his work as an artist, there are many lyrics which are musically poor in Vultures, and the lyrics going towards Jews and the Jew community are definitely offensive.<br>But if there&#39;s something that I don&#39;t find quite well on your video and statements, is you are margining all his fans as either immature, psychos, weirdos, people with meaningless lives, or just ignorant. <br>I understand you saying that after the comments you usually get on videos criticizing what Kanye has been saying the past few years, but I don&#39;t think it appropriate to just carry all his fans on these 3 groups you made up, I&#39;m definitely disappointed by his attitude and Kanye has always had something else going on in his head, we all know that, but getting to the point where you just become a hate influence towards whoever listens to him also seems kind of offensive and a double standard, If you don&#39;t have anything to say, don&#39;t say anything, you fall perfectly into the peer pressure of being criticized by Kanye&#39;s fans on your videos, and you are just being as immature as a 14 year old who just found out about him and hasn&#39;t really listened to any real music or hip-hop throughout his life at all.<br><br>Overall, you are a grown ass man, doing childish shit.
Lol why even make this video?
hard agree, people are absolute clowns right now over kanye and this shit is exclusively music for antisemites. if youre a nazi, youll love these songs! otherwise, you should legitimately review your critical thinking. ye&#39;s life is EVERYWHERE in all of his music, thats what made bipolar and TLOP great albums. when the man behind it becomes a literal antisemite and the music becomes alt right, you are literally just listening to an alt right clown&#39;s delusions. this project is unreviewable trash.
He definitely loved the album
1. You‚Äôre bald<br>2. Your wife left you <br>3. You make the content equivalent of McDonald‚Äôs<br>4. You are a petulant child pretending to be a music reviewer<br>5. draaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiiin gaaaaaang
you already fell off, dunno why you&#39;re still trying lol
That new Brittany Howard tho....
Swear he‚Äôs a Kanye hater üò≠
Fantano describing Kanye&#39;s fanbase as cult like might be the most unintentionally funny and tone deaf thing he&#39;s ever said. Have you ever interacted with your own fanbase Anthony?
W VIDEO ‚ù§
But if Kim jong un  dropped this album he would give it a 10
you criticize his actions yet profit off of him by making countless tiktoks and videos even after the fact. <br><br>it‚Äôs also titled ‚Äúunreviewable‚Äù yet you do just that
Dont attack a whole fanbase like that bruh
For people who only care about music and not identity politics, this album is a 6/10-7/10. Only hope Ye improves on Vultures 2 and 3.
You only hate Kanye cuz he‚Äôs a nazi. Wait‚Ä¶Nazis are genocidal maniacs‚Ä¶ Euh‚Ä¶ Actually yeah nazism is bad but euhh you are a hypocrite for not liking his music because euhhh‚Ä¶.
Wahwahwah What a piss baby
This isnt a review dude, PLS WTF IS THIS
Completely biased, if you‚Äôre going to review an album say all the good and bad. Yes there are lines that make it hard to listen to, but to say it‚Äôs worse than Jesus is King is just a cop out. Why even mention the negatives you made up for yourself when you admit you can‚Äôt say how you actually feel about it.
Most deranged comments section I&#39;ve seen in a while. Absolutely appropriate review.
too racist, unsubscribed
I do agree with the sentiment of this video but going on about this while also having Kanye in the weekly track round up with no mention of any of this and no comments on anything beside how that song sounded feels contradictory
Shut up
It s pretty sad how you review someone&#39;s political seeings instead of music,it s not a 10/10 but this being &#39;&#39;unreviewable&#39;&#39; is straight up a joke.
ur corny
6/10
this mental breakdown is very embarrassing, fantano. this album is at the very least a 7/10. you don&#39;t have to admit it for us to know that.
Expected nothing else from this guy. It‚Äôs Kanye, of course he was gonna give a bad review
cringe tano
He didn&#39;t even said the ‚ÄúAnthony Fantano, artist name, album name: Forever‚Äù outro. Respect!
lol pretentious
So this was a person-review rather than a music review
kinda happy about this, its good to stand your ground on what you think to be the right thing even if some of your viewerbase is upset about it.
what happened to you?
The production was the best part imo. <br>Everytime i think &#39;&#39;hey this song could be pretty good&#39;&#39; kanye says some horrible shit. Lyrical lowlights all over. Ty Dolla carried.
no matter what kanye has done vultures is still terrible
L ratio you are balding
Bro just review the music
Based
Ahahahhaa Kanye broke melon üò≠
man im not a stereotype its just good music i dont agree with what he said but its enjoyable music
Anthony just jealous that he can‚Äôt post his wife on the instagram as Kanye do
&quot;I dont like the album cause he hates jews&quot; thats the whole video in a phrase. Yeah he said all the things he said but cant we just enjoy the album? What does the burn have to do with anyone? Or back to me?
BEAUTIFUL UNREVIEWABLE ALBUMS JUST DONT FALL OUT THE SKY YA KNOW?
Yet your profiting off his name same for Tory love white liberals cause you swear you have some type of moral code yet profit off these people you seem to think are horrible
Most racist Fantano vid yet
Libthony Cucktano coming heavy with the virtue signaling  ü§£ü§£
And yet Ye is still King
He sounds slow ngl. I didn‚Äôt know he‚Äôs on the spectrum. Now I understand why he gets so many views.
My Jewdar is going parabolic ü§î
fantano i hate kanye and i hate you too so explain thatüòÖ
BLAH BLAH BLAH YAP YAP YAP YAP YAP YP YAP YAP YAP YAP
The instrumentals on this was garbage
i am antisemitic because i like an album i guess
at least it was not a 6
MBDTF started his career, Vultures bout to end it apparently. Worst review in the last 5 years period. This is the graveyard of music criticism. Shame
bro shut up nobody cares about your leftie political agenda you are a music reviewer go review music. you usa people are so politicized that you are unable to even listen to music and just appreciate it. I don‚Äôt give a fuck about your political take as I don‚Äôt give a fuck about kanye‚Äôs political views
the messy chroma is key
It gets harder and harder to be a Kanye fan I swear
What a edgy title woooooo very impressive
this isnt a review
He gave it a 0 on AOTY
remember you run a music channel
Review the album baldy
Explain why it went #1 in Israel üáÆüá± on Apple Music üòÇ
We are watching an h3h3 level fall off in real time
Once again the clouds are gathering to release what they held in, spread love everybody, empathy for everyone
If there‚Äôs only 2 or 3 types of Kanye fans, they‚Äôre must only be 2 or 3 types of people in the whole world because the album is #1 global
When the album is so bad, it doesn‚Äôt even get a Not Good.
He used to have unbiased reviews. Now he&#39;s just trying to have controversial takes so he can become relevant again.
shut up
Fantano doesnt care about Black People
Kanye likes fish sticks
fanti, you&#39;re being too political. Today you&#39;re acting like a vulture. Please get some rest and provide us with valuable content.
You‚Äôre supposed to review the music, not his fanbase. Hope that helps.
Now imagine it was called The Vultures Store
Cry about it bald man
Burn sounds like a generic pop song yet boys a lier part 2 is a top song of 2023
Bruh
no deadass i love some of ye&#39;s older stuff but its all soiled by his terrible takes and it actually pisses me off so much. i literally used to be able sorta just listen to him in secret and think about how cool he used to be but its too hard to ignore now.
Geez some of these comments are exactly what Anthony is talking about. People are so indoctrinated into the Kanye world.
I‚Äôm a nihilistic teenager I guess.
Review of political opinion with a sprinkle of music
This is mad corny boycotting someone by making a video on them
leftists like fantano are undoubtedly the worst kind of american in 2024. easily.
you really dont have to shove down our throats that you are the biggest kanye hater
The fantano effect is real, his goons have bombarded the site echoing what they heard from him üò≠
looking too deep into the lyric
here&#39;s a real review for yall while your here<br><br>overall thoughts are that it&#39;s decent:<br><br>this may be the first album I&#39;ve ever heard that&#39;s actually backloaded instead of the opposite. If you have any interest in this album and haven&#39;t heard it yet start the album at burn and ignore anything before that.<br><br>Dolla sign and the production carry a lot of the time with Kanye&#39;s only good verses for me being burn, do it, carnival, and problematic.<br><br>Carti on carnival is the best feature on the album to me but if you like more lyrical type stuff it&#39;ll probably be Freddie on back to me.<br><br>Beg forgiveness would be top 5 on the album if it wasn&#39;t 6 minutes long. there&#39;s too much dead space and the instrumental isn&#39;t strong enough to carry those sections. should&#39;ve been like 4 minutes.<br><br>a few more specific thoughts:<br><br>yall can say I have the humor of a 12 year old IDC that beautiful big titty women bar is funny as hell to me and I will never not enjoy it. <br><br>Kanye&#39;s verse ruined paid, would&#39;ve been top 5 if it wasn&#39;t for that goofy shit.<br><br>Travis&#39;s verse on fuck sumn was kinda disappointing, it was way too short and I&#39;ve never liked that high-pitched voice he does sometimes.<br><br>carnival SLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPSSSSSSS best song on the album and it&#39;s really not that close<br><br>my favorite tracks from vultures beat my favorite tracks from donda but while donda had more mid songs on it, vultures has more straight up bad on it.<br><br><br>TOP 3 TRACKS: fuck sumn, burn, carnival<br><br>BOTTOM 3 TRACKS: paperwork, keys to my life, hoodrat<br><br>RATING: 7/10 on a good day 6/10 on a bad day
7 minute yap session
Mid West
he made graduation
Looks at that! Someone who is not going to stand the bullshit that is Kanye. It&#39;s rare.
Good on you melon. YouTube comments are pretty cancerous in here but the statement you made here is highly admirable and I appreciate how you went about this. Your opinion has always had an impact and this couldn‚Äôt have been done better
The amount of virtue signaling Fantano partakes in is fucking hilarious. Disgusting, but hilarious. Dude&#39;s not self aware at all
the disastrous consequences of the concept of Death of the Author reaching the public, it&#39;s never &quot;separate the art from the artist bro&quot; when talking about artists who aren&#39;t weirdos
Kanye - ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre so valuable‚Äù, in regard to naked women. <br><br>also Kanye - proceeds to put an ass naked woman on the album cover
if this album was called &quot;the vulture store&quot; he would&#39;ve given it a 10
At this point, everything I hear about Kanye West just makes me deeply sad and disappointed.
So its not a 10 got it
this album was truly awful, unreviewable indeed
Jokes aside, I hope Bianca is okay. If Kanye doesn&#39;t try / intentionally torches his career so much, his marriage can&#39;t be any better.
watching a dude with a hitler mustache talk about Kanye being anti semetic comical
Show us on the doll where Kanye hurt you the left wing bias is really showing
New idea? Keep politics out of ALBUM reviews you&#39;re here to talk about the music itself not what&#39;s going on with the artist outside of the album. This isn&#39;t dramaalert this isn&#39;t CNN I don&#39;t need a recap of what&#39;s been going on in Ye&#39;s life since 2022. Trust me I know it&#39;s happening you never fail to mention it anytime the guys name is brought up and you spend 70% of every video about him rambling about 3 points regarding it
Kanye about to sample this review on the next album
If you&#39;re still a fan of Kanye at this point...you&#39;re simply just trash.
If you didn‚Äôt want attention, you shouldn‚Äôt have reviewed it or just not acknowledged it.
Fantano is soft. He knows that the album is amazing. Stop pandering so that you still have friends. Also you play zero instruments or possess any talent to judge others
People in the comments can&#39;t handle this video lmfaooooo actually pathetic to still be riding for Kanye
Vultures gave me great music and finally the push I needed to unsubscribe from this dork. Cheers Ye and Ty
The man is so over rated- his lyrics are a complete embarrassment to lyric writing- not sure where the genius part comes in since he uses 10 producers and ghost writers on every track
review starts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=306">5:06</a>
God you could tell how much it pains him that the album was a genuine 9/10.
Respect ‚úä
I hate everything he is doing but i still like his music... :(
Comment section: He doesn&#39;t even talk about the record<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=270">4:30</a>-end:
rubbing his moustache after talking about hitler is wild
So clearly there‚Äôs a lot of brainless Kanye fans in the comments
i watched your live reaction and you&#39;re just overhating at this point, even though you called CARNIVAL trash you were still bumping to the song LOL. you have no reason to be hating this much unless you&#39;re trying to get head from a jewish girl or some shit
&quot;feel like im getting punked.&quot; Exactly. I think this Andy Kaufman levels of performance art. Not my cup of tea, but i feel that&#39;s what he&#39;s doing. He&#39;s like cartoon level villainish, which is kind of funny considering we&#39;ve never really seen something like this before
If this album was called Good Kid M.A.A.D Vulture 1 he would give this a 10
if this was called good vultures maad vultures, u would give it a 9
‚ÄúHis public Image is forever altered by all of this‚Äù üò¥This is Kanye West we‚Äôre talking about.
And he‚Äôs still the king üó£Ô∏è
Unreviewable should = no review, this a cash grab
You don&#39;t really do either of these in half of your reviews. Perfect example is you giving every Ken Carson and Destroy Lonely project a 0 or a 1 just cause you feel like it. &quot;ohh these all sound the same they&#39;re all whiny and have no inspiration or depth&quot; followed by 9 extra minutes of rambling so you can hit that 10 minute mark and get ads on the reviews
Jonah hill please save me jonah hill
thinking about how important this video will be to the fantano lore in 5+ years
Bro you are definitely just a jew and offended, silly goose
D1 hater
LOL remember when you said ‚Äúwhatever. You can‚Äôt stop me from listening to burzum, I don‚Äôt care.‚Äù YOU gave neo nazis a platform bro by seriously reviewing them LOL
The comments are only proving fantano&#39;s point further...
i kinda like this album tbh
Bro barely talked about the music lmao
Rent is dueüíÄüò≠
I don‚Äôt get why you had to lump in all Kanye listeners as either cultists nihilistic teenagers or insane conspiracists.. I‚Äôm a Jew and I listen to Kanye.. quite honestly I don‚Äôt agree with what he says but I still like that his music helped me through a time in my life where I was undergoing tremendous change. And for that I owe him a lot of gratitude. Kanye fans aren‚Äôt ALL inherently bad people. Let‚Äôs stop generalizing please
Take melatonin mr melon
He made graduation what did you make?
fantano was in his prime when he reviewed burzum albums
Bro you don‚Äôt know music
I prefer this approach to the way you talked about Burzum
Wheres the lie tho
If the hoodrat instrumental was on a death grips album you would give it a 10, get the fuck over yourself
I‚Äôm a num 3 kanye fan and I hate the album, except burn and bigotry women
You‚Äôre washed bro
You care about the politics more than the music
Fantona has no life bro he depends on kanye for clout ,bro is just sad to me GEEK
All of the braindead parasocial Kanye fans in comments proving your point IMMEDIATELY lmaoo
Kanye fell off
Blood definitely likes Burn and doesn‚Äôt want to admit it üíÄüò≠
That&#39;s the look of a man realizing he&#39;s about to lose half his audience for doing the right thing
Fantano separate music from politics challenge, difficulty impossible
Despite hating the album, Fantano still bought the album cover to put on the wall for the wall. He even managed to find a zoomed in and edited version too, what a great find! This is a guy that‚Äôs working his hardest for us viewers, thank you Fantano!
Kanye West hates black people.
Pussy ass video. You still review it anyway despite saying its unreviewable wow. I didnt care for it much either but it&#39;s not unreviewable lmao
In the end, he wasn&#39;t a pure music critic either.
Fantano stop yelling you‚Äôre scaring me :(
Your Hitler moustache has a moustache.
shut up nerd
Melon is not being reasonable unlike Kanye West who is the most reasonable person that ever lived.
You called someone ignorant. Rap and ignorance go hand in hand
Proud Kanye fan type 3! üéâ stream vultures, its S tier music. üòä
Kanyes mom died for this? Shit, she&#39;s looking up at him, shaking her head. Thank christ for Run the Jewels and Aesop Rock.
Lame!
You&#39;re pushing 40 and still havent grown out of your pretentious preachy stage when it comes to politics nobody wants to hear it. Just review the music
We got a yapper
I love being the nialistic teenager it&#39;s so much fun
Fantano jew confirmed
Anthony this was NOT what I was expecting from a second redux of MBDTF but you do you i guess
He def a Jew
big kanye fan. albums sucks.
carti choked a pregnant woman and i guarantee you still review his album<br><br>travis allowed his fans to die in a crowd crush and you reviewed his album lmao
You are a shill bro. What have you contributed to music or society? You have been a net negative to music, particularly hip-hop for a long time. Leaching off of African American&#39;s art for publicity. You are not proving anything to anybody here. Only that you are unable to separate your bias and personal feelings from objectively reviewing music. You know what is great though? Kanye will continue to win and you will be mad and miserly forever.
The rare case of melon pussying out
Thats fine but noone asked you
I completely understand your hesitancy in reviewing this album and all that goes with it, but for a music review channel I don‚Äôt think any of us wanted to see a full on rant against Kanye, not because we support him, but just because it seems unprofessional. But what do i know, just thought it was weird.
So does this count as a ‚Äúnot good‚Äù?
I lowk agree. Am I cooked?
Kanye is proving himself right everyday
I don‚Äôt agree with anything Kanye has ever said or done. But in a case like this, this was a bias review. Remember this is a review if he wanted to make a video talking about the politics he could‚Äôve done that. But remember THIS IS A REVIEW. There should be no political bias whatsoever. And you are deliberately ignoring the actual good tracks everyone is talking about. And just focusing on what you don‚Äôt like. Which is political don‚Äôt make a review if you can‚Äôt separate the art from the artist. Then don‚Äôt review the album, because you‚Äôre spewing out opinions as if it‚Äôs factual when it comes to quality. You came in with an agenda before listening to it. Decided you weren‚Äôt gonna like it than you cherry picked what you didn‚Äôt like. I came into this album expecting it to be terrible. And then adoring it once listening to it. This was a terrible review and when speaking about music you must not be bias. This wasn‚Äôt a review this was a rant.
I think the thing is that there are very few people that when told someone they support is in the wrong they respond with, &quot;you know what, your right&quot;; instead i think more often you&#39;re met with a standoffish denial, but subconsciously they have realize that its not okay. If not then there&#39;s something wrong with them, so don&#39;t get too frustrated
üö¨
i didn‚Äôt know you could get worse than a ‚Äúnot good‚Äù‚Ä¶ holy fuck üò≠
your whole approach to this was so bitter and dishonest....FYI HE SAID A LOT OF SHIT HE DIDNT DO ANYTHING...LAST TIME I CHECKED THIS IS AMERICA ND U CAN SAY W,E TF U WANT... But I still would love to hear what he said that was actually anti semitic? calling himself an anti semite? you should look up prominent figures throughout history that was labeled anti semites, ppl like Martin Luther, Henry ford, Malcolm x, Bobby Fischer .... its a long list u should actually look at the data and stop being and mindless bleeding heart, look around ppl like you are destroying everything including hip hop
The internet&#39;s cringiest music nerd
Thank you for not holding back, much love‚ù§
BOOOO
he must be a jew
i feel like your trying to act too offended rather than just reviewing it
ü§ì
This man is a pro meat rider when it come to Kanye
Bro is offended more than every single Jew on the planet
seperate the art from the artist .
I like it
Cry about it bald man
Fantano reminds me of Hank Hill in this video.
This might be the first video i will dislike
Kanye is living mortgage free in this man‚Äôs head lmao
Oh no those poor Jews are gonna feel bad if bald man reviews the album üò≠
I guess if the shit hit the fan, they are not a fan anymore.
Kanye fell off
Imagine thinking your opinion matters
Fantano on crack
this mf such a baby holy shit üò≠
wow this is a horrible stance for this guy as a critic
Kanye is the best troll in history lol
I just listen to the music bro
This is a kanye review not a Vultures 1 review. &quot;Music critic&quot;
You are a great reviewer for being honest, however this record is totally viable music for you to review. New sounds and fun to listen to if you can focus on some of the points he‚Äôs mentioning like corrupt influence of the media on the public. You also only talk about the worst tracks on the album at the end of the review. Please make a comment on every song at least brother. Stay true to your voice though. Happy to see you incorporate your wide perspective on the space politically.
Kanye‚Äôs latest cultural achievement is completely short-circuiting the critical faculties of our only remaining popular music critic.<br><br>Fantano suuuuuuucks
Bro listened it on muteüíÄüò≠
Bro thinks his opinion matters
This Kanye spiral has been a decade, if not longer, long by now. I used to be able to say &quot;oh but he made X and Y is a banger&quot; but I&#39;m just can&#39;t anymore.
So you can review serial killer rapper albums where they promote drugs violence and gang activity towards children but Kanye says some questionable stuff and that‚Äôs where you draw the line?
&quot;ima fix vultures&quot;
Mf the biggest hater i have ever seen. You call fans biased while you only do positive reviews for left wing artists. Stop mixing politics with music. Actually clean your ears and listen carefully before opening your big as mouth. Shit aint bout Kanye, overall your reviews are the most biased and full of sh1t opinions ive heard. Tuned in to lowkey laugh but sh1t just made me piss off. Maybe if you get your life on track your hair will come back bud
cant wait for the redux
Dababy said that shit about gay people and you still reviewed him

Could u talk about the album on this music review channel
You are a bald regarded acoustic
where‚Äôs your wife buddy
It‚Äôs not an amazing album but not horrible I like Kanye but definitely a max 7/10-8/10 for a big fan and probably a 5/10 for a regular listener, but at least give it a number and then give it a hissy fit after
And yet he&#39;s more marketable and respected in the music industry than you.<br>And aren&#39;t you the Gaza apologist (believe what you want)... Who&#39;s the anti-Semite?
Yeah this comment section is unhinged.  Some of you are hiding behind some racist ass rhetoric, talking about rappers having gun bars proving that they‚Äôve killed someone.  That‚Äôs not true and you know it‚Äôs not true.  It‚Äôs pretending to not understand the basics of hip-hop just to simp for a man who will never care for you.<br><br>More importantly‚Äîfucking context.  There‚Äôs a vast difference between a gangster rapper having a bar about gangbanging, and a artist who not only is anti-Semitic in his music, but brings that out both socially and politically, but also was once considered among the backpacking rappers like Talib Kweli and Mos Def.<br><br>Context matters.
Didnt watch the video but dropped a dislike :) u fell off
&quot;Beautiful, Big Titted, Butt-Naked Women don&#39;t just fall out the sky you know! Sky you know Sky you know and I can tell you one thing, Butt-Naked Women don&#39;t just fall out the sky you know!&quot; üò™üî•üî•üî•
It‚Äôs funny he still reviewed Kanye when he supported trump in 2016 and said slavery was a choice lol . I guess when he was disrespectful to black people it was okay but not the Jewish community noooo .if you had this energy 5 years ago i could at least understand .
If this was called kids see vultures it would be a 10
After watching his live reaction and reading the chat it&#39;s clear now that kanye is attracting bigots and empowering them to proudly say some deplorable shit. I&#39;ve loved kanyes music my entire life and have always appreciated his artistry, but there is no separating the art from the artist with kanye. It&#39;s now being expressed through his music and audience. Also the amount of comments about Anthony&#39;s wife on stream is insane. These people are genuinely unhinged and disconnected from humanity. Anthony looked incredibly hurt, embarrassed, and disappointed throughout. Hope you are well Melon.
Shut up and Enjoy life!
crazy bipolar, antisemite and im still king.
Omg. Fantano just a hater, there&#39;s no fan in him. He&#39;s hatertano now. Bum ass reveiw. That&#39;s why carnival hit #1 global on Spotify.
#1 in 100 countries yet unreviewable
Lol
You gave Kanye a 10 after he was racist against black people. You decide not to review after he spoke against Jewish people. I think you proved his point
BBTBNWDFOTSYK!!
It&#39;s definitely his worst album. My lord look at all these Kanye glazers in the comments. Ty Dolla $ign is terrible and Kanye&#39;s whole antisemite faze is completely cringe. His fanbase is so pathetic and would suck Kanyes ball hairs.
Guys I think he liked the album
i&#39;ll give it a 2 for general production quality and for the song burn
sending hate from brazil &lt;33
Love you melon. But you went full cringe
Thank you for saying this Anthony, even if you are going to be flooded with hate. As a former Kanye superfan who was active on niche Kanye-centric communities like Yandhileaks, his fanbase has devolved into absolute lunacy, and I simply had to break away from it during his 2022 meltdown. This isn&#39;t a group of people interested in having a dialogue or actually engaging with art. They just want to kick and scream, argue with others and antagonize anyone who doesn&#39;t think the same way their monolith does. Such a shame, considering how fun the community used to be. There is nothing to gain from discussing or even engaging with Kanye and his work at this point, so why even bother. Stick to your guns dude!
This is still a review thooooooooooooooooo‚Ä¶ üßê
I just like his music not that deep
This is kinda gay
I don‚Äôt agree with what he says nor do I like the lyrics but I do love the production on some songs. Not his best album but definitely different
Touch grass fantano smell the earth and hold ur nose in the ground for 10 secs and let the bugs nest in your nose
even if there were no lines about jews on the record, &#39;separate the art from the artist&#39; is privileged shit.  there is no music or art that is more important than the safety of marginalized people.
Album review not talking about the album. Feeling a light 1 on this video
If this album was called ‚Äúkids see vultures‚Äù he would give it a 10
Wokethany Woketano<br> here
Ye fans are just so whack üòÇ
Anthony is just jealous Ms. Westie isnt his bestie üíÖüèøüíÖüèø
Okay from the gist of the comments it seems you are being a bit biased so ima unsubscribe
This album is very middington
Bro said on the stream ‚Äúthat if you play hoodrat to friends who don‚Äôt listen kanye they will hang you with the cord and never give the axu‚Äù, but if you play any of the songs from scaring the hoes to people that don‚Äôt listen that type of song they will do the same.
Everyone screaming Antisemitism, but no one talks about the fact that all these powerful Jewish CEOs and label companies literally make their money from EXPLOITING black people lol.
I‚Äôm a HUGE Ye fan and I have to agree. This album is by far his worst album. This is the first time I‚Äôve ever been disappointed by Ye, musically. His music went down the drain along with his Christian morals.
Everyone in the comments so mad üòÇ the albums terrible
26k to 17k u did smth wrong
bro is off his rocker
Remember when you seriously reviewed convicted murderer and infamous neo-nazi Burzum but now you sold out so Kanye West (Imfao) is too beyond the pale?
couldn‚Äôt hear you over #1 on trending
I like Kanye West but this album was mediocre
This is a very fair assessment. However, I am a Kanye fan and love it. Music is very subjective and it‚Äôs tough for people to understand
Melon congratulations to you because despite your clear distaste for the person IMO as a KanYE West fan I see that you still managed to have a fair musical critic of the album objectively based on your taste in music and not your opinions of the anti Semitic person behind it
absolutely agree. kanye fucking sucks.
Yuno miles &gt; ye
Bro just trashing everything about the album and it‚Äôs kinda lame, only going after Kanye when it‚Äôs literally a collab project
Loopy‚Äôs cards are not as hard to install as these ones, but they are still recommended for people who know what they are doing.
Guys I don‚Äôt think Fantano likes racist people like Kanye
Burger king
Libthony Tardtano
So‚Ä¶. Did you like? Did you hate it? What would you rate it? üòÖ
Agree with everything you said. People don&#39;t realize how much the 2022 incident changed him and some of the lyrics in Vultures 1 are very corny and hard to listen to. Not only that but I think this is his worst album, yes, worse than JIK and WTT. Kanye decided to keep the worst versions of the songs from the album + mediocre mixing in a lot of parts and only a few actual good songs. Now I know that Kanye is not one of the best humans rn but he is a musical genius, this album is still a 6/10-7/10 imo.
Does anyone know if he still does music reviews after his divorce? I‚Äôve been looking but all I see is political stuff?
Simply‚Ä¶ separate the art from the artist..?
I&#39;d love to see the dislike bar on this one lmfao
Of course the white man is hating on black people and during bhm? Smh
bruh are you going to review the album, the music, or you are gonna just throw hate to the person that make the album jjajdsakdj
Anthony when he actually has to review music like his YouTube channel says instead of talking about someones incorrect political opinions
I think even if we‚Äôre just to judge this thing solely for the music, it completely lacks identity. I‚Äôve seen people praise it for songs that sound like MBDTF, TLOP, Yeezus or any other of his work. It just kind of resembles his past (and much more quality) work rather than reinventing it. He‚Äôs had a long career where he‚Äôs reinvented himself consistently, I don‚Äôt expect him at this point to provide something completely new. But while I think the album is fairly listenable, it‚Äôs also extremely forgettable when its best moments are just reminders of much better material.
Burzum
bros really mad lmaoüòÇ
Meanwhile he gave sexyy red 8/10 ü§°
womp womp
The album was total ass, maybe that&#39;s why his wife&#39;s ass is on the cover.
We jus like his music nigga calm down
We get it fandango you like what the woke people like
Anphoney Fagtano
lost a lot of respect for you with u
4. People who realize he has a mental illness and are able to recognize that while he need serious help and the people around him aren&#39;t good i influences, he makes good music and will listen regardless
It‚Äôs almost like Kanye is bipolar, and might go into manic episodes where he says crazy insane stuff
just talk about the music bro<br><br>I&#39;d rather you give it a 0 than hear you yap for 7 minutes
Kanye is a real n word
I‚Äôve never seen a more miserable person in my life
Should Kanye do his next album w Mc Ride?
Guys, there&#39;s something wrong with this video. There&#39;s no number at the end that tells me how I should feel about this music. And worst of all, there&#39;s no TRAN-SITION. I&#39;m kinda flustered by this tbh.
I did like the album but I don&#39;t blame anyone for not wanting to listen to his music anymore
After being subscribed for 10+ years, will be unsubscribing. Not reviewing this but other artists who have done much worse lmao crazy
Cool but where is the music review?
Remember when you made comments about Ye&#39;s wife&#39;s appearance because you hated this album, yeah we remember, misogynist.
Thing is, he made a good album or two and then called himself a genius. Every idiot after that believed it, so no matter how shit or overrated his music is now, or how irrational he behaves, they attribute it to the quirks or eccenteicities of a &quot;genius. &quot;<br>Kinda like a Salvador Dali,  except Dali  was truly good.
I love how mad kanye makes this dude shits beautiful lmao rent free
this is fire. your points on the types of ye fans is completely accurate as well. i made a video about ye a year ago, specifically about all this, and i unironically got these three types in my reddit mentions. i had actually completely forgotten about it, but then you brought it all back to my memory lmao.
You might think he is hating but as a KanYE West fan I have to give melon credit<br>Paid being a downgrade of Fade in every shape and form is a very solid take and it truly shows that melon knows KanYE skills well so even on a purely music standpoint he knows how to criticise him even though obviously he is personally so appalled by ye
It&#39;s really fucking concerning to me that like half the comments on this video are apologetic/bordering on supportive of Kanye. Either there are way more actual Nazis alive today than I thought or the education system in this country has really and distinctly failed to give people a full picture of just how fucking psychotic and dangerous real antisemitism is (in Kanye&#39;s case it&#39;s even worse, he literally has befriended out and about open Nazis, not just any random antisemitic dipshit). To all the &quot;I just care about the music&quot; people, I am begging you, please reevaluate your life, because idk how music you like could possibly justify supporting actual fucking Nazis! Do you even hear yourselves! And to all those who clearly agree with Kanye&#39;s antisemitic opinions in this comment section, do us all a favor and strongly consider eating lead ‚úåüèª‚ù§
How was the divorce??
Fanta no only supports Jews when it fits his narrative. He could care less about the 1000 Jews that died when HAMAS launched their attack in October, but this is where he draws the line? In the type I took to write this he‚Äôs tweeted TWICE with anti Israel prop. Ridiculous
why the hell are so many people defending &quot;ye&quot; in the comments? this is crazy, he&#39;s a douchebag and his music and lyrics now are insufferable too<br><br>also, I saw someone bring up that Burzum review fantano did 12 years ago trying to defend ye, and that&#39;s also dumb as shit, it was fucking 12 years ago, things change people grow up
You‚Äôve reviewed music made by criminals btw
So if he didn‚Äôt do the whole new thing it‚Äôd be a 7/10?
Im not gonna review this album but heres a biased review
If it was called ‚Äúculture vultures‚Äù which you are you woulda loved it
This video falls into the first intention you pointed out; just because your reasons for disliking the album are heavily influenced by external factors which bleed into most songs, it doesn&#39;t make it impossible to make people reflect on the album&#39;s quality, which is exactly what you did. I believe the &quot;unreviewable&quot; status is meant to shock because you were offended by Ye&#39;s actions. Thus, I find no problem in the methods you employ, but you certainly don&#39;t sound like a &#39;music critic,&#39; more like someone who is salty over Ye&#39;s unapologetic and alt-right tendencies.<br><br>From my end, the general public reception wasn&#39;t bad, most people liked it, and artists did not find it as bad (like Peggy and most of the top-of-the-charts feats) as you. I believe most people see it as Ye challenging the status quo but refuse to delve into the actual meaning or political implications of his sayings. Then, his rebellious status paired with NSBM imagery (which never fails to slip back into mainstream trends) engenders something that sounds unique, polarizing, weird, and refreshing to viewers that might completely disagree and even understand how it&#39;s <b>actually</b> dangerous to bring Nick Fuentes back into conventional media, for instance. It&#39;s no doubt that Ye knows he&#39;s in this powerful position that seems to mix everything that&#39;s intense about our times: alt-right extremism, misogyny, misinformation, internet trolling, violence, and so on... So, you cannot deny that &quot;Vultures&quot; is a villainesque statement about our times and cannot judge people for taking part in it, as it is pleasing to engage in destructive (artistic) behavior; after all, we don&#39;t need to have a sharp moral compass working 24/7 on every piece of art we consume.<br><br>Your stance on this whole thing is that of someone who naively opposes the villain, while most people are just witnessing a major disruption in the music world as they enjoy a great story; that&#39;s why your video sounds corny af.
this is trash... fantano is a pandering clown ... &quot;kanye said some forbidden truths one time, so hes unreviewable forever now&quot;  üí©ü§°
So you didn‚Äôt like the music or you don‚Äôt like Kanye? I thought you reviewed music
I did not hate it
Common Melon L
I think your criticisms of Ye are fair and true, but Jesus is King is a good album ‚ÄºÔ∏è
Good to see the unhinged Kanye stans have taken over the comments section here.
Beautiful big titty woman just don&#39;t fall out the sky, ya know.
Thank you for saying this Kanye fans are the worst
IJFAJB
Ok but on a scale of 1 to metaphysically impossible to review how unreviewable is it?
yapped for 7 minutes just to say it&#39;s actually good smh
Conservatives listen to leftist music and watch movies with leftist actors. You don&#39;t have to hate music just because you disagree with his opinions.
you can just tell fantano is a democrat.
Still waiting for you to review that Christ Dillinger track &quot;Fuck Anthony&quot;
You think a man who‚Äôs job is to review music would be the first to separate the art from the artist but not this man, he rather talk about politics, idk how this dude has a fan baseüòÇ
Crazy how immature so many people in the comments are.
Fantano often calls out Israel but if Kanye does it, it is un acceptable
I agree melon I thought burn was the best song on the album
The album is good who the fuck cares
okay i actually appreciate this because he‚Äôs saying exactly what a lot of people are thinking but would be slandered for ‚Äúspeaking against‚Äù kanye when really i think it‚Äôs the reverse and more ppl have realized him for just a fucking plain bitch. bro i became a fan in 2021 like a big one now 2024 is here and i barely listen even w the new shit bc he‚Äôs spiraled to such a low level piece of fucking garbage and it really is the ego of him and his fan base that think everything he does is godly is literally the result of him brainwashing so whatever, go ahead let them run around w nazi fascist ass logos on their clothes and be judged by people further im all here for it because i can‚Äôt wait to watch this man fail finally. what he‚Äôs saying is very accurate on the state of things and the people who get it get it so i can really appreciate this.
Album is a classic, amazing record. But your taste is dofshit as per usual so no shocker here
Wow, first time Virtue Signal/10 for an album score üòÆ
The fact that anyone listens to Kanye still after everything he‚Äôs done is baffling‚Ä¶
The biggest rappers on the planet are featured on the album do u hate them too ü§î
There wasn&#39;t a single good song on this album. <br>Again, Kanye hasn&#39;t created anything good in the last 10 years (both in music and everything else).
Fantano I swear, as a Brazilian who don&#39;t even understand the lyrics, I just like how the music sounds
Ok ur wrong
The album is so awful a part of me thinks Kanye is trolling.
Sounds like baldie over here got triggered by le epic kanye troll cus he got no wife
I can‚Äôt wait for his next album! Not!‚Ä¶
If fantano had such a big problem with Kanye he should‚Äôve just stopped reviewing/covering any of Kanye‚Äôs content. To even refer to any of the tracks he mentioned he had to have listened to the songs more than a couple of times giving Kanye a couple more streams thus directly supporting him.
From ‚ÄòKids See Ghosts‚Äô and ‚ÄòYe‚Äô, to‚Ä¶ whatever this is. The depth of Anthony‚Äôs despair and betrayal is inexpressible
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=274">4:34</a> let people enjoy what they like, your true nazi colors are showing fantano.
L
in light of israels genocide are we really still all that scandalized with his comments anymore?
So basically. U loved it
music is all love, hope you&#39;re doing well :)
do the thing
He made graduation
Ahora decilo sin llorar pelado
Fantano claiming Kanye‚Äôs reputation is fucked is absolutely crazy this is the most relevant album release Kanye had in a while I really enjoy the sounds it‚Äôs not perfect I would give it a light 9
Remember, this same dude gave Lil Pump a 7 and Sexxy Red an 8.
Your best review by far.
Damn that‚Äôs crazy I liked the album. I guess I‚Äôm antisemitic now üíî
glad that there‚Äôs a voice out there to state kanye‚Äôs wrongdoings, love anthony for that &lt;3 <br><br>but to all of you who won‚Äôt shut up for one minute &amp; listen to what anthony gotta say, clearly shows how close-minded kanye‚Äôs fanbase is
This is unreviewable and Sexyy Red got an 8/10‚Ä¶ let that sink in‚Ä¶
corny bald man
im a lifelong kanye fan but cmon yall be real its not a good album
Does Fantano have actual fans anymore? He‚Äôs doing the same thing he did to Daniel Caesar back in 2018. Trying to tell a black man what to say or how to think it‚Äôs outrageous ü§£ dude is a bum
Well do you know Kanye west is a Psychotic mentally ill person don¬¥t you fantano ?, reason does not match with his mind
Still better than mbdtf isn&#39;t it melon?
Says its unreviewable. Reviews the music.
I listened to this today, and it really is a shit album. I give it a light to decent 0
Not gonna lie man this isnt a good look for you. Your political leanings are showing yet again. Put a lid on it. Your black wife can survive without you white knighting her for 10 seconds.
so.... light 6?
Why are you guys booing him he‚Äôs right
‚ÄúI cant review this album‚Äù<br>Proceeds to review parts of the album<br><br>Glad to know you‚Äôre better than us, mr high-and-mighty. Your dumbass couldn‚Äôt even understand the reference line correctly. No, it‚Äôs not my favorite album, I‚Äôd even say it‚Äôs pretty bad, but for an album reviewer to act like he‚Äôs above reviewing an album is truly something else.
this is why his wife left
Dang this album is so bad Anthony had to end the review like an apology video
I think there is an issue with people praising celebrities and general when a lot of them have mental issues and other issues. There‚Äôs been a ton of artists who‚Äôve gotten away with awful behavior. That‚Äôs why I think to blacklist Kanye seems a little hypocritical. Separation from art to artists.
I have never seen the comments this unhinged on a Fantano video before. Y&#39;all need to get some help.
Thanks for stating the obvious melon
if this was called &quot;Vultures Store&quot; you would&#39;ve given this a 10
Bro this album is so good what are you talking about?
I&#39;m so hyped for him to review Quadecas album drop on the 16th
NEGROS CONTRA FANTANO
you made reviews on not one but two Burzum Albums and now you‚Äôre choosing to be this performative on a Kayne album because you can‚Äôt swallow your pride and say an antisemite made good music? Have to laugh :)
Woketano couldn‚Äôt handle it
At the end of the day, it&#39;s your opinion. But at the same time...<br><br>Trying to make other people&#39;s opinions on things invalid is not cool. Listing off &quot;The only people who like this&quot; and listing such broad things as &quot;teenagers&quot; (people in the 16 to 34-year-old range are the primary demographic for hip hop and rap) makes most other people&#39;s feelings seem invalid, and you look like the only guy who has a correct opinion.<br><br>Let&#39;s say there are two groups. One for pro-murder and one for anti-murder. If one of the pro-murder spokespeople says, &quot;I know that most anti-murder followers are probably either male or female,&quot; does that invalidate the opinions of the anti-murder movement? No. It just makes the pro-murder spokesperson look stupid. <br><br>And frankly, the lyrics from the clips you showed were not displayed in a way that glorified antisemitism.<br>King puts the words &quot;crazy&quot; and &quot;bipolar&quot; next to &quot;antisemite,&quot; which he&#39;s showing are all not suitable labels to have and not the type of person someone should aspire to be. He also shows that he is not these things (anymore, at least) by putting them in quotes.<br>Vultures and the other bar both attempt to disclose any idea of him being an antisemite. Why would it be antisemitic to say that he now has people who work for him who are Jewish? Why would it be antisemitic to be in a relationship with a Jewish woman? <br>Given, these may be harsh and off-putting ways to say these things, but it&#39;s Kanye. What did you expect?<br><br>Music-wise, It was an all-around good performance. The bass is a little too much for my taste, but besides that, saying the production of a Kanye album is trash, you better have some evidence to back it up. (The Hoodrat sample was terrible; I won&#39;t deny that)<br><br>Again, it is your review; you may say what you want. You made your points and narrative about this album as articulate as you typically do, and I applaud that you didn&#39;t go absolutely off the walls, bashing a project you clearly don&#39;t like. Thanks for creating a platform for honest opinions on music, but don&#39;t forget that invalidating other people&#39;s views in such a way prohibits that from happening.
Fantano literally said &quot;butt naked beautiful big di- women don&#39;t fall out of the bl bl bl!&quot;<br><br>Ultimate Freudian slip
You‚Äôre smokin some serious bias here on a fairly good album
Anothony i have watched you since you were a small channel. You personally gave me permission to impersonate you way back, over 10 years ago.<br><br>But dude you seem like you are in a bad place. Take a break. You seem absolutely miserable my guy.
Melon going after his own fanbase lowkey
This is why your wife left you
smh, you would have given it a 10 if it was called <i>To Pimp a Vultures 1</i>
I dont get the fuss tbh. Rappers have said and done far worse things and melon has had no problem reviewing them.
I never thought he was a great producer or mc. He was good. Not great. Over hyped.
Yeah. unsubscribed.
ur a ü§°
This album was good and you know it you just hate it because you hate Kanye
Fantano Washed
read the room not the audience
Wait you forgot the music part of the music review.
damn this is actually embarrassing fr he just hating on the album to stand out cmon just admit its fire
I thought this channel is all about the music
I gave the album a try and it sucks even despite all his antics lol
Are you a reviewer or not? ü§®
BACK TO ME  is a certified banger. you cannot argue that.
Thank you for 7 minutes of virtue signal
I knew something about this album was off. I got sad listening to it. It ruined my day.
if reddit was a person he would look like him
You hate Fantano because he hates Kanye<br><br>I hate Fantano because he puts politics before music in his music reviews<br><br>we are not the same
Sexy Redd got a Stong 8...never forget
I thought the album goodüòÅüëç
Of course you have to save face on this platform. i dont believe you actually hold these beliefs. That shit slapped. End of discussion.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=333">5:33</a>
That utopia sounding a lot better to those that wrote it off before
I thought this was a music review channel not a person review channel?
based
How your political bias shows over your music bias:<br>-Father John Misty Pure Comedy 9/10<br>-Kanye Vultures -?/10<br><br>When they‚Äôre pretty equal in quality of music, yet both get a little full of themselves politically.
anthony trying to rate music not based on the person level : impossible
Holy sh*t this review is absolute trash. Fantano is living in 2022 and it‚Äôs embarrassing, this is coming from a guy who‚Äôs been reading/watching Fantano‚Äôs reviews for almost a decade. I really do think the culture war broke this man and it‚Äôs sad to see. I hope he gets help for whatever he‚Äôs going through
Since words hurt you so much you probably shouldn‚Äôt review another rap album that has to do with slanging drugs, misogyny, and killing people cause those things have negative impacts on society and have taken many lives away from us
I liked the album a lot üëçüèº strong 7 to light 8 for me üëçüèº
I can&#39;t believe your video is controversial, 16k mfs who disliked the video hates jewish people
Thank you fantano for ending anti Semitism
this mf gotta be acoustic
Bro forgot that he suppose to review music not politics
bro shave your head before you talk about the king you unpresentable SLOB
unwatchable 1<br><br><br><br>This video in question has become excruciatingly unbearable to watch. Ever since Anthony&#39;s infamous review of MBDTF, his content has deteriorated to an unprecedented level of insufferability. This man, who seems to have a penchant for consuming his nasal excretions, delivers opinions so atrocious that they&#39;ve allegedly led to my grandmother taking a harrowing tumble down a staggering 13 flights of stairs. As a result, I&#39;m currently in the process of engaging legal representation to address this matter. Frankly, I never expected this particular review to be so utterly unwatchable. Yet, unfortunately, Anthony&#39;s content has consistently plummeted to abysmal depths over the course of the last five years.
It ain‚Äôt that deep, just give it a 1 and move on
While I don&#39;t disagree with the points being made, I am curious as to why the line is being drawn here at anti-Semitism? Obviously anti-Semitism is bad but many rappers preach murder and misogyny and ACTUALLY act on the words in real life by killing their opposition and abusing women. So why is the line drawn here? Surly everything commented about Kanye in the video applies to the multitude of rappers who&#39;s words penetrate through the music as well, sometimes even worse than Kanye. If art cannot be separated from the artist when its message coincides with how the artist acts and speaks in real life, why is Kanye getting special attention here?  How is this not hypocritical?
Another example of Anthony‚Äôs shit opinions üòÇ
ah shit here we go again
God, you are such a clown<br>Glad you&#39;re wife is doing better
I really wish you would have done a proper review. People are gonna hate regardless but surely it would show more integrity to do that.
yeah you gotta log off
this video has the energy of that idubbbz video that tanked his career lol
7 minute yap sesh
The things that Kanye has said and done are completely inexcusable and horrible. It‚Äôs obvious that he is HORRENDOUSLY mentally ill. It is still incredible what he has done for the music scene with his innovating and genre melding. I will never stand by the things that he has said because they‚Äôre hateful and wrong but there are still hints of his old self musically on this album that show how he was able to change the music landscape by being unafraid to take risks.
Musically it&#39;s a spotty album. Good start, better finish, dead middle.
Lil bro actually pressed üò≠üò≠
I&#39;m just here to get paid.
and this is why ive never subbed
Bro hating soo hardd
I love kayne but this ablum is bad not one song good
Bro is such a liberal
Bro can&#39;t even do his job üò≠
Don&#39;t be so delulu ant
stfu go listen to classical music
Real life soyjak
‚ÄúBooger eating white supremacist‚Äù <br>First mention of Nick on TND?
let the hair go bro
Kanye is not wrong when he says that Jews are money and power hungry. It‚Äôs not a fucking coincidence that Jews are prevalent in Hollywood, real estate, and billion/million dollar companies as well. He‚Äôs just pointing it out, that‚Äôs it, and it sucks that people get so butthurt about it. And Fantano, if you‚Äôre so above reviewing Kanye‚Ä¶then you shouldn‚Äôt have made this fucking video.
review it anyways bruh like come on give it a light 3 or something but just review the album
you let your fans ruin this for you tbh, not the music
The children who listen to three albums a year are going to be mad about this one
This comment section is full of people who are clearly part of the 3 demographics he mentioned in this video
Music is never unreviewable? You are just showing your complete bias and hate
He gotta be trolling right? This album was pretty good
Oh brother‚Ä¶
It‚Äôs not unreviewable, it‚Äôs a 6 to normal people and a 2 or 3 to you
Bro let the twitter comments get to him
In loco veritas - he‚Äôs likely seriously mentally ill but this horrible stuff is just a reflection of who he is deep down, so the illness doesn‚Äôt excuse the vile statements.
If this was called kids see vultures you would be salivating rn
seethe moar lmao
I wasn‚Äôt expecting this to be so existential
You‚Äôre supposed to be reviewing the album, not Kanye‚Äôs personality. Hence your opinion here doesn‚Äôt matter since you spent 80% of the video talking about the man. <br><br>Edit: you‚Äôre also clearly offended by what he said about your people.
Person I like drops good music and aligns with my views 10, person I like and makes bad music 8, person I dislike and makes good music 5 or unreviewable.
Fantano trying to separate the artist from their politics challenge (IMPOSSIBLE)
What a boring take - sealing the casket on Fantano for me. And i agree that Kanye‚Äôs output has been mostly poor for almost 10 years now
We need Cal. He would understand.
i dont like kanye but his music is too good not to listen to :3
fantano&#39;s fall off gotta be studied in the future
fantano: people shouldn&#39;t get mad over my reviews they&#39;re my opinion <br>people: i like some songs off the album<br>fantano: these songs are terrible your opinion is wrong
Now I understand why your wife left you xd
bro what about kids see vultures
Mans been through the wars with this one
hate numero 1 do homem kkk esse cagao anda comendo sua propia merda üòÇ
I only care if the music is good, but the music isnt good.
shave your head
The album definitely wasn&#39;t ye&#39;s best work, but saying it&#39;s unreviewable is disingenuous at best
Finally someone with some sort of platform not just pretending that nothing is happening! Like this stuff is actually infuriating! Shout-out to Pusha Tüéâ Kid Cudiüéâ and now Fantanoüéâüéâüéâ Also WTF Tyler, The Creator for giving Kanye his first work after the breakdown with production of the track Heaven To Meüò¢
Can you stop twisting his words about loving H**lr? He says he loves all men regardless of sin. We are all created in his image, we can only find peace when we stop hating and love one another. Please don&#39;t be a messenger of hate, be a man of love, and convince others to do the same. He gets us.
But you dont seem to have a problem reviewing the plethora of gang affiliated rappers who promote violence, drug addiction , and misogyny; whose music <b>also</b> has an impact on society‚Ä¶
So why even do this why even make this video? Why even talk about him? Why give him the time of day? Because you want views and money.
When has Kanye said anything normal?
Classic/10
This is the equivalent of telling your boss I don‚Äôt want do my job. We should unionize as subscribers
I get but that‚Äôs album was fire idc
damn that‚Äôs crazy I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm allowed to say carnival slaps without having to worry about giving people psychic boo boos. it sure would suck if I had to make money off having an opinion on the internet, then I‚Äôd have to make a video like this too. anyways I give vultures a strong 6.5 and am going to go listen to burn while driving around 10 mph over the speed limit, perhaps near vehicles with families in them. the nazis had cool clothes. please like and subscribe when I‚Äôm forced to post an apology video later
so can you review the album next video?
Fantano&#39;s moustache looks like the Pizza Hut logo
Melon left out the 4th and most chaotic yet likely option: that most of the outrage people have is performative and that the same people who are saying they‚Äôll never support Kanye are the same people streaming the first day. Thats how it‚Äôs gotten so high on music platforms. Thats how he made $19.3 million in one day all while selling all of his yzy brand items for $20. I‚Äôm not trying to justify what he said, in fact I disagree with all of his antisemitism comments and actions. But the only way he would doing as well as he is on sales and the only reason the album is as well liked as it has been, would be if the outrage that the majority of people have and show is performative. Besides Fantano, of course.<br><br>Edit/Update: HOW DID THIS ALBUM REACH #1 IN ISRAEL?! ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£üíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ
Dude thinks because he has Enter The WuTang in background he has say on HipHopüòÇ
just review the album lil bro its not that deep
Wtf is this guy on?
It‚Äôs funny
it‚Äôs so hard man. its just so hard sometimes.
Boohoo, mf. Ye is Kingüò™
This is 100% because of what was said about his ex wife on Twitter
Ur literally a music reviewer bro üò≠
The funniest delusion is that liberals think they are not bias at all. They are the most bias people I‚Äôve observed. Let the production be unpolished for a Kendrick track and he interprets it different. Like it was some strategy. But for people that don‚Äôt fit in his liberal agenda he will spin the narrative to something he completely doesn‚Äôt like. What a fucking nut
bro actin like that ain‚Äôt every single hardcore fandom üòÇ
He on weed
Why even post this - If you&#39;re not going to do a review then don&#39;t do one. No one is forcing you to. This wasn&#39;t even about the music.
Womp Womp
this is pretty lame.
these kinda takes is why your wife left you
Emotionally, politically and racially charged as always Fantano!!
Fantano i empathize with you truly, there‚Äôs so many Elon musk-ites in your audience and I really do respect you standing up for what‚Äôs right
Back to me fire
theres 3 good songs out of 16
I disagree but think the you can‚Äôt separate the art from the artist point is a good one. Being way too critical though, it was a fun listen. Also it‚Äôs hypocritical to say you wont review the album because of what Kanye has said, but then still make videos about him for your own gain.
Man I just wanna listen to the music, Kanye is a bad person but a great producer. When did music culture turn from loving music to idolizing those who make it and giving platform to their bad opinions.
Clown
dude is completly broken. you&#39;ve reviewed hundreds of albums with political lyrics and all of a sudden this one&#39;s &quot;UNREVIEWABLE GARBABGE&quot; get a grip dude
Completely on the nose. Thank you for this
Still not as bad as taylor swift ruining the super bowlüò≠üôè
fair but donda 2 is way way way worse
Everyone who likes the thing I don‚Äôt like is a nazi!!!!!! - Reddithony FATano
This album is a fun listen, fantano unfortunately is not.
this is such cringeworthy virtue signal crap. you were alt right 5 years ago. you made racist jokes 5 years ago. you used 4chan daily 5 years ago.
Seeing the degradation of Kanye is like losing a real friend it‚Äôs hard to witness but hey merch go hard tho
when‚Äôs the part where you get off the politics and review the music
Hahahaha bro is a haterrrrrr at heart. Be an adult and grow up bro. You‚Äôre pressed he‚Äôs back and trying to diminish it but all you‚Äôre doing is promoting it. Stick to reviewing the music. That‚Äôs all we care about not your personal opinions. No music is un reviewable.
You‚Äôre a clown
bro just hasn&#39;t got good taste
I loved the album and it&#39;s just  the first part!! üî•üî• I respect other people&#39;s opinion of it, but yours is just biased. So, if you didn&#39;t like it say You didn&#39;t like, but as a respectful review Chanel you cannot call it &#39;crap&#39;
Fantano over analyzing things once again. Being a &quot;reference&quot; means you&#39;re the person that started certain fashion trends. Also, I don&#39;t fit into any of those 3 Kanye fan catagories. I, a christian, do not like his antics outside of the studio, but he is a great musician. He is historically and statistically one of the greatest ever. Come on.
Bro no one cares. Hopefully all mainstream rappers come out as antisemite so you can stop putting out your trash reviews
Fanta I an idiot this is one of his best projects since tlop strip the artist from the music isn‚Äôt that what you always do clown
Watching YOU unravel is more entertaining than most things
Yooooo was that Aplasticplant?!?!
these niggas in the comments raw dog defending Kanye with their life üíÄüíÄ the video is good and has valid points but they&#39;re not gonna think critically
I just like the music, If you are a democratic or left wing it is your problem, the world don‚Äôt spin around the us problems
lmao he‚Äôs nearly crying
hahaha can we all finally see Fantano for the dorky little worm that he really is? Now, I&#39;ve been a die hard Ye fan since 12 years old, in the trenches for him when it wasn&#39;t cool to be....But for the past 5 years or so I&#39;ve found his recent releases to be incredibly stagnant and washed....There are salient arguments to make for why the music dissatisfies sonically, but the fact that this tumor runs right into political and social criticism should tell you everything.
I loved this album but yes kanye is unhinged lol
I thought this dude was a professional reviewer not a professional yapper
if it was called vulimadvillainy you wouldve given it like a 7
Thank you , saved me from listening to it.

There is a deep sadness, an undeniable tragic beauty and grandiosity to at least a handful of musical moments on virtually any Kanye West album. Their sometimes fleeting nature, and their increasing rarity makes them more special in a way. They rarely have anything to do with him as a rapper. But to act like the only reason to want to hear new Kanye West music is that you&#39;re somehow amoral or a nihilistic teenager is obtuse.
spittin facts
just scrolling thru the comments, did y‚Äôall actually watch the video?<br><br>let alone listen to what he said?
It&#39;s genuinely unbelievable that people expect Fantano to separate the art from the artist in this case. Kanye is in a financial and cultural position of normalizing actual fascism. Kanye has always been personal, that&#39;s literally his entire brand. Kanye has only ever been a &quot;character&quot; to those who are capable of living their own lives and feeling his songs as influential, as opposed to gospel. It&#39;s disgusting that there are generations of people who see him as a divine bullhorn as opposed to another artist speaking their mind. The difference is, he&#39;s vilifying the oppressed.<br><br>He is a worker of iniquity. I&#39;m not religious by any means, but that&#39;s the only way to describe Kanye&#39;s unhinged behavior. He is giving credence to political discrimination by the nature of his art.<br><br>I expect &quot;ratio&quot;s and &quot;ü§ì&quot; comments, but c&#39;mon. Forreal. You can&#39;t be that oblivious.
k cool but when will you talk about the new Ty Segall? üò∂
Took personal to a whole new level lmao
I think he meant reference as in reference track, like something really good to compare to
Thank you very much for not giving in the the kanye riders. Massive respect.
bro this youü§ì? go touch some grass
cringe baldy. album 10/10
good on you for treating this the way it would be treated. the only other reaction to this album after everything kanye&#39;s done lately would be just to not even acknowledge it at all
Kanye fans gettin mad in the comments looooool
I‚Äôm a nihilistic teenager then üòù (I‚Äôm 24)
He gave Peggy a 0 basicallyüò•
Cry harder
Yes fantano, the tens of millions of monthly listeners of Ye all fall under those three categories. You have pea brain under that bald head of yours pal
realest shit you&#39;ve ever spat
Your moustache is pretty ironic buddy
Why do people care about this guys opinions?
Fantano‚Äôs always gotta be different
Stop hating nerd
About as tone deaf as Hillary Clinton saying basket of deplorables üòÇ
Get me a CHICKEN SANDWICH and some WAFFLE FRIeesss
So youre feeling a -1 on this one?
&gt;titles video unreviewable <br>&gt;reviews album<br>Is he acoustic?
Kanye is receding more than Fantano&#39;s hairline
This trash video
I love it here<br>We gonna take over the year for another year<br>It&#39;s your bestie, Miss, Miss Westie<br>Don&#39;t tryna test me<br>It&#39;s gonna get messy<br>It&#39;s gonna get messy<br>Just, just bless me<br>Bless me<br>It&#39;s your bestie, Miss, Miss Westie<br>Just tryna bless me<br>Just bless me, bless me
Yeah this record is ass
Slightly more finished Donda 2 is a good assessment. A lot of it is trash for sure, some of the Ye hooks and verses are cringe af yes, but there&#39;s some insane bangers on here well worth the price of admission.
thanks for doing this video instead. this is one of the best videos you‚Äôve posted in my 6-7 years of watching. this is probably the best approach to kanye moving forward: simply not even giving him the time of day.
cant believe I witnessed the day the melon broke.
Can‚Äôt wait for unreviewable 2!
Fair
Worst album ever
I thought people were allowed to hate the Jews now because of Palestine???? I‚Äôm so confused i don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm supposed to support or condemn anymore. I don‚Äôt know if naked women fall out of the sky. I don‚Äôt know if this album is good or bad. I just don‚Äôt know. This comment has been brought to you by better help
whats the point in making this video and deliberately wasting everyone&#39;s time on something you could&#39;ve actually reviewed properly? or just not commented on at all since [I agree] its not a great album?<br><br>PS I did the Cal drawing in your Watching Movies With The Sound Off review, thanks for not crediting me or thanking me or telling me you&#39;d use it in a video whatsoever.
You washed
You triggered bro?
The Kanye stans mad as hell üò≠these mfs just as toxic as carti fans. And melon is right Kanye has been utter shit for awhile now cmon now compare this to graduation, college dropout, late registration, etc to these garbage albums. Give it a rest he‚Äôs not a god and he‚Äôs been off the best rappers list for awhile. It‚Äôs just crazy how yall let one opinion which has facts to it get yall crying in the comments
soy rant LUL
Fantano absolutely buck broken by Ye. Absolutely rent free. Melon&#39;s head is spinning. Meanwhile Ye living his best schizo bipolar life laughing at it all, fucking his big-tiddied beautiful butt-naked wife all over the globe while Anthony loses his mind and can&#39;t stop talking about the man despite how much he hates him. Let chaos reign
Bro didnt talk about the good songs like carnival, burn or problematic. Kinda weird ngl.
You do know your supposed to be a music reviewer right you don‚Äôt need to take a political stance with everything you do (not saying i agree with ye political views) just review the music and do your job
this the same guy to give sexxy red a 8
I really liked the review of this unreviewable album thank you melon ‚ò∫
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ el melon se rompi√≥
whole vid a cash grab
I&#39;m starting to feel like Fantano dislikes Kanye
Thank you for your opinion, as a teenager that is actively trying to not fall in the categories that you mention (Nihilist, hateful psychos or obsess people that ignore any type of reasoning) I found it really helpful and encouraging that guys like you step up and call out all the BS that this artist are doing. I found it necessary, that we establish a line and recover our sense of what we consider art or music, I believe your opinion is trying to achieve that, and give us a lens which will help us to wake up and think!!! I miss the old kanyeeee, and I will forever appreciate what he did in the first 10 years as a musician, but I must seek reason and see that the great storyteller, the guy that wanted to make a better world and specially make his mama proud, is gone.
F-you for rating Brock Hamptons last albums so bad, but you hit the nail on the head with this one.
I know you thought you looked sooo cool in that thumbnail lmao üòÇ
Ok but what do you give it?
Anthony...touch grass. There&#39;s no reason this should affect you that much.
Don‚Äôt get the idea of it being unreviewable‚Ä¶ if you don‚Äôt want to acknowledge it, comment on it, give him attention, etc that‚Äôs fair, but this video was still a review even if you didn‚Äôt give it a score. Why not just say it‚Äôs not good like other trash albums
And another thing, beautiful big titty butt naked women just don‚Äôt fall out the sky, ya know?
incorrect opinion
This comment section lmao. Y‚Äôall Kanye fans are quite something üòÇ
i just like the music he creates i dont really care about politics outside of it :D
Youtube&#39;s advertising guidelines really got to this guy
Crybaby
KANYE MAKES HISTORY ON THIS CHANNEL ONCE AGAIN
This is a bullshit. You made a bullshit. I‚Äôm not even gonna listen to this album and I know you made bullshit for a video.
Bro hating bcause kanye got a wife
Drake is touching himself to this rn.
You forgot he was black. He can‚Äôt be antisemitic, because he‚Äôs black.
üòÆ
a lot of yapping he did without getting to the point
Well I had fun listening to it
Chin up Fantano, Kanye is who he is but he loud and proud. It‚Äôs a slow motion car crash and you just gotta enjoy the ride man. Being neurodivergent is great and I love it
FUCK SUMN goes hard calm down Melon
Donda was better fr
The ironic part about this is that Fantano‚Äôs reason for not rating MBDTF very high was that he didn‚Äôt care about Kanye‚Äôs personal life one way or the other but now it‚Äôs completely flipped
nie placz lysy
I understand where you‚Äôre coming from but I think this would‚Äôve done better as a separate video on the second channel. You listing off these die hard Kanye fans that bait you on Twitter makes you sound terminally online.
Can u give a music review please
Particularly in the case of someone like Kanye West. His abrupt attraction to far right ideas shouldn&#39;t really be taken in the vein of a social scientist espousing theories about the world, however as a artist going through a crisis and latching onto some external set of ideas that make sense to their own specific psychological journey.<br><br>It&#39;s clear when listening to him talk that he doesn&#39;t really have a deep understanding of fascism or nazism and instead sees it as a violent rejection of the status quo and to say things that are so obviously outside of the overton window probably does the same thing for him as saying &quot;George Bush hates black people&quot; did for him in the early 2000s when statements such as that were seen as extremist.<br><br>It reminds me of how many punk artists of the 70s flirted with extremist ideas in anarchism without actually seeming to have a deep understanding of the ideology but instead seeing it as an emotional tool to express something about themselves.<br><br>I definitely don&#39;t think Kanye West is aware that he is doing this but having really tried to get a grasp of what&#39;s going on I think that this is the more sensible way to understand recent events.<br><br>To summarize, It was never about the Jews... It&#39;s always been about Kanye.
Back in 1994, OJ Simpson savagely murdered 2 people out of jealously and all the evidence pointed directly to him.   But even before the verdict where he got off, all his fans made a whole FREE OJ campaign because they loved him as a football fan.  That told you all you needed to know about some people in this world.    So yes, some Kanye fans would still support him if he killed people.
I totally get demonizing YE‚Äôs  harmful speech.. but I think fantano and most peoples art  these days is made with the responsibility of creating in mind‚Ä¶‚Ä¶I feel the people who feel the ppl who are trying to do the right thing by not supporting ye.. but I think there is a group of us who gets what YE‚Äôs trying to say  do and show.. the world or parts of it are trying to hold him accountable for saying things  in the wrong way.. and I think some ppl filter through the parts that are  a reach‚Ä¶ some hear the truths. In what hes trying to express in addition to the parts that we don‚Äôt believe.. <br><br>Just like it‚Äôs troubling to see ye speak in a way where the truth of his message will get <br>Lost .. it‚Äôs alll sad to see fantano intellectually approach art from a one sided perspective as if it doesn‚Äôt have anything good going on‚Ä¶ the album to me is him literally making the most commercial basic music in each genre that he‚Äôs attempting to target and I think the music will get deeper as each album comes out .. the songs that he has on the project are  true ye style versions of songs we already heard before and  I think his attempt as magnetizing various audiences who prolly don‚Äôt even see ye as a great artist ‚Ä¶I think it‚Äôs purposely dumbed down subject matter wise .. just like the stage design .. when he said he loves all people (specifically one who I won‚Äôt name) I think he was saying it  in a Christian type he without sin should cast the first stone type of way‚Ä¶ but that aside Tim will tell‚Ä¶  I‚Äôm just wondering for those of us who have different opinions from the most prevalent in our times have a chance at creating or surviving in this society because if you don‚Äôt think what  most ppl think is okay these days it‚Äôs almost like a threat to your lively hood‚Ä¶
Came back to give this a thumbs up.<br>.<br>Where did those 15K dislikes come from?<br>.<br>&quot;Y&#39;all know this is just my opinion, right?&quot;.<br>.<br>.
Fair, thank you
As a Kanye fan, I think I can speak for some of us when saying that while I don‚Äôt agree with the stuff he says, it‚Äôs never gonna change how I listen to him. Majority of big musicians are pieces of shit in real life, this is nothing new. Him saying he agrees with Hitler doesn‚Äôt change how I listen to Ultralight Beam, or Flashing Lights.
clown
5 mins of Kanye rant is crazy
I would like to propose a fourth type of Kanye fan: someone who just likes to listen to good music. You don&#39;t need to be  verbally bullied by some bald man online to listen to audio that makes your brain release happy chemicals. Simple as that. To those who repeat fantano&#39;s rhetoric and say &quot;oh, you can&#39;t really separate the music from kanye since his beliefs are so deep into his music,&quot; you are spouting complete and utter bullshit. There is not a single bar from the album where kanye says the word &quot;jew&quot; or &quot;jewish.&quot; Just remember, you don&#39;t know fantano, and fantano doesn&#39;t know you. So don&#39;t take what he says that seriously.
trash album but did anyone expect anything else given Kanye over the past year?  I&#39;m disappointed but not surprised.
7 minutes of hating from a Jew boy‚Ä¶ wow
I listen because the history and he does have talent, he‚Äôs entertaining, and I don‚Äôt take him seriously anyway. He clearly has mental issues. Also I don‚Äôt think he has hate for Jews. He‚Äôs pointing out general stereotypes which he finds to be true bcuz of his experiences which is understandable, but he doesn‚Äôt hate all jus cuz of that. Btw there was a couple good songs
Yedolf fans mad
listened to this thing, and man is it dookie. <br><br>Predictable, forgettable, cheesy ass lyrics man... was he drunk when he wrote this shit?
you can tell his wifes boyfriend took away his switch
This is the most washed music reviewer. Worst take of all time, doing this just for click bait
Still the King, still the‚Äî
DO IT, BURN, and CARNIVAL were like 6/10 songs for me but the rest were fucking awful
Leave Kanye alone!
Kanye has Jewish staff and this guy is still calling him Antisemitic smh.
This is the most washed music reviewer. Worst take of all time, doing this just for click bait
While you have the right to choose whether to review an album or not, it seems you had decided against reviewing this one well before its release. <br>If opting for a pseudo moral grandstand review, it might be more constructive to refrain from selectively highlighting the worst aspects and showcasing biased verses. Instead, objectively discuss why you find the album &quot;unreviewable garbage&quot; without categorizing the audience into three arbitrary groups. It would strengthen your argument to acknowledge both shortcomings and highlights, such as Carnival followed by Beg Forgiveness, rather than presenting a one-sided perspective.<br><br>(as I have said before, I understand why you might not want to promote an artists rhetoric that you disapprove of. But I do not believe this video is successfully justifying your point.)
YouTube need to bring back the dislikes so we can see how badly fantano got ratio‚Äôd for this mess of a video
COPIUM
Garbage ass political bullshit review
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=153">2:33</a> How about 4. Just people who don‚Äôt agree with what he said and don‚Äôt look to far into the music? Like I won‚Äôt die for him and do not agree or like what he said but carnival goes crazy
Damn, guess I‚Äôm a cultish weirdo üòÖ great project, 9/10
The MUSIC of the album is actually pretty good. I don&#39;t care what he raps about, I can&#39;t understand much of it anyway, I only listen to music for the MUSIC, regardless of who made it. So yeah, trashy attitude from you, not that I expected any different. You and Pitchfork are one and the same now as the deniers of MUSIC.

15k meatriders
Review based off the art, not personal bias
L
Wahhh wahh he doesn‚Äôt agree with my politics wahhhh
Fantano please stop engaging with Kanye fans
You‚Äôre a dork lol
I can&#39;t take Kanye seriously anymore
Didn&#39;t even talk about the music for many minutes in-this is not a music review this a rant
bro judges music by the artists political views üíÄ
This guy&#39;s whole channel is just‚òùüèªü§ì
Bros boyfriend is definitely jewish üò≠
Then just don&#39;t review it, this comes off as just a tantrum.
the album was good and bro cant make a review
KANYE GOAT
fantano, i hope your doing ok, i dont agree with your review but I hope you are doing ok nonetheless.
A little disappointed by your perspective. It‚Äôs incredibly important to separate art and the artist.
the best statement about this entire situation is that you can‚Äôt separate the art from the artist . if the artists statements are in the music . as soon as he said some tehe how am I antisemetic shit into the mix it ruins the listening experience . and when you have Chris brown and even carti on the record you have to throw some things in aswell . <br><br>- George Wrth .
So brave if Anthony to make this video sharing how unreasonably rent has skyrocket lately. Truly a man of the people
If the album was called ‚Äúto pimp a kids see vultures‚Äù he‚Äôd give it a 10
Shut up baldy
Two months in, TWO MONTHS, and I already have a bad feeling for this year.
Is this an album review or an antisemetic review?
As a ye fan majority of the tracks are bad. And for the good ones are mid at best. Instead of releasing 3 albums of mid he shoulda just the good ones into 1 album and have an amazing album.  Disappointed that everybody. New body, the leaked song with kodak amd bad bunny arnt on the album.  <br>Side note; i swesr to fucking god if city in the sky (old yhandi track) doesn&#39;t make it ima start throwing hands
this is too woke, just wanted a proper interview smh
As someone with bipolar disorder, I‚Äôm both sad about the situation Kanye is in because there were so many things to prevent it, but also happy I‚Äôm managing my disorder well enough to not end up like Kanye. Kind of a weird feeling
Real life hater üòÇüòÇ
This video represents the death of<br>subjectivity for me, im out
bro is seething
As someone who isn&#39;t a big fantano fan, this his best take yet.
More then 3 types of fans bud
using kanye for clicks is crazy, just don‚Äôt address it if you genuinely care so much üò≠üò≠
L
alah ngomong taek raimu
Remember when you seriously reviewed convicted murderer and infamous neo-nazi Burzum but now you sold out so Kanye West (lmfao) is too beyond the pale?
The guy known for reviews making a video about not reviewing
This crazy but was bitching when Kai didn‚Äôt like lol nas song straight bias asf for no reason like we really this sensitive now
Carnival clearly was not enough to save bro üíÄ
Anthony! 1999 Write the Future! Ghostface, Del3030, Budos, Smino, Souls, De La, etc etc
This is the same person who had openly given positive reviews to 21 savage a convicted criminal who raps about commuting disgusting crime
thats why your wife left u.
Least clueless melon rap review
Fantano the type of dude to study liberal arts in collage and call it a ‚Äúreal‚Äù degree.
Quit tryna be different
Fantano is right.
I feel like I&#39;m in a toxic relationship with Kanye. I keep waiting for him to change and go back to what he was like &quot;before&quot; but he just keeps getting worse. Nothing can justify what he&#39;s been doing. I just wanted to hear good music from the guy who made College Dropout...
Bro just hates music
Bro just wasted 7 minutes of my life
just say you like the album
why his bald ass can¬¥t talk about music and leave politics alone, he reminds me of that one ps5 review that everyone made fun of.
Fantano you fell off a long time ago,i dont know anybody watching your content anymore besides liberal college students, you do not separate that art from the artist,you know damn well your hating because of kanyes comments from the past 2 years, you also do not like his republican views, you tried becoming a liberal twitch streamer like hasan and fell off completely. Buddy had to take advantage of all the Kanye buzz going around so he could run up some views off a shitty biased opinion.
this is really refreshing after the worst people have crawled out of the sewer for kanye. Thank you fantano
coward
Gay
Mr fantano you forgot to add the zero right after the one, should edit that asap!( im definitely insane)
I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôll see this comment ,Fantano, but I suggest you go on vacation. There‚Äôs no point in wrapping yourself in the chaos of human behavior. The world will be what it is‚Ä¶.imperfect. Go put some positivity in your life. When you get back you‚Äôll realize acknowledging people or persons who are objects of negativity is pointless.
u a clown for that fantano, how u goin review politics instead of music?
Dude the album is not that good but you are the most insuferable guy on the internet, stop talking about him it serves no purpose, it&#39;s not about reviewing music anymore, you are just giving the antisemetic attention, focus your energy on something else something actually important, maybe people who are actually doing evil things in this world, but this weird obsession with Kanye West is looking like a desperate attempt to gain attention, i mean You are free to criticize him, he is an asshole in many ways but i believe we got it the firsts few dozen of times lol
Full tilt fantano here <br>Internets busiest basket case
Fantano: FINALLY, AN ALBUM A BILLION TIME WORSE THAN SPEEDING&#39; BULLET 2 HEAVEN
He&#39;s hilariously disingenuous while cloaking it in a veneer of civility and rationality. He called Bianca a dollar store kim on twitter but says Kanye is dehumanising her in his purposeful misinterpretation of the reference bar.
Knew melon would come out hating
Vultures was decent to me ‚Ä¶ and I fucks wit HOODRAT lol
this is def a moral check for ye listeners
People are dumb
Kanye bad because he&#39;s antisemitic but albums about murdering other gang members from artists accused of domestic violence are actually completely fine
If &quot; Selective hearing&quot; was a person:
Only a bad reviewer would make this video
Weird video bro
Aight but it also went #1 in Israel‚Ä¶.
This was some real Foggot shiz melon. I know you‚Äôre all for woke culture but give me a damn break üòÖ
Theres a very important 4th type of fan you neglected to mention, one which may be the most crucial to his continuing success: the apathetics. The fan who either doesnt know, or simply doesn&#39;t care about any of this. Who brushes off all politics or social frictions (those that rub them the wrong way) as icky and then just carry on. These are the types to get very self-righteous in the few areas that concern them, but the most parts, they just kind of revel in ignorance, willful or otherwise. Thats the crucial 60% I think. Most people are too lazy to be otherwise.
lmao its just pretty good lol
As a fan of Kanye‚Äôs music, this is the most sad and unfinished album.
I think Anthony is genuinely wrong about Kanye, and he keeps pushing the thought that other people are blinded by fanatism when I think he‚Äôs the one who actually suffers from it.<br><br>As someone who doesn‚Äôt care about Kanye‚Äôs music or his character, and as someone who actually listened to his rants, Kanye is not antisimetic, he is literally just dumb as fuck. In summary, Kanye‚Äôs message was ‚ÄúI love everyone, even the devil aka Hitler‚Äù, obviously the media presented it as ‚ÄúI love Hitler‚Äù . Then the idiot Kanye then tried to prove his point further by sharing a screen w other hated people online, etc, etc.<br><br>Kanye‚Äôs message has been purposely manipulated and misunderstood by the media and other losers who actually believe  in those type of messages, and Kanye is an idiot for letting that happen after all these years of experience with his mental health and the entertainment industry. <br><br>That being said, Anthony‚Äôs presence online isnt just YouTube, everyone knows how close to his heart he keeps his political believes and ideology, of course this whole Kanye thing rubs him the wrong way. Regardless of what he believes to be right or wrong, it‚Äôs obvious his ideology made him blind as fuck cause the lyrics he showed to prove Kanye‚Äôs an actual Nazi or whatever were plain old Kanye bars, whitest whites, vanilla 1.0 Kanye bars. Equivalent to ‚Äúchoke a south park writer with a fish stick‚Äù. It‚Äôs Kanye‚Äôs comments on society‚Äôs point of view of him. It‚Äôs him being satirical of society‚Äôs expectations of Kanye West. It‚Äôs him teasing the audience, and being unapologetic about it. Again, fuck Kanye west for all I care who srsly cares, it‚Äôs just so obvious that Anthony‚Äôs ideas have made him just as biased as the people he apparently really dislikes and feels comfortable critiquing. Anyways fuck Kanye fuck Anthony‚Äôs fuck this comment and fuck me I just couldnt shut up when this shits so obvious
I appreciate this position Anthony. Feels refreshing to have someone tweeting about Israel‚Äôs massacre of Palestinians while at the same time standing up for Jews in other contexts. It‚Äôs nice to hear given people are ignoring true examples of antisemitism during this war.
I thought the reference line was a compliment????
His wife left him bro
This is like the donda 2 score
Bro pick n choose and follow lib narratives to in his reviews lol‚Ä¶ he still reviews freaks like jpegmafia who have sexual assault allegations but gets mad over Kanye speaking fax most of the time
Bro pick n choose and follow lib narratives to in his reviews lol‚Ä¶ he still reviews freaks like jpegmafia who have sexual assault allegations but gets mad over Kanye speaking fax most of the time
40 year old egghead salty because Kanye fans troll him on Twitter lmao
ok but carnival is good asf
Really a 10? I didn‚Äôt think you would like it that much but glad you did!
Two different sides of mob mentality.
The albums pretty sick. Don&#39;t know how this is a review
Sound about white of u fantano
sorry couldn&#39;t hear you over Vultures 1
Never forget this guy gave kids see ghosts a 10 when Ye was saying slavery was a choice, now Ye says something about white people and now he‚Äôs a monster.. this dude is an absolute clown
You‚Äôre a nerd stay out of black folk business
Damn‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ you really got this one wrong.
After saying sexy redd album in top 50 over utopia you&#39;ve become irrelevant now tbh üòÇüòÇ
kanye defeated melon
calling her a reference is a fashion term lol. It means people will copy her style and use it as a reference to theirs
7 minutes of nothing. Fantano stay in your lane man people come for music reviews not political discussions.
why didn‚Äôt you talk about the music fantano?
it&#39;d be wild if more widespread media literacy was still a thing
Idk this video feels very self righteous and pretty hypocritical. You seem so concerned with what nerds are saying online. I know this is an overused line, but genuinely you need to go touch some grass.
I get it. As someone whose &quot;goat&quot; used to be Kanye (up to LoP) his new fanbase and constant episodes of whatever is wrong with him have made it hard to enjoy his music. Plus the quality overall has dropped.<br><br>This is why a lot of his new fans are literally kids. They think it&#39;s cool to be a narcissistic douchebag and love that he says whayever stupid shit comes to his head and makes enemies of everyone. Hes a &quot;villain&quot; and kids eat that shit up
Melon turned into a Karen
This review made me like the album even more üíÄüòÇ
if this was called vultures see vultures it would be an 11
I will RKD for NJF
But bro reviewed Travis after the concert controversy
Unsubscribe
Bro didn&#39;t mention a thing about Ty lmao
He gives you content. Stop covering him if you feel this way.
Fantano will review a carti b album who literally drugged people and robbed them but this is too far
Fantanos just mad he got divorced
i‚Äôm sorry about the hate your gonna get for this. it‚Äôs a very level headed take, it‚Äôs the situation that‚Äôs ridiculous. the people who agree are much less likely to leave a comment than the people you mentioned as kanye fans. you‚Äôve been doing this a long time you know that everybody leaving hate is being absurd. you would‚Äôve gotten hate if you didn‚Äôt talk about it too. good luck melon
A reason to listen to this album is because Kanye curates the best balance of innovative and accessible production. He brings Jpegmafia and 88keys in the same room and brings them together tastefully. Stars and Back to Me are the best rap beats we have heard in the mainstream since his last album. The moment where the drum break comes in on Fuk Sumn is sexy.<br><br>The lyrics are terrible, the mixing is atrocious, and Ty Dolla CARRIES lyrically, but Kanye will never fall off when it comes to the BEATS.
jealous he has a wife?
Kanye&#39;s trash and so are his fans
if it was called the money vultures bro would‚Äôve given it a 10
Bald man big mad.
You know the album is good, how fucking embarrassing of you to be this salty and upload it without realising how you sound so totally not self aware. Christ
Jpegmafia really broke his heart üíÄüíÄ
Get outta here bruh
Kanye broke him
So does Peggy working with him on MULTIPLE of these songs make you think less of his albums that you have loved so much in the past, or any other of the people who have aided Kanye in this albums making, you better not review any album from anybody involved in this album and stick to your guns
Ye broke Fantano. Praise da Lord
If this was called Kids See Vultures hed give it a 10
The nihilistic teenagers sounding off in the comments rn
rent is due anthony
BeautifulBigTittyButtNakedWomen Just Dont Fall Out the Sky you know!!
also the songs on the album are all pretty good. so maybe thats why people like it bruh üíÄ
I&#39;m #1 in the list of the types of kanye fans
ü§°ü§°
Just went over to AOTY and he just scored it a 0 üòÇ
Fundamental lack of understanding and dismissal of bipolar disorder
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=258">4:18</a> none of these lyrics are anti-SemiticüòÇ id rather he bring it up in a jokey way than just ignore it, at least he&#39;s addressing it
This is not it.
bien guebon
grow up
If someone wants to hate then fuckin let em, long as they ain‚Äôt breaking the law
JIK over Vultures? Your buggin bro this is hate. That‚Äôs just not objectively true whether u taking mix song quality song mixing amount of content etc etc.
like his music, hate his currently personality<br>the album was pretty bad for the most part although burn was really good imo...
Wow Anthony I‚Äôm proud of you only one complaint about the mixing ü§©
This is so depressing, man
I haven&#39;t heard the album, but Melon seems very upset üòÇ
Bro just review the music forget about the controversial moments
Not sure what qualifies you to give expert takes about OUR music. You‚Äôre just another culture vulture trying to capitalize off of Kanye‚Äôs nameü§°
I wanted it to suck way more than it actually did, but i cant deny liking a few of the songs on this one, though theres for sure Kanye&#39;s worst songs to date on this one<br><br><br>Fuck Sumn, Carnival and Vultures were basically the only good songs
Kanye fans are absolutely seething in these comments. Based Melon.
Imagine being such a soft bitchmade beta that you let politics sway your opinion of music I cant
This is insane because I am 100% positive if ye never said anything about Jewish people you would‚Äôve given this a positive review‚Ä¶ ppl have spoken the album is getting almost unanimous praise most well recieved ye album by the masses in a long ass time
Fantano loves Kanye so much he went out of his way to make a video about how speechless he is for this new album.
So you hate that you liked it?
Wow, we are getting a full on leftist take.
I fail to understand how an artist saying a naughty meanie mean thing to someone makes a difference. Is the music good? Does it make ears happy? Sounds=good? Words=eh? Maybe stick to the music
this is the male equivalent of a female saying &quot;im speechless&quot; and then proceeding to speak
L u skipped cartis verse??  what a dumbass. <br>top 2 songs in the WORLD rn is Carnival &amp; Fuk Sum.
Bad vid unsubbed plus ur weird and suck at interviewing
This is honestly commendable, I appreciate you not platforming Kanye with the amount of sway you can give people with your reviews and maybe people can actually take something out of this un-review and begin taking Kanye off of the pedestal he‚Äôs undeservingly been placed on currently
ye hasnt stopped falling off since 2019
Unreviewable album<br><br>Reviewable people
Bro is now officially crazier than kanye himself
im against kanye but instead of making a complete rant; fantano shouldve never put out a video/ review/rant and just make a small explanation on twitter for his reasoning. At the end of the day this video is still platforming kanye and helps no one.
this is supposed to be a video about VULTURES 1 and ¬•$, how Bianca is relevant in the review? Talk about the music, not about her, weirdo
burn and problematic were good, everything else was trash
this is super gay
Why‚Äôd you zoom in on the album cover so I can‚Äôt see ty dollas juicy dumper
The same liberals crying about how Kanye is being antisemitic are the ones that want Hamas to wipe the Jews off the face of the earth. Kinda ironic huh? Ye is mentally ill, what do you aspect from him?
i hate watching a grown ass man cry about music
.5/10
So a few bad words about a group of people and some bad lyrics is the final straw for you to not rate it, but y‚Äôall will regularly post music where artists talk about killing people, doing drugs excessively, and violent crimes?<br><br>Sounds like virtue signaling.
I never listen to guys like this opinion on hip-hop music. He&#39;s a guest. He&#39;s a on looker. Hes views the culture like a zoo. And if you can&#39;t rap or make a decent song, your opinion is invalid.
You would give God himself a light 4
I also believe in &quot;separate the art from the artist.&quot; Sure, Kanye&#39;s recent music has been lackluster, but his older music still hits just the same, especially for new fans. Personally, I&#39;m looking past his recent Ls and focusing on the classics he made back in the day.<br><br>And yes, I agree that Vultures is a shit album. I didn&#39;t add any of those songs to my playlist because they suck both in political correctness and quality/effort, but I do still have plenty of good Kanye songs on my rotation.
I&#39;m one of those &#39;&#39;I only care about the music&#39;&#39; kind of guys. And yeah, as someone whose first language isn&#39;t english, I can totally listen to music without a single care about the lyrics. I feel like I start hearing the lyrics after the 50th play and I do not care about them most of the time. I wouldn&#39;t be able to listen to PC Music and cheesy trance if I cared about the lyrics.<br><br>Although if the lyrics are in my native language, I can&#39;t ignore them and, for that reason, I can&#39;t really listen to french music because the lyrics suck 90% of the time. Any other language is fine though.
Lmao holy shit calm down why is bro so angry üò≠ taking it personal is insane
Hating one person this much just to push an agenda is crazy
I wish I had subscribed to your channel before you were such a righteous old fart so that I could unsubscribe. No one is looking to you for moral advice brother.
The people who are saying Kanye broke melon are the people Anthony is talking about
On top of everything else, the music is ass and uninspired. It‚Äôs harder and harder to separate art from artist. The shock value has overtaken everything else. The last good Kanye album, in my opinion, was Kids See Ghost. From there, it‚Äôs been all Jesus, Trump, Hitler, Kanye worship lmao while the music takes a backseat. All Kanye references in his music anymore is his controversies. And he doesn‚Äôt even do it well. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è<br><br>I still listen to old Kanye and can still get down with it. But unfortunately his recent stuff just doesn‚Äôt do it for me. He has turned me away. ‚ÄúI miss the old Kanye‚Äù
brother scared for his sponsors so he j didnt review itüòÇ
my reaction is better than this lol
Thank you.
Bruh stfu review  the music
You shouldn‚Äôt listen to hip hop bro
wowoow
poor mellon, all busted up. when you learn about the Elohim and have a few years to digest you&#39;ll feel better.
Thanks for the completely unbiased review ! I&#39;ll be sure to stop liking or disliking this album, and instead consume the body of work with no opinions or thoughts
Ye? More like nay
Really quick, how do you feel about what‚Äôs happening in Palestine?
yeah bro i used to actually be a big fan of this guy, what a fucking joke he has become
Where‚Äôs your wife Fantano
But Fantano he said it was a jokey jokeü•∫
If people are so enchanted by the CARNIVAL beat drop just listen to Raydar by JID, an actually good song that does it better.
at least it‚Äôs just an opinion guys üòÆ‚Äçüí®
Don‚Äôt worry guys I‚Äôll review it for him<br><br><br>Hello guys SpongeBob SquarePants here to do a review of this new Ye and Ty dolla $ifg album ‚Äúvultures‚Äù this album seemingly dropped out of nowhere and surprised many as nobody expected it so suddenly. Ye several listening or rave parties promoting the album and at first glance I was really excited to listen to the album. Ye dropped vultures some random ass day I forgot but when u first heard it, it was very different from anything I‚Äôve ever heard from Ye. Bump J brings in a good verse but I kinda wish he didn‚Äôt mumble his way throughout it. Lil durk by far had the best verse in the whole song and Ye kinda uh . Ty dolla $ign outro with quavo was very pleasing to listen to.<br><br>A long time past and we started hearing many snippets of some songs. Of course with Ye an album could be delayed many times and that was the case with Vultures.<br>Anyhoodles Kanye dropped on a Sunday at 3 am and here is my actual review of the album<br><br>ACTUAL REVIEW <br><br>The intro is very pleasing to listen to <br>with this sample of what seems to be a kids choir . I have mixed feelings for the song keys to my life starts very boring but India love kills it at the end of the track. The song paid has a very catchy chorus with Ty $ and has an ok ye verse. Talking is a very good track and the 2nd half is very heavenly. <br><br>Back to me is my personal favorite track with a k*ller chorus from Ty $ and a good verse from ye. But Freddie Gibbs stole the show with his fantastic verse and the best feature on the whole project. HOODRAT HOODRAT HOODRAT<br><br>Do it has such a catchy chorus and YG impressed me a lot . Paper work one of the more weaker tracks but it‚Äôs still a good track.<br><br>Burn is such a club song and it‚Äôs so catchy but I think Ye should‚Äôve let Ty have the whole track<br><br>F*k  sumn is the worst track on vultures very catchy chorus but Alvin ruined the whole song for me and they removed Quavos original verse<br><br>Carnival is a great track but far from the best the mixing is off as u can barely hear playboi carti and rich the kid had a very good verse <br><br>Beg forgiveness is one of the best songs on this album with Chris Brown absolutely stealing the show with his part and Ty $ had a very passionate part <br><br>Good don‚Äôt die was very bloated but it‚Äôs still a good song<br><br>Problematic had one of the best beats and the best Ye verse on it <br><br>King is a very good way to end the album as Kanye is signifying that he doesn‚Äôt care what u call him cuz he‚Äôs still THE KING<br><br><b>**RATING*</b><br><br>Overall I really liked this project a lot of songs got left out but it‚Äôs still a really really good project <br><br>I‚Äôm feeling a strong 8 to a light 9 on this project üòä
thats a whole lot of video for not reviewing it ü§°
W mans
Who else just came to unlike
Remember when Kanye was good? Good times
No way this christian hater is this mad about antisemitism
This salt this guy has for ye is unmatched. He hates but so far it seems like a lot of people actually like it. He‚Äôs a little out of touch
why make a review on your review channel, call it unreviewable, and still review it in the video. i mean, if your gonna point out the bad things about the album, might as well just make a full review. jus saying<br><br>Edit: also him saying that every kanye fan is either dumb or a nazi is not any better than your fans thinking your a Jew for not liking Kanye.
you claim to be a music reviewer yet in the first 2 minutes you talk about kanye political views and what he said <br>my point is you will never find a food reviewer that cares abut the chefs political views in the video you constantly paused not to say something about the song just to say what bad person kanye is quot ‚Äò‚Äô he harassed his ex wife ‚Äò‚Äô wtf dose this have to do with the album the same rappers you love and suck dck like jpg mafia or freddie love kanye‚Äôs work and work with him so and obviously the fans love it your music taste is limited and your clearly don‚Äôt see the approche kanye is taking your opinion ist dead not relevant i always loved your reviews because there were thoughtful but now im sorry for you hard to stay relevant isn‚Äôt it
I didn‚Äôt even know kanye released an album ngl
Kanye made him get eye bags. Incredible
This is a good album it has a bunch of hits minimal controversy n on time like wtf do u want bro
I‚Äôm a fan of his music but obviously I don‚Äôt like the things he says. Yeah he talked about jewish people, but when he called himself an antisemite I didn‚Äôt like that and it kinda ruined that track for me. Tbh not sure what keep a few jews on staff mean. I‚Äôm guessing since he went crazy he said he needs to keep jews on staff for people to think he‚Äôs not antisemitic. Same with the jewish bitch line. I didn‚Äôt find those lines to be clearly hating on jewish people, but rather making jokes about the situation he got himself in- which is fair to be completely against. And it‚Äôs not in great taste. Other than that I liked the songs and had fun with them and I like his older music as well. And I think it‚Äôs crazy how anthony fantano pretty much just says: you guys are wrong if you like it and you‚Äôre just a crazy antisemitic fan who doesn‚Äôt care about the music. Anthony even said that if he gives it a good review, bad people will just take that and be antisemitic or something. It shows he‚Äôs not really reviewing it for the music and mostly reviewing it like this to go against crazy fans. Also I liked paid and I like fade. I think both are good dance songs. Saying one is a worse version of the other isn‚Äôt fair to me because they have different sounds. I would dance differently based on which song is playing, but I like both for the same reasons. No one has to like the album lol but I just disagree with his opinions
why are you so angry
Lmao if this was dropped by some underground dude you would be head over heels
Tbh I love Kanye‚Äôs music but some of his newer albums are not living up to the standards of graduation, dropout and late registration.
Can&#39;t wait for unreviewable 2
this used to be a music critic
I usually agree with a good amount of your reviews. This album is fire. I think you may be smoking crack.
So that mean it&#39;s NOT GOOD?
New title melon hates on Kanye for views
Libthony Soytano
When you don‚Äôt want to give a platform to someone you find so abhorrent but the rent is due lol
Listen man I like your sh!t but cut the edgy sh!t just review the music man. Like the blue hair lesbians don&#39;t want you bro
Ye the goat this shit means nothing he number one in the world
people really just saying the album good because carnival goes hard
There should be a 4th type of fan of kanye<br>The ones who like his music but don‚Äôt agree with his opinions because we‚Äôre functioning adults with morals but are mature enough to enjoy music for what it is. <br>I hate what kanye has done to his image in 2 years time but I like what he is as a musician and he still is making large stadium worthy music
sounds like you didn&#39;t really review the album, just his behavior
jeez the lyrics at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=256">4:16</a> are vile, deeply uncomfortable. good take melon, this is unreviewable
So cringe
New low for You bro, you are trying so hard to hate on this, just chill enjoy life enjoy music, its not that serious
kanye&#39;s addicted to headlines. only enjoying his music is almost impossible at this point because we are so aware that the next headline worthy bar can&#39;t be far away. it sucks that he can&#39;t just shut up and create music, but always has to get the media and politics involved. like bro, be the producer you&#39;ve started out as.
Okay‚Ä¶ carseatheadrest Stan
I‚Äôm the biggest Kanye fan and this downfall has been seriously devastating. The album is definitely his worst.
Womp womppppp
Imagine reviewing a piece of art based on the artists opinions
That‚Äôs a cool opinion fantano. You‚Äôre so different! No one cares.
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
But if King Von dropped an album...
The people that are saying this album is remotely good or holds a torch to any other Kanye project are brainwashed idiots. Kanye is finished, this man should have no platform.
used to like this guys videos.. now all his videos are honestly pathetic and so unhinged &quot;coincidentally&quot; after his divorce supposedly happen.. its honestly embarrassing lmaoo. Find God
My thing is‚Ä¶why make a video at all? If you‚Äôre vehemently against everything he stands for and genuinely didn‚Äôt have a reason to review, why create content based on this artist. A tweet would have sufficed, even a YT short. I appreciate and respect the opinion, I am just genuinely curious for the reason
major eye rolls here
How did you let this review get subjective lol
NO<br>NO<br>ABSOLUTELY NOT EN OH
fantano so üê∂üíî
i think you do bring a lot of good points about kanye&#39;s intent and actions, and that having a good faith conversation with most people in that sphere is pretty much off the table. BUT i think that kanye kinda at this point wants that, and probably loves being a &quot;fuck what you think, im a villain&quot; type character in his own head now especially since he shat the bed. personally i still appreciate his music to some capacity but to say that some of his messages about faith and peace have dwindled would be an understatement. the things he says are abhorrent as of late but that attitude has always really been there.
Silly silly take
Unreviewable but reviews it anyway‚Ä¶ ye wins lol
It literally is reviewable though.
The album is like a 7/10, this is such a lame way to avoid reviewing something, it&#39;s like a movie review channel refusing to review The Pianist because Roman Polanski is a piece of shit. Kanye is a horrible person but this is so lazy and cringe.
If this was called rainbow bridge vultures it wouldve been a strong 8 to a light 9
Well, on the plus side atleast my albums won&#39;t get hated this badly lol
3 on birds on the trap, 6 on MBDTF, and now this, if you still listen to this man‚Äôs eh opinions, you need to start making some of you own and grow up.
It‚Äôs ass, the Kanye meat riders keep getting younger and more brain dead.
there&#39;s fourth group of kanye fans: i love his production xD
Make this a JPEGMAFIA album, with context and all, and somehow it may just be a masterpiece
How‚Äôs your wife?
All I wanna say lil homeboy art is art you can separate the art from the artist u don&#39;t like it it&#39;s cool and fine and even cretesising it but u can&#39;t call people names and think oh they these people are crazy cus they listen to him and relax
Bro read one thing on the internet about Kanye and based his whole opinion on the guy
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=305">5:05</a> the review
‚ÄúThe Jews in my fan base‚Äù alright man your no better lmao
Yes let‚Äôs all listen to the guy who rates music on a number scale
If It was called Hood&#39;s Hottest Vulture you&#39;d give it an 8
Personally I don‚Äôt agree with what Kanye says but I also do agree that you should seperate the art from the artist. Sometimes I just want to listen to good music and don‚Äôt really care about that person‚Äôs political views. But Vultures is pretty trash regardless.
Just review the music buddy
ok old head
Fantano, everything said in this video is fair with one piece of additional context.  <b>You</b> perceive this album to be unreviewable.  <b>You</b> can&#39;t stand the questionable lyrics.  And again, that&#39;s totally fair.<br>Personally, I chuckle and shake my head when a lyric jumps out at me as offensive, and I genuinely enjoy the production, rough round the edges though it may be.  Strong 7 for me.  <br>If a project makes you so angry you cannot review it fairly, be at peace with that.  Genuinely man.  <br>Love ya melon.
This video wouldve been fair if you didnt acually review the album the last 4 min of the video. This objectivley isnt worse then kids see ghosts or jesus is king.
full agree fantano. definitely wouldn&#39;t be a good idea to take this mess seriously.
I&#39;m a deep Kanye fan but I hate what he has been saying, I wish he stops, it doesn&#39;t even make sense. I also like the album, even if it&#39;s not great it&#39;s more interesting and cool than most of the music I find, but the attitude he has on the songs is deplorable. And I think you&#39;re too biased with this situation, getting mad at people for liking songs, calling them childs or whatever
Totally expected this.  I think objectively though and unfortunately<br>He is very very wrong
Wow i finally agree with this man lol
Thought you review music, not people. You didn‚Äôt need to make the video, but still you did because you know the name ‚ÄúKanye‚Äù brings you views. You‚Äôre making a video to target the audience you criticize in this video. Get off your high horse.
L
So let me get this, he won&#39;t review the album cuz he hates Ye? Or he&#39;s afraid he&#39;d get cancelled by the jews? It&#39;s one of these two
Okay‚Ä¶‚Ä¶how about you review and rate Ty Dolla $ign‚Äôs album Vultures 1 üòÅ
i find insane that an album broke a man this hard, the seething its off the charts, and I don&#39;t even like Vultures that much
vultures still fire
Lmao of those three types of fans i guess the 2nd one is the best of the bunch despite not being great
either review the album properly or leave this discussion in your second channel because no one cares about what you have to say about kanyes anti semitism<br><br>- ex kanye fan
Maybe if it was called ‚ÄúHonestly, Vultures‚Äù he would‚Äôve give it a Not Good
I personally think the album is a 9 to 9.5 and I‚Äôm Jewish
This comment section seems to have missed the point
Kanye is dorkazoid music
ye the goat one
What a sensitive little boy
Fantano sucks so much lmao
I just wanted an honest review of the music, man
‚ÄúParading her around like a naked body‚Äù this take is so boring and played out. You‚Äôre actually doing exactly what you‚Äôre accusing him of by assuming it‚Äôs completely his choice and she has no say in what she‚Äôs wearing or doing. I hate you stupid corporate liberals so much.
Fantano a clown
thank you for this video, melon. takes like these only hold the art to a higher standard--and hold us, as listeners, to something similar. no more &quot;kanye apologetics.&quot; there&#39;s no more room for him. it&#39;s over.
he wants to give it a 10 sooo baddddd
Did you really need to upload a video like this or did you just want to vent out the feeling you have towards Kanye againüòê if you really thought this album was unreviewable then why bother even making a video about it or listening to it?  I just feel like this whole video was unnecessary tbh
Hate the guy not the music
Absolutely horrible take‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs really a good album! Just because you hate Ye doesn‚Äôt make the album horrible, just makes you lose credit as a critic ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è WTH‚Ä¶.
you are right but i actually wanted you to review the album
How many Burzum records have you reviewed lol
Looking forward for unreviewable 2 and 3!
&quot;You can fix ignorance, you can&#39;t fix stupid&quot; - Daryl Davis
Just review the music dawg. THIS IS A MUSIC REVIEW. IF I WERE HERE TO HEAR SOMETHING CRITICAL ABOUT KANYE I WOULD WATCH NEWS ABOUT THE IDIOTIC STUFF HE&#39;&quot;S DOING  I do not agree with the things Kanye has said and done, but I personally enjoyed this album for the most part. I would honestly give the album a 7. It was dynamic and oftentimes entertaining at it&#39;s low points. . While Fantano is right about Kanye right now... This isn&#39;t a music review??? In addition what about Ty?? if you&#39;re gonna let your bias get in the way with Kanye, why can&#39;t we talk about Ty&#39;s performance on here??? The only time he&#39;s mentioned is when he sings a repetitive chorus on &quot;PAID&quot;. I&#39;m very disappointed. This isn&#39;t even an album review... it‚Äôs a Kanye politics and behavior review! shaking my head. P.S yeah HOODRAT was  bad...
i dont see how fade and paid are even remotely similar
Album was probably the best Kanye album of the last decade except for maybe pablo
I know this shit down voted to hell üòÇ
some of y&#39;all really shook over this LOL
literal SATANIST in the industry and he chooses to hate on ye. make it make sense
I respect and understand your opinion on Kanye West as a person, but this is a shitty excuse for not reviewing the album. You can separate the art from the artist, you don‚Äôt have to agree with the lyrics, and you shouldn‚Äôt. The album itself, in my opinion and many others, has some great songs on it. Your opinions on Paid and Back to me are confusing and it seems that you have a major bias. Again, I can obviously understand why, I don‚Äôt like Kanye as a person that much. But, you‚Äôre clearly not qualified to review this album
Thank god anthony dropped this, I had no idea what my opinion on it was
Wow
So is it unreviewable or does your hemeroid hurt?
Where&#39;s your wife?
become unrateable üòà
L
FREE PALESTINE
THIS GUY A HATER PERIOD...EVEN PETTY DRAKES DESPISE THIS DWEED CALLED FANTANO
It‚Äôs a shame the dislike button doesn‚Äôt show metrics anymore
if the album was called &quot;good vulture maad bird cage&quot; he would review a 9/10 4 this album
Wow what an unbiased and thoughtful review. Thanks Fantano
delete this garbage video.
How embarrassing, you fell for Kanye&#39;s whole schtick. (&quot;No one knows what it means, but it&#39;s provocative... it gets the people going!&quot;) Hes a provacatuer and you&#39;ve been provoked ü§£
Generational headloss
You seem depressed Anthony how‚Äôs the wife doing
Another common fantano L
Stop being a weirdo and just review the fucking album you‚Äôve had a known antisemite on your stream before jsut give an unbiased score bruh
Reactionary content. Trash. This video is unwatchable.
Again with the Public Service announcement. Just review the album.
I like the rythms and vocals but the lyricism and raps are horrid for Kanye but I like it more than jik and ye so I think it‚Äôs fine and I‚Äôm not a Kanye dickrider (I‚Äôm Jewish too)
Kanye fans can‚Äôt handle criticism. They throw a tantrum if you don‚Äôt give all of his works a 10/10 or higher. Honestly, listen to more music, there are millions of songs out there. Don‚Äôt make Kanye your life.
Eyoo, I came for the music not a lecture. Snowflake much?
Another Fantano W.
I only care about the music
11. this is the album of the year. your points about Kanye&#39;s following can be used on any other fan. (someone popular right now is Taylor Swift) so her going and influencing mostly young people with her Instagram reel of endorsing Biden Harris with no other reason than it was cool at the time is completely okay! The boarder has still not resolved its issue of being completely useless at stopping massive amounts of retinol and illegal immigrants yet that&#39;s no issue for your rich youtube life.
I love this album but i respect your opinion since you seem to be way more qualified than i am to review this album
ü§°ü§°ü§° This really what we doing fantano? We out dis
You review drill artists I don&#39;t want to hear lyric shame
Replies on this make me wonder if people actually watched the video or remember what Ye did in the past... I&#39;m disgusted of how people are still defending Ye like this, it&#39;s fucking embarrassing to everyone on this planet. Everyone who still defends Ye needs to grow up or else the human race is doomed.
it‚Äôs not that hard to be unbiased lmao
We all support people with mental illnesses until it inconveniences us.
Fuck I‚Äôll say it, I actually agree with Anthony Fantano for the first time‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..
Everyone I know likes the album. So do I. Not his best but It‚Äôs dope ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
LOL
Review music or work for fox‚Ä¶.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=223">3:43</a> just review the music and tell people if it‚Äôs good or not. That‚Äôs how you tell people. Not sitting here whining about stuff that doesn‚Äôt have to do with music. Is this a music review or a summary of the past 3 years? Witnessing the downfall of needle drop in real time
THIS GUY A TRUE HATER, WHAT IS ON HIS RESEM√â?
I be been a huge Kanye fan my whole life. Jesus is king was a mid album but I tried to love it. After that it‚Äôs just bs. Kids see ghosts was the last time I heard Kanye on an album having something of substance to say. After that it‚Äôs just a total mess. Everything feels rushed and unfinished. It‚Äôs like he doesn‚Äôt love his craft as much anymore
If this was called Sorry Jews it would get a 10
summary of the review:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>7mins of yapping
You realize with a review like this you drive more of your fans to listen to the record right?
I just came to dislike the video
Nah Buddy ass hating with the reviewüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ foh
So we&#39;re supposed to cater to 2% of the population that owns the media, the banks, the music industry and more? As if they don&#39;t already have enough power already? Sure, buddy.
People grilled him on twitter and now he‚Äôs mad
Hater
It was pretty‚Ä¶ mid, idrc about Kanye anymore
Huzzah! The can yay album is here!
Free Palestine
You‚Äôd rather be doing another Drake album or something?
Fantano be like, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt review the music‚Äù my brother in Christ you are the music reviewer
So... No review?
Melon was so woke already years ago, but it‚Äôs so bad at this stage. Just review the music and let the politics aside jeez
Can you shut upüò≠
&quot;kanyes worst album&quot; only says 2 songs that are bad.
He did t say anti simite he said the headlines say anti simite, no polor etc and I‚Äôm still king .. context is important
Womp womp
This mf gave sexyy reds album a better rating then mbdtf btw<br>y‚Äôall still take his opinion seriously? If you do you lost my respect.
Fantano not showing a screen shot of people  accusing him of being a Jew, when that‚Äôs a Fantano type edit move to do,  makes me think he just made that part  up
FANTANO U ARE JEWISH, U ARE BIASED ANYWAYSüòÇ
Womp womp
it might be kanye‚Äôs worst album but his worst is still a lot of artist best. You also should have spoke more about tracks like carnival, Fuck Sumn and burn
I still want a score on this bro
Don‚Äôt hate the player hate the game
ok Anthony, with this logic I hope you never review another gangster rap album about killing people. if king von was alive and dropped an album there‚Äôs no doubt you would review it, even with it being about killing people. if a literal serial killer can talk about killing people in his music, don‚Äôt treat kanye like some evil guy bc that is nowhere near as bad
can we talk about how that last cudi album sweeps vultures tho
Kanye fans making fun of Fantano for getting so heated over this when they themselves getting heated over Fantano is arguably more embarrassing.
All time hater lmao
Mid life crises
Egotistical, narcissistic,anti-Semitic geniuses with a God-complex don‚Äôt just fall out of the sky you know‚Ä¶
Melon reviewed Kanye instead of the album. üòÇ
4. Likes the music
Not sure about this one Melon
Only songs I liked were once again, and good(don&#39;t die) for sure his worst album
Did they tell u to do this üòÇ
The album sucks anyways so it‚Äôs fine
I can just see and hear the frustration in this man‚Äôs words when talking about this man Kanye. Clearly him and many others like myself are tired and done with his antics
You gave sexxy red an 8 stfu
Kanye and Taylor swift both run cults
Damn its worst than a not good ahahah
Melon was dead on about the kanye copers.
Fantano acting like when your favorite show ended as a kid and now you gotta act mad
Really respect this. Have been wondering for months how your gunna address this and glad you haven‚Äôt just tried to separate the art from the artist like some other creators
Unreviewable because of the politics Kanye&#39;s involved with and don&#39;t want to give some kind of platform for that but no problem consistently making Shorts and TikToks farming interactions including other viewers&#39; reviews because of the hype surrounding the album. I respect your choice not to review it, but keep your story straight dude.<br><br>You waited through the extremely long-winded several months leading up to the album by consistently covering Kanye‚Äôs antics, weighing in on viewers‚Äô opinions, etc. This continued up to and passed the full release on the album. And even literally streaming yourself listening to the album and giving your opinion on it while repeatedly arguing with chat about it. Then when the time comes for you to weigh in you act like his actions are now to disgusting to even discuss the album. Like you haven‚Äôt been consistently farming interactions from Ye fans and giving your opinion on singles.<br><br>Everything about this video is pretty disingenuous considering you‚Äôve ridden the hype of this album‚Äôs release up until now. Yikes.
What about the actual music, the album isn‚Äôt bad
Bruh those bars are crayyyyy
&quot;i am here to express my opinion&quot;<br><br>Also him<br>&quot;IF YOUR OPINION IS DIFFERENT TO MY CORRECT ONE, YOU ARE STUPID&quot;
At least Ye has a wife to parade around. Boom Roasted
I‚Äôm 3
If you truly wanted to accomplish your goals wouldnt you just not review the album or give it any attention. But you want money even if it involves giving who you believe to be a nazi publicity.
Welcome the highest paid Fantano review so far, congrats melon, you‚Äôll finally be able to make a living out of this üôå
AWWW IS MR MELON A LITTLE ANGRY ü•∫does somebody need a hug?
Holy fuck this video is the definition of gay
What if this is all an elaborate end goal of Ye&#39;s to get back at Melon for giving MBDTF a 6? To do so much insane stuff to the point that forces Melon to destroy his credibility as a reviewer.
Came here just to dislike this mf. Alright guys didn‚Äôt even make it past the ads. Bye
appreciate you taking a stand and saying something that&#39;ll make waves when you didn&#39;t need to.
But Fantano, the Pods are $20 now! I bet you‚Äôre a size 3, sending em your wayü•∞
you aint even 1/8th of a man, insulting another man&#39;s wife on twitter tf is wrong with you
Thought this was supposed to be about the music ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
This dude for sure has pronouns in bio
You are tripping that album is fire.
Leeching off kanye&#39;s clout again, if what you&#39;re saying is genuine then you would just ignore the album<br>But you need views so you made this video
The album is so unreviewable the cover art keeps clipping through the green screen
what if i can like kanye and hate what he stands for? Is that a different type of fan or am i still a bad person
Melon just mad that pegi got a yeezy pod and he didn&#39;t.
I know he secretly listens to the ignition remix
You already know an album is fire if  it melon hates on it üò≠üôè
you ate
Dude this is so lame<br><br>This mentality is  why you never became an artist
Good solid 10. Thanks
bro was left traumatized by this album üíÄ<br>i dont really have much of a opinion on vultures
Are you Jewish? cause you just sound hurt instead of a music reviewer. Keep it objective to arr
Anthony, the REAL melon and ye fans stand with you on this one. <br><br>Yeah there are songs I like on this album but more than half of it is unlistenable garbage. Besides the unfinished mixes, dated production ideas, and awful songwriting choices, Kanye has made it impossible to separate his actions and words from his music and has doubled down on being a piece of misogynistic shit. <br><br>Your Jewish fans (Jews ain‚Äôt the best term for you to use ) thank you, at least I have, for not being okay with the anti semitic conspiracy nazi fascism ye is surrounding himself with, serious OR not. <br>I pray he gets himself out and does the hard work to help stop him being a piece of crap.
Good job reviewing the music!
If this was called ‚ÄúHood hottest Vultures‚Äù he wouldv given it an 8
Loved this nonbiased review
i just enjoy his music idc about his goofy political opinions nor do i agree with them. just enjoying the sounds and beats alongside Ty who is a musical genius ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
you suck so bad man :(
When you go into an album already hating it before you‚Äôve played it this is always gonna happen üò≠
Could have said nothing or just reviewed the music. Da fuck, not here for your rant on mental health and socially acceptable behavior.
This with all the drake hate shows he just doin this for views bro prolly vibing to carnival  rn
Why not just ignore the album altogether üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
üòπüòπüòπüòπ
You CAN still say you only like him for the music and just ignore those couple bars. Nobody cares. You just yapped for 7 minutes.
???? Review the album.
Idk kinda fucks the whole page huh?
‚ÄúThe album was too good for me not to make a review about it‚Äù - Fantono
HAhahaha. &quot;Boo hoo, Kanye doesn&#39;t like Jews and that makes him the WORST guy ever!&quot;<br>Get a grip, Foptano. Bro&#39;s really out here saying Jews are above criticism. lmao guess I&#39;m a hateful psycho, cos yeah, to be this reflexively against Kanye for criticizing New York Tunnellers you&#39;d have to be a Chosenite.
bro this guys such an incel üòÇ
Unwatchable video number 1000 from Fantano
STOP THE YAPPING REVIEW THE MUSIC
Fantano died with the Super Bowl
Nah i agree with i disagree with my agreeing, hence why i agree with it bc i fundamentally disagree and utterly despise my taste, and since im a fantano fan after drinking 10 gallons of Ye Kool Aid and 68 grams of copium
you were trash when you rated mbdtf and you still trash now
&quot;unreviewable&quot; is interesting when half of the video is spent ùóøùó≤ùòÉùó∂ùó≤ùòÑùó∂ùóªùó¥ the album
If you saw no art in this then your real lame
This gives hard ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not mad I‚Äôm just disappointed‚Äù and I completely understand üòÖ
VIRTUE SIGNALS 1
ü§°ü§°ü§°
And you guys used to think nothing Anthony did to Kanye would be worst than MBDTF being a 6 (twice)
Truely unreviewable. Since it‚Äôs impossible for a music 1 critic to review a music 2 album
You can tell Fantano hasn‚Äôt slept in days. Trolls have gotten to him and his divorce has taken a toll. He should take a break
review the album mf
dude you could‚Äôve given this a 3 and i would‚Äôve been happier
Honestly, I probably wouldn&#39;t have even made a video. Ye&#39;s made his bed, best not to give him any attention or time of day.
u done got urself grilled
Snowflake moment
Your bald
Well said Anthony
oh u mad üò≥üòÇ
Great vid Anthony. Fully agree with the points you make here!
L take to be honest. Kanye has a history of doing ridiculous things, but now that cancel culture is in full swing you hop on the bus and come up with this honestly delusional argument to justify shitting on an actually decent album. ok man.
It‚Äôs kinda hard to like this album when the bad stuff Kanye did is literally advocated in the song itself. Oh well at least Carnival is a banger tho
That‚Äôs why ye is the goat
Although what you say might be true, im part of fan group #3 so eat my shorts melon
so this guy out of no where is deeply offended by a rapper who disrespects women lol what a fucking fraud, if you feel that way you might as well stop reviewing rap music, cause by your logic youre &quot;endorsing&quot; any genre of rap that youre reviewing here, drugs, violence, crime etc foh
he‚Äôs trynna get the kanye dm
Vultures isn‚Äôt a perfect album by no means &amp; still doesn‚Äôt feel fully finished but you have to take the music for how it is an atleast look the the highlights then just saying something is ‚Äúunreviewable‚Äù based on your personal bias‚Äôs towards the man
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=305">5:05</a> for those who aren‚Äôt interested in melons virtue signaling
You would give it more if it was named The Vultures Dropout
that second group of fans is the absolute f*<b>*ing worst bruh fr so f***ing accurate and they&#39;re literally the kinda p*thetic a*</b> edgelord reckless teenage shepherd that f***ing ruined hip hop altogether fr I assure you they&#39;re EXACTLY the same audience as Yeat üò≠
This album is a 6/10 AT BEST but you described all of my problems I have specifically with Kanye and this album.
How you talking bad about someone‚Äôs wife in a music review. cmon man this is just wierd.
I don‚Äôt condone Kanye‚Äôs actions, but there‚Äôs definitely a few highlights on this track list
I think it&#39;s a bit difficult to really assess Kanye&#39;s music at this point, because despite the appalling things he&#39;s been saying these past few years, it seems quite clear that he&#39;s mentally unstable.<br> This is a person that, quite clearly, exhibits signs for bipolar disorder, and at some points even persecutory thoughts. So, how can we objetively assess what he&#39;s saying? I thing that, more than being outraged at what he is saying (which we should), the main focus should be to actively figure out if he&#39;s having a proper follow-up. Because honestly, the guy&#39;s been saying stuff that hints at not having people properly taking care of him and making sure that he&#39;s actually taking his meds. He even shows this persecutory behaviour by accusing his doctor of trying to hurt him, how can that be a sign of someone that is actually on a proper track towards recovery?<br><br>I don&#39;t really care that much about his recent music, honestly. He&#39;s one of the greatest shapers of modern music due to his great producing talent, but if he&#39;s consciously saying this stuff, I will always defend consequences. However, from a medical and ethical point of view, you can only judge the person&#39;s words if he is aware of them. And I really think that he is completely messed up, and mental disease&#39;s prognosis only aggravates with time if not properly addressed. That&#39;s all.
Don&#39;t listen to vultures 1 listen to Yeezy Boots by RxkNephew instead
Melon machine broke
This is honestly a sad way to get some brownie points all because Kanye said anti-Semitic (which he has apologized for) and you decide to not review this album yet you also chose to review Travis Scott&#39;s album after the Astroworld concert incident. It seems that you like to cherry pick who gets a pass. pretty pathetic
Everytime I think I finally like this dude, he just makes the worst take of all time, like üòíüòíüòíüòíüòíüòí
W for Fantano. Huge Ye fan but I can‚Äôt enjoy this album. Wish there were people around him that genuinely had his best interests in mind, and that he would LISTEN to. Praying for Kanye
You&#39;re supposed to be reviewing the album not Kanye&#39;s off the field antics.
Your a nerd and loosing your hair. No one will remember anything you&#39;ve done when you leave earth üåé Let that sink in.
Not getting a ‚Äúclick the like if you‚Äôd like‚Ä¶over the top of my head is more reviews you could watch..‚Äù is weird
D1 hater
Genuinely one of your strongest reviews. Im glad you pointed out the hypocrisy and the fact that they never truly listen to the music or hear different perspectives.
fantano needs to just stfu because he genuinely doesnt know good music, for gods sake he skipped cartis part because he didnt like the way he said his first 5 words.
he called the album unreviewable so he went on a full review on kanye&#39;s opinions and statements. nice.
The entire comment section is just full of all the types of people he mentioned. like shit on him all u want, ur just proving his point of how insufferable and parasocial u are.
All jokes aside, thank you for speaking out against Kanye&#39;s horrible messages. So many turn a blind eye to them, for the sake of being &quot;objective&quot;, but I&#39;m glad to see you on the right side of history.
i mean burn, carnival and back to me are the only songs I&#39;d consider great, the rest are filler that have potential but are either unfinished or kanye ruins them, i feel like if it was just a ty dolla sign album with kanye production it&#39;d be great
Yea but when Kanye was saying anti black shit he was still reviewable. Melon tries not to be a hypocrite challenge (difficulty impossible)
Why can&#39;t you look past something you disagree with and pay attention to the music, Jesus.
Common fantano L
Not even interested in listening to the album but this is sad LOL if its unreviewable don&#39;t review it. You wanted the clicks and not defending Kanye but you have no problem reviewing other artists with questionable histories? Embarrassing going to get the recap from SunnyV2 in the future
its not good, he‚Äôs totally right. i do think there‚Äôs a handful of decent songs, but really this album is not good. i love kanye, but y‚Äôall need to realize whats going on
Great job Anthony, a really grounded, unbias review!
Imagine if Anthony cared this much when white people were spoken about poorly on rap albums. It would be cringe af.
Show the dislikes
Easy dislike
I&#39;ll review it then: It was better than everything he&#39;s made since 808&#39;s. Brought back some boom bap. But for all the things fantano said is why I won&#39;t listen to it again. 7.2/10
u just mad . album is a 8
Also btw Mr melon man.. Bianca used to be the head creative director for Yeezy &amp; that‚Äôs how Kanye first meet her he‚Äôs known her for a while so do some research buddy before your yapping making assumptions about some ‚Äúrandom naked girl‚Äù he found‚Ä¶ think it not logical giving your opinion about someone‚Äôs WIFE who you don‚Äôt know the full backstory and history of, how would you feel if someone talked about your wife like that huh?
Rare Fantano L
Anyways so what do you rate it ?
That&#39;s your problem Fantano, you only do it for the numbers, for the money, you don&#39;t do it for the music, you want the numbers at the end of the day, not enjoyable content.
Zzzzzz
i fully understand people who completely turned their backs on him, such hateful messages should not be spread by anyone, especially by someone with as big of a following as him. i truly think that we as a society should shame him as much as possible with the hopes that some day he‚Äôll wake the fuck up and realize what he‚Äôs been saying. however, i still listen to his music (pirating it) because it‚Äôs been such an enormous part of my life and an endless source of inspiration (vultures included). these two statements can coexist. i think every person should decide for themselves if they want to keep listening to him or not. but if they do, it is NOT okay to be supporting anything he says. just fucking listen to him quietly and shut the fuck up. don‚Äôt even post him on social media because it creates a message that ‚Äúif kanye can say hateful and offensive things and not have to face any consequences for his words, then i can too‚Äù. antisemitism is evil. trump is evil. russia is evil. white supremacy is evil. these things cannot be debated
Carnival&gt; this entire YouTube channel
&#39;&#39;three types of kanye fans&#39;&#39; and it&#39;s all negative<br>good job melon
Lame
New Fantano cope review dropped babe
This guy is coping so hard lmao hes back
It&#39;s the same thing with Trump. Every little thing he says, no matter how stupid or hateful, only reinforces their support. It&#39;s mental illness.
When you read the words and the meaning you are really something else, Fantano, it says I have a few Jews on the staff now and you saying it‚Äôs not good or normal. Lmao
So everyone who‚Äôs a Kanye fan is a nazi annoying teenager or follows him like a cult?
Nuh uh
worst faith review i‚Äôve ever seen. jesus.
poopy review, high 7
If it was called &quot;The Vulture Store&quot; you would&#39;ve rated it a 10
This album feels like the equivalent of the Super Bowl last night.
Bro in an hour he said 3 lines about it who fucking cares? The entire album is bad because of 3 lines?
Really feels like he went into the album wanting to hate it. Reviewers are meant to be unbiased
The whole Kanye thing makes me kinda sad tbh, he&#39;s clearly capable of good work but when someone does nothing but hang out with people who tell them everything they want to hear, it really stops that growth that could&#39;ve been
This guy gives Sza like a 9 or something like that hahahahaha SZZZZA üò¥ hahaha he us just hating
w
Named 3 types of people but not just people that like the music lmao
weird way to say it‚Äôs a 10, anthony
Stop crying buddy
for the majority of the video you didnt even say anything about the album?
Hmm kind of a weird coincidence that he liked all the guest features from artists  and just hates Kanye&#39;s parts. Oh well! Nothing more to examine here.
Heated for no reason
I laughed to hard at big titty ladies falling out the sky to dislike the rest of the album
I get what you&#39;re saying and yes the Jewish rhetoric is confusing and horrible but you have forever had a bias against Kanye and went into everything he&#39;s made with that pre-existing bias. I&#39;ve literally never seen you freak out so much over an album in the 10+ years I&#39;ve been following you. The music isn&#39;t nearly as bad as you call it out to be, it&#39;s obvious that you just want to take this excuse to write him off and be done with it. You&#39;re not wrong about many things but your reaction and obsession with proving a point on Kanye is just weird at this point. If you really didn&#39;t like it that much then don&#39;t review it or at least don&#39;t monetize your video...
Your reviews suck
half of the album SUCKS, 1/4th is good, 1/4th is great.
Kanye&#39;s right about the jaws
Anthony I‚Äôve watched you for years and I have to say brother this is just pathetic man , this album is not even bad yet alone ‚Äòunreviewable‚Äô you can dislike or even hate ye but to act like his music is down to this level is just insane. First minute of this video is just calling ye an antisemite and disrespecting his wife like that has nothing to do with the album. Ye trolls on twitter are feeding into what you say and honestly to me it seems like you‚Äôre doing it on purpose to gain interactions . Still, this album IMO is decent , no where near ‚Äòunreviewable‚Äô . Dislike ye all u want tho it‚Äôs ur life
This comment section. The butthurt is real.
Retarded take. Review the music not the politics fantano
haha Kanye broke this guy !!!!!!
Fantano the type of guy to review the guy who made the album and not the album
You people failed at making him go away üòÇüòÇüòÇ congratulations, u played the whole album
I won‚Äôt let Kanye ruin Kanye for me lol the album is great
Horrible take
Bruh, it was a good album SMH
Antony fantano=no bithces
Anthony will never separate the artist from the music üòÇ. I can‚Äôt wait to see the downfall of Mr. Fantano this guy a top class hater
womp womp
YOU CAN&#39;T CALL AN ALBUM TRASH IF THE WHOLE ALBUM IS IN TOP 50!!!
If it was called &#39;good kid mad vultures&#39; he wouldve given it a 10
Kanye the only artist the break Melon... Proudest moment
You gotta stop bringing your politics into your reviews
With the free Palestine movement being as popular as it is I guess you could say Ye was just ahead of the curve
This is why kanye the goat
üòÇ
Womp womp womp womp
The album is awful
Fantano is such a beta
Everyone that still supports kanye at this point is either a heartless teen not being directly affected by his hateful actions or is so delusional that they&#39;re paying the man calling for their death
A grown ass 40 year old man attacks Bianca for no reason and then acts like the victim
It had 2 songs that were relevant to me, but the rest is from hell so i think the rest is not genuine
So Peggy can do it and it‚Äôs fine? That‚Äôs where you are bias.
youre a real one anthony
just review it bro its not that deep
Garbage Channel
Your political ideas are absolutely braindead and I couldn&#39;t disagree with you more, and yet I enjoy your reviews. That&#39;s how I enjoy Kanye. Sorry that you can&#39;t do that, it must keep you from alot of good things
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=146">2:26</a> did he just call teenagers lives meaningless???? Yikes üò¨
So you‚Äôve reviewed music made by murderers, drug abusers, people that beat they wives, rapists, yet you draw the line at someone who is already known for having no filter and saying controversial things. Ok sure buddy
oh BROTHER this guy STINKS!!!!!
Used to be the biggest Ye defender but I only defended him cause his music was good but lately the music can‚Äôt back up the dumbass shit he says now. These last few projects have been disappointing
How can you be so spot on about something? This is masterclass. Applause
You&#39;re just mad you and your people can&#39;t cancel Ye. But yet I guess sexy red is a pillar to the community because you gave that album a high ranking lmao. If you are going to call some trash out call it all out. Women objectifying themselves is not empowering lmao. If anything it&#39;s bad for young women who look up to these types of people.
Why are you so emotionally invested in this? lmao this whole review is unhinged, it&#39;s like kanye derangement syndrome. why can&#39;t you just normally review the record without chimping out?
Just talk about the music, man
shut up
It&#39;s not that bad tbh like the actual music, its very mid, worse thing is how corny it is considering he&#39;s 50 yo man is doing this
If it was named Kids See Vultures he would‚Äôve gave it a 10/10
He&#39;s intellectually and morally unserious. &quot;What am I supposed to tell my Jewish fans? Kanye didn&#39;t mean it? That he&#39;s just crazy?&quot; As if Jewish people haven&#39;t grappled with the meaning of Wagner&#39;s music over the past 150 years. He treats them like children whose parents and grandparents were shrinking violets.<br><br>I used to joke that Kanye was like Wagner‚Äîdown to his maximalism and stage design‚Äîbut at least Wagner wasn&#39;t alive to endorse Hitler. But hell, Kanye was off his rocker when he gave those interviews. Wagner sat down to write the volumes of antisemitic filth he published. He thought his essays through, writing them, rewriting them, sending them to an editor, defending them when his former friends lambasted him. In this way, Wagner&#39;s antisemitism was worse than Kanye West&#39;s. He thought far more about what it meant than Kanye ever has. And yet, Jewish musicians like Daniel Barenboim, who called his antisemitism &quot;monstrous,&quot; fought to perform his music in Israel.<br><br>&quot;What am I supposed to tell my Jewish fans? Kanye didn&#39;t mean it?&quot; No one knows if Kanye would have said those vile comments if he took his meds and was surrounded with better people. Perhaps he still would have. Perhaps he did actually mean it. This is irrelevant to the question. Wagner was a committed antisemite, and he did mean his vile ideology; despite that, Jewish people like Barenboim were able to come to a conclusion that was undeniably very difficult for them, but one that ultimately affirmed their belief in the aesthetic value of Wagner&#39;s music, of performing it, and of doing so in a country that had people who would have liked to throw Barenboim in jail for putting it on an orchestra&#39;s program. Others like Asher Fisch, whose mother fled the Holocaust, believed that conducting Wagner would be their final victory over Hitler.<br><br>Jews who grappled with the question about what to do with art created by people like Wagner are more brave and respectful of Judaism than stupid cowardly shits like Fantano who balk at even having to consider that question.<br><br>I find some of the lyrics Kanye used in this album to be truly detestable and grotesque, particularly the line about how he couldn&#39;t be antisemitic because &quot;he fucked a Jewish bitch.&quot; (As if members of the Nazi party never slept with Jews.) This is fair to critique on those grounds. It is the actual text of that song. Of course Fantano is right that it would be stupid to ignore this. To then extend that to a condemnation of his entire catalogue of music, to say that to like Kanye&#39;s music is to belong to one of three disgusting camps of people is reductive. It treats Jewish people as if they were idiots, as if they were children.<br><br>I&#39;m not saying the question is easy to answer, only that it is insulting to Jewish people‚Äîor any person who is confronted by art being made by someone who hates them‚Äîto balk at having to consider it. People like Fantano are cowards, plopped down in the world as if the questions that enrage them were never asked before by those with far less. They would do better to shut their mouths and read about how their betters approached the question rather than violently reacting to it being posed.
I truly think this is a pretty good album. The only criticism i have is some of the mixing needs work
Some serious Kanye meat riders in here üòÇ
What a read lol
It definitely feels unfocused. Like a bunch of cool snippets
it&#39;s a really bad album. if it were good i would have liked it tho. sometimes i dislike kanye albums at first then they grow on me... yeezus, pablo, ye. this one isn&#39;t going to grow on me
Being a Kanye fan in 2024 is peak brain rot. Excusing Nazism ‚Äúbecause the music is so good!!!!!‚Äù But the music isn‚Äôt even fucking good anymore. This album is ass. I‚Äôm glad Anthony reminded all the Ye fans that still exist that their fav artist is a Nazi
Soooo where‚Äôs the album review‚Ä¶.?
Melon ain‚Äôt getting any Beautiful big titty butt naked women ya know?
the fact that paperwork exists as a song
womp womp
Didn&#39;t expect fantano to do the review in german to be honest.
If death grip was on it he would give it a 10
this mf thinks the world revolves around himüíÄdawg is not Ye
booooooo
Bro looks like he been crying
did he just add a new grade to the scale lower than not good?
Bro forgot the fourth type of fan, the fans that hate this new mishmash of anti-semitism and toxic masculinity
5 minutes and and he hasn‚Äôt even mentioned the music yet
The title of the vid üò≠ waiting for 2 &amp; 3
truly one of the music review of all time, thank you melon
please delete your channel
He clearly just doesn‚Äôt like Kanye west
‚Äúmusic critic‚Äù my ass üò≠üò≠üò≠ cope harder
seriously why do people care what this balding gay guy thinks about music
ok, ill review it then. 7/10. Some good stuff, some boring stuff, some times in the same song. Pretty on par with all his post pablo stuff.
Mr Fantano you forgot Kanye isn‚Äôt Antisemitic anymore because he watched 21 Jump Street with Jonah Hill who‚Äôs jewish and said he liked it. So this album is a 8/10 üòä
Thank you Fantano, after this video I&#39;ve come to realise some would say a &quot;third eye revelation&quot; within myself. I realise I don&#39;t have to base my opinions from yours anymore and I&#39;m proud to say Kanye&#39;s recent album was &#39;ok&#39; at best
Kanye sucks straight up.  That POS song with his kid is trash
I refuse to listen to this album for all the reasons you pointed out. The fact that this is being normalized is mind numbing.
Hey melon, may I know your opinion on drake&#39;s meat? Please melon I need to know if I should like it or not.
Oh no now i can&#39;t from an opinion on this album
Fantano needs to take a break‚Ä¶
Okay, but if it was called ‚ÄúMelons,‚Äù you would‚Äôve given it a 10
as a kanye fan, who loved vultures.<br><br>hes right.
why does the man still have an audience
i must be part of the nihilistic teenager group but I&#39;m an old jew
Keep in mind anthony gave sexy red a higher score than my beautiful dark twisted fantasy‚Ä¶
We get it melon you‚Äôre woke
Donate the profits of this video to the ADL.
Kanye is right about Jews. You are the best gateway to new music. You&#39;re Italian and not Catholic. Your ancestors would be ashamed.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=155">2:35</a> yea but there is a fourth... people like me who just dont care and listen to the music.. <br>Kanye is a bad person. Kanye doesn&#39;t deserve respect for his dumb actions. He still going on my spotify playlist so which one am i?
Holy shit Ye really bugged out  fantano reviews.
didn&#39;t know this was a political commentary. Thanks needle drop!
ok but he never divorced bianca
I remember when I first started watching your videos, I enjoyed the more &quot;objective&quot; approach you had to reviewing music. Giving articulate and cohesive reasoning to all your points as to why you enjoyed or disliked the music. Recently it&#39;s felt like there is way more emotion in your reviews, with lots of emphasis on pop culture, politics, etc. The value of your opinion on music will only diminish when you are so caught up in the artist&#39;s lives and pop culture instead of just sticking to the music.
HAHAHAHAH
butt hurt fantano
This video got me to subscribe
Can&#39;t wait for unreviewable 2 interview üî•üî•üî•
bro is just helping ye with his whole edgy villain arc. free publicity XD
be worried if they say nothing.
As nihilistic teenager I felt like I was called out
You taking it too serious.. 10/10
No seriously - where are these absolute die hard Kanye apologists I keep hearing about? Because Fantano keeps referencing them like it&#39;s a legitimate group of people and not like 7 reddit guys
Review Penalty of Leadership
If there&#39;s anything melon has to admit to, is that his beat production is still top notch. Noone else in the industry even comes close to his type of production quality. There are still some positive things you can about this album without that being synonymous with you saying you hate Jews. Like cmon bro. There is a degree of separation you can have with an artist from his craft. Im not signing off on anything hes doing but i cant say he has a good song or two on this album? Imagine Burn is playing at a store and a person just neutrally states, &quot; I like this beat, who made this,&quot; and someone goes oh then I guess you hate Jews and agree with objectifying women. Like wtf are you talking about bro. We can&#39;t give credit where credit is due without cosigning everything kanye has done?
So that wasted my time, everyone knows he‚Äôs crazy thanks Fantano
I agree Kanye is a piece of shit because his opinions are fucking terrible and he‚Äôs never had anybody tell him no but you thinking this album is trash is insanely biased, but I can understand that not gonna ask anyone to support someone who is anti-Semiticü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I just can‚Äôt deny art
so all the remaining kanye supporters decided to manifest in this comment section huh
You reviewed Ye&#39;s personality, behavior, and politics, not the album.
Just review the fucking music. As much I understand them (and agree with what you&#39;re saying), I don&#39;t care about your liberal-leaning opinions. As a critic you need to disregard all that bullshit and just talk about the music in its own light.
i dont even fuck with fantano&#39;s rap takes ever because im a producer but yeah this shit sucks major ass
idk who&#39;s more desperate for attention, if u or Ye
This is a pretty fair BIASED review. With Kanye you can‚Äôt separate him from his music because he‚Äôs too real. Real ü•∑ know when someone hating and he‚Äôs not.
womp womp mf, aoty.
Supporting Kanye in 2024 qualifies as as a mental illness
bro doesnt realize he still reviewed the album
Revival &gt; Vultures?
Womp womp
This album was pretty insufferable to sit through, lyrically and musically it&#39;s just his most bland and tasteless album to date, aside from maybe &quot;Burn&quot; there&#39;s just no way I could sit through this garbage again
Kanye got a divorce and started hating Jews for no reason fantano got a divorce and started hating ye for no reason
no wonder he‚Äôs divorced
you&#39;ll definitely get shit for this, but i completely understand your reasoning here. i am not jewish myself but was taught english growing up by the elderly jewish lady my mum was a careworker for when i was younger. she was like family to me so i cant personally even listen to this album myself, its just disrespectful.
can u be more normal
L.
Thank You üôèüèº
I can hear him blink in the intro he&#39;s that depressed
why didn‚Äôt he talk about the good tracks like carnival, burn, king and some more
So you‚Äôre a biased reviewer who is incapable of listening and reviewing something honestly and objectively. Got it. Glad to hear you finally say it out loud.
This was bias asl you album not great cut it‚Äôs definitely a cool 7/10 hater
party&#39;s over grandpa
freak ur agenda melon
Bro just jealous cuz Ye has a wife
It really bothers me that this video is titled ‚Äúunreviewable‚Äù and begins with fantano saying he isn‚Äôt gonna talk much about the music yet so many of these comments are people complaining about this very thing. You didn‚Äôt get a review just like the man said at the beginning of the video. And to call this a meltdown is insane; no yelling, no screaming, no tears, just gated frustration and pretty collected and composed thoughts. It‚Äôs ok to not agree with someone‚Äôs opinion but don‚Äôt over-inflate something to make it out as something else. Also for all the mfs saying the video is ‚Äúleftist‚Äù- being against racism/antisemitism and not enjoying an artist that promotes and brings up this very thing in his music shouldn‚Äôt be a political issue, that shit is wrong. These ye supporters gotta be kids or idk what we‚Äôve come to as a society. <br>PS The reason Ye saying this shit is worse than others who have said is that he has an insanely massive platform in comparison which reaches millions and millions of people and he has much more influence that can do a lot more harm.
Bro idgaf about his political views and how he treats his wife, he literally posted on Instagram his wife likes it and both are happy
THANK YOU for being a sane voice.
Bruh wtf did you just trick me into watching. I feel like you scammed me of my time this time thumbthany fake reviewtano
Yeezy szn
But he made graduation
Just going to say as one of Ye&#39;s edgy nihilistic trauma bonded hangers-on that Lingua Ignota/Rev. Kristen Michael Hayter&#39;s &quot;SAVED!&quot; album was a much better soundtrack for channeling America&#39;s fascist id than this album is. It has its place I guess.<br><br>It&#39;s kind of over now for Ye fans. I think before the meltdown there was a chance we&#39;d get a controlled unraveling of Kanye&#39;s alienation and masculinist paranoia, maybe find some meaning in what it takes for a black man to be drawn to white supremacist symbolism and neofascist ideology. But Ye basically cannot allow himself to take risks or be vulnerable rn. He&#39;s going to go for &quot;uncancellable&quot; as his vibe and it&#39;s going to kill any possibility of getting any truly provocative art out of him. That JPEG collab might be good though.<br><br>I&#39;m not even sure there&#39;s a part of Kanye left to be critical of himself. He&#39;s got Milo handling his money right now. I get why people don&#39;t want to deal with the idea that Kanye might be too far gone but honestly that might just be the lesson that&#39;s needed: If you play too lovingly with fascist aesthetics as a way of dealing with your existential dread you might eventually find yourself goose-stepping for real.<br><br>Good job to Anthony on the moral growth. After your two Burzum reviews it&#39;s good to see more thought put into the harm that platforming fascists causes.
You have ligma
Yo melon I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre going to see this, but I‚Äôve been a die-hard Kanye fan since 11‚Äô (except for 2022) and while I do have to admit this is probably in the bottom 2 of his discography it is nowhere near the point where you can be calling it ‚Äúunreviewable.‚Äù The album still has great highlights in the form of Burn, Beg Forgiveness, Problematic, and Talking, but giving a Sexy Red album a strong 8 and refusing to review this at all tarnishes your status as a music critic and your impartiality in general. Kanye has provided the genre with some of its most impactful and influential songs whether directly or inadvertently and I feel like you could have addressed your concerns in a much better fashion than described in the video. If it was called ‚ÄúKids See Vultures‚Äù maybe it could have been a 10 ü§î just my 2 cents
The title of the video and the video itself contradict each other because technically you still reviewed it anyway even if you didnt give it a score üíÄ
I think this officially puts bro in the D1 catagory.üòÇ
how could those be the only three types of fans if the album went #1 in a hundred countries. like regular people are still clearly enjoying the music.
i understand not liking ye himself but cmon fantano the music is fire
you review artists that rap about and commit murder, misogyny, homophobia, cheating, robbing, assault, etc. but you&#39;re only willing to take a stance on ethics and morality in rap when its the most obvious wrong about kanye spewing shit about jews. If he never had spoken about jews, you&#39;d probably not even bring up any of the other shit, along with the majority of rap today
I think you‚Äôre being biased and unfair
When he talks about there‚Äôs only 3 types of Kanye fans, that only covers like the small 1% that have just been accumulated since the anti semite stuff.
You can‚Äôt call yourself a music critic if you can‚Äôt remove the artist‚Äòs personality and political opinions from the art.
100% a jew
sometimes i just really dislike this guy
How you gonna be a music reviewer and not review damn music, WE KNOW HE BE DOING WACK SHIT, THAT&#39;S NOT WHY ANYONE IS ON YOUR CHANNEL.
Bro needs everyone to think he‚Äôs a good person‚Ä¶
Okay buddy then don‚Äôt review it!
hes so mad this album is so good after shitting on ye
Worst fantano review to date. I came to hear your opinion on the album. Not your yapping about how much you disagree with him
but its kanye
I agree with everything said besides the 3 types of fans point. that was bs
Ok we get it now talk about the album
Fantano actually thinking Kanye is a neo-nazi is hilarious
This was not an album review.
your gonna regret this  when vultures 3 is a 10/10 üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=266">4:26</a> Why would you block the face while he&#39;s handing out amazing quotes like that.
Kim ain‚Äôt gon let u hit bro
So this is pretty much a video full of virtue signaling and hating because you don‚Äôt like Ye anymore because of his controversial and &quot;dangerous&quot; views... But rappers talking about murdering others, selling and taking drugs, fucking others people‚Äôs wives and doing all kinds of other shit isn‚Äôt dangerous or controversial and okay to support?üòÖ makes complete sense. Those topics don‚Äôt bother me because I love hip hop and I don‚Äôt agree with Ye&#39;s views in any way but it‚Äôs super hypocritical to act like his views are the worst thing in the world and &quot;dangerous&quot; when other rappers are talking about things that are more dangerous to society than what he‚Äôs been saying.
Bro haz la rese√±a del album, no de la persona
MBDTF review: I don‚Äôt care about this album because Im not invested in Kanye‚Äôs persona and real life antics.<br><br>Vultures review: I care so much about Kanyes persona and his real life antics thatI‚Äôll switch up my entire video format just to diss him
YOU‚ÄôRE a clown. You don‚Äôt speak for the CULTURE. A real music critic looks past the antics and controversies and critiques the ART. Meanwhile you get sexy red great reviews and she‚Äôs destroying the culture. Stay in your lane.
Ok I&#39;m likely to get drowned out here but genuinely thank you for being sane about this. Seeing the ways people bend over backwards to ignore (and thereby tacitly support) white supremacy and antisemitism puts such a knot in my stomach. Thank you for not letting it slip by. I think you did a good thing with this non review.
Seetheony Copetano
Proud of you.
How about you at least attempt to separate the review from the reviewer? Do it and burn were unarguably fire, so were many of these tracks. I‚Äôm no way whatsoever can kanye do no wrong or have bad bars, he does sometimes, but this is an 8/10 album. The only thing wrong with it is there are like three weak songs and the lyrics aren‚Äôt as deep as they could‚Äôve been, otherwise üî•
I‚Äôm too busy looking at that gray alien face from the low quality green screen keyer
damn i actually agree with this.  kanye stans are too deep in the rabbit hole to even be open minded to criticism
Why even make this album a video, i think its best we all just ignore kanye if we ever want him to go back to pre-craziness and good music. This is just giving him the attention nd controversy he wants.
You should not have posted this.
Your reviews been trash üòä<br>We talking bout music or politics ü§î
melon don‚Äôt like it bc of his political views. wow! nothing to do with the music congrats! GIVE A REAL REVIEW GOOBER
this comment section is deranged. these men are fools. disgustedly brainwashed.
wait till anthony finds out that people can like the album for the music and still not believe in whatever kanye is saying üòÆ
you forgot the 4th type of kanye fan, ppl who make youtube vids about kanye
keep yapping melon, we streaming &quot;HOODRAT&quot; still
no.
if this was called kids before vultures u wud‚Äôve given it a 10
I just thought there were some fun pop songs on the album lol. His last 2 albums were trash &amp; his singles have been awful since 2018. But vultures is pretty good, not great, but solid
this is so disappointing. I was expecting for your thoughts on this album, but you just say that people who likes Kanye music in 2024 are mentally sick. Defining an album as &quot;unreviewable&quot; is a failure for a music critic, i think
I think this guy likes kanye
Feels like it was supposed to be a review but was just an excuse to rant about him for 7 minutes not really getting much of what the album is supposed to be about just the person behind it
Gibbs verse was fire tho
Ye fans livid in the comments üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Fantano couldn&#39;t review the album, so he reviewed Kanye and all his fanbase instead
There it is.
Fantano learned racism bad at 40 and refuses to stop letting us know
1
Thanks for saying this, it‚Äôs a shame the Kanye cult eats this crap up but I wouldn‚Äôt expect anything else from them. They‚Äôre like Drake fans but worse, literal morons
Ijust like the music
this is soy
Virtue signal the review
At least you&#39;re honest about being a little biased üëèüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩ<br>But I would have expected you to talk a bit more about the Music and the Vibe instead of his personal behavior and past missteps ü´°
So this is a Kanye personality review and not a music review ? Cool.
You can‚Äôt say you can‚Äôt review it, and then review it. If you can‚Äôt or don‚Äôt want to that‚Äôs fine and respectable. Just cause you didn‚Äôt give it a number doesn‚Äôt mean you didn‚Äôt review it
imagine not getting it.
He called his lady a reference in terms of like a reference for an art piece, dude. &quot;dehumanizing&quot; Wrongo
this dude is such a clown
‚Äúunreviewable 1‚Äù is a silly name for an album fantano
Ain&#39;t nobody give a shit about your reviews after u gave sexy red an 8 üíÄüíÄüíÄ
We all know Fantano isnt judgin da music n jus da artist but dis is jus blatant disrespect for everyone who worked on da album n anyone who calls themselves a &quot;reviewer&quot; Its fine to hate kanye but dis is a mockery of everythin a reviewer is. <br>I used to think u were cool. At least as a reviewer give it a not good so u can feel kinda serious
Kanye is trash for trash people
Yeah it does kinda suck.
8.5/10 album, cry about it ü§£
8/10 for sexxy red but makes a 7 minute long video about how he cant review vultures<br>another video for the &quot;anthony fantano has no credibility about music&quot; folder!
what other artist fit in this category?
this devorced racist lost sleep thinking abt kanyeüòÇüòÇ
LLLLLLL
Calling out Kanye for being misogynistic (which he is) is a little strange since you not even 24 hours ago tweeted calling her ‚Äúa dollar general Kim k‚Äù
the album is good.. maybe you should unclog ur ears and listen with an open mind!
NUH UH IM NOT NIHILISTIC
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=146">2:26</a> <br>Whoa Melon. I get the hate against Kanye, but you can‚Äôt call the people who listen to him ‚Äúmeaningless‚Äù.
If only kanye named this album kids see vultures as well he would‚Äôve gotten a 10
The only songs bro even hated on are some of the best and most successful ones ü§£ü§£
eh i dont agree with your opinion on the music itself on the album but it&#39;s a well made video at least
I have a question can someone not listen to an album pick some songs they like (that aren&#39;t hateful) and enjoy them without completely immersing themselves into there community
Anthony crying when he learns Peggy produced songsüòÇ
I may be a Kanye fan, but dawg, this first drop is making me hopeless. I also think it&#39;s hard to separate the music from kanye since he writes about his personal morals and life happenings frequently in it. Unreviewable is a perfectly understandable assessment of this album.
Reminder: Fantano = JEWISH
Lol you have reviwed worst music buddy. If your not going to review the album just say it. But dont say the music is trash because its better than ALOT out there. Peace.
‚ÄúThe jew cries out in pain as he strikes you‚Äù
You make a lot of good points about Kanye and his fans. But I think the music is actually good? It really isn‚Äôt as bad as you‚Äôre making out
Last bias vultures review
Kanye might as well be the irl Uncle Ruckus at this point
crybaby
What soy does to a mf
Idk how this mf been sayin since the last seven months that he doesn&#39;t want to talk about Kanye and he ends making like 50 videos about Kanye
this was such a cool video but i didnt catch the part where u reviewed the music lmao
as a kanye fan, fantano is right this time
man i love kanye fans, with their same 5 comebacks, including such hits as &quot;seperate the art from the artist&quot;, &quot;ü§ì&quot; and my personal favourite, &quot;bro is a certified kanye hater&quot;. real thick skulls on these guys.
They album is a 1 or 2.
I like how you just generalized his entire fanbase into three specific groups that are all horribly described. This video sucks lmao
bro can‚Äôt admit he‚Äôs biased and just doesn‚Äôt like kanye
I&#39;m just here for the music, man.
Look at this mans face during the review, genuinely tweaking bruh lmao. Dude has completely lost it. Embarrassing.
Hope his association means melon will stop overrating Jpegmafia projects
Can‚Äôt stop playing carnival
you&#39;re just jealous he got peggy producing vultures üò¢
U bein a baby rn
Booo u suck boooooooo
ah good thing he‚Äôs not reviewing Kanye‚Äôs imageüòÆ‚Äçüí®
If this album was called &quot;To Pimp a Vulture&quot; you would&#39;ve given it a 10/10
What about the music
I wish YouTube still showed dislikes
Melon went in, damn
Dont care melon talk about the music
Goo bait
I had lost pretty much all faith in Kanye and even I can acknowledge this is a good record. Fantano washed

Internet&#39;s most biased music nerd.

Anthony Fantano, felted now and forever.
Bruh you‚Äôre not worth listening to if in an album rating video you talk about antisemitism for entire minutes lol
Jesus bro. If you hate the guy so much why even review it. Oh money‚Ä¶stand on morals, but as soon as there‚Äôs a check fuck that. Charmin soft.
Bro literally has the 1000 yard stare
Back to me is awful? I didnt realise i was too busy beautifulbuttnakedbigtittywomenjustdontfallouttheskyyaknow
Agree on your take on actual dumb Kanye cultists beinng beyond reasoning with and I say this a ex super diehard stan, but this video is a poor asf look from you as well and will bite you in the ass later tbh when you decide to actually review someone who has also done terrible things. I can see this easily becoming the new whataboutism of your entire catalogue.
I might be one of the cultish weirdosü§î
Well, thanks for sticking on your beliefs. I thing that there&#39;s people worst than Kanye that you end up reviewing their tracks, such as literal murderes who sang about killing people. But we&#39;re not here to brag about it. The album isn&#39;t close to bad, as far as I know your review I can project this feedback coming from you. Great album, thanks for being honest
Aburridooooooo
It would have been cool to hear your opinion on the actual music lol
‚ÄúI think Jews should be able to screw over artist without artist being able to call out who‚Äôs doing it‚Äù you could‚Äôve just said this and ended the video.
To be honest, I loved the album. I thought it was going to be trash, since it didn‚Äôt seem like Kanye was focused on anything. I enjoyed it. Specially STARS, Back to me, Beg forgiveness, and problematic. This doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with his rants last year.
bro just said having a muse is dehumanizing YOU ARE NOT A SERIOUS MUSIC REVIEWER
Wow my goat is really washed... And no I&#39;m not talking about Kanye
Just review the album jfc take a break if your hurt that bad
aplasticplant stray üò≠
Jesus Christ it doesn‚Äôt seem seem possible to be as soy as you are
Unsubbed, you‚Äôre too far gone man. You‚Äôre honestly psychotic for having that opinion, and calling everyone that enjoys this album delusional. I was expecting a 5-6. Dude needs to relax for real. You were doing the same thing years ago, supporting controversial views.
well of course it&#39;s unreviewable if you don&#39;t even review it? 90% of this video isn&#39;t about the music
seperate the art from the artist
I dont think is a coincidence that he is being &quot;antisemitic&quot; at the same time Israel is murdering millions of children in Palestine
what are you talking about bro ‚ò†Ô∏è
This dude is a physical embodiment of a virtue-signalling morally superior Redditor.
bro so mad
Why are you doing a review about not doing a review that&#39;s just stupid if you hate ye then don&#39;t post ye at all.
Bro turned into more of a political channel then a music review channel. No one cares just review the music
This would‚Äôve gotten a 10 if Fantano had a wife to love like Ye
Stop hating Kanye dude it‚Äôs cringe.
imo it&#39;s possible he keeps bianca from speaking her voice or from using his platform to gain notority but my guess is that she doesn&#39;t want to. i think that&#39;s fine people have their right to be in the public eye however much they want or dont want to so long as they aren&#39;t hurting anyone or thing. i liked &quot;sumn&quot;, &quot;carnival&quot;, &quot;paperwork&quot;, and &quot;back to me&quot; on this album. the songs dont sound stellar. they sound forgettable honeslty sometimes. i feel like he isnt adding kicks or hi hats or snares in places that could use them. he is still a musical marvel to me and inspiring for sure. this doesn&#39;t sound like his best album. vultures the song already sounded mid but it was fresh and new to say the least. im hoping he crammed these songs because he procrastinated and that v 2 o v3 will be legendary but yeah v 1 was lack luster for sure
It ain&#39;t that good, but it ain&#39;t that bad.
Unsubbed
But I bet you‚Äôre down to check out a bunch of controversial personalities like Morrissey, Kid Rock, Phil Spector, Mayhem, Viper, etc cause they‚Äôre not as big though? Ur a grown man having a meltdown over someone else‚Äôs lyrics u havent said much about the music. What about journalism or reviewing how the music itself may have suffered from the hate and controvery, you‚Äôre just telling us stuff we already know while sounding reeeally emotional lol
Let‚Äôs not sit here and act carnival wasn‚Äôt a banger tho
Kanye&#39;s rabid dogmatic fan base isn&#39;t too far off from Taylor&#39;s delusional worshippers; ironic isn&#39;t?
what does all this have to do with music?
Thank you for tightening the album cover so I don‚Äôt have to see all‚Ä¶that üëçüèº
Bro let his feelings get in the way of the musicüò≠üò≠üò≠ he hates Ye
üéâüéâüéâ
ü§ì‚òùÔ∏è
if this was called ‚Äúscaring the vultures‚Äù you would of gave it an 8
people are mad cause fantano is right and hes looking at the cultural impact hes had, rather than just listening to the music. the dude is a nazi. you have to factor that in.
Bro tryna hard something good so hard üò≠üò≠üò≠ just stick to music reviews but it‚Äôs your channel so do what you gotta do
I like how 90% of the comments are the exact people Melon is talking about, y‚Äôall literally fell right into it lmao.
It‚Äôs a messy album but it‚Äôs still decent 4 atleast
my main gripe with this review is the reaching for the camera at the end. shame fantano shame. doing the youtuber apology camera reach is so below you. other than that fair review
bro is a straight up hater by now
Unsubscribed you a sheep üò≠üò≠üò≠
who tf actually cares about this nerd‚Äôs opinion ??
fantano feels like when my dad say something racist
He could release literal shit and he fanboys would still defend (sh)it
I got &quot;Can&#39;t Tell Me Nothing&quot; in a music exchange over the summer and it was awful. I don&#39;t understand how anyone other than the nuts like him.
He thinks his opinion matters LOLLLLLLLLLLLL btw YE 2024
I actually really do enjoy Burn, Good (Don&#39;t Die), and Beg Forgiveness. Rest of the album is kinda mid. I can see those 3 songs being the headliners since they&#39;re actually good, but it&#39;s like scuba diving through sewage water to get to them. Listening to Hoodrat almost made me turn off the album right there, and King just left a bad taste in my mouth. Those few songs save the album for me personally, but I have to tune out the guy making it to think so. 100% the most controversial album Kanye will ever make that&#39;s for sure.
Art needs to be separated from the artist, otherwise we wouldn‚Äôt have any art. The most messed up people create the most beautiful things. From actors to painters and even money and we consume it cause it‚Äôs keeps the world moving.
Kanye made an album that melon hates more than tones and I‚Äôs welcome to the madhouse. Truly magnificent how Kanye keeps shifting the boundaries of music to this very day!
Excited to see what you think about &quot;unreviewable 2&quot;!
I 100% agree but I gotta say there&#39;s got to be a dm from kanye like the drake one soon
Just shave your head bro, you ain&#39;t keeping anything up there.
keep the tears going it&quot;s helping the sales lmaoo
You are in shambles üò≠üò≠üò≠
i love that the green screen is f&#39;ed up
bro is definitely a taylor swift fan
Mad Jew lol
This is sad
Fantano calling Kanye&#39;s wife a dollar store Kim after his wife left him this year. Rough
H**DRAT could be the worst song I‚Äôve heard this year (for some reason YouTube has an issue with the H word)
I already know this nga gonna hate üòÇ
Keep your head up Mr. Fantano, I respect your integrity and honesty even when the masses will hate you. ‚ÄúFanaticism is always a compensation for hidden doubt‚Äù CG Jung
King is exactly talking about people like Melon. Calling him all those things but he is still the KINGüëë
Is &quot;unreviewable&quot; Worse than 0 and not good?
The question is, why do we have to keep giving Kenye West a non critical platform, when there are so many brilliant artists out there that don&#39;t recieve a percent of Kanye&#39;s coverage whilst they don&#39;t use their artistry to implify anti-setimistm, bigotry and rightwing conspiracies
&#39;&#39;we will talk when we get home&#39;&#39; ahh review
Its not even bad, if Death Grips made it he&#39;d give it a ten
Personal feelings about Kanye aside, the album is just so BORING. Nothing new, just a regular rap album. Which isn‚Äôt so bad but when you compare it with the rest of his discography‚Ä¶.<br><br>Also something I‚Äôve seen left unsaid is how this man is pushing 50 and his song material is taken from the same cloth as rappers in their mid to late 20s.
If this was called &quot;To Pimp A Vulture&quot; he would give it a 10
Let‚Äôs be honest we knew this guy would say this. Free Palestine
Yo this mf said hes not reviewing it and then reviewed it anyway towards the end of the video üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Ye is the goat + your bald
Talk about the music!
This is the most soy thing I have ever seen
I truly believe the new kanye is a clone &amp; the Anti-Christ
unreviewable because its so damn good thanks melon for this amazing review 10/10
AND THE CROWN GOES MILD üî•
Honestly. I like the album. I give it a solid 7/10. It‚Äôs not his best work but it‚Äôs far from his worse! It‚Äôs def in his top 5 albums! Big L for Fantano for letting his emotions get in the way of a honest review.
This man is so shallow
To criticise people who are ‚Äòonly there for the music‚Äô is a very narrow-minded thing to say. Although I greatly respect your personal stance
hahahaa man youve reviewed dozens of rappers that are killers, beated theirs wives and some other fuckedup shi, i think you can be kinda objective like in any other of your videos and just review it, actually its not that hard, man, i get that you can draw some line or whatever on some things, but i dont really think its useful when you only talk over their music
Pretty sure Ty was singing from a stripper‚Äôs perspective in Paid
Anthony you&#39;re being unfair here, sparate the art from the artist come on now
It&#39;s not even just kanye fans who like the album. I&#39;ve seen plenty of people who like it who hate kanye.  Also, can people really trust your opinion when you reviewed multiple trash artists high. I get it. kanye sucks but stop acting like he can&#39;t make music. Take a break I think your divorce is getting to you. Music reviewing shouldn&#39;t be seven minutes talking in circles.
learn to have fun please
Ur stereotyping a fanbase the video not even the music. I‚Äôd say this video is non-credible garbage 1.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=424">7:04</a> min of hating that‚Äôs crazy üòÇ
Boycott Fantano
üò≠ü§£
this is the guy who thinks dark fantacy is a 5. Cant take bro seriously
You‚Äôre so pathetic lol.
Tbh this is embarassing
I tried listening to this due to morbid curiosity and i couldn&#39;t get through track one without feeling genuinely gross.
Interesting how fantano talks about how he can‚Äôt review it (understandably) but then reviews some songs he doesn‚Äôt like, and purposefully leaves out any positive aspect of the album, just a weird vibe of a video
are you stupid or what lil miga
‚ÄúUnreviewable‚Äù then goes on to review the music for a full section of the video. Just leave it at he‚Äôs a nazi and move the fuck on from this dillweed. Much more brilliant artists who are not nazis you could be posting about.
Melon has spoken out, but Cal Chuchesta seems awfully quiet about his opinion on this...
nah vultures solos
If you don&#39;t like Kanye anymore that&#39;s understandable but you&#39;re really going to do a whole livestream and twitter tirade to use this album dropping as an opportunity for moral grandstanding? Still using Kanye for engagement even though you hate him now. Weird
I just don‚Äôt think anyone is really forming their beliefs/opinions off of what kanye says. We all know he‚Äôs a nut job
This review reminds me a lot of a lot of recent reviews for games and movies by saying things like &quot;The fans of this are lonely angry men who&#39;s opinions don&#39;t matter and who are probably Nazis&quot; I understand the anger in this review from the perspective of a very obvious political/social bias but claiming &quot;the fans of this are lonely, angry (right wing) men&quot; and writing the entire album off as <br>&quot;not reviewable&quot; or not deserving of a score, sows so much more division in the cultural landscape. I understand you&#39;re very outspoken of your political beliefs and you very obviously skew very far towards one side in your reviews, I think its becoming increasingly obvious of your biases and not rating the music as &quot;MUSIC&quot; but instead what it politically/ socially seems to stand for, which in your very one sided mind one side is much more important. I think its important to see issues equally valid from both sides. Half the country isn&#39;t inherently evil if they disagree with you socially/ politically
Bro get all his views From videos hating
i mean i was a little underwhelmed by it but wowüòÇ
Fantano how about you just don‚Äôt review Kanye if you don‚Äôt like him so much bro holy crap
I agree absolute ai trash trying so hard to be arty
What about the fourth type of listener‚Ä¶ someone who likes Kanye‚Äôs music and doesn‚Äôt get involved with his online/real life antics, nor give a shit.
this might be the worst yt video oat
be fr dawg, stop trying to be different
If you hate Ye so much why did you listen to this album or feel the need to use his name for views on YouTube? You are a hippocrite.
It‚Äôs so inspiring to see someone give their HONEST opinion about something knowing they‚Äôll get death threats from shrimp d*** little boys and not have a care in the world. Keep it real bb girl‚úäüèΩ
Sukuna likes this album and that&#39;s all we need to know
All I&#39;ll say is you&#39;re doing a disservice to Ty by not mentioning his verse on Beg Forgiveness <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/m8MfY4jbFsWJhL0PyouA2Ak"></a>
Fantano needs to grow his hair out
This is why your wife left you
Big titted women just dont fall out of the sky you know...
and too why does Kanye get so much trouble for the things he says when there&#39;s thousands of rappers who promote violence in music and life. sometimes artists don&#39;t get treated fairly fr.
OK...FANTANO YOU THE KING.......
Your absolute worse video, I think it&#39;s time to take a break dude, your divorce has taken a toll on your mental health.
So you&#39;ll review rapists and murders but not someone with bad words and fucked up thinking? I&#39;ve been a subscriber for about 10 years now and I&#39;ve got to say this is disappointing putting politics in front of the music.
It‚Äôs sad Fantano‚Äôs words are lost on deaf ears. His message that he‚Äôs trying to put out here is truly powerful, and it‚Äôs really convincing. It made me think about the entire situation in a different light.
You aren‚Äôt woke, you‚Äôre just a loser
Fantano is such a goofy mf he thinks what he says is the golden standard lmaoo
I have hated Kanye for 20 years. He has been capable of this sociopathy from the get-go, and well, it&#39;s because he&#39;s clinically a sociopath.
you reviewed burzum tho
Lol these commenters are so cheesed about fantanos opinion. Bruh this is his job, if you don‚Äôt like what he‚Äôs saying don‚Äôt watch his videos. When has he ever given a fuck what his haters think. People are more mad that fantano doesn‚Äôt like Kanye than they are about Kanye not liking Jews üòÇ
the production on hoodrat literally sounds like a Tyler the creator or jpegmafia song, how are you gonna say it sounds like the worst song ever meanwhile if Tyler the creator made it you‚Äôd literally be throating him saying it‚Äôs a good track
And it‚Äôs not just a Kanye album it‚Äôs ty dolla as well and personally I thought he added a lot
I actually don&#39;t know if I am glad that I didn&#39;t like the album
According to Fantano if you like Kanyes music you are an idiot and cannot be normal
Okay white boy
carnival gas tho
Didnt you review a Burzum album?
lame ah boy this is the reason your wife left you üíÄüíÄ
Bro just review the album, get off your high horse man. Clearly normal people dont care about politics and just wants to listen to music.
fantano acting like kanyes fanbase has diminished to only mentally ill people when vultures 1 is the 10th biggest rap album ever on Spotify based on day 1 streams.
All I say melonhead, carnival is a banger üî•üî•
But you like and review Sexy Redd tho. You also were advocating for the vax. Political needle drop
This album is number 1 in Israel
This is why turning the tables are the best music reviewers on YouTube
Doesn‚Äôt sound like he‚Äôs reviewing it
this guy has turned into such a political clown it‚Äôs hilarious
The ragebaiting is crazy fantano take this shit down üòÇ
Ye the goat too bad
quit yappin
Can someone explain the reference line?
I&#39;ve always said that in your reviews you&#39;re a subjective person giving it&#39;s point of view and opinion over a piece of work being respectful and adding jokes in the middle time to time, but as you said that this is an unreviewable album, the most important reason (imo) is because you have said nothing but facts and true facts in this video, there&#39;s no &quot;oh yeah that&#39;s just his opinion&quot; that could ever take place in this situation, I really thank you for making this video and showing a lot of points that sometimes people like me struggle to show off
I want to state how much I appreciate you not putting his name in the title or description. Every time i see someone make a video about this guy, it feels like it&#39;s meant to be some massive hot clickbaity moment (which admittedly you have done with him before lol) and it&#39;s incredibly offputting, especially considering the gravity of the things he has said and continues to say. Personally, I&#39;ve been 100% checked out from what he has gong on ever since just before tlop was about to drop. Back then I was just annoyed at the shitty album rollout, but now I really think it&#39;s important that we don&#39;t give him any more oxygen at all. The limelight is what he runs on at this point, and <b>personally</b> i find it slightly irresponsible to try to make views or money off of his name or appearance. We gotta let the guy just fade away into a quiet goodnight, imo.
Please don&#39;t use the N word.  We prefer the term &quot;national socialist&quot;.
Welp. If Fantano won&#39;t review it, I will<br><br><br><br><br>It&#39;s a 10<br><br>You&#39;re welcome guys
most political video ive seen from fantano
Talk about the music you melon and not the person we don‚Äôt care bro
The divorce be hittin hard today huh melon?
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Leftist can‚Äôt comprehend the idea that people don‚Äôt think like him and just like the art. Hitler liked dogs. All dogs are evil.
Wompwomp
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=244">4:04</a> Can anyone explain to me what ‚ÄúJesus Christ, Hitler, Ye, third party, sponsor that‚Äù even means?
This isn&#39;t a review. This is personal attack. Fantano fell off.
Womp womp lil bro there were great songs on the album
I do not understand the point of this video it was just about how its pointless making the video just don&#39;t make it and like kanye , a nihilist, doesn&#39;t make you  a nihilist like liking the wolf Wall Street wouldn&#39;t despite bieng about nihilism
Bro gave ye an 8 and ksg a 10 but won‚Äôt review this üòÇ biased and bald
It&#39;s just an album bruh, no need to trauma dump fantano
wait who actually cares about this losers opinion anymore?
L
I only have listened to his first 3 albums and there fire but the things he says are weird
Ugh. You really are the anti-Samuel hydelberg.
FIRST KANYE 10???
I want to like kanye but this album is dogshit lmao
So are you gonna review the album or not
no way this melon man is for real.. Amazing album...
Fantano, just because you didn‚Äôt like the album, doesn‚Äôt mean you should go around saying you would go ‚ÄúDEFCON 3 on Jews‚Äù and That podcast you did with Alex Jones doesn‚Äôt help at all.
hi fantano, while i agree with you on almost every point made here, your comments about Bianca are weird as hell
&quot;yes, it&#39;s the nihilistic teenagers!&quot; bruh ain&#39;t no teenager listening to kanye lmao
Lol pressed leftist
Just get into the music jesus
kanye who?????????
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=5">0:05</a>-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=10">0:10</a> the perfect rhetorical question
Just review the ALBUM
This dude is a crybaby retawdüò≠
maybe stick to reviewing music instead of soapboxing about kanye&#39;s antisemitic comments when you have no issue complimenting works from killers, rapists, and pedophiles. your virtue signaling has ruined your content.
Look I agree abt the anti-semitic lyrics and arguing that those are songs are flawed because of them, but it‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre in every song of the album‚Ä¶for example Stars and Beg Forgiveness have none of that stuff
This ain‚Äôt even an album review, it‚Äôs a kanye politics and behavior review ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Un‚Ä¶..subscribed. This was the final straw in a long tirade of you acting like an overly emotional donkey‚Ä¶.nobody wants to hear your political opinions or idiotic uninformed hate filled takes. You clearly are no longer able to review music without bias so your reviews are no longer of any value.
bro scared to rate it so he decide with unreviewable video. we know melon actually like it but scared to rating it because people gonna say that melon antisimte too so yeah we know that.
YOU SUCK!!!!!!!!
washed
I dont get why call it unreviewable though, this video is basically a review and you could have just called it trash and said everything you said, seems like just bait for clicks. As far as the discussion about kanyes politics, while they are deplorable, you still review the work of artists that beat women, kill people, engage in gang activity and terrorize communities. Are we really saying having racist views is worse than literal violence? idk not tryna defend kanye in this but it just seems hypocritical
I respect your opinion but you are completely wrong. The music wasn‚Äôt bad. I understand you are mad about him and the stuff he says but that gives no means to<br> be biased and not even give a review. This is your job. You rely on us as the people. Start acting like it
Bruh you put out a video reacting to burn, Ye fans are dumb enough for you to make a profit off them ??
he keeps saying he‚Äôs being objective or giving a general assessment and I agree with everything he said but he could have talked about more songs there‚Äôs more than 3 like even saying more lowlights would have been better or some highlights like burn
Fantano supports the palestinian genocide CONFIRMED.
His ex wife was definitely a kanye fan
am i the only one who didn‚Äôt like the album
Yap yap yap
Tbh yall saying that he is mad af but I feel like he is spitting facts
Dude. You can have an opinion, but your activity on Twitter was pathetic. You‚Äôre a grown ass man. Touch grass. Call your therapist.
It‚Äôs not that bad broüò≠
Your best video in years. Glorious.
Based on this title it must be so good it&#39;s unreviewable

Bald Man‚Äôs Vulture review boutta have more dislikes than the 2018 YouTube rewind
Kanye making melon reconsider why he reviews music in the first place because of this album... Really Makes up for that MBDTF score. üòÇ
The fuck is happening in the comments
This guy is so upset about Kanye still doing well he‚Äôs pigeonholing any Kanye fan as a bunch of weirdos when he‚Äôs at number 1 in over 100 countries and the most listened to artist in the world right now lol
god dude you have become so unbearably pompous i cannot take it anymore
Fantano falling off
Burn is mad good
Anthony is so clearly just being a dick at this point to stick it to the fans. Hes so deluaional that hes just being extremely unfair. Guarantee he would have loved hoodrats production it it wasnt kanye. Its so sad to see this guys fall from grace
can you review yuno miles
Anthony Fantanostein?
Not even a minute in. Talking about antisemitism. This is a music review channel. Which should be unbiased about whatever the artist is doing, besides their art. The album is not that good and I am the first to say that. But when you start a music review with political comments that means that you have lost your integrity as a reviewer.
tbh it‚Äôs kanye‚Äôs worst album. don‚Äôt let recency bias trap you because we were so desperate for out fav artist to drop lol. 3 good songs (carnival, burn, fuk sum) maybe 4 this is no where near the as good as tlop mbdtf or even ye. play these songs wit you gf in the car and im she gon look at you weird bruh stop coping coming from a kanye fan
L melon
ya‚Äôll know this is just my opinion right?
Can‚Äôt wait until Kanye posts this on his instagram, it will be happening.
So your critique of the album is: &quot;i don&#39;t like it because kanye don&#39;t like jews&quot;?
4, people who just like his music. I don&#39;t defend him over the weird shit he&#39;s doing. All i know is that he is a physcho genius who produces quality music.
Hack
LOOK AT WHAT THAT DIVORCE DO

Fantano L
back to me is a  banger tho. best track on the album.
So basically this review was ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt review this album because I don‚Äôt like the person he is‚Äù
My man u rate by politcal views, not by the MUSIC. Ur an aboslute clown, mate.

reddit isn‚Äôt gonna like this one
Am I taking crazy pills or was the album just solid, not terrible or amazing. I feel like the vitriol Anthony espouses is disproportionate to the quality of the music, which I found to overall be fine.
Bro hasn&#39;t looked up what the majority of the billionaires in the world&#39;s heritage is as well as majority shareholders in blackrock, vanguard, things like that.
The fact that Kanye hasn&#39;t gotten a normal review score in the past two years is the most Kanye thing of all time.

Appreciate this Fantano you so real for this. Don‚Äôt let the haters tear you down.

4/10
Thank you Anthony! As a fellow NPC I dont know how to think for myself, so thank you for telling me with your music reviews!
He didnt say its not a 10
Dude made a video about everything but the album, this what happens when you can&#39;t separate the artist from the art.
You misunderstood almost all of the lines and straight up lied about kanye not apologizing. This is some next level hating right here üíÄ
You need to get laid ‚ò†Ô∏è
He did the same thing with alone at prom, we get it you don‚Äôt like the person
kanye was #1 in israel
This man has as much taste in music as he has hair.
maybe if it was called To Pimp a Vulture he would‚Äôve given it a 10
Surprised he gave it a 10 but that‚Äôs just his opinion I guess
The Album is fire bro. You‚Äôre to much in your feelings and deadass just a hater at this point ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
&quot;unreviewable&quot; because fantano needs a new scale since this one is off the charts (I didn&#39;t watch the video)
What was even the point of this video
Didn‚Äôt you give A Written Testimony by Jay Electronica a fair review?
Dawg most of those lyrics are pro Jew get the fuck out of here
If it was called Kids See Vultures he‚Äôd give it a 10 üòÇ
Ok but what about the music, Melon
bro ur js projecting hard as fuck atp ur suppose to review the album not talk abt his recent fuckeries and get those damn ears cleaned bc I know for sure we did not hear the same album with this ass rating u keep pulling out w
idk how people liked this album besdies maybe 3 songs, shit was so bad.
stop it melon you&#39;re scaring me
What twitter does to a person
after a certain thing that kanye did this dude just rates his projects with unjustified hate
Kanye is such a good producer he made his fans forget that lyrics are part of music
The fact that you read the the comment that stated that he separated the artist from the art and then stated he cant. like ur an absolute dum dum if you cant separate the art from the artist
if this album was called ‚Äúkids see vultures‚Äù it would‚Äôve been Reviewable.
Ur the worst Anthony
This is so funny. The album broke him for some reason üòÇ. Come on, it‚Äôs not that serious, Vultures is a 6 or 7/10, mixing is awful and Kanye has a few weak verses but overall it‚Äôs a solid album. This guy hates Kanye because of his crazy comments (rightly so) and hates a few other artists and can‚Äôt look at their work objectively as a result because he gets too nitpicky I feel like. Also, he never reviews trap albums or albums about drugs or sex highly anyway so I knew he‚Äôd hate this but this level of hate is just odd tbh
Blud would praise kendrick if kendrick said anything negative about jewish people
I‚Äôd say a 7 or 8 personally
Fantano just doesn‚Äôt like blacks
unsubscribable 1
He‚Äôs valid trust me jews ruined his life can‚Äôt blame him
would you rate this album a 10 if it was named to pimp the vultures
I think the album has insane production value on a lot of the songs. That said on my first listen i really only enjoyed 3. Problematic, lyrically is great im also a fan of the beat. Honorable mention for Carnival, i think that chant in the background is great musically and really works for the song, i dont like many of the verses though so its definitely a deaf listen for me lyrically. Vultures is great, start to finish and i really enjoy Talking, i love Ty&#39;s verse, i love the reflection on how hes raised his daughter and the obvious weight its carrying for him.  Ill give the album another listen sometime this week and update any songs i actually enjoy.  But this is my opinion.  Regarding Kanye and his life that i know little to nothing about, i have no opinion.
you‚Äòre lowkey fat tho
I actually respect what all Fantano is saying, because he clearly has put thought into this, and I‚Äôm not trying to undermine anything Kanye has said/done, but I just think the better approach would‚Äôve been to just not talk about it. And if pressed, just simply say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not reviewing/discussing anything related to Kanye West‚Äù. If you really want to DDoS Kanye, not talking about him is the best option. Is it going to happen? No, he is and will continue to be one of the biggest icons in music (he even stated in the video himself he knew he wasn‚Äôt going to be able to change anyone‚Äôs mind). But not talking about him at least doesn‚Äôt draw even more unwanted attention. <br>It is a tough spot for him I understand, given his previous enjoyment of the guy‚Äôs music, his popularity and attraction he receives from his millions of fans, revenue from videos with his name in the title, while also trying to hold true to his own values and morals. I know that situation would be tough for me to deal with if I were in his position. <br>Just my two cents.
mf is a music critic and can‚Äôt even review the music üò≠
Folks like Tom McDonald and The Autoblow guy say a bunch of wild racist stuff in their lyrics and we all clown them for it (rightly so). Kanye says a bunch of wild racist stuff in his lyrics and we‚Äôre supposed to separate the art from the artist because the production is good. The inconsistency in y‚Äôall‚Äôs views is nuts.
L for Fantano
Focus on the art.
You&#39;re a smart guy. I am sure you understand that &quot;unreviewable&quot; invites other people to review it for you or debate you on merit of such a statement. Just say you do not want to talk about the guy or his current fuckups. Unless, of course, you made this videos only for views and attention. Then kudos to you, I guess. <br> Would&#39;ve have said the above no matter who was this video was about. just fyi.
I never thought we&#39;d see the day we got a worse possible score than Not Good
Kanye has by far the most fascinating, yet tragic and sad character arc ever. How did the incredible funny, clever and likable artist that made The College Dropout, exactly 20 years ago, transformed into this... that i don&#39;t even know how to describe. Is it insanity and mental ilness? Or simply resentment and ego driven? It&#39;s probably both...<br>Anyways, the talk about separating the art from the artist in this case is bulshit, not only because it&#39;s inside the art, but also because every Kanye album is a clear reflection of the man he is at that point in time. And that&#39;s what makes him so unique. Few artists express themselves so openly and honestly like Kanye. But this is not the likable person that did the college trilogy and 808s anymore, nor is it the flawed but relatable individual of The Life of Pablo, Ye or Donda. And definitely not the majestic and power force behind Twisted Fantasy and Yeezus. This is an utterly unlikable and sometimes despicable character, with some clear mental and emotional disorders. Vultures 1 is just as unlikable and pathetic as he is now. He continues to be super sincere and genuine in his work, for better and for worse. And despite some good and interesting sonic moments,  the album leaves a bad taste in your mouth after listening to it. <br><br>Sorry for being so long in my analysis. I&#39;m just incredibly sad and i needed to lay it all out.
what do u think of the album being top 1 in israel then?
üß¢
red flannel were cooked before even watching the vid
preach, melon
Free Palestine
Melon wrong
This Mf so caught up in his liberal head and didn‚Äôt even go into this attempting to find the goods or interpret anything the right way. If he can‚Äôt accept there actually is just another group of fans that enjoy this Mf music then this Mf just part of the pick a side bandwagon. Maybe you should take a break from reviewing if Kanye‚Äôs presence is getting in your head this much buddy
This guy only reviews on party lines he supports all the liberal ratchet stuff but hates every right wing person what a ü§° this is music be bipartisan like seriously it‚Äôs so obvious he made a video called what the gop clowns listen to it‚Äôs not like half the libs aren‚Äôt clowns too keep music aside from politics
#1 rap album in Israel btw
bro its official he is bugging I will do the review for him<br>Vultures has a couple poorly mixed songs, hoodrat beat is good and so is carnival fix mixes and its a 8/10 <br>Fav songs: carnival, problematic, fuk sumn, stars, back 2 me<br><br>Least fav: talking, vultures, paid<br><br>y&#39;all know this is just my opinion, right?
If eminem dropped this album you&#39;d give it a 10
I don‚Äôt understand why y‚Äôall think Melon is breaking. He sounds very level-headed in this video in my opinion. <br>I will never support Kanye as a person, and I can‚Äôt say anything about his newest music, which I will never listen to (except for Talking/Once Again which I heard on a Brad Taste stream. Itwas pretty mid), but I won‚Äôt be surprised if it isn‚Äôt very good, especially with some of the lyrics Fantano showed.<br>Even with all of this, liking the album does NOT make you a bad person (unless if you support Kanye outside of his music). Everyone has different opinions, especially in music, so you keep you‚Äôre opinion, I‚Äôll continue to not listen to this album.
if you didnt like it you should have just done a normal review and given it a not good, or a 1 because making a video on why you wont review it while complaining about is kind of meaningless
the gayfishest of all gayfish
Y‚Äôknow, Idles is releasing a new album this week.<br><br>Random I know, but I can tell you without listening to Vultures that it‚Äôs gonna be better than this. Go listen to that when it drops.
Fantano Falling off from the bottom is insane tbh
My hot take is that this comment section is proving fantano right
So many Kanye fans coping in the comments üòÇ
bruh
There isn&#39;t a way to subjectively review the album as there isn&#39;t a way to &quot;seperate&quot; the artist from the music.  Kanye&#39;s fans align with dressing up like Jeffrey Dahmer for Halloween.  They are not to be understood because they aren&#39;t understandable.
PARASOCIAL CULT MEMBERS WHATS UP!?
Great point fantano not a lot of people give u credit for how dumb you are
Fuck this is too funny hahahaha
LMAO üò≠ bro so PC
youre so personally offended by this. you sound like youre about to cry.
So basically the third type of Kanye fans are meatriders
But you&#39;ll review <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=284">4:44</a>, and then give it an 8 even tho it riddled with anti semetic lyrics.
You are blind to a whole side of this, not that kanye is right, but the fact that the things he said before he started saying antisemitic stuff, when he was talking about the control over the music industry and media, was true, and we can see that in Israel vs Palestine, in the beginning the whole country was manipulated into seeing this as Israel being the victim, and further dividing us, and stuff like that being called out as antisemitic is ridiculous and just a way to cover for the small 5% of Jewish people who even have a say in this, you are not right to criticize on an issue that barely effects you, and you as a white person are in the same boat as these specific people are
Dawg your job/point of your channel is to talk about projects and rate them out of 10. This is just 7 min of ‚ÄúKanye‚Äôs a bad person, but look at me I‚Äôm a good person‚Äù. If you‚Äôre not actually going to review the album then why even make a video ffs
comment section literally proving his point
Bro spent 90% of the video going in on the fanbase and 10% of it reviewing the songs that are easy to single out and hate on.. kanye isnt making h*tler comments on ALL 16 songs bro, at least review the ones that dont have bars like that
Never thought i would agree with fantano but i do this time
my beautiful dark twisted melon
If he was a democrat this would be an 8
I personally thought it was trash. But art is art man.
I had a feeling that this would be the possible outcome of this review and tbh, while I thought a couple tracks were aight; I get it. He&#39;s a hateful asshole and there&#39;s no point in reviewing it.<br><br>On a less serious note, y&#39;all know that if this album was named To Pimp a Vulture, it would be a 10/10.
LOL
Why were you trying so hard to pretend that you didn‚Äôt like Carnival?
Has he ever seethed this much over an album before?
Internet&#39;s busiest hater
Pray for Israel üáÆüá±
Fantano the act is getting old in all honesty. Trying so hard to dislike mainstream stuff while praising Sexy Redd. Also insulting his wife is kinda low ngl. You lose credibility review by review
I agree with fantano on a lot of his points. It&#39;s really unfortunate that a guy who usually makes good music is also so egotistical that he would rather brag about still doing numbers after saying something objectively bad then apologize truthfully for it and move on with his career.
Yea ur a clown
i understand we can‚Äôt always separate an artist‚Äôs misdeeds from their music but a lot of this was just plain uncalled for. dissing the man wife and an entire religion was not it.
womp womp
The fact that this video is pissing off a lot of very stupid people is beautiful
Finally yall are seeing what a tweak and clown this fool is. L music take after L music take
I wish they showed dislikes
Did he ever say, ‚ÄúI love hitler.‚Äù You are a hack. Stfu and just review music. Leave your own politics out of it.
It‚Äôs impossible to critique the production or verses on their own merits, even if they‚Äôre bad respectively, because of how brazen his antisemitic statements are.
this guy has to be a jewish
Lil bro angry
Kanye West is a Nazi.
You‚Äôre not of value. Nobody would miss you
Wife-ium divorce-io, oops, my bad, Fantano, that sucks dude She cooks food, for me now
I‚Äôm a fan but this review was the most bias and emotional review I‚Äôve ever seen, thought bro was about to have a mental breakdown for a secüò≠
no fim vc ta certo ...
L take. Complete hater
If you put someone with bipolar disorder in a position where millions of people are agreeing with every word you say and handing you millions of dollars, you will end up with someone like this.
I agree, Kanye needs to get some help. Until further notice the album is unreviewable.<br><br>10/10
holy fuck you did not get the &quot;reference&quot; bar at all lol, you have got to be the only person who interpreted that way
says unreviewable and then continues to review it
As a black man  I must say this shit has to stop straight up I got bald headed white dude culture vulture that‚Äôs gone tell me what good hip hop is . Clown I‚Äôve been listening to hip hop for 45 years. You can‚Äôt tell me nothing hater. This is our thing you just a guest. Vultures 1 was Fire. Why do people listen to this hack
Took 2 millions subs to burn off my chain
Just say you&#39;re racist man, it&#39;s not that different
Im a kanye fan i do not belong in any of those categorys i will say i do not support everything he says but try and keep an open mind you dont have to love or hate everything about a celebrity
You‚Äôre soft
Just review the damn album
Would have gave ‚ÄúTo Pimp A Vulturefly‚Äù a 10/10
what is lil bro yappin aboutüò≠üò≠
This review has literally nothing to do with the music it‚Äôs just bias lmao
Anthony try to separate politics from music (impossible)
unwatchable 1
You got caught being a nazi years ago and you are still trying to shift the blame to Ye. Your anti Israel and support hamas. Your livelihood is gone. üáÆüá±
Kanye is my favorite artist of any time period, but even I can say this album was mediocre and directionless. I loved Donda so much but this is the &quot;Jesus is King&quot; of the 2020s. Shallow lyrics, weak flows, and hooks with almost no stickiness or replay value in my personal opinion. and Ty Dolly Signs writing style did nothing but make these claims worse.
Took 8 billions to burn off my chains üî•üî•üî•
DONT LET HIM COOKüîäüîäüî•üíØüíØüî•üó£Ô∏èüó£Ô∏è
It&#39;s time to get off the internet if you are going to these lengths of being bitter.
its so funny seeing mfs say they dont care about this guys opinion but everytime he posts they return and comment the same thing
bro really thinks we care about his political views
Don‚Äôt let this distract you from the fact that melon‚Äôs wife left him
Mrs.Fantano,  you need mental help
kanye is really bad at this point, but i like the music 8/10
Mental instability on full display here
I used to enjoy you more on omegle scaring ppl.
i feel this was a little unfair. i mean theres other artists who admit to doing way worse stuff than kanye in their lyrics and theyre already known for doing said stuff (not some shocking retroactive reveal) and fantano is willing to review their stuff. i think if fantano scrutinises all the artists he reviews as much as kanye here, he wouldn‚Äôt be able to review atleast a quarter of the stuff he reviews.
Gonna offer my view on this whole thing. Because I&#39;m glad you at the very least made a video addressing the seriousness of the shitty things YE has said and done in not only the past two years (but this shit goes back FAR). Some of the Ye stans are ruthless and have some serious tunnel vision.  <br><br> I HATE the shit Ye is saying and perpetuating. There‚Äôs no excuse for any white supremacist or nazi bullshit.¬†<br><br>I will say this, and I agree with you on the whole, &#39;There‚Äôs no separating the art from the artist&#39;  because there isn&#39;t. However, there‚Äôs still just listening to the damn music anyway whether it be curiosity, interest, or one&#39;s personal preference. To me, life is too short not to consume interesting art regardless of its creator. Idk, I‚Äôm past dissecting morality in entertainment which there is usually NONE. Ye is definitely not being smart about this, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs making some sort of thought provoking statement with all this nor do I think any of his collaborators do (or care given his stances). Like you said, he&#39;s just owning a dumpster fire at this point. Aaaaand Ty&#39;s just here to get paid lol  I just think there‚Äôs something to be said about inducing outrage because...well...it sells unfortunately. Especially when you‚Äôre at the level of someone like Ye. And he knows his fans will eat anything up. <br><br>In any case, I love ya melon and I always respect your thoughts as always &lt;3
I&#39;ve never wanted to listen to any &quot;music&quot; this individual has ever made. I didn&#39;t even bother to get to the end of this episode.
Left wing baldy
Your job is to review music. Didnt ask for a 7 min lecture. Stop crying and do ur jobüò≠üò≠üò≠
Melon stopped reviewing the music now
Unreviewable? You literally just reviewed it...
ur wife leaving you really hit hard huh‚Ä¶ üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
would‚Äôve been a 10 if it was called to pimp a vulture
I don‚Äôt think this was the best way to handle the situation, probably should‚Äôve just done a short very boring review cause all this does is create an unnecessary spectacle on a mid album of a very mentally ill man.
if it was calles To Pimp a Vulture youd give it a 10
WOW Anth14ony Fan88Tano! You&#39;re right, from the river to the sea. For real, bro really complaining about Anti-Semitism and sliding in them Palestine colors as often as possible. We see you.
That Jay and Silent Bob Sketch thing was the cringiest thing ever.
Well, you&#39;re the only one who feels this way. #1 in 71 countries, #2 in 23 countries. You&#39;re clearly taking this stance for notoriety and attention. That, or you&#39;re doubling down and owning the dumpster fire you started by saying Ye couldn&#39;t make good music anymore. You were wrong. Don&#39;t ever say you don&#39;t hate Kanye ever again.
o b s e s s e d
what happened to you fantano
It wouldve been a 10/10 if the album was called &quot;to pimp a vulture&quot;
OMG OMG OMG! I have seen this and watch this video with Wayans Smoke and Black Peter Griffin on YouTube and it was awesome! I love Kanye West but I liked him better when he doesn&#39;t support Hitler nor that he would be anti-semitic! I wish he supported Jews! üíî ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=93">1:33</a>, yeah, this shows that you don&#39;t know exactly what you are talking about<br>I get why you don&#39;t want to be involved... but saying his wife is like his sex slave is just... dumb
Yap yap yap
May the trauma not be noticed
kanye is genuinely the kinda guy everyone used to act like pewdiepie was. <br><br><br>and even then pewds came out of that after a couple incidents worse than kanye is while he&#39;s still doing it. i feel bad for kanye fans, man, even harry potter fans have it easier with their fandom
why don&#39;t we review the music?
best teeth in the game got the strongest spine too
Bro really is coping because of Kanye lol
Lol pander more
Music taste is subjective. You‚Äôre welcome!
His best album since T lop
NoThonyTakeTano here!
so are we not allowed to hate music by virtuous and good people? if you take this stupid ass &quot;you must consider kanye&#39;s personal life and words when judging his music and liking&quot; it and flip it on its axis it&#39;s a room temp IQ take. investing in this video before it gets taken down by melon (i don&#39;t like the album)
If the album title was To Pimp a Vultures 1, Anthony would&#39;ve gave it a scoring of 10x10/10
Very corny
go listen to sexyy redd
exactly the response Ye would&#39;ve wanted from this tard
ngl melon head you getting out of touch with music and 6 minutes of the video was straight yapping
You are hating hard üòÇ prob feel he is trolling you personally
I understand the blind hate, but don&#39;t lie this is not unreviewable. The fact that you talked about the album will make people go listen to it to see if it is actually unreviewable. Garbage is garbage but why that is still something reviewable. There are albums worst than this that you have reviewed. Just say you hate him and people will understand.
Never seen you this bitter.
It‚Äôs a bad album, but Kanye was right about the J*<b>**</b> elites‚Ä¶..
How bout just don&#39;t review it and stfu
L idiot af
Bro if you wanna virtue signal about not reviewing the album or platforming Kanye, don‚Äôt then proceed to do those exact same things within the same video!
you are officially not getting considered for album reviews anymore. All your opinions are biased and some are just flat out lies. You don&#39;t like vultures but you praise sexy red like ain&#39;t no way ur such a chump üíÄ
I wish i can post that dog witth the daredevil mask gif on here
if this album was named &quot;To Pimp A Vulture 1&quot; you would give it at least a review.
The irony is that this is the best possible review of Vultures melon couldve made. No bullshit or pandering to the cult fans, just brutal honestly and scathing critiques.
if only people cared about your opinion
If you didn&#39;t like it you could have just given it a low rating. I don&#39;t get all the hating you&#39;re trying to spread
I love this album and I don&#39;t understand how you can dislike it but I guess that&#39;s just how art works.
Jokes aside, you calling the album unreviewable is an incredible cop out i never thought you would actually do as a respected critic. honestly surprising. although i have yet to watch the entire ‚Äúreview‚Äù, based off the first few minutes and the lack of a rating in the description, it seems like you finally let all of kanye‚Äôs antics completely cloud your judgment over the music side of things. i understand the themes of some songs are not completely separate from his antics, but it really doesn‚Äôt effect the music imo.
&quot;Unreviewable&quot; still makes a video about it
Loser
If i wanted a review of the artist&#39;s personality Id have gone to Pitchfork
You gotta keep the same energy with other rappers. Hypocrite
I mean there were parts of some songs on the Album that sounded nice and well put together but even if you ignore kanyes personality and some of his lyrics it wasnt close to be being a good album as a whole especially compared to other kanye projects
I was hating at first for you being biased before watching, but then you reminded me of everything that went down. Yeah, I wouldn‚Äôt want to review this fucking guys music either.
My ears are closed like yours Anthony
i don‚Äôt like kanye, i like KanYe West. The real kanye who produced and made shit like college dropout, late registration, graduation, and my beautiful dark twisted fantasy. I don‚Äôt like what he‚Äôs made of himself now and it‚Äôs so sad to see. It‚Äôs not even easy to listen to his old works because of what he says now. Sad shift
cringe as fuck
thesneedledrop
Its Okay Y&#39;all Imma Review It Seriously And From A Non Biased Place.<br><br>Edit: You Forgot Black People. Anthony. Only White People And Black Liberals Cancelled Ye.
4. people who don‚Äôt gaf about you or anyone else being offended and just like good music
Fantano sent Kanye to his room
&gt; Can review gang bangers and domestic abusers, as well as people accused of SA, scamming, etc<br><br>&gt; Draws the line on a mentally ill guy who said bad things
so sexy reds album is better than this
As someone whos not a Kanye fan, this album was actually pretty decent<br><br>Its obviously not the best album of the year since its not even complete yet<br><br>But its good<br><br>Id give like a 8/10
Not to jump out there defending Kanye, hes been a disappointment in many ways and I definitely don&#39;t think he&#39;s anybody&#39;s savior or anything like that, but besides the Hitler thing (which is bad, so if it&#39;s just about that then I get it), what&#39;s a defamatory thing that he said about Jew-Ish people as a whole? I literally just googled Kanye attacking Jewish people in case I missed something, and all I find are people saying he&#39;s &quot;antisemitic&quot; and he&#39;s &quot;hurting so many people.&quot; Far as his actual words, you have to remove your brain from your skull not to understand that he was actually pulling back the curtain on a commonality among a lot of the people who control much of the entertainment industry and many aspects of our lives. I do feel like he&#39;s under some type of mind control (there are actual clues to that, calling it stupid without giving it consideration is you taking your brain out of your skull) and the &quot;powers that be&quot; are using him and his mental illness as tools to discredit things that are true, and the amount of people in media that play into that is concerning. You literally have to take your brain out of your skull to not understand that.
Marshawn Lynch reference‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
This album was so ass lmao
Yeah no I agree. Kanye has been fully consumed by his own pride. When I was listening to the album it just felt like it was made by a corn-addicted racist bigot. And that‚Äôs kind of what kanye has become now. It‚Äôs just ironic how he completely destroyed all of his character development over the past 4 albums with just this one. Terrible. Donda would not approve of this.
ive been having troubles explaining how i feel about kanye sense like i used to be in the second category of fans but but i started to realize how actually fucked up kanye is, this video pretty much summarizes exactly how i feel, thanks
Kanye was my fav artist for 10+ years until he courted nazis and anti-semitism (amongst other BS). Hit the nail on the head, Fantano.
Wtf is this liberal bastard talking about
bald
Lmao but he lowkey just reviewed it tho üòÇ
Loved the lack of the normal outro, class
Bro completely misinterpreted the reference line. He&#39;s saying like If you go to a hairdresser, nail tech or surgeon they use bianca as a reference photo. Ye has him in shambles rn.
What is Fantano yapping about
I rather watch the review than hearing the album
Are y‚Äôall crazy? Did u even listen to the album? It sucks
why dont u stick to reviewing the music and stop trying to politicize it.
Can‚Äôt wait for the follow up video where you review the music on the album üôè
can&#39;t take you seriously anymore
to those commenting this review is a &quot;meltdown&quot; or just making fun of him, i just gotta say you are missing the point reeal real hard. this man (kanye) built his image of a stupid monster saying the most harmful things to a group of people who definetly has had enough of that thoroughout history, and you watch this and go &quot;lol its so good he cant review it ü§£ü§£ü§£&quot;. i&#39;d love you to please read this and think for a second of how absurd it is that we&#39;re having to discuss hate speech of nazi level coming from one of the most famous people in the planet. it&#39;s so fucked up i&#39;m even commenting in this thjing full of apperently ignorant and allienated people, because yall will just refuse to hear this very necessary point from mr melon guy (thanks melon for the video). where are the people complaining abut the artist talking too much about politics now huh? yall scaring me a bit. please try to thing about this for a second, thanks.
Honestly I don&#39;t think Fantano proved his point by making this video, he should&#39;ve not made one at all to just prove how much of a nothing album this is. It&#39;s just more bullshit from a madman on decline, why bother with Kanye anymore like legit?
Very harsh review, I‚Äôm not a hip hop head, nor a Kanye fan. But if u don‚Äôt like burn or carnival then that sucks for you.<br>The production was amazing, lyrics weren‚Äôt good. Still a 7 on my books
The dude talking about Kanye liking hitler but he has a hitler stache lmfao
now i feel bad for liking the music.
ratiod
Barely even a review of the actual album just melon yapping about how bad Kanye is. At least review the album
Divorce really getting to ya huh melonhead?
Im the second group he lables ü§§
This guy is the classic example of someone who can‚Äôt separate politics from the art.
Your cmnt section is a cancer pit of brain rot as always
Show some respect to the man that made you famous
Back to Me, Burn, Good (Don&#39;t Die), Beg Forgiveness, &amp; Problematic are some of my favorite songs. Especially Don&#39;t Die, I love when he&#39;s earnest.
my favorite part was when kanye said &quot;its melon time&quot; and then Fantano&#39;d all over the review
Cry (vultures is decent)
Shut up before you get exiled.
Vultures was #1 album in Israel that shows a lot how Jews feel about him üòÇ. Ye is the üêê. Seems like it‚Äôs only Jews that live in America have a problem with Ye
Lyrically Kanye is bad, but the Vibes are there so its like a 5/6 outa 10 for me. Unreviewable is an  overstatement fr.
Actually crying on youtube
üòÇ not everyone who still listens to ye is a super ye dickrider. Regular people still listen‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
hasanabi of music ü§£
Fantano, of course it&#39;s okay to have an opinion. But can&#39;t one just like the art instead of the artist without being a &quot;nihilistic teenager&quot; or a &quot;parasocially obsessed cult member&quot;?<br><br>Agreed with what you said about hoodrat tho...
I don‚Äôt really fall under any of the categories I can just separate the artist from the music and enjoy the music
&quot;QUIT HAVING FUN!&quot;
i don&#39;t know what to expect from this comment section but god damn y&#39;all need to listen to this:<br>&quot;SAYING HE ACTUALLY THINKS IT&#39;S A 10 IF VULTURES STORE/TO BE VULTURES/TO PIMP A VULTURE/KIDS SEE VULTURES/YOU WON&#39;T GET VULTURES YOU WANT/VULTURES GET READY/SPINNING VULTURES IS FUCKING UNFUNNY AS SHIT&quot;<br>shut the fuck up everybody please I&#39;m following this channel since 2019 and it&#39;s the same fucking jokes every single time please just shut the fuck up
Wait, Kanye exists I thought he was myth üòÆ
This dude has full blown Kanye Derangement Syndrome
but he was kinda right look at Israel

Im 23 but reading those comments make me feel old haha
no one cares about what this egghead thinks in 2024 üíÄ
Look, I&#39;m an ex Kanye stan that jumped off after the antisemitism. I wouldn&#39;t call myself a fan of his anymore, not anywhere close. But I don&#39;t think we&#39;re doing anyone any favors by calling this album unreviewable. Donda 2 was unreviewable. This is a pretty solid album all things considered, esp in terms of production. Pretending like its not doesn&#39;t... do anything lol except I guess make oneself feel better about it? How many Burzum reviews do you have again? Varg is reviewable, eh? Where does this stop? Should you go back to the Daughters album and take away the 10 and make it unreviewable because the lead singer is probably a pos? Do I need to get into Michael Jackson? <br><br>Here&#39;s how to do what you seem flabbergasted by: &quot;The production on Burn is great. Ty Dolla Sign sounds amazing. Kanye&#39;s lyrics are very cringe, and here&#39;s why he&#39;s wrong and I disagree with him.&quot; even if that reasoning is &quot;Kanye, they call you antisemetic because you&#39;re acting like an antisemite&quot;. Like man, you&#39;re a professional reviewer, I know you know how to review something while condemning the ideas presented. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s in any way abandoning your jewish viewers to review something and give it a critique based on those issues.<br><br>This just feels like moral grandstanding. And again, I am in no way defending Kanye&#39;s views, he&#39;s an idiot, I am merely disappointed at my favorite reviewer jerking himself off about how socially aware he is instead of just reviewing the damn album.
This bald guy is part of the herd of sheep. He has no original thoughts at all, just follows what all other liberals think. Wake up already
head look like a nut
Wait so you&#39;re mad cause people just want to listen to his music?
the album green screen flickering in the background truly drives the point of it being unreviewable home
There&#39;s no world where Fantano would have given this a good review. Just admit that and spare us the rest, &quot;music critic&quot;
Im more interested in Melons take on the &#39;2 reasons for why reviews exist&#39; ... Arnt reviews fundamentally supposed to reflect how accurately an artist was able to bring a vision to life? How well they managed to execute this translation within their own medium?
Here we go more nazi talk
truly incredible how many people are writing shitty comments without even watching the video.<br><br>the only thing i disagree with is him saying jesus is king is unhinged and crappy.
Gives Sexy red an 8 üòÇ
First Fantano vid I ever disliked!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=277">4:37</a> i love how fantano censored the profile picture but it is so painfully obvious that it is blonde
I think you liked it melon. And I think you hate that you liked it.
i thought the point of your reviews was to simply just share your opinion on the music itself and not have the goal of changing other peoples own opinion on the music because not with just Kanye fans, there are fans of every artist who arent ever going to hear your opinion on anything so I dont get why its different in this case and you can separate the art from the music because you just shouldn&#39;t just critique the song on the lyrics because while yes that can be hard to separate from the artist, the beats. the productions, the features, the mixes, are all separate on their own and can be critiqued while separating the art from the artist.
Stop being such a baby holy crap dude cmon
Ngl Ye&#39;s biggest mistake was going after Jews. If he just went after Whites, hed be fine. Even then Jews love to use White supremacy until it starts affecting them. Especially when it comes to young black artists and atheletes. But at the same time you cant really call them out on the predatory systems they have in place because thats anti semetic even though in their own holy book, it quite literally tells them to stick together which is why so many black artist&#39;s lawyers are affiliated with the labels. Meaning that they just get double scammed. As Black man, he cant be racist to Jews who have appropriated White supremacy to oppress Black people from ownership of their own art. Also White and Jewish doctors have higher mortality rates on Black patients, thats another thing Ye has been vocal about. I dont understand how you can look at how Jews and White people oppress Black artists and not expect them to lash out. Ye already lashes out at White people on previous albumd and you were fine with it, I was fine with it. Now that he starts alligning himself with White supremacy just like the Jews did, now its a problem? Jews were happy to call themselves White when it came to Black people&#39;s treatment in society but somehow Black people doing the same is an issue.
oh so this is a video about Kanye&#39;s opinions and thoughts or his music? get a grip fantano.
What about all the really mysoginist rappers with mysoginist lyrics which you still review. You&#39;re inconsistent.
If it was called &quot;to pimp a vulture&quot; he would&#39;ve given it 10/10
for those only here looking for the rating: he thinks its more ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù than Donda 2 but more sloppy than JIK, but at the same time he feels its Ye‚Äôs worst album so far.<br><br>so atleast a 4/10 or lower (most likely lower).
Like half of hip hop at some point was into the whole Louis Farrakhan Black Supremacist antisemitism conspiracy bullshit and fantano didnt care but oh no Kanye does it. This has literally nothing to do with antisemitism and more so with fantanos personal feelings surrounding Kanye. Like he literally reviewed albums of people who legitimately murdered other people but this is where its &quot;too far&quot;. OK
Never seen a more immature comment section in my life. He‚Äôs right. And he would probably give the album a light 2 or sum
fantano must be jews üòÇüòÇ
On scale of 1-10 was this album better or worse than Kid Cudi&#39;s &quot;Speeding Bullet To Heaven&quot;? üòÇ
Kanye is a bad person I&#39;ve accepted it. I&#39;m just here for good music. Idk how you can say this is a bad album LOL
Womp womp cope harder egg head
Ye fans couldnt make it past the first 45 seconds of this video.
Wasn&#39;t expecting less from u Anthony ! U go girl
lol Anthony seems so salty can‚Äôt wait to see him quit Twitter again
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=326">5:26</a> Guys Melon smiled that means he liked Vultures 1 üéâü•≥
Let us all pray for the people of Palestinian falling victim to the apartheid Hitler-inspired Jewish hand. 28000 murdered- more than half of them woman and children.
If this album was called ‚ÄúTo Pimp A Vulture‚Äù he would‚Äôve given this a 10
Mf talk about the music
Fantano if it was called ‚Äòto pimp a vulture‚Äô it wouldve been a 10
I 100% agree with you Anthony on your thoughts about Ye. I haven‚Äôt been a fan of Kanyes recent work neither have I‚Äôve been a fan of him as a person. I don‚Äôt understand how that‚Äôs so hard for people to understand. All you have to do is watch and listen. I truly don‚Äôt understand how  anyone can think Vultures 1 is good.
Fantano would have been better off not speaking on the album at all. Unfortunately, he probably doesn&#39;t realize that the majority of hip hop rocks with Ye, and our own period, even if we think he&#39;s nutty. I like Fantano but his opinions on hip hop and Ye are irrelevant to how hip hop and Ye will continue to function. Most of us aren&#39;t snowflake cry babies and can actually listen to someone we disagree on some things with.
Fantano hit it right on the nail describing literally the only Kanye west fans left
He has officially lost his mind. Bro just wanted to hate it. If you don&#39;t want to review it, just don&#39;t make a video on it you troglodyte.<br><br>Also shut up the album is fire
U say this album is unreviewable but still gonna make a video so u can capitalize on the hype‚Ä¶ says alot about u
This music is fire tho. Burn? Problematic? Fuk sum? Cmon dog

Wow, I can&#39;t believe melon actually gave it a 10
giving this a 1 is a little ‚Äúon the nose‚Äù don‚Äôt you think?
If it was called ‚Äúhood hottest vultures‚Äù it would have gotten a 10/10
Dickeat per usual
I love how this video title has no mention of the artist or the album (aside from the description) and yet it still attracted sycophants to the rescue, because of course it did.
i agree, he is still rolling with Milo and other nazis, they can all pass
How the fuck does this dude still have a channel
kanye got fantano looking more centrist than ever
Lmao my guy you are so pressed
I&#39;m a Kanye fan and I believe that everything he has done is very shitty and horrible I hope he can stop doing all this stuff because I like his music I dont stan it to the point where I believe that he can never drop something bad for example I think the title track to vulutres is absolute garbage.
Why should people take your reviews seriously when your review of this album is ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like that other people like it‚Äù
Your opinion was very clearly decided before you listened to the music. Most biased music reviewer ever.
1/10 video i forgot to pay attention to it before i knew it. it was over thumbs down
I just have one question... why did you even listen to it? lol. You could of still made this video giving your reasons for not reviewing it without listening to the album. Not saying that anything you said in the video is wrong, I just find it weird that you listened to it being that you hate the guy so much.
It&#39;s more of a pop album , I&#39;ll give it a strong 5
Are you here to talk about the album or about his anti semitic views and his wife. Man talk about music and not about what you don&#39;t know
When does he actually start talking about the music?
i think melon missed the point of why we watch his videos. im a Kanye fan, id have preferred to see a well thought-out review of each track even of he doesn&#39;t like it not this low register SJW bull*<b>*</b> like he&#39;s almost about to have a fit üòÇ like brother in Christ if you end up being triggered like a woke karen  don&#39;t even listen to it but then again that doesn&#39;t pay the bills does it?? all im saying is you should give this at least a number even it was a zero not this unreviewable crap its reviewable you&#39;re just too much on that leftist cocaine to do it properly
Fantano used to be a legit reviewer now he‚Äôs all soft and dumb
If this was called &quot;hoods hottest vulture&quot; you would given it a 10
Even if we say &quot;We don&#39;t care as long as the album is good&quot; it would be irrelevant since the album isn&#39;t good. lol. Kanye has been the worst part of his own albums for a few years now. I wish he&#39;d just produce for other people full time.
It‚Äôs official, Kendrick has surpassed Kanye
Actual npc
Thanks melon for actually taking a stand. I feel like figures in hip hop have been too quiet about this. I mean besides Pusha T, who  has been very outspoken against it all, so shout out to him for that. But it&#39;s things like JPEGMAFIA, who wishes death upon someone like Morrissey in a song title lmao, just casually ignoring the antisemitism that really rubs me the wrong way. Like Ty Dolla $ign has never taken a stand against anything lol, but JPEGMAFIA is just being outright hypocritical.
Damn i said 6 on Sunday this is a new low üòÇüòÇ
Kanye bad guys, so I can‚Äôt review the greatest album of the year üò¢
Smh, I don‚Äôt even have to watch the video but I know you‚Äôre basing the music off Kanye personality that you don‚Äôt likeü§¶üèΩü§¶üèΩ based
Rare fantano L
Ok. I understand it. <br>But why do you talk about it. <br>I not hear his album got out. Tbh. <br><br>Just ignore him.
A bunch of hot air to say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a coward who still likes Kanye but gonna bash everyone who likes Kanye as a racist, teenager, or super Stan‚Äù none of things describe 90% of the Kanye fans I know. <br><br>Some of us are just mature enough to separate the art from the artist.
You could have just chosen not to review it, this was goofy.
there‚Äôs a 4th type of kanye fan. Enjoying his music without agreeing with his words or actions‚Ä¶ this is often the case with fans of rappers. Separating the art from the artist is an important part of music enjoying. I personally avoid listening to his music, for how bad the lyrics are, but you have to do it to an extent with most rappers. Each person draws their own line wherever they feel comfortable! I‚Äôm a Christian, so that affects where i draw my line, but I understand that everyone has a different opinion ab this.
How much longer until Kanye gets sectioned? Cuz, like, him literally shitting out nazi stuff isn‚Äôt something a normal, functional adult would do.
Im not gonna lie, i see a lot of the points that he talks about, especially Paid, like that is the one track i dont like, and i respect him for not reviewing the album, though he went into detail on some part.<br><br>For me, there was some stuff that i was like, why didnt he talk about this. Like my favorite song on there, which is burn. The beat is good, Ty did his part, Ye did his part, its a good song. <br><br>But another thing I have seen with this album is that only now people are bashing on it, not when it came out, not the day after, now. Is it his best work? Not even by a mile, was it worth the 57 days late? In my opinion no, but there were good songs on the album that I have been listening to. <br><br>The Album is like a 7.3 imo, has its misses, but its hits are up there and in my opinion, werent even talked about by Fantano.
&quot;I swear the artists personal views don&#39;t impact my reviews&quot;
rent due?
just because people are mature enough to see past the antisemitism doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re nihilistic teenagers. it makes you an emotionally underdeveloped grown man who is unable to enjoy the artistic impression of his life for the past year portrayed by the album. This video is mad cope
you talking political just review the music dab
This &quot;review&quot; is NOT GOOD
kanye should&#39;ve retired with donda
There&#39;s a real theme to the structure of some of these comments, you can be a bloody terrifying hivemind sometimes internet...
Fantano is an edgelord. Any man who likes Sexxy Redd is a deranged fool.
Fantano needs to eat a snickers. He‚Äôs not himself when he‚Äôs hungry.
Valid but I disagreeüëç
cringe
It‚Äôs somewhat ironic. Fantano had to release something cause a new Kanye album review is a guaranteed banger in terms of YouTube money. But, instead of just doing a normal review he posts this preachy trash. He is one of the eponymous ‚Äúvultures‚Äù Kanye is directly talking about on the album lol.
OR a nigga could just like an album. that simple
Alimony broke this man
Melon hates this tape so much, he doesn‚Äôt care how the green screen looks
This album is definitely not worse than JIK üòÇüòÇ
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=319">5:19</a> that was hilarious! hahahahahah
just not posting a video would‚Äôve been a better statement than whatever this is. if it‚Äôs unreviewable and not worth your time, don‚Äôt release a video about it.
Zionist fantano
im jewish and i love it
Starting a MUSIC review with the social issues surrounding the artist is so stupid and takes away from your credibility because now we‚Äôre gonna assume that the only reason you don‚Äôt like the album is because of your own personal views of the artist and social issues rather than just disliking the album because the music isn‚Äôt great. Bro does this with a lot of his reviews. Just cuz he doesn‚Äôt personally like the person or what they‚Äôve done.
MEL√ìN A MI NO SE ME.OLVIDA LA REVIEW DE PESTE NOIRE, HIP√ìCRITA.
Sooo 10/10?
As somebody who liked this album for what it was and genuinely enjoyed the musical ideas presented, I could not care less about whatever the hell Kanye is doing in his personal life, I don&#39;t think he&#39;s a good person and his hateful antisemitism is awful, his devolution into madness isn&#39;t all that interesting and no I don&#39;t Stan him or see him as a cult leader, so I think that description of &quot;his fans&quot; is really reductive and kinda pointless since there&#39;s people out there who genuinely like the music and also recognize Kanye is a crappy human being
The Kanye subreddit&#39;s malding hard over this one. The dickriding is crazy
Hahaha get fucked Fantano it&#39;s number one. Just came to laugh at the clown.
If your review for an album involves speaking about his past for a couple minutes then you arent listening to the music and just hating on the artist
LOVE THAT THIS REVIEW HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ACTUAL ALBUM!!!
A divide at the top: those that take him literally but not seriously vs. those that take him seriously but not literally. <br><br>Exhausting either way. Where is the nuance? <br><br>The people will vote however they deem fit regardless. üåçü´°
Ye always been my favorite rapper, gave me graduation as a first record at 10‚Ä¶‚Ä¶&amp; I don‚Äôt know if I can agree with Anthony any more.
you look lonely bro, whats going on
bruh it sucks to be you honestly
I‚Äôm not denying anything Kanye has ever said in the past, I personally like to believe that deep down his intentions are good but his executions are so atrocious.<br><br>That being said I genuinely believe that his album was not anti-semitic. When he says he‚Äôs crazy, bipolar and anti semite he‚Äôs literally just using the terms the media uses on him. He mentions the his stuff because he‚Äôs Kanye. He did it with Taylor and any other controversy he has partaken in. <br><br>This is the most biased fantano review ever, the album isn‚Äôt even bad, but if I had to rank it then it would definitely be near the bottom.
i just realized this album was shadow dropped
Loser
Political 1
Also didnt fantano review a burzum album awhile ago? Was it his intention to endorse it?
first time watchin this guy, are the rest of his vids like this?üòÇ he seems chronically online
What did you think of fuck sumn though melon<br>I actually thought that was a good song, same with burn
This video was unreviewable and unedited...
Your best take of all time
Yeah the album isn‚Äôt great, but separate art from artist. I thought you were an advocate for that.
But are the beats good?
Hey, how bout you do what you are supposed to do here boy. Review the album.
Oh yes I‚Äôm the third type of kanye fan!
lol this was such a cop out fantano
this is terrible news for that one loud kid in class that everyone hated because he wanted everyones attention
Katt Williams was right.
As a Jewish man and a Kanye fan the album is good, I‚Äôve been given many amazing artists by melon and I‚Äôm grateful as hell. This is unfortunately another MBDTW moment not as severe. And with the nazi shit I take whatever ye says with a grain of salt, he has apologised and overall I don‚Äôt really care what he says because I know that he doesn‚Äôt pose any threat to the Jewish people and is true and happy in his soul and I can only admire that
How was JIK unhinged? He basically just talked about his faith and family there...
melon, pls just enjoy the music
I understand him rejecting review this project, but &quot;3 types of kanye fan base&quot;?? this is the strangest thing that fantano did. He is exceeding his authority. He is music critic, not a fanbase critic.
we get it melon man u have no taste
All this shows me is that you don‚Äôt separate art from the artist. Album sucks but it‚Äôs not un reviewable
if it was sexy redd&#39;s vultures it will be a strong 9
This is kind of pathetic
if Hoodrat was chanted by Sexyy Red you would eat that shit up
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=334">5:34</a> anthony you can&#39;t say that :0
if you hate kanye as person just stop speaking or making content of him it‚Äôs obvious you have a bias by making half the vid not even about the damn album melonhead you just thirsty for money and kanye‚Äôs a great way for you to get traction on your channel
Yeah this album is really bad. I don&#39;t think it was even mixed at all, hot garbage
If Kanye were white then melon would&#39;ve given it a reviewable/10
His wife is an art reference to artist paul lorenzi artwork from the 60s of beautiful big titty women
Idgaf as long as the music is good
Divorced
based
I probably fit into the nihilistic teenager category of Kanye &quot;fans&quot; at this point (someone who doesn&#39;t boycott it/ enjoys it is more accurate), but I didn&#39;t find the lyrics to be antisemitic. He talks about how people call him antisemitic but that isn&#39;t antisemitic itself. Some of the songs are good as well like the opener STARS. If I had a brand and image to protect that was directly tied to my livelihood I would protect it in the same way as Anthony so I understand saying this is unreviewable, but saying you have to be willfully ignorant to enjoy the album is a pretty gross misrepresentation of the actual content within in it (beyond subjective opinion of how the music sounds). I could be forgetting lyrics that were hateful but I don&#39;t remember anything in particular
if it was called &quot;hood hottest vulture&quot; it woud be an 10/10
How can you call yourself a music critic and post something like this. It‚Äôs certainly not even close to his worst album, and he‚Äôs letting his (completely valid) personal dislike of Kanye get in the way of actually listening to the music
Hello to all the Kanye fans in the comments. This is a reminder to take your crazy meds and finish your homework before nappy time
is this comment section full of Kanye on different accounts? so much salt
The angry army in that comment section lmao... wtf is wrong with you. Desperately trying to cancel anthony.
I‚Äôm gay
wow isn&#39;t it supposed to be about music? not politics??
Kanye fans just as bad as Taylor swift fans yall annoying asf
BRO WTF IS THIS
W FANTANO
FANTANO DOESN‚ÄôT CARE ABOUT WHITE MEN
Your job is to review the musical content Anthony. I get it some of the bars are wack and I absolutely don‚Äôt agree with most of what Ye‚Äôs been doing, saying the last 2 years, but the album itself is actually good and way better than the likes of JIK. It‚Äôs not close to his best but to get this kind of album from him in 24 is pretty nice. Most of the people actually like the record (not just Kanye stans). I feel like this album is your worst nightmare üòÇ
Shut up before you get exiled
Would give the record a light to decent 6. Got great records and bad and mid but I say slightly better than average
SNEEED
Begin: calls the album is unreviewable trash.<br>End: reviews the album
We all have to pick a hill to die on
Thanks Obama
This album is reviewable. He just doesn‚Äôt wanna review an album by a nazi which is fine. But acting like everything about this album is shit cuz you don‚Äôt like the person is weird. There are lines addressing the stuff. You would complain if there were no lines addressing this shit. But it‚Äôs not like that‚Äôs what this album is about and you‚Äôre trying very hard to make it seem as if this is just a album where ye just screams ‚Äúdeath to Jews‚Äù for every song. Also very shameless for going after his wife. Acting as if any of this stuff is happening without her consent. Idk wanna mention your divorce but it‚Äôs hard not to when you talk like this. Like Jesus Christ you barely talk about the actual album. Imagine crying about toxicity when you act like sexy redd is any close to this. Absolutely pathetic. Twitter owns you
When does he start talking about the album?
Hood hottest princess better than vultures confirmed by Fantano
biggest ye hater ever, bro pushing 40 and still acting like a petty fucktard simpleton
glazing tf out of kanye album lowkey ass
L take, 5/10
You review hiphop music which is mostly about people of colors self hate for people of color ..but you draw the line at people of color having hate for others ?? So killing people that look like you is okay if you‚Äôre a person of color but you must beg for forgiveness if you talk about the gate keepers? please make that make sense ? Not defending if the music is good or not, that‚Äôs your opinion but thinking someone must beg for forgiveness is the delusion here when you champion music about people of color hating themselves
you‚Äôre so obsesssed
Melon‚Äôs entitled to his opinion as always but I think he‚Äôs coming off far more annoyed at the antics that come w Kanye rather than his project itself. I mean worst than JIK? He can call Vultures bad but let‚Äôs be real here
Dog ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇ
Butthurt woke Anthony Fantanowitz
Go cry about it fantano it‚Äôs a great record.
Not that deep lmfao
You really need a real job
Anthony you can‚Äôt just say hoodrat hoodrat hoodrat over and over and call that a review!
Going on political rant I wonder who that sounds like?
Album so good he can‚Äôt even get to the point to rate it so he just decided to make it as ‚Äúunreviewable‚Äù üò≠‚ò†Ô∏èüôèüèª
L
What do you think about still listening to his older music that doesn&#39;t contain these current messages
8/10!
Why even bother posting anything.
Didn‚Äôt even take the momento to elaborate on songs like Burn or Keys to my life , you just shouldn‚Äôt even have reviewed it period, u just talked smack
You‚Äôre a troglodyte fantano
Bro, maybe it‚Äôs you?
Biggest W I&#39;ve ever seen from Fantano and I disagree with the MBDTF review heavily. It&#39;s not that I dont like kanye&#39;s music, it&#39;s that  this album is objectively terrible, makes anti-Semitic comments, and also kanye is just digging deeper and deeper. You cant seperate the &quot;art&quot; from the artist when the artist literally is the &quot;art&quot;
fantano is such a loser.
i just like his music and would love to have a conversation about him and this record, theres more then 3 types with all due respect. Him being antisemitic is not okay though i dont support that because duh
I give this review a 10/10. Fvck Kanye!
Holy shit
Do you still listen to Michael Jackson ?
It was good to see a Nick Fuentes cameo
fantano not only having the worst opinions in music but also politics isn&#39;t surprising. You&#39;ll never be happy
GOONS skip to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=304">5:04</a> for review üòÄ
Why did melon make a video about how vultures is unreviewable and then proceeds to review the album tracks in the video? Is he stupid?
just stick to sexy red bro let us have some fun üò≠üò≠
White people who are into punk hit a fucking wall at 30 when it comes to any sort of thought process or having ideals
Just review the music melon
Bro didn‚Äôt even say anything bad about the music
Man never have I been so disappointed in Meltdown Melon üò¢
Maybe we just like the music because he‚Äôs good at making the music?
Fantano really be takin it personally
Who gon tell him that Vultures is number 1 in Israel ü§≠ü§≠ü§≠
I CANT JUST BE A LISTENER IN 2024 ??? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=188">3:08</a>
Awesome Anthony! Dissing people who like music. Should I call you a rapist for giving Daughters a 10? I hope those brownie points help you sleep at night. üòò
Fantano balding looking like a real life crying soyjak
you fell off so hard dude, wouldn‚Äôt expect better from a loser who gave mbdtf a 6/10. you‚Äôre a critic, you never made real art and you never will that‚Äôs why you talk down on black artists consistently for damn near a decade. you don‚Äôt rate these albums off the content of the albums but more based if you like a certain artist or not. whatever happened to seperating the artist from the art this is the absolute opposite of it.
Most of you younger Zoomers might not be aware of this, but Melon basically built his whole career off of being 4chan music board‚Äôs lapdog and he used to platform(lmao) edgy online people that has said way worse than what Ye has said in recent lyrics. He was perfectly fine about it back then, until he got pressed by Fader and saw that being edgy &amp; online was no longer financially feasable on YouTube, not because he didn‚Äôt ‚Äúgrow up as a person‚Äù (he was already a grown ass man back in the day btw).<br>If we judged him the same way he‚Äôs judging Ye, then it‚Äôd be more than right and not two-sided at all to stop watching his reviews/unsubscribe/etc.
womp womp 10/10 album
Y‚Äôall actually smoking crack if you think this album has the same level of quality as a Yeezus or MBDTF or Graduation let alone beating it.
How you gonna say an album is unlistenable and then tell us how bad the songs are? Did you listen to this ‚Äúunlistenable‚Äù album
4/10 for me. I liked paperwork, fuk sumn, and carnival, but unlikely to return to it. Obviously I&#39;m not cool with the hate ye spreads but I&#39;ll still give a listen to whatever he drops. And occasionally bump some of his old pre-JIK shit
99% of what ye did in the past 1% the actual album. bro ppl come to u for music reviews not political stances / opinions on what someone did üò≠
u scared bro? scared that people are waking up?
i guess you can say i&#39;m a nihilist teen, who has nothing going in life, even though i&#39;m 21 years old, but my point is, i&#39;ve never listened to kanye seriously before because I didn&#39;t get into rap till late 2016. i heard everything that came out after that and didn&#39;t think much of it. I wouldn&#39;t flat out say i&#39;m a nihilist, but more of an existential nihilist. so i try to find my own meaning in art. recently i&#39;ve been struggling with self esteem and a break up with someone who i shared 5 years of my life with, and they&#39;re dating someone new. it&#39;s been long enough that i finally feel like i&#39;m making progress and moving on, and i guess i like kanye&#39;s confidence in this album and i can relate when they&#39;re singing all heartbroken and stuff. that track with chris brown got me in my feels. i&#39;m sure there is better heartbroken kanye in his past work, and i&#39;m not meat riding rn because i will cringe and skip tracks like King, paid, and hoodrat, but i cant say there isnt something here that is good. like i said i like the confidence and the self esteem boost i get while listening. also they played talking at the club in miami and everyone was going crazy. they don&#39;t care bout none of that out here ig, but me and my friends thought it was funny. (i do not agree with kanyes takes btw).
Why are you so angry?
ur such a little sussy liberal boy
Kanye is racist we all know. Melon is so emotional he could hardly do his job and talk about the music. Melon L.
How do you know she has no personality?
lol cry harder
You took this shie too serius
Wokethany gaytano
Why arnt u reviewing the actual music though ?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=280">4:40</a> - why DOES this person need to listen to anything YOU or OTHERS about Kanye? Do you think you have some weird moral authority on what people should think?<br>This isn&#39;t even about Kanye, fuck that antisemite - but you&#39;re mental bro.
if his politics and beliefs are too problematic wouldn&#39;t you scratch your head knowing he still pulls the features he does. I wonder why? This sounds more like the rhetoric you spew has put you in a corner of which it would go against your brand so your only option is to have it as unreviewable. But if you actually heard this work which I&#39;m sure you did it would probably be highly rated which would also go against your narrative. Don&#39;t worry we know. ‚Äúnobody puts baby in the corner‚Äù
i love how fantano criticizes kanye of being ignorant, but then proceeds to doing the exact same thing himself in this video. good job üëè
I guess this is not a ‚Äúreview‚Äù but this should not even include the fan base and your personal trolls that hate u on Twitter. This seems like your hurt ego influencing your consumption of the media. Cringe fans that berate you usually never effected your scores / review.  imo
This is Anthony‚Äôs inner racist response to being left by his wife but directed at Kanye.
I see this as a big win. Kanye‚Äôs the one and only person who can break this moron. üíÄ
If you think everyone is delusional, then you‚Äôre the delusional one.
I don‚Äôt know if you remember me. I doxxed you (didn‚Äôt release publicly) and texted you about 10 years ago. You respectfully asked that I never text you again, and you promised to review an album of my suggestion when I complied. We went back and forth over email a few times I‚Äôll try to find it. I‚Äôm cashing in on that, Anthony. You owe me, my dude. This is my 1. I want an unbiased review<br><br>I don‚Äôt like his antics either, I think he fell off before TLOP. I still enjoy a lot of his music even if it‚Äôs not up to his normal standard.It‚Äôs not even just about his music, we waited for your Yeezus review for a min and looked forward to it. It‚Äôs a whole experience, a tradition at this point. ‚ÄúDamn Kanye dropped an album??? Wonder what Anthony has to say‚Äù
This is too good üíÄüíÄ
awesome review if you dont like it ik i will
top 10 worst videos on youtube
only kanye is capable of making his own tier
Been checked out of Kanye stuff for a couple years (recent albums sucked) but this is probably the best return to form he could have made after some recent crap. If this was a Ty solo project I can&#39;t help but feel this would have been a totally different review. Not trying to go to bat for him but its funny that the total length of Kanye&#39;s &quot;naughty&quot; comments were about half the length of this video and get headlines, youtube docs, and think pieces published for months while he goes back to working on the album.
Damn. Hated it so much that he only mentioned the track with Gibbs.<br><br>But‚Ä¶I get it. I do.
you gave MBDTF a 6. nobody cares about your opinion
Huge Disappointing L from the Melon. At least with his other albums you disliked you made some good points that made me see another perspective. This is just a biased personal attack not based on music
u sound almost as crazy as kanye rn
HAHAHAHAHAHHA reviews are irrelevant we all have ACCESS without you talentless trolls.
A substantive chapter on racism ought to be dedicated to ‚Äúwhite liberals‚Äù ‚Ä¶  Jordan Peele‚Äôs ‚ÄúGet Out‚Äù could be referenced ‚Ä¶  my 2 kobo. To each their own ‚Ä¶‚úåüèøü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Has fantano forgotten that he reviews rappers that have literally killed multiple people and brag about it in their lyrics. But this is where he draws the line?
I actually thought you were going to review the album not kanye. Rename the first 4minutes 10seconda of the video as a kanye review.<br><br>We came for the music review not the kanye review
Yes, this is your opinion, which sucks
lol if I‚Äôm a nihilistic ignorant worthless piece of crap for enjoying the album slightly then so be it
This is probably the worst fantano review I&#39;ve ever seen, he&#39;s not even being objective anymore, he just let his hate cloud his judgment bruh
They cloned Kanye, theirs no way Kanye Went from donda to this boring piece of ass ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Bro you forgot to review the other 14 songs, I m not crazy for the album or kanye, that be clear.<br><br>I only got more atracted to the record after hearing that peggy is on it, and the songs he has production on are great. Why you didn&#39; t yalk about them? I was interested on whats your opinion on those songs.
Speaking facts, Anthony. It&#39;s shocking to see how many fans Kanye still has at this point.
I thought Kanye was the one who was hateful Melon?
thank you anthony fantano for giving this a strong   to a light   ! i thought this album was                                    !
YouTube got rid of the downvote for this moment
It would be decent of Fantano to try and give a honest review of the project for the sake of Ty dollar sign who is getting the biggest look of his career from this album and the other artist featured on the album like Rich the Kid who many thought career was over, Or just not review the album at all,  I ln stead of what i saw him do with this albums tracklist , I lost all respect for this reviewer and i can&#39;t trust him, he does not have the ability to have non biased reviews about music,  I know he doesen&#39;t like Kanye as a person he has made that clear,  He should have listened to the tracks gave critiques on what he liked and what he didn&#39;t like, At least then i would have respected him as a music reviewer,  Instead he just went on this  Childish tirade that makes him look just as silly to me as kanye west does to him, Never watching another review again!!!!!!!!
Bro is fearless
Kanye could legitimately fart into the mic, uninterrupted for several minutes and his cult would call it peak. I&#39;m legitimately floored by his remaining fandom at this point lol It&#39;s gone far beyond &quot;He made graduation&quot; at this point. They see him as some servant auteur type when really he&#39;s just off his meds
Now I hate to be that guy, I thought the album was mid, but Fantanos would eat this shit up if SexyyRed made it LMAO
I have a simple rule that has never let me down: I don‚Äôt rock with n*zis
I‚Äôve got a lot of respect for Fantano (mostly for showing me lingua ignota), but this is a brain dead take imo. You can‚Äôt tell me Fuk Sumn or Carnival don‚Äôt get your bald head bobbing. If it‚Äôs unreviewable for giving attention to an antisemite don‚Äôt take the half measure of dropping this. Great video Melon
If it was called &quot;kids see vutlures&quot; it would be a 10
Fantano you love Kanye so much that you have created two new scores for him (Donda 2 and this one)
I always support &quot;separating the art from the artist&quot; but the guy literally raps about the things that we&#39;re supposed to be separating from the art
If the album was called ‚ÄúKids see vultures‚Äù he would have gave it a 10
Your wife left you
Hate to say it, but I was far more excited for the review of this record than the record itself. the album kind of blew and was edgy and lazy, I was really unimpressed, glad Fantano hated it too. It&#39;s one of the few times he and I agree.
Listen i totally understand why you‚Äôd be upset about the things ye has said. but id rather you not review this album at all because you‚Äôre clearly saying everything out of frustration and not real analysis no matter how much you may say thats not true its so obvious. not to mention you literally only reviewed like 3 of the songs off it which tells me even tho the others probably sounded good to you, you just didn‚Äôt want to say anything positive. Also by your logic in this video, ig that means you can no longer be a jpeg mafia fan seeing that he played a big role in this album and produced a lot of the songs you claim to be bad.
shutup baldy baldy boy
Bro review Graydons family photo album
bro got butthurt üòÇ
Dude stfu you&#39;ve reviewed albums made by worse human beings and gave them a score (even really good ones), just actually talk about the album
Kanye is a clown. One song singing about Jesus and the next one he is talking about sucking a d. He just knows that there are not a lot of artists that make a little bit more right-winged songs and that these people are going to protect him and give him better notes because there is no alternative.
decent 8
I didn‚Äôt like the album but Freddie got to give it like a 0.1 or something at least
The cracks in his agenda is showing .Music is music there plenty of people he has reviewed that are terrible people .
Fantano the saint out here lmaooooo
Bro this is so LAME üòÇ
Amen Melon, Amen.
Is Kanye getting to you?
bro you not better your past is racist there‚Äôs a literal video of you saying a racial slur
Shut the fup and enjoy the greatness.
Bro is OBSESSED with kim k<br>She&#39;ll never get with you bro
sounds like a taylor swift fan
the album isnt even that bad its like a 5.5/10
This is the definition of when you ask liberals for their opinion on music ü§£ü§£ü§£<br><br>‚ÄúUm akshully‚Äù then rant for 8 minutes.
why does every kanye fan have to think he can do no wrong wth üò≠
i actually think this is fair of fantano, he doesn‚Äôt want to platform kanye. yea he sounds emotionally charged here but for good reason. we dont have to deal with insane kanye fans on his level. he was already dealing with them, i cant imagine it got any better. <br><br>kanye has ruined his reputation forever, its very frustrating especially seeing how big of a role model he really was to so many people. and the impact he had on music. its disappointing and disgusting.
I understand what you‚Äôre saying bro but this is flat out stupid. You‚Äôre categorizing all of us fans based on your assumptions and stereotypes of how we feel about Kanye‚Äôs personality and you wrote off a completely valid point about separating the art from the artists because of 3 lines where he mentions the controversy. It‚Äôs very disappointing to me and probably a lot of people who were looking forward to hearing your review on this album. This is music, not Kanye‚Äôs or our personal lives. It‚Äôs not that deep bro
Bro thinks he&#39;s him in the thumbnail.
Childish Fantano
You know you‚Äôre down bad when your average Pitchfork review is more coherent and less whiny and dumb<br><br>Jesus dude nobody cares about your political opinions, just review the actual music and shut the fuck up
Taking up sooo much real estate in his head..
What is your talent exactly?
YE BREAKING BARRIERS
I&#39;m confused because you reviewed the song Talking on your weekly track roundup, putting it in &quot;meh&quot;, but here you&#39;re saying you can&#39;t review any of it. How come you could review the song but not the album?
It‚Äôs good and you like it
this guys getting absolutely cooked on twitter for these takes
pathetic you&#39;re this butthurt about a fucking album lmao
If this was called Vulture Get Ready, you would‚Äôve given it a listenable 10/10
Kanye Defender: Listen, Kanye has mental illness. It&#39;s something he&#39;s struggling with and people don&#39;t realize they&#39;re seeing a man&#39;s internal battle being put on display for public scrutiny.<br><br>Kanye: &quot;Genocide is dope, end all the jews. Trump equals god, mental illness is fake news&quot;<br><br>That same Kanye Defender: OMG fam Kanye did it again this album is FIREEEEEEEEE  omg his lyrics DONT BELIEVE THE HATE Y&#39;all üî•üî•üî•üî•
Kanye is right about the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=75">1:15</a> tho
But Kanye just meant that he loves all people /s
Listen up, guys. White boy is telling us why thing is bad!
This the typa dude to pick n choose who not to listen to b/c he has an ego. Newsflash, ur parents and probably urself have listened to disgusting human beings who‚Äôs raped, murdered, abused, etc, but u still supported them. Music industry is full of weirdos and ur not doing anyone a favor by taking a stand here.
if jpeg dropped this album youd be on your knees rn
review the music weirdo
but if it was called ‚Äúkids see vultures‚Äù‚Ä¶.
It is so easy to see he‚Äôs acting like this just cause it‚Äôs Kanye üòÇ If anyone else dropped it would be a whole different story
I really enjoyed this album and I respect and understand anyone who doesn&#39;t. But saying that everyone who enjoys this album is either psychopaths, lonely and ignorant or parasocial cult members is insanely toxic and generalizing fans of one of the biggest artists of all time. I just genuinely enjoy the music. I am not ignoring what Kanye has done by enjoying tunes from my favorite rap artist. I honestly don&#39;t care too much about Fantano&#39;s opinion, I have enjoyed some of his content and he has opened me up to new music, but this combined with some extremely toxic tweets have really soured my opinion of him.
so now were drawing a line with objectifying and demeaning women in hip hop lyrics? now its too much? lol
The amount of people who say &quot;separate art from the artist&quot; to a genre that is about speaking what&#39;s on your mind is crazy. He says &quot;How I&#39;m anti-Semitic? I just fucked a Jewish bitch&quot; in the album and people still say you just need to stop being political and appreciate the music. Like what
Can you imagine being as beta as Fagtano?
yeesh, melon&#39;s indignation has really clouded his judgement here despite getting it mostly right. The album is definitely a stinker, but not at JIK or Donda 2&#39;s level like melon thinks. Shame Kanye&#39;s such a dumbass, i could easily see anthony laughing at the beautiful big titty lyrics and praising them if not only appreciating the lighthearted goofiness of them if these were different times. Oh well. I agree Kanye needs to do more to atone for this bullshit period in his life. We&#39;ll see what happens.
Yea no
KANYE&#39;S THE #1 ARTIST GLOBALLYüêêüíØ<br><br>this is a Great Album,<br>KEEP CRYING BALD HEAD
I hate to say this kind of thing, but I don‚Äôt think Kanye would‚Äôve gotten a good review no matter what he dropped according to you like you have reviewed some terrible albums, terrible and this one‚Äôs unreviewable I‚Äôm not gonna sit here and say it‚Äôs really good I‚Äôm just saying Compared to some other shit that you reviewed. How is this one unreviewable I think you just don‚Äôt like Kanye anymore not advocating for the album just saying this is nowhere near as bad as some of the other things that you have definitely reviewed
This is like if my boomer military dad was a libtard reviewing the album
Virtue Signaling
Ye‚Äôs heart ain‚Äôt even in any of this he genuinely sounds like he doesn‚Äôt believe himself as he‚Äôs saying shit.
The Pope like the leader of the Vati-
You are right about everything. But I still love the album
Kanye is changing the mold, Not only has he gotten 2 10s, he has gotten unreviewable.
I like all the albums you think are perfect, and I was enjoying this one up until you told me it&#39;s so bad I shouldn&#39;t even think about what score I&#39;d give it. So I don&#39;t like it anymore
This technically means Tom Macdonald is better than Kanye
Vultures is so good it destroyed anthony
I guess I have to go to NFR for an actual review of the music. Fantano will review rap albums boasting about real murders they committed but having a &quot;wrong&quot; political opinion is heresy.
Fantano looks anguished‚Ä¶like he just finished a 24 hour marathon of Angelic 2 the Core.
I mean, first few listens, it&#39;s a reasonable 5/10. The album doesn&#39;t push any boundaries considering people are talking about it like it&#39;s AOTY. It&#39;s not, and it&#39;s also not terrible. 3 standout tracks. That&#39;s it.
when i strawman fallacy for internet sympathy and clout :((((
What a self-righteous prick lmao
Man has a real hard time distinguishing the art from the artist only in this particular case
&quot;nothing ill say will convince Kanye fans&quot;<br><br>No bro, nothing you say will convince THE PEOPLE
why is he angry tho üòÇ
Are you reviewing the artist or the art Melon?
even if u set kanye as a person aside from the music, he hasnt had a good album since 2018
‚ÄúUnreviewable‚Äù but you posted this stupid video
You nailed the review of this album.
I mean yea he&#39;s awful but I just wanna know what you think of the album, most people that like this album just think it sounds good. I think reviewing it as music and also talking about how kanye has spiraled would get that message to a lot more people. Your point of understanding why I do or don&#39;t like the music still applies.
A light zero
Honestly, the only reason I was wanting to see a review of this is because it&#39;s hard to find people talking about it who aren&#39;t total meatriders.
Fantano is just mad Kanye is moving past the cancellation phase at this point üò≠
Review music not politics baldy
I get it. I don&#39;t agree with Ye&#39;s behaviour, or what he&#39;s said, but ever video about since the incidents is a 10/20 min lecture on why he&#39;s a bad person. I get it. Now change the record and talk about something else. You know, like the music considering thats the reason i watch the channel
hi just here to dislike this vid and support the hate against ant-knee
Are you ready to do 2093???
‚ÄúThe worst she can say is no‚Äù<br>Her:
You‚Äôre forgetting about the ppl who don‚Äôt care about lyrics (me) cuz those beats and flows are amazing‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è
You know it‚Äôs bad when there‚Äôs no intro
Ironically, in your review of this unreviewable album, you accomplished your #1 Goal of reviewing an album. <br>I typically bury my head in the sand when it comes to drama surrounding artists. I never cared about anything other than the material churned out, and I prided myself on that. I listened through vultures, I found it mainly forgettable with a couple songs I liked, and I didn‚Äôt think anything else of it. <br>After this review, you gave me pause and made me think about why I do or don‚Äôt like this. After some consideration, I‚Äôm not going to be going out of my way to listen to anymore Kanye stuff. <br>I clearly still have a whole lot of growing up to do. It‚Äôs a tough pill to swallow, but a necessary one. Thanks melon. üíõ
LMAOOO
&quot;What he says doesn&#39;t matter to me, I only care about the music&quot;. How do you apply this to a RAP ALBUM?
I stopped listening to music and just watch this channel
Wah Wah Wah
This album feels like the dark twisted fantasy crumbling down. The production is very interesting to me and the melodies are insanely catchy. Sounds like TLOP in 4D. Love this record so far
Youre trash
Also those aren‚Äôt the only perspectives u could potentially have on ye or this album lol. The truth is far more nuanced than this.
If this was The College Vulture, it would of been given a listenable/10.
show us your wife please
How can you say you love Hitler and call yourself Jesus, Kanye? He is seriously ill and Kanye fans don&#39;t understand that. I hope he can act like Kendrick Lamar one day, I hope he gets better. Fantano is right
Bro cried more over this album than his wife did over the divorce üò≠
I‚Äôm part of group 4, where I just like some of the music
But you‚Äôll review artists actively promoting gang violence? How does what he says matter in the context of the music quality?
It would‚Äôve been a 5 to a 7
He really said the next two are gonna be trash. Bro how can you claim to love music lol
i remember when fader article ripped ur ass LMAO
I understand the reason why you feel the need to address contextual ques in the songwriting, but I personally try not to consider what a musical artist is doing in their personal lives. Good or bad. I don&#39;t care for Kanye&#39;s music, or his political stance. But I don&#39;t care for those things separately. If I need artists to be &quot;good people&quot;, I&#39;m not going to have much to look at, read, or listen to.
He calls it unreviwable because he secretly likes the album but hates him cause of everything Kanye did, be honest and real why you don‚Äôt like it
Tbh i think he does provide some good points especially how you can&#39;t just pat a jewish guy on the shoulder and say &quot;Hey its alright Kanye is just a lil crazy&quot;
twitter is talking mad shit bout you rn
Ur wife is onto bigger things
I find Anthony&#39;s inability to separate art from the artist embarrassing as a music reviewer. Even with Anthony&#39;s comments at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=250">4:10</a> it does not validate his reasoning. If you don&#39;t like the lyrics in the music then that is a detail you can bring up when reviewing it. Unfortunately, all we receive is Anthony ranting about Kanye fans continuing to listen and support Kanye&#39;s music. Which I find to be childish from someone who&#39;s entire channel and career is reviewing the music. We see a small glimpse of what this video could have been at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=307">5:07</a> and forward. I don&#39;t mind if Anthony does not like the album. However, making a video in this fashion is not it.
Womp womp üòÇ
idk i love it. the beats are great. some good emotional parts and TYs vocals are smooth as hell
My favorite bar from unreviewable 1 is &quot;Man the world gone mad, Heard R. Kelly in the next Balenciaga ad&quot; really good shot at Kim ü•∂ü•∂ surely his Head of Design is not a pedo himself
Talked bout everything except the music.
Fuck Kanye and fuck this album, won&#39;t be listening to this shit, everything this man does these days leaves me with a putrid taste in my mouth.
@theneedledrop music reviews should be objective, simple as that. If you don‚Äôt like Kanye‚Äôs antics and politics then don‚Äôt listen to his music‚Ä¶don‚Äôt review it‚Ä¶why promote it? You‚Äôre literally contradicting your stance with Kanye. Why support him? Don‚Äôt like him, move on‚Ä¶
This doesn‚Äôt have even a bit of a resemblance to donda 2 - ur reviews are getting so wierd and bad
Terrible record from a terrible human who used to make good stuff
Fantano: &quot;My bitch lookin like a refrence&quot; is an offensive misogynistic line<br><br><br>Also Fantano: Bianca is a dollar store Kim
Also you laughing at the just here to get paid line is exactly what he wanted lol I think this album being unreviewable in the end is the best outcome coming from you
You Are Not Real Mr. Fantano.
HE MADDDDDDDDDDDR
ironically he had his own little Kanye meltdown on twitterüò≠
This the type dude that tells u that u should pick up dog poop in ur own yard
Anthony disguised this review into a Lecturing session
Came for a album review left with a kanye review for some reason
Here&#39;s an honest review on the music only: It&#39;s better than JIK, while it&#39;s not perfect, I think it&#39;s more entertaining than Donda. Melon said it sounds like updated Donda, I would say it sounds more like a dark blend of Yeezus and TLOP. I did not have high expectations, but at first listen I&#39;ll give it a (decent) 7.
I don‚Äôt care for Kanye. I remember finally giving Graduation a chance 3 days before all the antisemitic stuff came out and thinking it was fine. The only track on this album I even somewhat like is Burn. I have looked into the lyrics at all but, the instrumental is nice I guess.
Thank u<br>His worst album yet
This comment section scares me
Don‚Äôt care melon, do your job
I don&#39;t criticize the &quot;words&quot; of a bipolar schizophrenic. But I&#39;m not excited for this album lmaoo
Don‚Äôt get your feelings involved Fantano.
We only care for your music reviews melon, we don&#39;t care about your twitter brain political reviews. If you aren&#39;t going to seriously review the album even tho that&#39;s the single thing on this planet you are known for doing, then don&#39;t even waste our time talking about it. I give this video a light 2/10
stop triying to be diferent bro
You fell off bum
This is a perfect example of what happens when you take misunderstood comments and rhetoric too seriously, Kanye was talking about the Zionists controlling the media 2 years ago and look at the state of the world today. So what, he likes to parade with his wife and brag about it she‚Äôs hot, no shame in game but there‚Äôs shame in hate. Hate the Jews or hate kanye hate is hate, pretty hypocritical and disappointing review here. Vultures isn‚Äôt meant to be taken too seriously, its only a serious album if you live behind a veil or a mask for that matter, VULTURES IS A FUN ALBUM!!! also bro it‚Äôs def MBDTF 2 lowkey, no similarities to donda whatsoever, this is clearly an internalized manifestation of music nerd frustration. Too angry fantano, but still it is your opinion, and alll opinions are wrong :)
Bro cried before the video
If this album would have been as bad as a 0/10, Fantano would have just said that instead of calling it unreviewable. <br><br>The truth is, everything is reviewable, there are just some things that are maybe not worth a review, because they are not worth mentioning. Why then make a video proclaiming the album &quot;unreviewable&quot;, what do you mean? It&#39;s not a ten, but its not a zero either? The worst thing you could do is giving the antisemite more publicity, while having too much cognitive dissonance to admit that kanye, even though he is truly the worst, still definitely is a pretty talented artist. <br>Calling it unreviewable is just a way to protect yourself from calling it good accidentally. Another way to do that would be just not even making a review, instead of giving him the exposure of being something that can&#39;t even be categorized. C&#39;mon, i can openly say Hitlers paintings are shitty, because they are.
least biased review of all time üî•
respect
As a reviewer, you can&#39;t just say it&#39;s bad music. That&#39;s just not true. Not a Kanye stan but I think you let your hatred for who he is get in the way too much of what the music is like. Which makes sense but it&#39;s betrays your original two points. You&#39;ve always been very biased and I think it&#39;s crazy how much this album can sound like albums you previously like. It&#39;s clear it&#39;s just hate, as justified as it is. Thanks for the reminder not to care about your reviews unless it&#39;s an artist we both think is great
he&#39;s pushing 50 and is 20 years into his insanely consistent career, let him have fun and do what he wants while producing rather than doing it solely for money/his fans
I‚Äôm just upset by the dumbasses praising Ye getting a 10 and unreviewable. Idk if it‚Äôs a joke or genuine praise at this point.
What a fucking coward lol
I‚Äôm here to hear a album review not a review about whatever this fuck this trash is
Came for a album review left with a kanye review for some reason
Bro I swear to god. PLEASE RELEASE THE PINK FLOYD WORST TO BEST ALREADY. I‚Äôve been waiting patiently Anthony!!!
Bro is so annoying why are you even considered a music reviewer
lol don‚Äôt think you realize you lost all credibility when you gave sexxy red‚Äôs album an 8
Says they dont take criticism about kanye, but proceeds to talk shit about his wife. Dont complain when people give hate speech towards you lol
I cant wait for unreviwable 2
Yall comments are just proving Anthony right
melon wouldve given it a strong 5 to a light 6 if it was called my beautiful dark twisted vulture
Wow what a shocker
People in the comments either didn&#39;t fully watch the vid and didnt get to the part where he talks about the music being bad or just use the arguement he debunked in the video. Foolish
This attention seeking is so boring. Political views are completely irrelevant in regards to Music. People watch you to hear your opinions about music, nobody is listening to you for your political opinions. If you don‚Äôt like Kanye and that effects your feelings for his music then don‚Äôt review the music. If you think it‚Äôs bad then you think it‚Äôs bad, fair enough but what is the point in creating a video like this? If you aren‚Äôt gonna review the album then say that. <br>I don‚Äôt agree with what Kanye has been doing or saying, but I find it very hypocritical that you will completely refuse to review Kanye, but not someone just as controversial if not more, like JPEGmafia?<br>Again, not a fan of Kanye, but this video seems like such a pointless attention grab. The biggest statement you could‚Äôve made, was not addressing the album at all.
Lmao this album no1 on Jew Land.
&quot;This album is unreviewable because of __ , still gonna glaze Carti even tho he&#39;s literally satanic&quot; ü§ìü§ìü§ìü§ìü§ìü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°
Wtf even is this lmao. People really aren&#39;t mean enough to you tbh. You look and act like you just inhale soy all day
unsubscribed 1
you&#39;ve lost the plot on this.
Bro needs that Kanye money so bad lmao
PERIOODDDTTüòç
Uncommentable 1
Tell us you‚Äôre Jewish without saying you‚Äôre Jewish
Type 3 üôå
If anyone ever comes to this goofy for unbiased music reviews good luck. Sad and scary at the same time.
Katt said it best. y‚Äôall told this rapper he was a genius for so long he started to believe he was.
Fantano fell off
But what&#39;s the rating
I think Fantano dont like Kanye üòï
What a crybaby lmao. Bro got cooked on Twitter and hasn‚Äôt slept since
Taylor keeps winning I see
Aww you can tell he‚Äôs so angry about it. Good job pal!
Just cos identity politics literally
Ant sound like the ‚Äúpissed off ex‚Äù that is mad that his boyfriend move on from him to better things. LOLüòÇ so much passive aggressive!
he came to body
Thank you for this. I&#39;m so happy to see music reviewers not taking Kanye&#39;s bullshit and his antisemitism.
L + ratio
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about politics, it‚Äôs about bringing right, and I‚Äôm right.‚Äù - Fantano
Nobody cares about you fantano
These comments are an absolute shitshow
tbh I don&#39;t care about the anti semitic lyrics, I just think the music is trash. The beats aren&#39;t on Kanye&#39;s level and the album is just a mess. Burn is a good song tho.
absurd to see melon be broken by Kanye West out of all people
Top 5 Kanye album oat
So is the album good or not. I don&#39;t care enough of Kanye nowadays to play the album I&#39;m gonna keep it real
Are you reviewing kanye? Or the album? Lame ass review
how much did the jews not pay you for this review
What about the 4th kind of fan who just dgaf and don‚Äôt care to gaf and just want to listen to music
Bro why Tf is this review funny af üíÄI‚Äôve never seen this dude so heated.
While I agree with you on many points, I think it‚Äôs a bit of a generalization to say that all Kanye fans fall into the categories you laid out. I have followed the rollout closely however I wasn‚Äôt a fan of the album at all. There are still some of us who are interested in a discussion of the music &amp; Kanye rn even tho we aren‚Äôt fans of him or this album.
What an absolutely horrible review, this is a new low for Fantano no valid criticism and the video itself wasn‚Äôt really even a review just a blast on a couple tracks.
You&#39;re the type of person that can&#39;t separate the art from the artist.
hater hater masturbater
If it were called my beautiful dark twisted vultures you would give it higher than a 6
thank you for this fantano at least someone holds him accountable
Respectable opinion but idk why you‚Äôd go on stream and critique album cuts and music videos from this album
You&#39;ve misunderstood that reference line
Divorce getting to this man
Bro 4 minutes in and Kanye really broke melonüò¢.
bro always rates the person not the musicüíÄ
I used to be a kanye fan but dude hasnt dropped anything classic worthy since MBDTF. <br><br>Everything else since then has been either mid with moments of greatness or just straight garbage.
bro really let politics affect his listening experience, it doesn&#39;t help that you&#39;ve been a shitlib since the Fader article.<br>some of my favorite albums of all time come from leftwing-type people and trans people, at least try to review what the music sounds like.
If it was called the money vultures it would get a 10
You fell off egg ü§£
you should probably take a break from the internet
It‚Äôs interesting how he tries to make and explain his point in the first half of the video. It seems genuine, and then he contradicts it by being smug and condescending when talking about the music. Pointing out a couple things and then smiling and laughing to demonstrate how bad he thinks it is seems like a thin-veiled effort to get more people on  ‚Äúhis side‚Äù
I&#39;m a bit mixed about this review, and perhaps not in the same way as some others. This non-review is kinda a review in itself, in the sense that it&#39;s still giving Kanye the attention that he&#39;s clearly so desperate for. Why not just ignore this album and point people in the direction of something more worthwhile?
this is a bad video. I get you have your opinion and obviously Kanye isn&#39;t a great person but it feels more like you&#39;re just attacking people who don&#39;t deserve it. I just enjoy the audio that is entering my ear, and you are vilifying anyone who just likes the music, and regardless of whether you like the music or not, its fucked up.
Bro didn‚Äôt  even talk about the music üò≠üò≠
This is top tier glazing
I watched the stream, this dude is so biased. When Burn played, he talked a little bit of shit about the beat and the mixing, then kanye came in and had a great verse to which he said absolutely nothing. Straight silence for the rest of the track. Hes not reviewing Vultures 1, hes reviewing Kanye West as a person.
Bro rather listen to sexxy red instead üòÇ clown
So much salt in one video ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Fantano‚Äôs brain has broken almost as badly as Kanye‚Äôs. This is unhinged.
Fuck I thought this was gonna be a spoof of unforgivable
Fantano chill, sip some tea and relax. U look so triggered and pissed off its crazy especially when u were trying to act like ur laughing i could see how pissed off u are which is so weird, ye is a terrible guy but ut seems like ur obsessed with him and u keep giving him a platform. Just ignore him fantano
I respect this I don‚Äôt agree with much of modern day ye but I‚Äôll always love him his music changed my life and I‚Äôll always respect that other than the antisemite bars and dehumanising his wife I like the album it‚Äôs atleast a 6-7 for me
The comments are giving me major &quot;Kanye could literally murder someone in cold blood on camera and I would still be a fan&quot; energy.
Hey Melon - here&#39;s a quote from David Bowie:  &quot;Britain is ready for a fascist leader ... I think Britain could benefit from a fascist leader. After all, fascism is really nationalism... I believe very strongly in fascism, people have always responded with greater efficiency under a regimental leadership.&quot; He was also quoted as saying: &quot;Adolf Hitler was one of the first rock stars&quot; and &quot;You&#39;ve got to have an extreme right front come up and sweep everything off its feet and tidy everything up.&quot;[412][413]<br><br>Maybe take down your review where you glazed him.
The discourse on the Kanye subreddit is completely sycophantic. I‚Äôm glad you not only stood by your morals here, but explained your perspective based on the purpose of criticism. The notion of critique is not ethically neutral and if people here cannot see that this IS a legitimate expression of  artistic criticism, they‚Äôre at best anachronistic about the history of music and at worst acting in bad faith.
I like it
bro we are all aware of kanye‚Äôs outbursts, just review the damn music
I dont think he liked the album guys
Anthony Fantano the internet&#39;s <b>redacted</b> music nerd
Respect.
If the album title would have been No Fanta for the Vultures you would have given it a 7 is what you‚Äôre saying Melon?
No but seriously , are you Jewish ? Cause that would explain at lot
&gt;calls the album unreviewable<br>&gt;goes ahead and reviews the album<br><br>Good one, melon.
i don‚Äôt think you understood the reference line
terrible album
So a 10 thank you, Melon man, for admitting it&#39;s that good. üëç
dog him!
unreviewable? more skill issue ü§°
doesn‚Äôt say shit abt the music just brags about how good of a person he is
I was expecting like a 2 and this sermon from Melon, but he didn&#39;t even grade it lmao. The album is not bad, but kanye ruined his public image.
I was in subtle disagreement until you said something extremely profound &quot; how do you penetrate this level of self inflicted ignorance&quot;
Peggy working with Kanye really mentally fucked you up üòÇ
Is this the first unreviewable?
Yet you still gonna use the image and create content off of the album itself anyways to get clout/likes/clicks/streams. Hypocrite and unwavy af
kanye thrives off of reactions like this‚Ä¶it literally powers him
everytime ty dolla sign was in a song, i felt like i was in heaven. everytime kanye was involved, i felt like i was in hell.
jackass
This man wants to be different so bad. His ego has been inflated and wants to be relevant so bad.
are off the grid and carnival really that different though
this review ass
the pandering will get you nowhere, you were better off not making a video on the album at all
I wonder if melon using slurs in the past and basically it coming to light is why he‚Äôs overcorrecting this hard. Kanye really broke him.
Your soft as fucküòÇüòÇ
&quot;bald sjw yells into void for a few minutes&quot;
Chelsea Wolfe when??
I just like the sounds he makes. He makes cool sounds.
Look fantano you clearly aren&#39;t qualified to talk about politics on your music review channel, its genuinely easier to respect H3H3 and Idubbz when they talk about politics than when you talk about politics which is crazy. I would actually be able to respect these political opinions too if you weren&#39;t constantly using obnoxious buzzwords, it is very hard to respect someone&#39;s political opinion if that person is constantly using annoying buzzwords. Doesn&#39;t matter if they are &quot;right wing&quot; or &quot;left wing,&quot; using buzzwords makes anyone look like they don&#39;t know anything about politics. I can respect your opinion about the album itself though.
Instead of grandstanding he could&#39;ve just said, yeah i dont wanna review it because kanye is le bad man
this is barely even a review
Unsubscribed
Fantano had two options here:<br>1: Ignore Ye fans and just say &quot;I think Ye is a reprehensible individual and won&#39;t review it&quot; like plenty of others have, then turned off Twitter notifications for a week<br>2: Ignore what Ye fans have to think and made a quick review saying &quot;the album&#39;s shit and here&#39;s why&quot; and then the rest of the review would have just been the part from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=303">5:03</a> to the end<br>This man in the middle BS feels like that meme of that guy shouting &quot;STOP HAVING FUN!!!!&quot; at those two people playing a game on the couch. Ye lives so rent free in Fantano&#39;s head that Ye has him paying his income taxes too.
How pathetic must one be to think that kanye west&#39;s music (or himself) is genius? He not only makes conventional boring music, but also is a terrible human being
Grow up, this is gay
Thank you for this video
It is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=193">3:13</a>. He is
but burn
If we let Ye have a successful career after all that he has done, we would just be opening the doors for even more nazi or even racist celebrities
Kinda sucks, I thought he was gonna give it like a 7 or something üò¢
Bros out here reviewing kanyes fanbase and political views for 80% of the videoüò≠
vultures i would say is better than donda love kanyes stuff but hes gone crazy
ok buddy
Bravo Anthonyüëè
Anthony Fantano would support sending the unvaccinated to camps during the pandemic.
This clown comes in and thinks that him not reviewing is gonna get people or not listen üòÇ the album is great u just think ur the villain üòÇ
Anthony needs to understand that, while his opinions are valid, the vast majority of people aren&#39;t thinking very deeply about the music, they just like the way it sounds.
The Ye copium is real
Ye owns you buddy
i like kanye alot ngl and if he was going to say and do all these crazy ass things then the music should be crazy too. no, its just generic and boring. cant tell it apart from every other mainstream hiphop track out now. shit he couldve done weird expirimental stuff to further show how utterly insane he can be but i was just left bored and disappointed
L
You‚Äôre a music reviewer not a fuckin‚Äô activist dude.<br><br>Don‚Äôt even like Kanye but this was cringe asf, weren‚Äôt you like an edgelord meme guy a few years back?
fantano you good man?
So biased.
i love life, i have  someone to live for, life has meaning. i like Ye music. you do yours i do mine. anyway. peace.
not in the 3 types, just like his music...
I have never seen him this angry before and I&#39;ve been watching since 2014 wow üò≥
if this was called ‚ÄúMELON 1‚Äù it would be so reviewable üôÑ
The biggest kanye cancel andy on the internet. Nobody cares about what he has said or is saying, majority of people that enjoy his music still and will love him. Nobody comes to your channel to hear your opinion on ye&#39;s opinions but to hear out what you as a semi respected music reviewer has to say about this album. Just look at any social media posts regarding kanye and most people in the comments just admire him. Stop trying so hard to use your platform for the goats cancelation
Based.
Your such a looser üò≠
kanye is great this guy is just a jew
Didn‚Äôt your wife leave you
Ik Ye‚Äôs childish ass fanbase gonna be so mad watching this
Dude why you gotta hate on the fans I just think the music is fire I&#39;m not a psycho or anything
I am pro Kanye. He is right.
this guy really think he the shiit
bald man attacks rival bald man
This video is just 80% of him talking about Kanye as a person then 20% him saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs bad, I don‚Äôt like it‚Äù, that‚Äôs not a music review. Melon didn‚Äôt even understand whole lyrics he complained about because he was too busy focusing on Kanye as a person, why even bother making the video?
S O Y   T E A R S<br>O<br>Y<br><br>T<br>E<br>A<br>R<br>S
this could have just been a tweet
just review the album music boy
keep crying, unsubscribed:3
Kanye is the opposite of Joji. Joji started as a meme with (funnily) bad music, and has since become a celebrated and Grammy nominated artist. Kanye started with excellent music that made him stand out at the time and is now a meme with bad music.
This review is really good. I really liked vultures and would say i am a &quot;kanye fan&quot;. I think what you said about paid is false, i liked it a lot but i do agree with you on hood rat. I think a lot of the antisemitism comments and jew lyrics are unforgivable. I really hope vultures 2 and 3 are better.
The reference line could refer to her being a reference to beauty ; how for creative work you make mood boards/treatments, you look for references to build a look.
KING- YE<br>Crazy, bipolar, antisemite<br>And I&#39;m still the king<br>Still the king<br>Still<br>They thought headlines was my kryptonite<br>Still the king<br>Still the king
I thought this music album was great
holy shit üíÄ
this album broke fantano nearly as much as the separation from his wife did lol. should&#39;ve just posted a 3 second video calling it mid
Vultures was a trash album
I‚Äôm A Fan Of Melon But This Is Just Pathetic
Kanye meat riders mad that his album is trash lmaooo
based fantano
This ain&#39;t it chief üòê
Melon is mad because there is no Kendrick feature
You don&#39;t like this album, you like the controversy it&#39;s stirred up. <br>You don&#39;t care about &#39;the music&#39; you just want to feel superior. <br>Ye fans don&#39;t want to debate they want to deepthroat.
do you guys hear or watch whats happening is palestine ??
Watching Fantano have to pretend to not like the album because he dislikes Kanye‚Äôs politics is hilarious
How you review something that unreviewable? <br><br>Oh wait you can when you want attention
The best video you&#39;ve ever made. Kanye fans are some of the most braindead people on the face of the Earth. Imagine being proud and saying with your full chest that you enjoy a hack like Kanye.
I feel bad for Kanye&#39;s &quot;new wife&quot;. She needs to stand up against that bully one day...
Listen, i wouldn&#39;t call myself a Kanye stan by any means, I love Kanye&#39;s older music and I still listen to the college trio monthly (probably), but his recent music is just not good, the mixing on this album was straight trash, some songs physically hurt my ears listening to them, some of the vocal are so badly mixed I can barely hear them over the production (not that most of them have any substance anyway), its really sad to see someone going through such a awful mental health and self perception crisis, I think the times of a good Kanye album or music in general is long past us, but we still have some phenomenal catalog to listen to and look back on someone who has had one of the biggest fall from grace ever.
It‚Äôs so sad how much of a hater this fully grown man is and how obsessed he is with hating on Kanye since he has been hating on vultures since it even leaked üòÇ
hurr durr Kanye is based thats what i heard
Thank you Anthony, very cool!
Dude ur such a grifter dude
I&#39;m with fantano , I found this album embarrassing. Crazy how many people on the internet are claiming it&#39;s a masterpiece
Ironic how Vultures 1 is #1 in Israel, it seems like Fantano is just being butthurt on behalf of people who quite frankly don&#39;t give a shit and are just enjoying the music.
It‚Äôs not that deep üò≠
idc what Anthony gotta say with this tbh this album was amazing...I do like Anthony reviews but this album was goated
ima react to your vid and call it ‚Äúunwatchable 1‚Äù
Seriously? I just know you like back 2 me. Just like i know you love the peggy production. At this point you‚Äôre just lying to yourself that this album is unreviewable or worse than JIK. <br><br>Nothing critical has been said. Just some weird cherry picked lyrics that you misunderstood and a comment by a random. Nothing in depth about the music. So ‚ÄúCarnaval‚Äù isn‚Äôt a banger? ‚ÄúDo it‚Äù doesn‚Äôt have a catchy hook? Nothing of substance has been said. Just ranting and opinions.<br><br>You can‚Äôt take yourself seriously after this just like your viewers been doing for years now.
even though I love Kanyes music and I still think he is the greatest of our generation I can understand Anthony¬¥s point here. I was a huge ye fan for a long time but you just can&#39;t ignore his behavior.
To truly understand the extent of Ty dolla $ign not giving a fuck about this album u guys should look up a leak: Juice wrld ft. Ty dolla $ign - forever. This song was cut from vultures but it showcases how badly he doesn&#39;t give a fuck about it very well lol
His stans are actually mentally challenged. It‚Äôs sad. Reminds me of the Trump cult
I dont understand how this guy has a platform and how anyone likes this loser
Free Palestine
I overall disliked the album as well but you should have done an actual review instead of whatever this is supposed to be.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=280">4:40</a> ofc its a blond pfp
Bro tbh if Anthony hates Kanye this much why make a video in the first place but since he hates Kanye so much he made three man is a fucking VULTURE
peggy working with ye is fantanos 9/11 lmao
I just like to enjoy music and prefer to enjoy the music rather than to not enjoy it.<br>I like music and I like to enjoy it.
Musically this album still flashes his talent as a producer. Back to me has a fantastic beat along with many other songs but the rapping and bars are atrocious. ‚ÄúWish someone had warned me when I was 15, my soulmate wasn‚Äôt born yet‚Äù is an atrocious bar and one of many of the album. Only songs that flashed potential for me was burn cus he was possessed by 2005 Kanye on that and the songs with tons of features since those could drown out his atrocious rapping. Bro should just become a producer full time
MUSIC REVIEWS SHOULD BE OBJECTIVE‚Ä¶.this is pure Hating‚Ä¶simple as that‚Ä¶hating‚Ä¶how could you possibly hate a grown man so much‚Ä¶it‚Äôs honestly concerning‚Ä¶if you don‚Äôt like him then why do this video? Just review something else‚Ä¶simple as that
What a baby
Jew. Free palestine.
√Ålbum so good that Is unreviewable

didnt bro give MBDTF a 6 üò≠üôèüôè
Kanye needs to stop doing that whole minimalist shit hes done in the past.... its not cool or edgy anymore
Wow very well put together explanations
so‚Ä¶ strong 7?
damn sexy redd  is the best ???
this is why your wife divorced you
yes there‚Äôs only 3 types of kanye fans and those must be the majority. there‚Äôs no possibility people just like good music and he consistently makes good music so people like him
Too much politics, not enough album reviewing. Bad.
just look at you bro..... people are scared to bring kids around you
Not everything has to be a big deal damn bruh ü§£

You could‚Äôve just not reviewed this shit album lol
why aren‚Äôt you doing your goddamn job as a music critic what is even the point of this video
Anthony, I perceive you as an intelligent guy; however, the situation with Kanye is somewhat confusing, at least to me. You are aware that Ye has a passionate fanbase. As in the past, you know there will be people who do not agree with your opinions, especially when you are reviewing or discussing influencers like Kanye, Drake, etc. The manner in which you&#39;ve been handling the backlash from such fanbases leads me to think that perhaps you somewhat enjoy the attention. Don&#39;t get me wrong, you are entitled to express your views and share your opinion with everyone. However, by this point, you should realize that it&#39;s impossible to please everyone all the time. Moreover, concluding your video with statements like &quot;nothing I can say will convince Kanye fans&quot; seems misguided. Your role is not to convince anyone; you are here merely to share your opinions. And I&#39;m saying this not to sound passive-aggressive; it&#39;s just that you seem upset with people and I don&#39;t get why. If I may give some sincere advice, it would be to avoid reviewing artists like Drake and Kanye if you are not prepared to deal with their fanbases. It&#39;s not as if anyone is forcing you to do these reviews. In my opinion, it just seems silly.
„Äé You&#39;re not even being professional at this point. Stop being childish and review the album like you would do any other project. „Äè
I like the album but i hate everything Kanye said in the past few years, is enjoying music not allowed anymore? Why does everything have to be so political nowadays
Kinda lazy just saying some of the lyrics in a silly voice to discredit them. Sure he dragged out the verse on back to me and I&#39;m not commenting on the rest of the album but just seems a bit distasteful
May be your most real review ü§ù
So usually YUNOREVIEW a series where he does mini reviews on albums he didn&#39;t get to. <br>This is him explaining why he isn&#39;t reviewing something. Would that make this the real YUNOREVIEW?
I just like the music
was this video even worth making? i agree with what you&#39;re saying here, but is this not continuing to add fuel to a fire that continues to rage? i think just not reviewing the album is a good move, but going forward i wouldn&#39;t even dignify the future kanye drops with a response. going on record to say &quot;i AM NOT reviewing this&quot; on the review channel feels like giving it a review anyway.
I gotta agree. If Kanye&#39;s verse wasn&#39;t on songs like Carnival, they would be actually listenable
If Ye and Ty Dolla $ign were Sexyy Red you would&#39;ve given this a strong 8 be fr
L
But if it was called Good Vultures M.A.A.d 1 it would get a strong 9 to a light 10
I don&#39;t give a fuck if he refuses to review this album. Its just seeing this whelp parade around, morally grandstanding to his audience who give him attention to review music is pathetic. Kanye&#39;s antics are making fantano quiver with rage in this video its pretty funny.
Categorizing people who still listen to Kanye‚Äôs music into 1 of 3 boxes is pretty lame. I don‚Äôt care for his antics outside the music nor do I agree with what he said (plus that fact that he was clearly off his meds and mentally unwell during it), but I still listen because I like his music and I thought this album was good but not great in my opinion. Its hard to believe that this was considered ‚Äúunreviewable trash‚Äù considering some of the other albums you‚Äôve reviewed. This feels completely disingenuous to me and I don‚Äôt think Fantano was able to separate the art from the artist, ‚ÄúIf Kanye‚Äôs delusional fans aren‚Äôt hearing that this record is awful then nothing can convince them‚Äù I mean cmon‚Ä¶
You‚Äôre right about everything but I would be a hypocrite to tell people to stop listening to his bs music while I still bang 90s black metal sometimes.
Fantano has become deranged by his leftist politics.
I was hoping you would put aside your political and personal views on Kanye and strictly review his music BUT I WAS A FOOL. I&#39;VE BEEN BAMBOOZLED
Watch him give an actual review to the new carti album even though carti literally abused his girl.
what about the music tho breh this is a reoccurring theme w u
I agree with everything you&#39;ve said, but if this is how you feel then you can&#39;t review most hip-hop now, since it&#39;s promoting violence and murder. <br><br>You have Key Glock on your loved list from last year and that album brags about real life murders and celebrates violence and murder throughout (amazing record btw).
The new not good
Bro you are full of hate. Heal yourself. I will pray for you
why are you so hurt
just tryna be different , marketing genius
Nunber 1 in 95 countries pussyyyy
Anthony you are blinded by your ego to the point that you can‚Äôt even review this project. Insane how you expect anyone to believe there‚Äôs no bias in what you‚Äôre saying
Not sure what to tell you fantano, we love the album. If you can‚Äôt seperate the music and the politics I think it‚Äôs seriously time to step down as a music reviewer. I mean that
if the album was named thevulturedrop then it&#39;d be a extremely well reviewable/10
i will stop listening to him if i become influential enough to effect him but his music is entertaining enough for me to override my negligible positive effect on ye
Bro is absolutely cooked by twitter üò≠
If it was called The Vultures Store it would be a 10
‚Äúunreviewable‚Äù, reviews it
Divorced
this is honestly such a W as a kanye fan. if he were to give it a 2/10 or a 1/10 it would‚Äôve been a lot worse but giving it it‚Äôs own category to forever be remember as the only one is so legendary. you‚Äôve made history
I kinda just like his music lol,first listen and only listen i have to say its a 5/10 album i dont really give a fuck what hes sayin on there it aint me sayin it,aint my buisness and not my opinion most the songa just werent for me. Hes a edgelord sayin goofy shit cuz he loves smokin his own pipe 24/7. Shit aint the holocaust pt2 i can name a myriad of artists and celebs who say risque shit about jews or anybody and i dont give a shit. Ty dolla sign is hot ass, kanye got a load of bangers, peggy got some good shit and some dumb fuck opinons hes kinda a suburban goof but idc man i cant call this unreviewable
Thank you Melon for giving this a 10/10!!!!
How much did the Rothschild pay you to say this?
Honestly, even if this wasn&#39;t about Kanye as a person, this album is so shit that unreviewable still makes sense. It&#39;s so boring and then seven minutes later you hear the most abhorrent shit you never even knew was possible.
the stereotypical democratic beta male doesn‚Äôt like kanye‚Äôs album because his feelings were hurt? color me shocked
what?
Thank You Fantano! a
Kanye stans having full meltdowns in this comment section cements Melon&#39;s point here.
kind of strange fantano is receiving hate for saying the obvious
totally unbiased review, not at all emotionally charged
&quot;no sense of humor&quot; fantano here back again with another video<br><br>Ye 2028 <br><br>Incoming to a voting booth near you
Still crazy that you can see the clear bias not just fantano but the white savior mentality people have. Literally went into this album with your arms crossed just to bring up things that happened in 2022. The album has insanely fun production takes influences from so many different genres and has iconic goofy Ye lines. Fr must be miserable to not be able to have fun with music. Quit acting like you weren‚Äôt a 4chan anon back In the day saying racist remarks fantano. We won‚Äôt forget.
AND BEAUTIFUL BIG TITTY BUTT NAKED WOMEN JUST DONT FALL OUT THE SKY YOU KNOW
All my homies like racism and conspiracy theories
Kanye is the first artist in the world to get an Unreviewable/10. Thank you Melon
midlifethony crisistano here
I don&#39;t think the concept of not having social expectations for artists we listen to is inherently a bad take (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=275">4:35</a>), but Melon is right, how you gonna separate the art from the artist when the artist&#39;s crazy shit is a main topic of their &quot;art&quot;, esp when they don&#39;t do or say anything in said art to push or change that narrative??
Dude shit on so many peoples work that they spent hundreds of hours on just to shit on Kanye because he disagrees with his political opinions and is jealous of  his relationship. What a loser
Fantano try not to review an artist because of their politics: level impossible
How good was the music that you couldn&#39;t even give it a score?<br><br> Kanye is a genius
admit ur old
The album was so good it left him speechless<br>He couldn&#39;t express his feelings through mere words
üíÄthis dudes whole subreddit calling him out for this dogshit non review
I&#39;m Jewish I like Kanye. I think bro is just mentally ill. I don&#39;t see how you support Jews you just say Israel shouldnt exisy
if it was called the vultures store you would give it a 10
I disagree with this verdict. I understand why Fantano is saying this but at the same time, no music is unteviewable. Furthermore, I would want to also say that bias going into an album is obviously going to taint the experience from the get go. Fantano being a staunch leftist is obviously going to frame everything, even things that are insignificant, as bad
I don‚Äôt want to hate Kanye but I hate Kanye
Yo Fantano, I&#39;m about to order McDonalds man want something?
youre strawmanning all his fans to be nazis? seriously? what if people just idk..like the songs??
Terminally online moment
He still the king
The reason he made this video was because he was inspired by the callbacks to mbdtf on the album. He thought back to his review of mbdtf and thought &quot;oh yea thats the review that really blew me up, huh. I should give another horrible review for a kanye album so it can go viral and I can make money!&quot;
Fantano is the biggest hypocrite of all time I fucking swear. Goes from saying &#39;I won&#39;t talk about him on my platform ever again&#39; to this shit... absolutely ridiculous
Anthony Fantano is the most stereotypical, cringey, politically-motivated, ideologically-driven, disingenuous grifter on the internet. He knows he&#39;s lying, he knows you know he&#39;s lying, but he does not care. He lives in an echochamber, and genuinely seethes when exposed to people and opinions he disagrees with. It&#39;s sad, but comical at the same time. <br><br>You don&#39;t even have to like Vultures 1 to know it&#39;s at least &quot;reviewable,&quot; and might actually be half-decent.<br><br>But, like so many others, Anthony is trapped in his leftists echochamber, not unlike a modern inversion of a 1950s McCarthiest.
I dissagree. I despise kanye, i despise his character, but i genuinely have to admit this was a phenomenal album. Stars is a beautiful song, burn is a top 10 kanye songs, back to me is a genuinely fun track, beg forgivness is fantastic. Keys to my heart is great too‚Ä¶<br>I understand your point completely, but i have to disagree that not all of his fans love kanye. I think it is possible to detatch the music from the artist, even if the artist is embedded into the art , because i‚Äôm mostly listening to the music, not the lyrics. Even if subliminally i‚Äôm listening to it, i‚Äôm critical enough to know he‚Äôs a terrible piece of shit , with innate talent for music. I agree with your point but i dont think you argued it correctly and i think a part of your opinion comes from closed mindedness. I dont think you should‚Äôve made this video at all.
Unreviewable is a 10/10 to me. I&#39;ll take it
Man this ‚Äúreview‚Äù ain‚Äôt it man. I agree with that Kanye is a horrible person with terrible beliefs and practices, but out of this whole video you only spent like a minute on the actual music on this album. Call it trash if you want, but please explain more than just a handful of tracks why it‚Äôs trash.
in the wise words of Daughters McIndustrial, &quot;You won&#39;t get what you want.&quot;
I&#39;m here, I&#39;m a little bit queer, get used to it.<br><br>It&#39;s so bad, holy shit, saw the video, gave it a quick little listen of each track. Same shit different typa toilet, sounds like stuff I&#39;ve heard before with what are movie samples in most tracks??? All the verses are just dumb as, with the best  being TY refelecting on his influence on his child - but again, same old shit.
what about us psychotic hateful nihilistic cult members?
Damn‚Ä¶ it has been good times but it&#39;s time to unsub from ya, you clout goblin melon‚úå
This is stupid
was this a kanye review or music?
I think it sucks that Kanye went down the rabbit hole. People who call this album fire are coping pretty hard imo
Children in the comments don&#39;t know what conviction is. The album is ass. Kanye hasn&#39;t released a good album since TLOP/KSG.
HOLA
as a active kanye listener it hurst but its fair
youre a MUSIC reviewer and this is MUSIC, its not unreviewable you just personally dont like the artist..
Love ye, fuck fantano
For the love of God Fantano, stfu about the political and economic state of the world and give us a review
Reivew it properly Melon, and do it more objectively dude
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=334">5:34</a> BROTHEEEEEEERRR üíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ
I like how mad he is üíÄ
nah I knew u would pull ts
Incredibly disappointed to see Peggy go all in on this.<br>All my Heroes are Cornballs
Titles the video &quot;unreviewable 1&quot; and goes on to review the album anyway
Thank you for sounding off on this, Anthony.
So if &quot;Not Good&quot; reviews are for albums that are non-starters, then &quot;unreviewable&quot; videos must be for albums that are non-non-starters. So then the two &quot;nons&quot; cancel eachother out and make the album a starter üòè
I don‚Äôt think people are liking this album necessarily because of the lyrics‚Ä¶ and yeah you can say that‚Äôs delusional kanye fan activity but most of the fan base is around for the production and outlandish beats at this point not even listening to the lyrics
Why is your head so large
I deleted all his music I cherished for almost 20 years since November 2022 and feel great
i rate your life a 0/10 and u look like you&#39;ve been crying
there will be not back to me disrespect üò§üò§
Shut up baldie
Damn peggy
womp womp
you just dont like kanyes political opinions. just be honest
damm fantano really fell off i wanted him to genuinely review this
I think a major problem is have with this as someone who likes both of you quite a bit is that  there are 65 million people who listen to Kanye on spotify and id wager less than 10,000 of those people fit into the groups he laid out  it‚Äôs kinda strange demonizing an entire population of people that‚Äôd be about the size of a European country to this extent<br><br>Also just get off twitter and all of this goes away
You know it‚Äôs bad when Anthony has to Google the definition of a music review
Ngl i like paid better
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=100">1:40</a> at least he has a wife to call a reference
Anthony is right ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Everyone here needs to watch Europa: The Last Battle
I love Fantano but he‚Äôs way too bias against Kanye
It&#39;s funny because he listened to the album anyways.
I love Anthony
I love the Mona Lisa but Da Vinci didn&#39;t have the right political opinions so I actually hate it.
Stay out of politics, just review the music.
I wish Kanye would rap more about positive happy things instead of weird creepy shit like this
You&#39;re so insufferable
I listen to Kanye for the production and beats more than his lyrics. Everyone knows he&#39;s mentally unstable at this point, so I think you should be willing to separate the art from the artist. Back to me is one of the best Kanye songs of all time IMO, and the samples and production on tracks like paperwork and good don&#39;t die are more interesting than anything put out by 99% of mainstream hip hop in the last decade
Womp womp üçâ
Separate the art from the artist challenge
mans js reviewed kanye himself üòÇ
If you wanna send a message to your Jewish audience, delete your other Kanye reviews/related content üò≥
You will look back at this and realize how unreasonable you were
The Marshal Mathers LP has much much more moraly cuestionable bars. So , if is not about the music, why do you like that album ?
hey man to be an internet critic you gotta review. hope this helps!
This album was so good. 8/10 for me
U suck
Just on the side of the music, (aside from the occasional references to news concerning Kanye and the repetitive, objectifying subject matter that every other rapper uses) I do think the album has value as an exciting playlist album with huge hits like back to me, carnival, and burn.
Surely this wasn‚Äôt based on personal feelings and politics
Bro that‚Äôs a little much it‚Äôs not that bad
when kanye eventually releases an album called &quot;yitler&quot; or whatever there&#39;s absolutely gonna be weirdos still going &quot;but the beats are fire&quot;
Petition for this man to stop reviewing hip-hop.  This genre is not for you and you don‚Äôt belong in this culture.
this &quot;review&quot; confused me bc i&#39;m halfway thru the album and i haven&#39;t skipped a single song yet.
Go watch him reacting to carnival on stream. In the first 4 seconds of pressing play hes already finding stuff to hate about the song. Even before kanye even gets on the song he is visibly very frustrated and annoyed. He has no reason to be.  Hes going into the album wanting to hate it. why? He usually always goes into reactions with an open mind, wanting it to be good. but with this album he went it to it with a closed mind, wanting it to be bad. This album is unreviewable because hes not even giving it a chance. Even then, how can an album be unreviewable? it makes absolutely no sense. I highly doubt anybody would be offended if he reviewed the album. hes reviewed albums from people who have done WAY worse like s*xual crimes and m*rders. its insane.
not even a kanye album review more like just a kanye review
Damn. This video is nuts
This would&#39;ve had a lot more weight if you didn&#39;t have a meltdown on Twitter and on stream.<br><br>Should&#39;ve just not review the album at all. The Kanye stans got to you bad.
Why he look so Tired in the thumbnail
Fantano went full nicki minaj levels of unhinged
Bro üò≠üò≠üò≠
Thank you Fantano for giving this a 10/10!!!!!!
Anthony you‚Äôre trying to ruin the album for me‚Ä¶
All jokes aside, this was brave for Fantano to do. I think his analysis is spot on here, there‚Äôs so many nihilistic teenagers on the internet outaged by anyone pushing back on Kanye‚Äôs insane rhetoric, and complete lack of attention to music over the last 3(?) years.<br><br>This album is trash. Some of you are too young to understand the cultural impact that everything Kanye did from College Dropout to MBDTF (and arguably even TLOP).
He talked more about Kanye‚Äôs political stance than reviewing the album bro a burger
Nah all credibility lost you‚Äôre a music reviewer not a human reviewer
There&#39;s either a ton of delusional brainwashed Kanye fans here or these comments are from a paid org to flood the comment section with Kanye approval while dissing you.  Kanye is a P.O.S.
Hahaha what an embarrassing video.
I wish burn was longer
Are we talking music or nah
Oh who cares, shut up and review the album
Talking about his wife is out of line
Listened to carnival, instrumental sounds like he tried to recreate H.A.M. from memory with weaker features
he 100% likes the album ü§£
Wait I get it, Anthony was so inspired by Kanye‚Äôs self destruction that he himself tried to one up kanye by posting this video and went on a rant on Twitter. Kanye truly is beyond our realm of comprehension.
Y‚Äôall really care about a man‚Äôs opinion whose favorite genre of music is probably like math rock üòÇüòÇüòÇ
You forgot the 4th kind of Kanye fan. The fan that can separate the art from the artist. If music is good, I will listen to it. That being said, CARNIVAL, BURN, and PAPERWORK are absolute fire
I had a feeling this was gonna happen
when the post-divorce bitterness starts hitting
I only watch a fantano review once in a blue moon so take this with a grain of salt, but over the last couple years it feels like his political views have infiltrated his opinion of various artists more and more. Its ashame.
fantano having a public mental breakdown is hilarious üòÇ
did he listen to it?
He is from Afro Asiatic decent he CANNOT BE ANTISEMITIC
Fantano gotta give us this philosophical politically correct bullshit instead of just reviewing an album like a critic should. enjoying something and disagreeing with it at the same time is perfectly accepted until it comes to Kanye for some reason
This is lowkey a review tho. But really lol I tried listening to see if it was actually gonna be good music that had nothing to do with his controversies but I listened to like 1 minute , heard a Jew bar, cringed and then shut it off. Lmfao.
&quot;Unreviewable....but if I had to put a number on it, its an 8.&quot;
It would‚Äôve been a 7 or 8 for sure
you couldnt save malding for the fantano channel and do a review here?
My problem is that at no point has he said that ye lied.
If it was called Kids See Vultures you would give it a 10
Kanyes DOWNFALL is INSANE üòÇüòÇ
Vultures was amazing though
You give it a 10 if you weren&#39;t jewish
People need to just let go of Kanye at this point. Stop wishing for him to pull it together. Stop giving him the press he wants. Stop streaming his records. Stop gawking at the downward spiral and let the man drown.
even left in that raw camera turn off at the end, so powerful, so impactful. really showing how you just couldn‚Äôt stand to make such a video üò∞üò∞
Anthony‚Äôs finally turned into pitchfork and reviews political views over the actual music
Fantano is such a nerd üíÄ <br>just admit you hate kanye and it‚Äôs not a musical critique
Damn bruh chill the fuck out Melon it‚Äôs just an album bro go listen to some Swans and relax a little eh?
Hey Fantano thanks for the virtue signaling glad you could still make money and leech off the terrible person!
I think this Album is like when you watch those videos of ‚Äú[random artist] paintings as they continue to go insane‚Äù <br><br>Edit: arguing with Kanye Stan‚Äôs is a waste of time. Clearly there‚Äôs nothing that could be done, said, or released by Kanye that makes you change your mind
Bro I like paidüíÄ
Since I&#39;m on Spotify it took me a few days to get to listen to this, I&#39;d seen mostly good things on twitter and in general about how Kanye was back. Damn I seriously, seriously worry that anybody can listen to that and come to that conclusion. Genuinely the only piece of actual rapping I enjoyed on this album was Freddie Gibbs&#39;s verse on an otherwise terrible track
Unreviewable because melon doesn‚Äôt wanna give a score cause he doesn‚Äôt get it, if it was made by Sufjan Stevens and was called ‚ÄúSongs I Blow My Cat to‚Äù it‚Äôd be album of the decade.
Fantano called Fuentes a &quot;booger eater&quot; lol. Fantano would never debate Fuentes and have his world shattered.
thats the same guy that give 6 to mbdtf.<br><br>think about that!
Man I didn‚Äôt like the album at all either but but I with you talked about it instead of reciting your anti Kanye speech the millionth time like I agree with your Kanye statements but like I know. Also ignore the haters stop trying to be like morally better them and defeat them, the haters don‚Äôt listen to your reviews and are in it for the music
i&#39;m with you dude. kanye&#39;s first 5 albums will forever be some of my favourites but i&#39;m not even going to bother listening to anything new he puts out.
The crazy bipolar antisemite line seemed to be a reference to headlines about Kanye rather than him owning those titles. That being said, it‚Äôs hard to defend the 2 other bars Fantano mentioned. There‚Äôs some quality on this album from what I listened to but Kanye‚Äôs treatment of his new wife is very disrespectful. I hope he can take accountability and start to make changes in his life. He may have some mental issues but still has to take responsibility for his actions.
Well done for saying the truth the album is a mess just like himself I&#39;m sorry 0/10 it deserves
I agree, a 11/10 is technically unreviwable since the score only goes up to 10
wow. truly the fantano review of all time
Boooooo
I enjoyed it
Okay, but what are your thoughts on the sound of the music that plays when you listen to the album?
it&#39;s funny that fantano is having a mental breakdown over kanye still being successful and beloved by the hip-hop community. he wants to have the sway to destroy kanye but he just doesn&#39;t, not even among his own fans.
His wife is a victim. All alleged, but supposedly her family has been desperately trying to get her out of the relationship because he‚Äôs controlling and she is like off the deep end. Like he literally marches her around naked while he is fully clothed and dehumanizes her in some sort of unhealthy version of a shame kink in public it‚Äôs so bad. Ugh. I genuinely just feel so bad for her, and his kids
Dumb üòÇ
Ye truly has broken Melon‚Äôs melon..
You know shit is getting real when the caucasian male internet reviewer takes off his glasses.
Not even worth a tran....
Felt the same way, thank you
now im starting to question if he is reviewing the artist as a person and not the music itself
Bait used to believable
Kanye fan type 4: I just like his music bro üò≠
anthony fantano more like poopthony shitano
your wife left you and you need an outlet to express your anger. it‚Äôs okay
Seriously fantano has completely lost it. Twitter ranting and insulting his wife. Reviewing the album by skipping through it and whining every 10 seconds, making a video about how he would never review it after reviewing it and then reviewing it in the last minutes of the same video‚Ä¶ this man is fucking gone. Honestly with all his performative antics in the past it‚Äôs kinda fun to watch. His cognitive dissonance is exploding in his face in real time. You can‚Äôt stop good art, sorry melon.
Just review it mate
Honestly you calling his wife a Kim K clone was misogynistic. Bianca is way hotter than
WHO AINT CASH A CHECK OFF MY NAME‚ÅâÔ∏è
Idk why Kanye can produces solid songs like burn, do it, and carnival then ruin it with his stupid one liners like on king or problematic. I thought the production on the album was pretty good tho
Wait, you&#39;ve been using a camera THIS WHOLE TIME?
Completely agree melon. This guy&#39;s done irreparable harm. A shame on people who promote him and listen to his music. I can forgive listening to old Kanye. but he&#39;s gone a step too far. And this is new music. You can choose not to listen to
Finally, Gunna has an album better than Kanye.
At this point I beleive this is a one sided beef between n n melon..This man just hates kanye which clouds his music review..Sucks though
Calm down, Perez Hilton.
lol Anthony is genuinely upset. We need a wellness check
L
This is NOT very objective
Very childish
Hey this Young Turks episode is kinda weird
Jewü´µüèª
As a no-english speaker i liked the album quite a bit
I like this video, it&#39;s simple, addresses his point of view on why he wouldn&#39;t review it and lists valid reasons of what Kanye&#39;s done. The only problem is that fantanos fanbase is mostly the people he called out. So obviously a lot are going to disagree. But this video was pretty fair and good.
Wow Anthony ur soooo woke
Reminds me why I stopped listening to Kanye.<br><br>You can‚Äôt ever mention his music in public without having to justify it to normal people OR push back from the psychos who think the shit he does is okay.<br><br>And that was BEFORE the Htlr stuff, so I can‚Äôt imagine how awful that must be to do now.
If it was called &quot;The Money Vultures&quot; you would have given it a 10
Fantano has lost it <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/ygF1XpGUMMjk8gSDrI2wCx"></a><a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/ygF1XpGUMMjk8gSDrI2wCx"></a><a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/ygF1XpGUMMjk8gSDrI2wCx"></a>
I feel like music critics should be able to separate the art from the artist<br>Not only talking about Fantano, talking about everyone
Blud is having a mental breakdown
Boo hoo fantano, cry üò≠<br>Unsubscribe
Nowifeny Divorcitano
so i listened to the album again after you made this video and jesus christ its horrible when you actually listen to the lyrics
I&#39;m the 4th type of fan. I chose to listen to him in his music and not the media and since 808s I&#39;ve separated the art from the artist.
Lil bro thinks he is a music reviewer
To respond to your 3 types of Kanye fans, I can see where ur coming from, and kinda agree. However I love Kanye and consider myself a fan and think it‚Äôs sad to see where his life has taken him. It sucks that all this has happened, but I still want him to succeed, I want him to be happy, because I think he has a beautiful mind, a beautiful soul.
Man didn‚Äôt even say Tran-Sition he said ‚Äúidgaf if you love it or hate itüñïüèø‚ÄùüòÇüòÇ
The album has a couple highlights, but for the most part makes me feel gross whenever Kanye opens his mouth. There were at least 4 songs that Kanye singlehandedly ruined with his vocals.
ok just review the record and not kanyes mental health
We will always remove the art from the artist. I hear ppl bumping R Kelly still, holdup isn‚Äôt it famous painters, sculptors and architects that have fucked up histories? I think he needs help and he lost me with that slavery was a choice but let‚Äôs not act like society doesn‚Äôt historically remove art from artists.
I hope kanye anlienates every single good producer and artist to where they can focus on better avenues than to waste time with his hate-riddled ass
You could tell Ye personally affects Fantano. Even Drake directly insulting Fantano didn&#39;t have this much of an effect on him.
Ohh no! anyway..
Your my hallelujah mr fantano
Shut up baldy, this music will impact people more than your sad words ever will.
kanye went from making a christian album to bleeping out curse words on donda to making an entire album about ass and fucking bitches, that BPD is crazy
&quot;Ye&quot; 2018 album is his only that absolutely sucks. This album is good, but I&#39;m just disappointed that he moved away from the spirituality in his last few collections. This album is very good. He isn&#39;t a human being to me. He is a fictional superhero/villain
Never post againüî•üî•üî•
Bro don‚Äôt you review music? Wtf is this shit
you‚Äôre so corny and ingenuous.
Thank you for never backing down, brother. Much love and respect. Loved Kanye‚Äôs music since Through the Wire, but his supervillain arc has turned me off completely.
What makes Death Grips great is that there is a lot of content in the lyrics, despite them being most times unintelligible. But there are people, and I do this sometimes, who just sing whatever shit they think they heard because they don&#39;t need to understand every lyric, they just like how the words sound as a melody. I don&#39;t personally like Kanye&#39;s music, but why can&#39;t someone just like the melodies that the words are making.
tldr. He hates Kanye and anyone who thinks this album is good
bro
His point is so valid, he can&#39;t review it because of it&#39;s own criteria and moral perspective, he&#39;s not obliged to review it, why there&#39;s people on the comments acting so childish?
Ur weird‚Ä¶.
bros mad hes a jew üòÇüòÇ
Wtf did I just watch
just review and rate the album
Totally valid argument, I get it, but. This album minus some of Ye‚Äôs verses beats out anything someone like (especially including) what sexy redd puts out. They‚Äôre ruining the culture by driving the obsession of sexual objectification and it‚Äôs wrong. I wouldn‚Äôt want the women in my life looking up to sexy redd, cardi b, doja cat, or any of them. So if this album is unreviewable theirs are too.
just give your opinion about the album and that&#39;s  it, why to put politics into it
I&#39;ve been watching Fantano for over 10+ years, and I have to say its not just YE who has had a decline in recent years. Fantano is on the same boat. <br>Fantano has become further and further removed from the music to the point where he&#39;s just a liberal talking head (No, I&#39;m not republican before you say anything).<br>He went from mention of politics here and there to the point to where its what runs his entire channel. This is just a 7 minute video of Fantano flexing his moral authority and how good of a person he is. What insufferable content. This isn&#39;t fun nor informative. Its pretentious  <br>His virtue signaling is out of control and he&#39;s even dictating that YE is &quot;Unforgiveable&quot; etc. That&#39;s just INSANE to me, no one has the power to say that.<br>Fantano has become so self righteous his content is just unwatchable, just like this YE album.<br>Its been a shame to watch one of my favorite Youtubers go from a fun guy making meme&#39;s to a sad depressed old man ranting on twitter and his videos about politics ALL DAY LONG.<br>Fantano seems miserable and watching his videos is too now.<br>Dude has reviewed music from people just as horrible if not WORSE then YE which is ironic too.<br>Fantano fell off just as much as YE. <br>And FUCK YE for everything he said, I ain&#39;t defending that shit. But Fantno has become a shell of the former entertainer and critic he once was.
When does the review part start
I think this is quite a big overreaction tbh.
how can an album be unreviewable? it makes absolutely no sense. I highly doubt anybody would be offended if he reviewed the album. hes reviewed albums from people who have done WAY worse like s*xual crimes and m*rders. its just ridiculous.
Get off his D already bro
This is somehow worse than Ben Shapiro saying rap isn‚Äôt music
Kanye fans be the ones that look at Hitler‚Äôs paintings and think ‚ÄúYou gotta separate the art from the artist.‚Äù Like there‚Äôs a fucking line that‚Äôs crossed at some point.
Over dramatic, that‚Äôs the best way I can describe this review. Although criticism of Kanye‚Äôs character is completely valid. But when we look at this album there are a lot of club bangers and fun tracks off this album. To put this project this low is kind of ridiculous.
What happened to separating art from the artist Anthony? You‚Äôre not even trying to not look biased.
I&#39;m wondering which of the 3 groups Melon thinks fans like The Mallory Bros, NFR Pod, Jon Denton, ImDontai, etc. fall into. I don&#39;t think they&#39;d fit into any of the 3. I think the reality is that the vast majority of people either don&#39;t know or don&#39;t care about what Kanye says. The shit he says is atrocious, yet the majority of people don&#39;t listen to music this way. Average people aren&#39;t invested, or &quot;tapped in&quot; like this, yet I imagine plenty of them would consider themselves &quot;fans&quot; of Kanye. Or maybe Anthony means &quot;fans&quot; of Kanye as a person, and not &quot;fans&quot; of his music. I&#39;d consider myself a fan of Travis Scott which I would imagine most people would interpret as me liking his music, not condoning his possible role in the deaths of 10 people.
Kanye West was like a burning phoenix. ü¶Ö<br>Arising from the depths of middle america shining all aspects of human life with his gifts and talents through the sound of music but ultimately fell from grace when his mama died igniting everything that she and Ye stood for.<br>People confuse Kanye&#39;s predicament from mental illness to what should&#39;ve already been defined from the start: a mental breakdown that must&#39;ve manifested by enduring the industry&#39;s feedback on nihilism and cultural sabotage. <br>Even after Feb. 10, 2004 debut of the College Dropout, could this legacy be a cautionary tale about the industry or has this dude been playing the irrationally sick card long enough that he&#39;s unable to backtrack from his own sanity?<br>Something from Harlan Ellison&#39;s famous sci-fi novel: &quot;I have no mouth and I must Scream!&quot; Truth is stranger than fiction.
This the same dude the gave MBDTF a 6. I still love you fantano although i may disagree w u on points.
If it was called &quot;Ok Vultures&quot; You&#39;ll give it a 10
üíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ
Cop out BS. Critique the album itself or stfu. You&#39;re literally fanning the flames of the same stuff you have a problem with. Just treat it like another piece of art or don&#39;t bother talking about it.
This album is good though? Are you mad it‚Äôs not pussy rap?
Kanye‚Äôs album was so good Anthony became a Zionist
Fantano butthurt because he prob has a lot of Jewish friends
You are so politically charged that you dont even review it lmao
This was embarrassing to  watch.
Kanye destroyed Fantanos mental health. Thank you Yeezus üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª
the shawarma one was more fireüß®üß®üß®üß®üß®
Never seen such loser
Michael Jackson fucked kids. How would you rate his albums, Anthony?
Bro what r u talking abt this shit is fire
All that yapping just to say bad things about two songs and ignore the others ‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è
i know we all love fantano but i ssriously hope he is okay :/ with all fhe sfuff going on in his psrsonal life its no surprise he is having a beeakdown on fwitter. guy needs to take a break and get some help for real. i wonder if he stopped taking his meds
LOL Ye really made Fantano question why he reviews music
Honestly i think if fantano just said i hate everything kanye says and i dint agree with it so i will not review his album would be so much better and respectful than just ignoring all the good stuff on this which there are i personally felt like a 7 on this album but fantano looked really silly on this review especially when he was reacting to it he look like a 5 year old. Anyway he said it himself that the album was not gonna look good before he even react to it.Enjoy the music guys and listen to anyone if you like the music good fantano shouldnt tell anyone what music to listen to
aweeeee Anthony got his little feeling hurt :( so much for being a music critic. pathetic. im jewish fyi :)
Why don‚Äôt you tell the Jews in your audience to call for a ceasefire?
The whole ‚Äú3 types of Kanye fans‚Äù is such an awful take.<br><br>Separate the music to the artist.<br><br>I do not agree with anything Kanye has said or done but you cannot deny that his music has been great for the last 20 years!
Ur so unbelievably biased and soft
This non/review just made me like this album more for some reason...üòÇ <br><br>The albums music itself is great  though the lyrical content tends to be boring, typical rap crap (bitches, money, cars, blah blah blah). <br><br>I personally felt that if the album had started with Beg Forgiveness, then led with the last 3 songs first, it would&#39;ve been the start of an amazing album. <br><br>I wish Kanye would&#39;ve explored all the crazy stuff he&#39;s been spouting since 2022 on this album, it would&#39;ve made it  interesting at least. <br><br>There&#39;s some great songs on here. You should definitely decide for yourself if you like it or not.
Ur garbage bro
The fact that he says the only people who like Kanye‚Äôs music are bad people is honestly disgusting. You do realize people can just like music right? Separate the art from the artist, and the lyrics are not great, but it sounds good.
I really cant tell if this is satire or if the melons having a mental breakdown
I don‚Äôt care about anything you have to say
i really appreciate how you never alter your opinions to align with your fanbase. thank you for continuously calling out kanye&#39;s awful behavior.
Imma need youtube to bring back the dislike button for this one
a little bit of an overreaction much?
Im here to add my dislike contribution
the fact he had a create a whole new score for this album
so u cant give it a review because of who ye is
This is even worse than the Gunna Wunna review lol
This man gave kids see ghosts a 10 but not ye his opinion is invalid
If it was called Kids See Vultures then you would‚Äôve given it a strong 9
Ye chose that color to fuck up your green screen, genius üöÄüöÄ
Cope and seethe
This album is by far the worst thing to grace the earth this album is equal to your grandpa trying to use modern day slang
Why do y‚Äôall use antisemitism as a bad word? The Jews have been killing Palestinians and reference the non Jews as literally being other.
if this was called &quot;for all the vultures&quot; you wouldve given it a 10/10
Album was so fire üî•
Fantano just hates Kanye and has a personal grudge. It&#39;s so obvious.
So Fantano can be a radical liberal, support Palestine, but he isn‚Äôt an antisemite? Stick to reviewing bozo, you voted for Biden
this is the greatest worst album of all time
You review music made by murderers and women abusers i dont see much of a difference, i dont think ye is a good person but you can still like the music. The murders infuse the murding into their music and you still like it, just rate the music save the review for the person for another video
7 minute yap session TLDR he barely reviews the music and doesn&#39;t like it
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=225">3:45</a> haha weird. you sounded like Cal a bit for a second there. How is Cal? Do you guys still talk?
I agree. This whole Jew thing is weird, what‚Äôs it even for
dude really did this? lol you know the album is not as trash as you make it look like bruh
Ye and his fans are deeeeeeeeep in this man‚Äôs head
It‚Äôs crazy how mixed reviews for this album are. Makes sense because Kanye has always been overrated even when his music is fantastic, along with the fact that his mental spiral has dragged him and the people on his dick into pure delusion
4th version‚Ä¶I seperate art from the artist, which I can see is hard with Kanye but‚Ä¶his music sounds good to my ears‚Ä¶therefore I like lol. All love melon. Just be nice
fantano fans thinking they&#39;re the funniest fucking person on the planet saying &quot;it would&#39;ve gotten a 10 if&quot; and then blending the albums name with TPAB or KSG
Yeah so according to melon Kanye is devil incarnate but Cardi, who has openly and proudly talked about drugging her clients and stealing their money in her previous profession is ‚Äòbeyond‚Äô these things now and is ashamed of her acts (apparently).
One things for sure.<br>Beautiful big titty butt naked women just dont fall out the sky ya know!!
Hey guys he does review the album he just says it‚Äôs Kanye‚Äôs worst album.
Could‚Äôve just said a light 5
You‚Äôll happily review albums from actual murderers thoughüòÇ
You are quite brave, Thanks!
So apparently sexy redd is amazing yet paid is ‚Äúbasic‚Äù and ‚Äúass‚Äù - just admit you hate Kanye. Sexy redd is shit and she ain‚Äôt gonna let u hit fucktano
so...is this a &#39;no review i refuse&#39; type scenario?
Soyboy 1
I found this record better than Sexy Redds debut LP
i‚Äôve been a kanye fan since getting into the genre. TLOP was the first rollout for any album ever where i was psyched about what an artist was doing and the culture around the music. i say this from a place of love for this man‚Äôs music.<br><br>this record is horrible.<br><br>i don‚Äôt even have the desire or energy to properly sit down and listen to it more than once. middling production for some who is regularly referred to as the goat in this regard. terrible writing and rapping all around. are there some genuinely good moments? maybe. is it still the most trash ye record yet? absolutely.<br><br>i don‚Äôt care to be in his cult of personality anymore. the rollout was a mess and, while i thought apologizing to his audience and his contemporaines (however scant it was) might lead to clearer skies, that‚Äôs sadly not the case.<br><br>ye barely has the desire to finish one record or make any cohesive statements, how are we supposed to expect him to finish three more? the worst part is, he‚Äôs convinced himself he‚Äôs right. that this has always been the plan and that anyone who brings forth criticism is preying on his downfall. i‚Äôd imagine that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called vultures, because he‚Äôs so incapable of seeing beyond his diminishing circle of influence that he can‚Äôt see the consequences as anything more than obstacles.<br><br>i feel like he can‚Äôt even make amends though. what could he say or do that will revive his image? you can‚Äôt really come back from this. i know vultures went number 1 and people will write it all off. but as a fan, i just want him to be better. even if that means never dropping again and just getting some help.
what a baby
see that&#39;s crazy and all but the record is good
Wtf?
Nerd
You would‚Äôve given it a 10 if it w- <b>goblin runs by</b> holy shit did you guys see that?
numbr 1 in over 100 countries   keep it moving herb
massive respect for you for doing this.
Having a 10 minute meltdown about this is way too crazy üíÄ
shut up
Cuck<br><br>Ye is üêê
When he said slavery was choice why weren‚Äôt you worried about what you would tell your black audience??
Anthony is so faaake, oh no,<br>The forecast said that there‚Äôd be snowflakes, whoa
Kanye stans are probably the same people that said they would never join a cult after watching a documentary.<br>David Koresh would thrive in this era
Wow I literally had no clue this came out. It never came up as new music on Apple Music so it just totally passed me by lol
womp womp
So don‚Äôt review burzum. Sellout dog
Albums a vibe! Fantano is trash
Back to Me is a banger though -  the Kanye refrain aside.
I love the song paid alot, its very open and funny
this review is clearly filled with political, personal bias. If you can‚Äôt separate the art from the artist in your reviews, I suggest you don‚Äôt review music. Focus on the ACTUAL music
Bro how about u address the things u claim are anti-$em****. U are no stranger to the music industry and the way it has exploited black artists‚Ä¶ who are the owners of the record labels? Who are owners of most corporate media?? Why is the conflict in the Middle East being so propagandized by the west ??? Who is behind that??? It‚Äôs not hateful it‚Äôs just uncomfortable truths about certain powerful people.
We should un subscribe . Anthony is an obvious shill. You ain&#39;t thats smart for a nerd .
Kanye would probably be the only one to get a no review
This ain‚Äôt even a review. This man just hates Ye. The 3 types of Ye fans part was funny thoüò≠üò≠. We sticking with Ye forever üêê
Man child
Boy the 9 other worst albums of 2024 are going to step it up a notch if they want to get the #1 spot.
Brother chilllll, you so angry you just started attacking people who would give it a listen and enjoy sum songs, the dude is trash but cmon that attitude will just make more hating psychos. I enjoy listening to Burn and Carnival and continue with my life without hating Jews or sum, I‚Äôm not American and I guess that‚Äôs why I might feel there‚Äôs no concerning consequences in the real world when he says something unhinged and acts like a complete clown, but personally I think there‚Äôs nothing wrong on picking some songs that sound kinda fire, I mean he ain‚Äôt no slowthai
40 year old divorced man try to separate politics from music challenge (IMPOSSIBLE EDITION)
<b>If this is unreviewable FINE</b> but don‚Äôt make Playboi Carti reviews, listen to David Bowie again or a myriad of other artists cos some of the biggest artists have done the same IF NOT WORSE.. your entitle to not listen to Kanye - the bad will towards him as been manufactured by himself and his actions.. but you have to perpetuate a double standard for so many artists to say you stand by this take.
Fagtano sounds like he puts  pronouns on his bio
Weird take, his album is number 1 in Israel
I expected this to be a biased negative review, but it actually has some well thought out and solid points. Very good review. Unsubscribed
Wheres your wife?
Is this a review on Kanye or on Vultures bro üíÄ
Fantano got a 1 review by Drake and went off the rails üíÄ
This is the same guy that preached about separating between the art and the artist. Yet, half of this video is him ranting about Kanye and not the album. Silly guy.
sounds nothing like kanye i was so excited for the album too, it was utter garbage
if it was called &quot;KIDS SEE VULTURES&quot; it would&#39;ve been a 10
This guy is a professional hater. Overly offended man baby
Utopia way worse you‚Äôre trippin.
this guy is so fucking annoying who listens to him anymore
Divorceable 1
Not Antoinette fantano being spitroasted by his entire comment section lmao
Man. This is very lame and close minded
U bot likes? 31 k views to 13k likes. Don‚Äôt disrespect big boss ye ur a hater lame old man.
What was the point of the video if you dislike all of the specificly anti jewish things? he was reviewable when slavery was a choice, he was reviewable when  George W Bush didn‚Äôt care  about black people, but he speaks on jewish people and now it‚Äôs not even worth a ‚Äúthis new kanye ty dolla $ign album is NOT GOOD‚Äù type video? We get it you‚Äôre a good person you disagree with his view but i‚Äôd rather you just shit on the MUSIC than his character. Most of these artist are scum bags kanye has done outlandish shit his entire career the difference now is the music is not as good as beforehand and the outlandish comments aren‚Äôt new they‚Äôre just jew specific now
So what you‚Äôre saying is that it‚Äôs already a classic
thats 100% understandable anyone who can&#39;t see the problem is living in goo goo ga ga stupid land, there&#39;s no way this review would come out normally or at least with either fantano pretending kanye isnt a crazy moron who goes out of his way to put himself totally into the music or a horde saying the most stupid things about the review every day for the rest of their lives.
Big dislike
Wagner was an antisemite, you can&#39;t say his operas aren&#39;t spectacular, rate the bloody music not the person.
BEAUTIFUL BIG MELON BUTT NAKED FANTANOS DONT JUST FALL OUT THE SKY, YA KNOW
I give this review an unreviewable out of 10
Fantano thinks hes gonna get cancelled if he feels any joy from the album
This is NOT unreviewable, you&#39;re just not capable to do it the right way, and this is the beginning of a downfall for a music reviewer like you, it doesn&#39;t matter if the album was bad, mid or good. This was just a completely biased rant.
criticizing the strawman you have on your bald head for how lonely they are, nice projecting
Bro literally lost all sense of credibility with this one, been watching for what feels a decade too.
Vultures gets hate but sexy redds album was an 8 like Kanye should at least get a 3 or 4 lol
I respect fantano a lot for doing this, I think it&#39;s totally fair to not promote an album in concern for others
This album was such a vibe though! I don&#39;t like Kanye as a person but I can appreciate the art. That&#39;s why you have to take away the art from the artist to appreciate music sometimes
I thought I was just a normal guy that loved some of Kanye&#39;s music, but also recognized his recent political takes as obviously awful. Now I know I&#39;m a parasocial cult member.
I give this review an unreviewable out of 10
Y‚Äôall are dense if you really don‚Äôt care about his hurtful comments. We shit on Tom Macdonald for his shitty music and lyrics, we all know it‚Äôs for the same type of reason
Im guessing no one wants to be canceled to say kanye and ty $ have some bangers on the album lol. Spineless fucks
ur bald
I feel like he should still review more of vultures, as he only really glossed over a few songs on the album. I understand that he doesn‚Äôt like Kanye‚Äôs lyrics about him being and antisemite (that‚Äôs perfectly fine and absolutely reasonable to be disgusted by it) but that is not the whole album. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôd ever hear a more thorough review of this album though sadly.
Waves don‚Äôt dieeee
Sooo I&#39;ve kinda liked the album, not all the songs though (the ones you mentioned are kinda bad especially the &quot;big titty woman don&#39;t fall of the sky you know&quot; part) but just to clarify that : I used to be huge Kanye fan up until TLAP, I never liked this album, and from this point all he did always sounded unfinished or not interesting to me, this one I gotta admit, i was not expecting anything but I enjoyed some songs. The major problem is the lyrics, we can&#39;t really act like he didn&#39;t write and rap horrible lines in this album, and that&#39;s the major issue with Kanye on his recent albums. So I enjoyed the listening, but even there was only bad albums that would come out after this one in 2024, this won&#39;t be in my top 10 projects or any top at the end of the year I guess<br><br>But you see, you&#39;re wrong about the 3 types of Kanye fans, there are still people like me (I hope) who still love his old music, but are not fan of everything he put out for the past 6-7 years
melon
I hope Peggy and Ye make and album together just to see you having a meltdown again
remember when you reviewed Burzum? I don&#39;t disagree with the points you made but the fact you have reviewed Varg of all people makes this completely disingenuous
So let‚Äôs all agree that Kanye is bad alright?!‚Ä¶what about sexy red ‚Ä¶ice spice‚Ä¶latto..etc.. you have your nose so up their asses you can tell us what they had for breakfast 2 days ago‚Ä¶ these 304s are promoting prostitution,immorality, and so many other shit but I guess we can pick and choose what works for us as bad and what is not‚Ä¶ ok got it üëçüèª<br>Either say that they are all shit and ‚Äúunreviewable‚Äù and be real and fair from all angles or stfu<br>And btw all rappers talk about their girls like that but I guess also only Kanye is fucked up for that
He did give kid see ghost a 10 though
4. You like his music and think he is clearly knowledgeable, hence his success.
The leaks were way better
Listen to &#39;The College Dropout&quot; instead. It&#39;s hard to believe, but that album just turned 20.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=274">4:34</a> this is how most people feel about Kanye and his music right now.
It really is worse than Donda 2
You aint a pop culture channel, you&#39;re a music reviewer.
I get some of your points but removing the art from the artist here is very easy. <br><br>Total overreaction that this album is about him being an antisemite. You&#39;ve got a few lines where he mentions it, but if that is all it takes for you to completely scrap the album and not review it, that is wild. You can totally skim over this stuff and just enjoy the album for what it is. If you don&#39;t like it, that&#39;s fine, but totally writing it off is pretty unprofessional, especially for a music reviewer.
are you gonna talk about the music or
I feel like it‚Äôs decent but not more than that, maybe like a 5/10 but I do think you might have misunderstood the line about Bianca, he seems to in love with her to disrespect her like your interpretation. <br><br>For me the highlight of the album is the song with North, I just think it‚Äôs so cute
Not even worth a tran-zition
I can‚Äôt wait for Vultures 2 now
Using that one fan as a strawman is lame too. That viewpoint is flawed but yours is just the opposite extreme. Think about it, on one hand we have a fan completely ignorant about ye‚Äôs actions but then we have you who are too damn caught up in them to even review an album on its own merit. The truth lies in the middle somewhere
It isn&#39;t that serious man. Oh no, he said &quot;keep a few Jews on the staff now.&quot; üò±what a monster ineligible for critique!  The same guy once said &quot;And a few white girls, asses flat as sh*t. But the head so good, dang a n*gga glad he hit.&quot; Was that lyric beyond critique because it is derogatory to white girls?
Nailed this. Thanks, @theneedledrop
Feel bad for him wish his mom was still here.
I find it strange how so many are able to listen to music by reprehensible people. Even when I&#39;ve tried because I truly enjoy an artist, after it&#39;s revealed that they are an awful person, I can&#39;t listen to it anymore. It&#39;s fine if people can, but the PRIDE with which people in these comments simply don&#39;t care is very indicative of why our world is the way it is.
You know you review MUSIC right? Thats it, we dont care about your opinion on this
Whys the album #1 in Israel then üòπüòπ
This album being a hit is fantanos 9/11
Bros really not taking the divorce well
Thank you for putting me on some of the most amazing music I&#39;ve listened to but if you think vultures 1 is bad I think it&#39;s time to retire
I like the record but I‚Äôll always respect Anthony for putting his thoughts out there especially when he knows hes gonna get hate for it.
but he said beautiful big tittied butt naked women and sfuff
Mad cuz his wife on the cover (gives melon ptsd)
The Kanye derangement syndrome is strong with this one.
Tbf there‚Äôs also a 4th category of Kanye fan (I‚Äôm in it) that thinks it‚Äôs tragic what has happened to his mental health, hopes he gets better support system/guidance, and still finds his pre-2017 catalog personally important, and so hopes with each new release that he pulls it back together
First 5 minutes is pure yapping. Get to the music bozo
Shut up nerd
As a half Jew with a very large Jewish family, this is a cop out. The album isn‚Äôt unreviewable, you‚Äôre just too afraid to review it. Stop being offended for other people, let them have their opinions on the matter, and you can have yours. All you had to do was denounce his bad messages, and then talk objectively about your experience listening to the album
SUCH A HATER HE DEFENDS KIM KARDASHIAN THE DEMON FAMILY OF THE USA MEDIA
Going from nfr review to this has got me split between opinions
Meltdown
but wht if danny brown made it?
NIGGA JUST REVIEW THE MUSIC HOLY SHIT WE DONT GAF ABOUT THE POLITICS MY GOD
I would understand where you‚Äôre coming from if you weren‚Äôt the same guy to give sexy red an 8 üíÄ
Bro just gave up on reviewing music and is just lambasting because he doesn‚Äôt like Kanye‚Äôs views. That‚Äôs okay but don‚Äôt guise it as a real music review, it‚Äôs a politics review.
oh stop, if this came from anyone else it would&#39;ve been granted a serious review. there&#39;s a ton of likable aspects of this album, the production alone can raise the value of it regardless of your morale standing with who he is and what he says
fantano such a hypocrite bruh<br><br>I know what kanye has done is bad, but the fantano will literally go out for someone like Lil Nas X who made fun of Christians and give him a good review but give the guy who made fun of Jewish people and say an album is unreviewable because of his actions. Pretty disappointed in the video and fantano
I give this review an unreviewable out of 10
Love everyone y‚Äôall , especially melon . Our brother is just confused
Its ass fr
didn‚Äôt your wife leave you baldie?
dont care, shit is fireüî•üî•
So you&#39;ll review the work of rappers who literally rap about killing people, but criticizing Jewish influence is too far? Crazy man
U not even reading the lyrics right bruh ü§°
I take this as a 10/10
There is not a single universe where you can convince me this album is bad. It has diverse hype songs with great verses. Only skip is Talking for obvious reasons. The rest are absolute bangers in every sense of the word
I don&#39;t think fantano understands the reference line. Genuinely. I think he meant reference of as in a reference in a design process.
i like the end of the album . post the track vultures this album is less about misogany for stripclub filler sake  and reusing ye ideas with diffrent artist on it , the end is all the problems with ye right now self fogiving himself in his music and crowing himself king after saying hes like the pope with his misogyny problem the hype is real
Plenty of people eat their boogers and believe in equal rights.
It makes me sad to read the comments and realize that Kanye&#39;s fandom is filled with children who are going to defend everything he does tooth and nail because they don&#39;t understand the seriousness of the things he says.<br><br>as a Kanye fan i&#39;m going to miss waiting for a new kanye album so much, this shitty music makes me miss the eras of Donda, MBDTF, yeezus, ye and all the incredible albums he gave us in the past, albums with a message or at least something to get out of them, not like this meaningless shit.<br><br>I really miss old kanye.
The internet‚Äôs biased music nerd
Bro just review the music we don‚Äôt care about your political views
Worst album is crazy
Yo green screen bugging bald ass vro
Unreviewable = too high for 10/10
This is just genuinely a bad review
Fantano is a college student trapped in a  middle-aged mans body
If this was Kendrick and Baby Keem Melon would have loved how Kendrick is just having fun less oblagation just like hillbilly‚Äôs that song was fucking trash
Ok melon, we get it. You‚Äôre the king
Jewthony Cucktano
LMFAOOOO
I don&#39;t see the issue if he made love to a jewish woman
review the album not the guy man that‚Äôs what your paid for
Womp womp just make a proper review and stop crying
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=334">5:34</a> i hope he didn&#39;t say what he said
KANYE THE ONLY ONE GETTING A 10 AND UNREVIEWABLE, HE IS INDEED THE GOAT OF THIS GENERATION
I&#39;d like a joke review, where &quot;separate the art from the artist&quot;, but meaning just look at everything not kanye, review jpegs production and the ft
3 minutes in haven‚Äôt talked about the music ‚Ä¶. why even make this video
Now let&#39;s cry how wikipedia does not put your ratings on their site
hey man but kanye still has a wife a you dont. I think your relationship was unreviewable too
b-b-but the production brooooo stop being such a hater grrr üò°üò°üò°
Bro really Botted likesüíÄ
Fantano is a stankin joo confirmed ‚úÖ
ALL the people working with Kanye are like the 3 types of fans you mentioned? I doubt It also you are bald
But you can listen to and review death grips ??? And call that music??? Lol this channel is about to Die !
I get hating Kanye fans I really do hate Kanye fans, but you don‚Äôt wanna platform him when you‚Äôll let Travis Scott slide who is partially responsible for the astroworld tragedy? Your a music reviewer and you know it, people come to you for opinions on music not people, we all know Kanye sucks but we also want to hear about the music, you don‚Äôt wanna let him say stupid shit but you‚Äôll keep the daughters review and the burzum review, you‚Äôll generalize a worldwide fanbase off a collective of stupid and bigoted individuals, you could‚Äôve given a normal review and nobody would complain, instead your pointing out your hypocrisy holy
This fool just dislikes greatness
A 7 minutes review that takes 5 to start talking about music  is insane
I mean I liked the album
If you can&#39;t put your personal Kanye vendetta aside and focus purely on the musical aspect of the album, then please don&#39;t upload a video and act like this is the worst shit since the last Tom Macdonald album. As you mentioned, there are a lot of things to criticize about Vultures, but it seems like you&#39;ve already made up your mind when it comes to him. We get it, you hate him, but you don&#39;t have to lecture us and serve up the same shit every time his name is mentioned. I don&#39;t get it, just don&#39;t cover him anymore.
Mental Illness is the realness.
You are capping but I understand why it‚Äôs complicated and it‚Äôs all good. I understand.
Melons only goal with this was to get sampled on Vultures 2
I‚Äôm good on this channel now it was nice while it lasted
he somehow made a more disrespectful review than the dark sky paradise review. and tbh, deservingly so.
You‚Äôre acting like nearly as big of a child as Kanye does. Letting a man make you this angry by simply releasing  music is sad man. Literally nobody comes to your channel to see content like this. Upsetting that you‚Äôll still post him just to get the views though.
BEAUTIFUL BIG TITTY WOMEN DONT JUST FALL OUT THE SKY YOU KNOW
this is an L take.
Dude you just need to just stop and take a breather. You‚Äôre getting way too mad at this. This album completely broke you. Which I saw coming, since you‚Äôve been on that dumb moral high ground ever since the 2017 FADER article, but this is an all-time low man. Just log off, stop acting like your opinion is better than people who like this record, and go Find God.
3 mins into this video and we are still listening to what you think about Kanye as a person. Is this even an album review or na?
Hater
If this album was named &quot;She put that thong on my Groing Groing and then it go Boing&quot; you would&#39;ve given it a 10
If it was called ‚Äúkids see vultures‚Äù it would be reviewable
If it was called  &quot;To Pimp a Vulture&quot; you would&#39;ve give it a 10/10
He is crazy. Needs help and/or medication.
the album was obviously made by clonye anthony ‚Ä¶
I love Anthony but in this video he comes off as the worst guy to talk to on any college campusüò≠
Fantano has no credibility because of his far left leaning politics , he‚Äôs not a good reviewer and I‚Äôve never valued his lame opinions
but you reviewed it, fantano üò¢
If this was called ‚Äúkids see vultures‚Äù he would‚Äôve given it a ten
Everything time he give a bad review I like the album üòÇ
why would anyone listen to this bald divorcee
fair
fantano&#39;s best hitler impression with the stache, what a tribute
If Anthony wasn‚Äôt Jewish he would‚Äôve gave it a different score
Bro the album had so many good tracks what do you mean
If it was called &#39;Scaring The Vultures&#39; you would&#39;ve given it a light 9
Might have a leg to stand on if you didn‚Äôt monetise the hit piece
U didn‚Äôt give MBDTF a 10 so I wasn‚Äôt really expecting a decent take on a new Ye album
always been overrated, his very best stuff is mid
i dont understand this guy. all i see is someone who was like &quot;kanye fans bad&quot; without realising they 1. make up half the music industry and 2. probably his audience aswell making this video him basically saying his fans are stupid.
My antisemitic king üëë
fantano when the music isnt sexyy red
this is ultimately gonna attract the braindead kanye fans but this will ultimately be right
You went full pandering. Sucks to see man.
Ok I will admit that Kanye in the past 2 years has not been the greatest person and has said so many horrible things but this album was not this bad. I feel like this is more of a review of Kanye himself rather than the album because it‚Äôs definitely not his best but it‚Äôs not the worst album that Fantano has ever reviewed<br><br>Edit: ok bad wording on the first part but yes he absolutely has done many, many, many, MANY horrible things over the past 2 years but you get my point
this actually kinda makes sense
listened to the album today and it was awful, only song i liked even a little was &quot;burn&quot;
Check outbsome other reviewers!  Theyll give an impartial breakdown of the features, production and the overall meaning in Ye&#39;s character development.<br><br>I give this review a 0/10.
why didn‚Äôt you do this immediately after his antisemitic rant like you did to tory right after the meg shooting?
Kanye is a caricature of his former self. To further establish himself as an ever-evolving prick, it seems he knows no bounds on becoming a more disgusting being. Guess you could say he&#39;s BOUND 2 slowly descending into becoming more sickening.
Bro you just lost it‚Ä¶
How‚Äôs the divorce tubs
I&#39;m glad you could give us biased takes and moral lessons instead of properly reviewing the music
anthony just because your wife left you doesn‚Äôt mean you have to take it out on ye‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è
album was good, enjoyed it. been listening to back to me on repeat
ah, the bald fraud is back to reviewing music again
so this is worse than a &quot;not good&quot;, right?
&gt;unreviewable<br><br>&gt;still reviews it
Only 3 tracks in and it sounds super quickly slapped together. Sound design is awful.
Bootlicker extraordinaire. This is just a cope for his most recent disastrous review that delegitimized his platform
If hes already having a meltdown from this, just imagine if a Peggy x Ye album ever gets outüíÄ
ty dolla sign repeating im just here to get paid over and over again is so funny
u say hoodrat is annoying and give the money store a 10, good one
His opinion is so biased because he‚Äôs a leftist. Anthony is forgetting the fact that YE is mentally ill and has episodes. Anthony had a picture of him in blackface scrubbed from the internet but yea sure his opinion matters on this subject.
Kanye gonna hand you your most-viewed video, and you know it. Still feeding into the machine.
Damn Fantano is broken and drake insulted his wife
Fantanos post divorce mental episode was capsulated so well in this video I‚Äôll give it a light 6 ‚ù§
Won‚Äôt review the album but has made countless videos discussing the Kanye drama for views ü§£ü§£ü§£ this a low point for the melon man
My curiosity will never be satiated.
2015 Fantano would‚Äôve done a review
Anthony you are just a sheep on the Kanye hate train. If this album actually had any semi-listenable songs and fun to listen to, you would‚Äôve given it a good review üò°
No disrespect, but Ye&#39;s new girl is probably just what you described, nothing more
A lot of 2. And 3. In the commentsüòÇ
Fantano out here trying to get the clicks. 0/10 do better!
I think he likes it LMAO
Fantano cares more about Kanye‚Äôs words about Jews than he cares about the Jews that are blowing up and massacring people üòÇ
i‚Äôve never really fully enjoyed kanye. He has the mentality obsessive spoiled rich misogynistic boy in high school. the people who claim that his production is revolutionary never really convinced me his music was mind blowing. The narcissism and the validation of it was weird. <br><br>The accusation that I don‚Äôt like kanye because I‚Äôm white was never fun to listen to. There‚Äôs just cooler producers out there. I don‚Äôt just didn‚Äôt like the beats or the flows. I was more into DnB and other stuff anyway. But I‚Äôm a little tickled that the self proclaimed genius who was beyond criticism in any form has become political and socially radioactive because of his personality. <br><br>Narcissism is trauma response but it‚Äôs a big red flag too.
You are so fucking hypocritical
Bro could&#39;ve just said 6, no one actually watches the videos
Melon would‚Äôve just gave it a not good or a 0 if he actually didn‚Äôt like it lol
A YouTube music reviewer refuses to review music and posts a video having nothing to do with the music. great job
Bros balder than Kanye üòÇ
Eh dunno how to feel about this. Kanye is a complete loser chud rn but you‚Äôre not reviewing for the rabid fans of anyone so idk why you‚Äôd use that as an excuse. And if it was because you were afraid of giving a proper score to someone problematic idk thats arguably fairer but idk i‚Äôm torn on that
This is for sure your most corny vid just review it you are a music reviewer stop chudding over what you think about the person
It&#39;s his best album other than the first 3 and Kids See Ghosts
this guy is a professional Kanye hater lol
i think we need to stop acting like kanye is fine to do all this. he needs genuine help, and needs to stop treating everyone like they are benth him. its literally becoming a atrocity exhibtion
SOY ENERGY
Mad respect for you Anthony
The Xitter freaks defending this are weird as fuck.
I listened to the first 3 songs and NOPE
Love seeing these controversy reviews! Looking forward to the the music review soon!
Talks about this but not Boldy&#39;s new shit
Wlr effect melon watch‚Ä¶
Dudes losing his credibility with reviews like this.
As a Jew in your audience, I don&#39;t think you&#39;re a friend of the Jews. You are almost as prejudiced as Kanye.
sure lil bro
Unironically might be Anthony‚Äôs best review.
I was curious to know if you suspected some a.i. or posthumous chicanery. I think he‚Äôs dead.
Lil Nas X: fully mocks Christians <br>Anthony: I like this<br><br>Kanye: doesn‚Äôt like Jews <br>Anthony: I hate this guy<br><br>(I don‚Äôt want hate between Jews and Christians, I just want you guys to know how this guy is a piece of crap)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=122">2:02</a> it‚Äôs pretty ignorant to not acknowledge the 4th group of fans which is people who just enjoy the  music and don‚Äôt condone the outrageous stuff he‚Äôs said. Like he‚Äôs one of the top artists in the world and you‚Äôre really arguing that every single fan can fit into one of those 3 categories?
you&#39;re making a fool of yourself with this one, just dont review it, no one is forcing you
bro this review is insane he hates kanye more than anyone else
You have reviewed albums from literal murderers, so it doesn&#39;t make sense that you find this so morally dubious. Also, the album isn&#39;t even bad. You&#39;re just listening to it throught the lens of &quot;this is going to be trash&quot; get a grip boomer
Agreed, I wouldn‚Äôt want to review Nazi propaganda either
I like the sound and vibes, I never really care about what rappers are saying because it&#39;s pretty unrelatable and honestly don&#39;t know anything about other stuff going on, most artists are messed up ..but vibes yes (for me)
I have no idea why this album and Kanye specifically got to you so much. It&#39;s really out of character for you, because 99% of the time, you come across as a really reasonable dude. I&#39;m sure on a different day, you would&#39;ve not taken this so seriously. Is the anti-Jewish shit that Kanye spouts really THAT much worse than all the anti-Muslim and anti-Christian other artists regularly spout? I don&#39;t see you going off on that.
If this community was unique all the comments would be different
If the album was named Vultuspine it would be a 10/10<br>Kanye invented a new category, thats why hes the GOATT üêê
this guy has completely lost it
hater
fantano yk you‚Äôre supposed to review the music and not the person right
i dont like fantano or music critcism in general. however, i know Ye fans will foam at the mouth because of this especially because it is in exact opposition to what Ye has shown over the past years: integrity
shes a reference to his preference in women. how is that dehumanizing lol what are you on about fantano. i mean the album was trash but damn
A badge of honor for Kanye fans. Fanta has melted down.
bro can‚Äôt do his job.
You cannot subjectively say anything bad about the song BURN. I disagree with the review but to give a 1/10 suggests that you have not really listened to BURN or this album as a whole.
Ye still breaking records &amp; trekking through uncharted territory üòÖ hes tight ASF the album is so good or else hed say its trash &amp; then cry like this. Btw none of the bars he put on the screen with such confidence were specifically antisemitic. Questionable..? Maybe. But i truly think the majority of Ye&#39;s issue is frustration/envy when it comes to Jewish people. Hes been slowly mentioning this for at least 5 albums. Then i think he was told he &quot;couldn&#39;t &quot;do this &amp; &quot;had&quot; to do that &amp; the ppl who rold him were all Jewish. Its no secret they&#39;re very successful. The Pasternak thing is an entirely different story. One that could create conspiracies.. and it wouldn&#39;t be Ye&#39;s fault.
I sense this is the beginning of the end of his youtuber arc. <br><br><br>Depending on how things turn out.
Yap session
So much bias nowadays Anthony
But what about the rest of us Tony? <br>Oh nvm this actually was a review
Ur wife was a light 1 and she still divorced uüòÇüëÜüòÇ
review dizzee rascal
I think you&#39;ve become blinded by hate, Anthony. Let it go.
Unwatchable video
Hell yeah dude, this fucking rules
&quot;That&#39;s all I have to say. Thank you, bye.&quot;<br><br>Jesus, no score, no transition, not even an end card. That&#39;s <b>disappointment.</b>
no
I liked the song he did with Ty Dolla Sign. Iunno, I can separate the art from the artist if I dig the art. Like his Poopy Poopy Ima Poopy song he did was like trash but like his older stuff is good. It‚Äôs like I grew up on Lostprophets and Chris Benoit and like I don‚Äôt like Ian Watkins or Chris Benoit as people and what they did was reprehensible I‚Äôll still listen and watch their stuff because I can see that their dope and it‚Äôs like if Kanye West did a rap song about his beliefs it‚Äôd be trash even if it‚Äôs super hard to be pro-Semitic what with their motherland committing genocide against the Palestinians I don‚Äôt think that anti-semitism is ever the answer.<br><br>The point I‚Äôm trying to make is that if I didn‚Äôt listen or follow anyone who did crazy shit then I‚Äôd be listening or watching nothing.<br><br>Finally if you really want to listen to something literally unreviewable then try listening to my music. It‚Äôs legit shit dawg, it‚Äôs the worst album of all time.
This is the definition of cringe‚Ä¶
Melon went from reviewing music to mentally analyizing Kanye¬¥s and his legion of fans, providing a psychological pattern of all things, what an upset lol
Professional Kanye haterüòÇü´µ
RATIO
U give it unlistenable cuz you&#39;re bald like Vultures !!!!
As a professional reviewer or critic it‚Äôs his job to put his personal opinions and feelings aside. The fact that in the beginning you said you can‚Äôt review it then proceed to criticize it shows the hypocrisy in your own statements. I understand you don‚Äôt agree with his  actions but as a professional you should be able to put your personal feelings aside. There‚Äôs many artist not just in music that have said and done terrible things but you cannot deny their artistic capabilities. However you‚Äôre a YouTuber and your own boss so by all means keep doing what you do. You‚Äôve stated your opinion and I‚Äôve said mine.
Yeah this is exactly how it feels, like what is the point of even talking about this as a project and Kanye as an artist. I‚Äôve lost all my love for his music in the past year or so. I totally get the tiredness in this review.
Everybody is joking around in the comments, but I think it&#39;s the best decision to not give into this shit, Kanye is off his rails and anybody who says otherwise is a sycophant weirdo. Let&#39;s be real, there&#39;s no reason to give a damn about anything Kanye does, he doesn&#39;t give a fuck about anything anymore, so why should we?
Ratio
holy shit a score worse than not good, and kanye&#39;s the first one to receive it. Fucking legendary.
You‚Äôre a sad sad man. Living a NOT GOOD life.
Woah there buddy let‚Äôs lay off the soy just a little bit?
I think u just hatin
yeaaaah I&#39;m unsubbing. Goodbye, buddy
I‚Äôm jewish and this is the funniest meltdown I‚Äôve ever seen from a music reviewer<br><br>Edit: wonder how peggy feels watching this
When Kanye says she‚Äôs a reference, he means she‚Äôs so beautiful that it‚Äôs a reference to others, I don‚Äôt think u understood the bar
Professional Kanye HaterüòÇü´µ
I was afraid you might actually legitimize this human piece of shit with a real review, so this comes as a relief. You&#39;re right: there&#39;s no talking to anyone still in Kanye&#39;s fanbase and nobody else would give this a try, so why bother?<br>Also, Ty, you know what we call people who collaborate with Nazis just to line their own pockets? Nazis.
<b>album reaches #1 on several global charts</b> <br><br>fantano: this is unlistenable
bro if you like the music you like the music, separate art from artist. I love the album and will continue to listen to it while not being anything like kanye or being a fan of what he says or does.
‚Äúunreviewable‚Äù is the ‚Äúsee me after class‚Äù of fantano scores üíÄ
Yip yap fantano it‚Äôs not even bad
Sounds like he had Spotify
Cope lmao
drake actually dropped a better album than kanye thats crazy
Kanye tax
Kanye got melon whining this is a W thank you ye
this is the worst video on Kanye West ever made.
You can&#39;t just say HOODRAT for the entire video and say it&#39;s a review anthony
I understand and somewhat agree with where you‚Äôre coming from but I actually really liked the album. For me it‚Äôs all about cool production and this album has some great moments. It‚Äôs really tricky to separate the art from the artist with Ye but I genuinely just like the music and I don‚Äôt really feel bad for enjoying the art.
internets biggest loser
I&#39;m not buyin it dog. The charts are speaking for themselves.
I only like Carnival and Burn pretty underwhelming
As a former #3....even I&#39;ve had to abandon Ye. I would be able to sarcastically overlook certain things if the music was still good... but it&#39;s terrible. I think he&#39;s completely unraveled and there&#39;s nobody in the room to tell him he has no business making music right now. This is what you get when you have a huge platform, mental health issues to include overwhelming narcissism, and absolutely nothing of value to say or put into an artistic outlet. <br><br>I still haven&#39;t listened to it and I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to. AK Bandamont just dropped thoooooo
Review the musicüö´üö´ base your review off his personality that has nothing to do with the albumüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç‚úÖ‚úÖ
fantano when music isn‚Äôt just screaming and random noises
Un reviewable yet you didnt fully listen to the project therefore your viewpoint is not credible
this mf talking about Kanye&#39;s life instead of the music
You‚Äôve actually lost the plot, ur in a bigger manic episode than ye himself
Fantano L
that face in the thumbnail is the most twitter soyboy look i&#39;ve ever seen lmao
the sheer vitriol on here being leagues above even his most negative NOT GOOD reviews is SO INSANE to witness i literally gasped at the thumbnail<br><br>but, unfortunately, this level of pure dislike is really the only respectful way to review this album
Hahahahahahahahhaahhahh
on the next album release can you just like review persona 3 reload instead (i havent played it yet im waiting for the steam sale and im gonna beat p5s)
i remember growing up wondering how humans could possibly have stood for the nazi movement or allowed the holocaust to unfold, but i get it now: indifference
Are you okay
he&#39;s still advertising ye&#39;s music by putting out this video, even if he uses the video to condemn ye. If he really wanted to talk a moral stance against antisemitism, Fantano should just have a policy to never mention Ye or his music. This feels like a half effort that fantano can still profit from while seeming morally superior. Lame.
Vultures is the epitome of why you shouldn&#39;t just blindly support an artist by &quot;separating the art from the artist&quot;<br>Are you sure you wanna support this? even in his lyrics its the most visible and apparent garbage spewing ignorance is the LAST THING you should have here, he&#39;s a fuckin sucky dangerous human being that should not be supported more than he already is
Very interesting video, but I do wonder where you draw the line for controversial artists now. What&#39;s the difference between reviewing a nazi and somebody who sexually assaults others? Or somebody who puts their fans in danger like Travis Scott? Or somebody who chooses to work with nazis like JPEGMAFIA. I agree with your points in the video, but I do hope you talk more about these kind of topics on you second channel because it&#39;s an interesting conversation to have.
Reminder: you can block artists on Spotify and you should block Kanye. There&#39;s a lot more music out there
Fantano, as always, makes a seriously level-headed statement on a person he&#39;s often admired and appreciated - one of the few artists whose work he&#39;s given his highest rating. Hope all the Ye stans here enjoy tasting their own tears to this review, no doubt it reminds them of Ye&#39;s sweet semen‚Ñ¢Ô∏è they usually guzzle on the regular. <br>Take a good hard look at yourself in the mirror boys - you&#39;re willing to overlook overt blatant Naziism just to dickride mid from a guy that doesn&#39;t even know y&#39;all exist? Get it together.
He‚Äôs no.1 in Israel rn broüò≠
Damn guess you can‚Äôt be a fan of Kanye music unless your a terrible person
L Melonhead
anthony please touch some grass. it&#39;s time
You&#39;re pathetic bro!
Nothing is worse than Jesus Is King
ur weird for this
Really enjoyed seeing Michael Jackson on classics week!
As an antisemite, the album is trash.
you&#39;re boring mate
You&#39;ve always been a music critic and when it comes to the Vultures 1 you&#39;re suddenly an activist....how convenient
Melon made like 3 different shorts about vultures and didn‚Äôt even review it üòÇ
Damn, Kanye buck broke you hard
Ty saying he‚Äôs just showing up for the money‚Ä¶and they say we Jews are greedy lol üôÉ
Im sure you‚Äôd treat your wife better than Kanye
bro hates ye lmao
Oh I knew you weren&#39;t fully all there Anthony but I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d actually have zero media literacy on top of needing shock therapy
I‚Äôm just gonna ignore the multiple burzum reviews on ur channel
Might as well have ‚ÄúHATER‚Äù written on your forehead
Kanye the goat
The past few years, I‚Äôve grown increasingly aware and worried about the prevalence and toxicity of celebrity worship, and I feel that this album and its rollout almost exemplify that culture at its worst extreme. It doesn&#39;t matter if you‚Äôre a literal nazi - if you‚Äôre a celebrity that I like, I don&#39;t care. All these cultists screaming about &quot;separating art from the artist&quot; when in reality they just want an excuse to continue supporting an awful person - an excuse to engage with art in ignorant, uncritical ways.<br><br>Listen to the music, but don&#39;t kid yourself. You <b>are</b> supporting an awful person. No ifs. No buts. Just fucking own it.
Youre are the one who loves The Smiths? Right? Just cheking
FANTANO sounds more and more insane left liberal... I&#39;m going to guess that he has TDS as well...üòÇ Vultures has bangers.. Is it 808s or MBDTF no.. but come on man.. its up there with PABLO..
Hating
In all seriousness, the ‚Äòbut he made Graduation‚Äô meme has done irreparable damage to the way Kanye and music in general is discussed on the internet because it‚Äôs being repeated like a mantra to completely destroy any semblance of critical thought
this is the worst review you&#39;ve ever made
I was stunned when i finished the album. I don‚Äôt know if there are any tracks worth returning to, at all. I detest Drake‚Äôs music but I‚Äôd even say I‚Äôd rather listen to a drake album over the shallow, uninspired mess that is Vultures.
kanye music so good it wasn‚Äôt even reviewable üò≠
Yap yap yap review the album already
Donda was great but this new album was complete trash. Surprised that he completely missed the mark on this one.
lol Kanye won
Glad you loved it
Fuck what he‚Äôs saying this a 8/10 minimum
Thank god I keep seeing everyone praise this album and I was seriously confused. It sounds so uncohesive and Kanye has never struggled this bad at singing or rapping ever. Im so confused as to how there are so many positive comments about it when it doesn‚Äôt even hold a candle to his old stuff
Thought this was supposed to be a music review, not a lecture
If the album was good you would give it a reasonably good review and score
Snowflake
But he liked 21 jump street
Was waiting for a review since saturday but i dont know what I was expecting
the album is 10/10 fire
The green screen is bad, the quality falls sometimes, only 7 minutes of review to a 55 minutes album and most important, a common L. I give this review a Not Good
As if a chorus that doesent repeat itself isnt common dumbas, and paid is way catchier than paid, LOL love how you rank albums by how much you like the peroson making themüòÇ
What a gayguy
if it was called &#39;&#39;To Pimp A Jewish Pie&#39;&#39;  he would have given it a bar mitzvah/10
for how disappointed melon is, ironically an unreviewable is a more iconic score than something mid or low tier, and kanye continues to play the internet like a fiddle
Anthony Fantano can&#39;t review an album because MUH POLITICS. Sad.
If it was made by death grips this would‚Äôve been a 10
Goofy ass
Yeah that Jesus verse completely turned me off from the album. I had to turn it off after hearing that.
So why has fantano gone back and reviewed albums from the smiths in a positive light when Morrissey holds equal if not worse views than Kanye?
Man I used to think fantano was the best reviewer on youtube now I don‚Äôt even know what to say, just remember how a few weeks ago you were defending someone making fun of christians and according to you that is ok but this is unreviewable üòÜüòÜ
üò∂
ye broke this man
To pimp a kids see vultures=20/10
Damn Kanye got some CAKE on that album cover üò≥üò≥üò≥üò≥
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=9">0:09</a> ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ big suck
Anthony is just mad because Kanye knows how to get a second wife after his first
Kanye became the most streamed artist in the world today. There must be a lot of psychopathic, cult member, parasocials in the world
I don‚Äôt know how I should feel üò≠ I honestly liked this album but I hate the idea of loving Kanye because of what he has done and said.
Calm down üò≠
so basically you hate kanye and to justify why you were unable to judge it you want us to be unable to judge it as well and anybody who disagrees is a delusional kanye fan
Amazing, simply amazing.
Kanye said it ‚ÄúThis the shit that makes rap n*<b>gas mad</b>
I don‚Äôt think that fantano realizes that by insulting Kanye fans for liking an album, he‚Äôs insulting two thirds of his entire fanbase
Tearing down black art again for the engagement‚Ä¶ again. Integrity down the toilet.
Shut up
Personally, I hate nearly everything Kanye has been saying as of the past few years. <br>I can also say that I enjoyed listening to this album. I found it entertaining. <br>But I would never defend this nor try to promote it to anyone. Is it good? Is it bad? Idk. I got a kick out of listening to it, but the shit he‚Äôs been on has sent me packing as a fan. I‚Äôm over this clown shit and this might be the last album I listen to from this guy. <br>Fully respect everything Fantano said here too. It‚Äôs honest.
Where did he actually get his credibility from, like what makes him think that only he and his opinion can be righ? Does he have any music to back up for his criticism? Or is he just plainly hating cause it‚Äôs Kanye and can‚Äôt review it unbiased
Excellent, take!
Kanye&#39;s like a year away from dropping a collab with Moonman.
The ass was the best part of the album
If it was called kids see vultures you would give it a 10
#1 in Israel
Here come the suburban white high schoolers with angry tears in their eyes writing some stupid brainrot take about how this dogshit is somehow good and melon doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs talking about
Damn, i really wanna listen to this album now. I bet it&#39;s fire
baldüí©
Thanks for clarifying why Palestine should cease to exist, Melon!
I‚Äôm a Kanye fan. <br>I just like the guy‚Äôs music enough to disregard his recent actions.
lmao cope harder
Well, Jimmy Page fucked a 14 years old and you review Zeppelin as a classic, so...<br><br>Bowie once was very interesting in nazism, and Ozzy said he was inspired by HTLR
We need Jesus is king Kanye back
The album has some amazing songs on it, Burn sounds like classic Kanye, paperwork has a hard beat, back to me, as funny as the sample is, is actually solid. Even talking is a good song, especially once again with Ty&#39;s amazing vocals. I see some hate for vultures, mainly because the song came out a while ago now, but I really enjoy it, the album in total is not even close to bad. His situation is unfortunate but you can&#39;t just say this album is his worst when it literally has top tier songs in it.
then don¬¥t do it you smug phony
4: people who just like his music
Bro I just lreally ike Kanyes music - its not that deep. Most fans fear any interview he&#39;s in
Melon is tweaking hard. I‚Äôd give this a light to medium 8. Actually pretty good.
Bro j keeps yapping. L video
Kanye‚Äôs fanbase is pretty much just a religion at this point
Fack by eminem‚úÖÔ∏è a couple racist bars üö´
This is a cop out
Moral highground personified
This is the review equivalent of ‚Äúthis is my last post on this forum‚Äù just don‚Äôt review it, oh wait, money. You either have morals or you don‚Äôt.
Sometimes I think Kanye doesn&#39;t have an opinion or a personality. He just has an aesthetic that gets him the most marketing.
Filtered melon lmao.
nonsense. this is simply bias. so what you dont agree with his views. you are a reviewer! you are treating it like hitlers made an album featuring his right hand nazi
Arent jews commiting a genocide rn thinking
bro but meanings could differ in an art form and depend a lot on the pov I feel like your being too hard on this
You reviewed tracks from Vultures on your live stream, then you half reviewed tracks on this video. If you cared so little about what Kanye had to say then you should have never listened to the album in the first place. You continue to post about it and profit off what he says. Put your money where your mouth is and don&#39;t give him space if you don&#39;t want him to have space.
WOMP WOMP LIL NGA ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
but your a vegan and kanye is the goat and you have no wife so your jealous and also kanye is a geniuis and your not so gg kanye wins and the album is 8/10 and very good an d you could never make better albuim or be more influential or be the n1 strream artist in the world as na indepentind atrist. <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg"></a><a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg"></a><a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/G8AfY6yWGuKuhL0PlbiA2AE"></a> aslo kanye is the goat and most infkluetian artist of all time nexct to micheal jackson and el vis presyhl <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/E8MfY5u7JPSXkNAP95GAmAE"></a><a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/E8MfY5u7JPSXkNAP95GAmAE"></a><a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/ygF1XpGUMMjk8gSDrI2wCx"></a><a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/hcMfY5_zAbbxvwKLooCoCA"></a><a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/Z8MfY8mzLbnovwK5roC4Bg"></a> u vegan go tell u therpaist about ur wife leave u and u wish kanye wasnt king still the king alsways the king
nav is dropping this year so who even cares about this irrelevant &quot;kanye&quot; guy üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
We cancelled R. Kelly for what he did, and now we cancel Ye for what he said
You really pulled the &quot;everybody that dont agree with me is a looser&quot; card lmao
production on this album is downright heavenly
Ye the üêê
This makes me want to listen to this now, which I had no desire to do so before lol
Lots of very upset man children in these comments
RIP Fantano, such a fall from grace
This comment section is a mess
#1 in israel btw
You refuse to review Kanye because of his controversy. There‚Äôs so many other artists with terrible pasts that you don‚Äôt get political with. Marilyn Manson, as a single example, literally R-worded women and you can still review his music. <br>Grow the fuck up. Unsubscribed
It&#39;s Kanye&#39;s Star Fox Zero
I like the album , I have no complaints. Shout out jpegmafia with producer credits on 4 tracks.
He hated this album so much bro started questioning why he reviews musicüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
This disrespectfull to ty$ he deserves a review
Peggy was so happy to work with Ye he didn&#39;t even bother to produce those tracks to not sound like trite garbage.
mega soyout bruh, just review the song
The album is good imo tbh
Crythony jewtano
He&#39;s a Swiftie, ofc he&#39;s not liked the album
So Burzum is fine to review and praise? But not Kanye?
Weren&#39;t you all up kanyes ass at one point? Like he was some sort of &quot;genius&quot;? What changed?
Fantano a Jew lover?
You just reviewed the recordüòÇüòÇ
Ye&#39;s crazy, the albums cool tho.
LMAOOOOO
How much are they paying you? Jesus Christ this is embarrassing
This bald fuck the only guy that just won‚Äôt take the music for what it is lol
Looking at just the YouTube comments of Fantano&#39;s reactions to some songs off this in the New Music Friday stream really does show who&#39;s left in the Kanye fanbase. There are no reasonable, level-headed adults left. Just children and bigots.
Na ye made him crazy üòÇüòÇüòÇ
SEPERATE THE FUCKING SOUND OF THE SONG FROM THE LYRICS AND RATE THE ALBUM PUSSY
why do you look like that?
This is the gayest thing I‚Äôve ever witnessed. Are you aware that his Jewish handler threatened to send him to the insane asylum ‚Äúlike last time‚Äù and that he wouldn‚Äôt ever see his kids again.
insane amount of glazing in the comments
Kanye&#39;s fanbase acts almost the same as Taylor&#39;s fanbase, and that&#39;s very ironic
bro laughs at his own jokes
In this video, a Redditor tries to make you forget he was Sam Hyde&#39;s biggest fan.
So he has to make it political and won‚Äôt talk about the music lol
pero dilo sin llorar
What makes me really depressed is how his daughter is on this album. I can‚Äôt imagine what it‚Äôs been like for these kids to watch their father implode into this hateful maniac in the public eye, and now he‚Äôs taken it one step further and brought on a child onto the album, essentially making her a prop for his bullshit. I can only hope he snaps out of it and gets the actual help he clearly needs, but I honestly doubt it.
Fantano is hater bro
W take Anthony
so why did you make a video about this? smh
Bro got so butthurt by people making divorce jokes on Twitter
Lil bro, you are NOT a victim, do your job and review it.
Find God
Fantano is becoming unbearably annoying
I don&#39;t think I&#39;m alone in this but I used to be a MASSIVE Kanye fan, and his personality was always a fun addition to it as he had very entertaining moments in the media. <br>But this entire thing has ruined his entire discography to me, his personality was always infused into his music and now I can&#39;t listen to a single one of his songs without thinking about the Holocaust.
womp womp
i understand this pov but i dislike the insinuation that people who don&#39;t deep dive into/or even listen intently to lyrics don&#39;t exist, and that everyone who likes this album falls into one of those subgroups. some people just like things that make their ears feel good idk.
You know, this is honestly just 7 minutes of hating. <br><br>You actually did exactly what Kanye said in this album. You‚Äôre still commenting because you want the views of the hot topic and simultaneously you want to politicize him in a way that doesn‚Äôt make sense to his actual political messaging. <br><br>The music on this album is very sonically entertaining. He very clearly clarified his politics and denounced what he‚Äôs been accused of saying both off record and on the actual wax. <br><br>Also him not liking Zionists but not being eloquent enough to state specifically that he disliked he disliked zionists. It‚Äôs something people like Lil dicky have touched on and other Jewish folks that have actually met him.
Melon just a hater frfrüôåüèæ
I mean I do understand Melon but this feels like him just taking the chance to go after ye fans. Using strawmen to paint all fans as nazis. Like more than half the video is not even about the album
I just dont get how  out of 16 songs bro did not get a single redeeeming quality
light to decent 2 review of the music melon, try again
thank you antony, now i don‚Äôt have to listen to this shit album
Unreviewable just like your marriage
Beg forgiveness is obviously &quot;gaining forgiveness&quot;
you&#39;re wrong + your wife left you
Dude who hurt you? I have guesses but I don‚Äôt think Kanye is one of them. You know you don‚Äôt have to review or listen to his music if you don‚Äôt want to right? Like you literally don‚Äôt have to.
L
I like the part where you talked about Kanye‚Äôs marriage while being divorced yourself!
&quot;How can I be different today&quot; ahhh review.
Damn. Now Fantano and Kanye D riders really have to pick a side
Review wishlist: <br><br>Allie X - Girl with no face (out Feb 23)<br>Eartheater- whole discography bcs it‚Äôs criminally underrated<br>V√©rit√®- somewhere in between album + love you forever album<br>Jackie extreme- self titled + onyx
He did it. He found a score lower than Not Good.
You can apply this to so many artists, lately for me is JPEGMAFIA. I&#39;ve lost so much respect for him on this and hiding behind &quot;my heroes are cornballs&quot; is a bullshit copout and saying he&#39;s not political and shouldn&#39;t be judged on it by comparing his previous records is ridiculous. And not even that, fucking Chris Brown? After all the shit he went on a mental rant about and all the lyrics in previous tracks?
Womp womp
Lmao Fantano was in a bad headspace for this one. Bro needs to take a break
Kanye‚Äôs rapping on this is fucking TERRIBLE man what happened to this dude
What about the production tho
Is Kanye career dead, though?
HOOOLLLYYYYYY FUCUK
I have to say, as a fan of Fantano, this is honestly a new low for these videos because this is kind of just downright sad. That he can‚Äôt even review an album because he can&#39;t take feelings out of it and just do an actual review. Realistically, I get it if you don‚Äôt like Kanye as a human being, sure, but to not even review the new album is pure sad. You bring up his comments about the Jews, and as bad as it is, Kanye was having fun with this album. A lot of the lyrics were jokes. Kanye was obviously just having fun with his project, and it shows that you‚Äôre basically just smashing the project because you don‚Äôt like Kanye as a person. Let‚Äôs take it back to a couple of weeks ago when you spoke on his Burzum shirt, and you are the SAME GUY who literally reviewed two Burzum albums. It‚Äôs ridiculous how you can‚Äôt even review an album, pure sadness if I‚Äôm being honest. Kanye definitely had good songs on here, and the production was very nice. Not even saying this out of bias as a Kanye fan, but it‚Äôs kinda ridiculous of you to not do so when you‚Äôve reviewed plenty of controversial artists, especially BURZUM WHO YOU FLAMED YE FOR BECAUSE HE WORE A SHIRT üòí.
Pretty ironic that you can&#39;t stand to review this album because of Kanye&#39;s (inside or outside the music) political rhetoric, yet you eat up JPEGMAFIA&#39;s work and praise it because what he says in his lyrics coincides with your beliefs. Meanwhile JPEGMAFIA has no problem setting aside his political differences and works with Kanye on the album.
oh
There&#39;s a 4th fan that he ignored:<br><br>People who don&#39;t need to align morally with an artist. Or even go further, those who are fascinated with immoral artists. You know what makes Joseph Conrad so brilliant? The fact that he was a colonist and wrote about it. You know what makes gangsta rap so interesting? The fact that they kill people and talk about it. You know what makes Kanye post 2016 interesting? The fact he&#39;s psychotic as fuck and makes music about it. You know what makes Burzum interesting? . . .  Etc.<br><br>That being said, the album is bad. I believe TLOP will be the last great Kanye solo album
I mean it‚Äôs aight. But is fanthony aight? He doesn‚Äôt seem aight
What a cop out
This will haunt you more than the MBDTF review Antony ! You have been warned
seems like he reviews fanbases now instead of music
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=334">5:34</a> finally said the n-word
What happenned to Kanye, so sad. I think he is a good person, you know. Some bad thing happened and he act that way. Talking about Hitl is so childish. I think he loves his wife, his children. I dont think he is a racist or a bad person. But the things he said this time, was on another level. <br><br>That said, I think keys to my life, talking, back to me, paperwork, burn, beg forgiviness, good and king are good songs.
The &quot;nihilistic teenagers&quot; category isn&#39;t even about the age group, it&#39;s about the mentality. How childish do you have to be to defend someone this blindly?
Fantano. This is the first time in the 13 years I‚Äôve been watching you that truly disappointed me. This album is clearly not even close to Donda 2 in quality. This is sad bro. This is his best work in 10 years. You‚Äôre so blinded by media thought policing and sound bites that you can‚Äôt see that this is some of his best work In years. Sad fantano. Really sad.
Kanye is rent free, stay mad, number album in the world, happily married, you‚Äôre physically and mentally stressing over another man, please grow up
If this album was called To Pimp‚Ä¶ ah never mind. I see this joke has been done 50 times already.
Anthony is a loser!! üíÄ
It is unreviewable, considering the antisemitism comments he previously made didn‚Äôt stopped his album becoming number 1 in Israel.
You know you‚Äôre failed as a critic when you can‚Äôt even separate the artist from the art
Anthony is foaming at the mouth
The comments are gonna be fun
the biased is crazy
This is pathetic
I ain‚Äôt listening to someone who cried at a mac miller track.
If danny brown made this it would‚Äôve got a 10
free Palestine
You disrespected his wife what on twitter
It&#39;s not that fucking hard to rank this album goddamn
Vultures is a good album your just biased
This is truly the album of all time.
He‚Äôs so mad ppl are fucking with this album üòÇ
Bros mad that he got cooked on Twitter üò≠
I dont understand why you can‚Äôt review an album because you don‚Äôt like the person who made it. I think this is a bad way of going about life
If it was called jews 1 you would have given it a 10
Lmfao
so like a 6?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=266">4:26</a> LOLLLLLLLLLLLLLL Don‚Äôt do it Antowon!
bro review the fucking music u had one job nobody wanna hear ur yappiness
It&#39;s not that deep, melon. Review the album
The problem with Ye defenders who attempt to use his Manic episodes as a defence for why he said these things. Is well when hes no longer having one he still agree with everything he thinks. Its just he knows to be more quite about it.
Free speech
just rate the music
Liberal meltdown caught on camera LMAO
Watching you cry over kanye is a 10 alone
Yeah, Kanye hasn&#39;t been alright in almost a decade now, but even then, he still managed to put out stuff like Kids See Ghosts, Ye, and Donda. <br><br>Recently, he&#39;s released Donda 2 and Vultures, which are not only bad, but especially in the case of the latter, it&#39;s filled with awful lines referencing the appalling stuff he said. <br><br>He alienated his old fans, and now has to cater to filth.
Malding
If this album was called My Beautiful Dark Twisted Vulture you would&#39;ve given it a 6
This made me go back and listen to Jesus is King and I gotta be honest, in comparison to what&#39;s been coming out recently from Kanye, it&#39;s pretty solid
Shocking.<br><br><br>Separate the art from the artist.
The engineer on the album was trans! Surely that‚Äôs at least a 6
I&#39;m neither of those three types of people, and I still enjoyed the album.
This How You No your ALBUM FIREEE
Fantano went full identity politics.
Where did the switch get flipped? Curious at what point did everyone look at him different? I dropped off after the 2nd album and it&#39;s been very easy to ignore his music but I don&#39;t know about his lifestyle really.
ah, you finally went mask off about valuing the aesthetics surrounding music more than the music itself. not that that wasn&#39;t already self-evident in your even less politically-charged reviews before this.
Calls himself a music reviewer and skips verses man this bald ass b is something else no wonder your wife left you
The fact that some of you are more offended by people protesting nazism than by actual nazis is horrifying.
i can to hear a review of the album lil bro not a rant about his opinions which in relation to this album specifically doesn‚Äôt really have any substance. Fair enough to talk politically and personally if theirs songs that talk about such subjects but bros just waffling to something that isn‚Äôt relevant in relation to the album.
cry baby
a very lukewarm take
I do think Fantano‚Äôs breakdown of Kanye‚Äôs fan base is pretty spot on. I ultimately just want good music to listen to, and I feel like Kanye‚Äôs half baked songs are underwhelming, especially when you get teased with sprinkles of actual quality
Hm seems like someone is still salty about his wife leaving his lame ass, not kanye&#39;s fault u couldn&#39;t satisfy ur wife bro
You‚Äôll review albums from truly bad people that have either directly or indirectly had a had in the deaths of others and call them great, but Kanye is where you draw the line? I didn‚Äôt see you trash on him when he said slavery was a choice
GreatConceptualLyricallyStellarAlbums dont just fall out the sky, ya know??
I agree with his opinion but<br><br>If hoodrat was a jpeg song or death grips he would be eating that shit up
Accurate AF. The album is pure trash like everything he has released since Life Of Pablo.
üöë Wahhhmbulance
most rappers kill, rape and racist why the fuck you care so much about antisemitism ?
cmon anthony, you know if it was called &quot;kids see vultures&quot; you would&#39;ve given it a 10
Yeah I agree, I was able to find inner peace thanks to this album. Thanks for the recommend, Melon.
MSNBC Music Reviewer
Mellon If this was called To Pimp A Vulture, you would‚Äôve given it a 10
Nailed it.
rents due
I like that he changed the cover art to a black mask. Really represents how Kanye is a shadow of his former self
bot
Anthony lets his political views too much influence in his reviews
cal has been stuck in the studio making a whole diss album against kanye thats why we havnt seen himm frr
I don&#39;t understand how u hate some of the tracks here i too as a Knaye fan call him out and his bullshit and feel disappointed by it but alot of the songs here are great and at worst are boring or in the case in the case of the title track garbage.
yea paid has to be some if the most hilariously awful songs
If the album was called Scaring the Vultures you would‚Äôve given it a 10
You‚Äôve gone insane
Kanye is the first artist to have both an unreviewable and 10/10 album from melon. round of applause üëèüèª
You‚Äôd give it a 6/10 if it was named ‚ÄúGhetto Vulture‚Äù
It&#39;s an interesting and sort of depressing thought: putting out a proper review of this album would neither spread positivity nor incite reflection.  I kinda agree.  Personally, I don&#39;t think anything else needed to be said.  I would have preferred if Anthony ended the video there.
Man I agree with your general critiques here but I wish you had given more of a dissection of the actual music. His life is of course relevant to the work and vice versa but having this video be mostly about his life is disappointing
thank you for the common sense
Loved this video about kanye! Can you now talk about the music please?
burn is quite a classic style ye song what did you think of that one?<br>also fuk sumn and carnival that are popular and high points of the whole thing
Man the divorce is really getting to you
youve failed as a music critic when you cant seperate the artist and ideaology from the music
RATE the music not the person
This is the worst review of all time I swear üò≠
Props to making this video. Kanye is a mess
Interesting review anthony. I did think the 30 second interlude where you kept calling kanye the hard r was a bit unnecessary though. I understand it may not be your cup of tea but racism isnt the answer. Also you probably shouldnt have admitted you beat your shit to ye‚Äôs wife. I get that you may get horny sometimes but thats another mans wife youre talking about. Aside from that though, hope you have a great day!
It&#39;s amazing to see all of the anti-kanye think pieces. Meanwhile, the man has done less harm to the social collective than Sexxy Red and Taylor Swift combined, but they don‚Äôt receive the same retribution.
Im sorry man.. but you were SO bias when reviewing this album. Even when songs like ‚ÄúBurn‚Äù came on in your stream, which literally gives Late registration/Graduation vibes, you were acting like it was the worst song you‚Äôve ever heard, even though you gave other EXTREMELY similar songs on other artists albums lots of praise. I‚Äôm sorry but unless you‚Äôre doing this on purpose, takes like these on this album make you an hypocrite.
Another W for Lil Dicky
As a jew who lives in israel I dont really care, would have rather you gave a review
Vultures 1 is number 1 in 104 countries btw. You calling half the damn world a sad, pathetic, lonely individual? You reviews used to be fun to watch, you barely even talk about the music. This whole video is so childish.
fantano struggles to separate art from the artist yet refuses to acknowledge this bias, this review is unreviewable
Probably the correct take that it&#39;s unreviewable. Everything the dude has been doing and saying for years is just ugly. The blaming of his behavior on mental illness just felt awful and embarrassing to anyone who believed it and that the behavior just continued after was no surprise.
loved the part where he rated kanye as a person instead of the music he is supposed to rate
I found the only highlight of that album was &#39;&#39;Burn&#39;&#39; because it had a similar feeling to The College Dropout. I guess that it is average because I didn&#39;t think that it&#39;s bad although it&#39;s not good either.
If it was called &quot;to shill for a jew&quot; you&#39;d rate it a 10/10
Don&#39;t wanna review but want the clout. I see.
I mean there‚Äôs a 4th type Kanye fan, the ones who were so moved by his previous works, and are clinging on to optimism.
New ye is trash and he&#39;s a crazy weirdo. But some people legit just don&#39;t listen to the words in the music they listen to. Getting so fixated on that part just doesn&#39;t make much sense, it&#39;s way more common than you&#39;re assuming
If y‚Äôall want to watch an actual critic give this album a well thought out hour and a half analysis please go to Professor Skye‚Äôs music review channel.
So you claim the album is unreviewable and that you won‚Äôt give him any attention but you‚Äôve posted multiple times on social media and now have a review up too! Ironic you would even spread the album of a man you claim to be so evil
it feels like people just kinda forgot about the shit that he said and did when the roll out for this album started. like everyone just went ‚Äúnew kanye üëÄ‚Äù with out even acknowledging what he did as if we‚Äôre back in 2019 when he was just a controversial figure and not a fucking nazi. did y‚Äôall forget?? or are you just ignoring it because he‚Äôs kanye?
Cringe fantano cant seperate art from the artist
rock on, fantano.
so good its unreviewable üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
Your views on music at this point Are starting to becoming condescending and obsolete. How is an album unreviewable.
Big ‚ÄúJames Rolfe&#39;s ‚ÄòGhostbusters &#39;16 - I refuse.‚Äô‚Äùenergy right here.
This fool looks like he eats corn on the cob vertically
I give your review a light 1 do better next time
great video!
this wasn&#39;t a music review :/ 0/10
Unfortunately, it doesn&#39;t seem like this message is getting through to the Kanye fans in the comments, but I respect Fantano for putting his foot down and denouncing Kanye. A clown like this doesn&#39;t deserve a proper review.
if this album was called, &quot;to pimp a vulture&quot;, you wouldve given it a 10
Okay. <br><br>I was all in for Ye since the bad stuff. I did this up until he went onto InfoWars.  Ye just spoke what he thought and still thinks.<br><br><br>Volume 1 is just not good. It sucks on all levels. I hope that 2 and 3 never come out. So much actual loss of a Ye experience. Sucks dink.
common Fantano L
Kanye could drop a legitimately fantastic album at this point and you would still hate on it cuz you hate the man. You&#39;re insane to think Jesus is King is better than Vultures. As much as you hate Christianity I&#39;m surprised you can tolerate those lyrics more than his corny/toxic ass lines on vultures. The music on vultures is better than JIK.
if hoodrat was a jpegmafia song you know he would consider it one of the best songs he&#39;s heard this decade so far
Even if in like the album ( production wise obviously not lyrically) what you said hear was true and i understand and support you in not reviewing this album
Why you so grumpy
fuck dude and his lame fans tbh, worst fanbase going rn
If this album was called kids see vultures you would give it a ten
as kanye said. you call him crazy and antisemite, but hes the king. look at the streams, the music, the audience, hes the best on the planet.
I actually liked this album but I completely get Fantano‚Äôs frustration.
üòÇ boo hoo
Kanye sucks button ‚ÜôÔ∏è
You sound like a bozo during this entire video
You forgot the 4th kind of fan, the one that listen to his old stuff and nothing else. Ok I‚Äôm not really a fan but power is a good song.
Bro made a 7 minute video trying to convince us he doesn‚Äôt start doing cartwheels every time Carnival plays.
i will take melons place and say this album gets a -2/10, you&#39;re welcome.
I normally don&#39;t agree with some of your takes, And as Kanye being in my top 2, You are absolutely right. Like genuinely about everything. Luckily, I&#39;m not one of the delusional people running around thinking kanye is goated for every drop he makes. I&#39;m thanking my lucky stars I&#39;m not supporting everything this man does either. <br>Him making graduation does not justify him doing all the things he&#39;s done.
A few points: I would like to see you review music in the 90s you would have gotten killed. The amount of bad sick minded people in music has gone down significantly. Child abuse (sexual), hard drug use, self deletion, fighting, racism, sexism, antisemitism (Michael freaking Jackson?). Did MTV stop reviewing or playing music? They used the controversy to fuel the music and sell more records. Controversies have always fueled music.<br><br>Two a lot of people are angry with Jews right now and this album serves their demographic: maybe if you see past the stunts you can see some form of messaging and braggadocio is happening that some people (not just neonazis) are tapping into. If you seriously think Jews sometimes don&#39;t straight bully people leading to some resentment sorry but its there. Taylor Swift is a good example, she is smart enough to find a way to ruin Scooter Braun but Scooter would have had no guilt in owning her like a slave if he could. But Kanye says an anti-Scooter bar and says it with some antisemitism and now its an evil lyric interesting<br><br>It isn&#39;t your job to protect feelings of certain of your fans, you can just do trigger warnings and try to review the songs. Jewish people should be strong enough to accept insults. I mean Jews are the ones who are constantly mocking, blaspheming Christians, pumping up views that they are pedos and abuse kids, producing Lil Nas X music and promoting things like Church of Satan by legally defending it. OK so can&#39;t they take some heat too? Oh no Kanye said &#39;Jewish b****&#39; so sorry but your turn to accept some hatred with some grace too. They want a world where Christians get abuse forever but Jews get zero, it doesn&#39;t work that way in the USA.
I would file for divorce if I seen that moustache to
He everyone Anthony Fantano here the internets busiest virtue signaler
No matter how much you virtue signal and actually despise Kanye your wife is not going to come back. You need to accept it
This guy melt down so bad
bro u a real a clownboy
Melon you are Music Reviewer not a fucking social commentator , if its &quot;unreviewable&quot; then fucking review it Melon : 3
was your twitter comment about his wife necessary though
Fantano go back to your Burzum review, you didn‚Äôt care back then.
I like how fantano spends half of the video explaining why he can‚Äôt separate the art from the artist and then the comment section is just being flooded with ‚Äúseparate the art from the artist‚Äù like dude did you not even watch the video???
You rate music bro dial it back and give us a number
Good thing he‚Äôs totally not biased politically
If the album was called ‚ÄúScaring the Vultures‚Äù he woulda given it a 10
Anthony Woketano at it again lol
The qualities of character that allowed Kanye to rise to the top have been responsible for his downfall
ayeyayaya by shredders. if you know you know.
Even Unknown Death 2002 had a funner review
Tim Heidecker arc
Anthony what the hell man. You aren‚Äôt even thinking critically and literally misinterpreting lyrics, either on purpose or you‚Äôre blinded by hate-mode. I don‚Äôt believe for a fucking second you think this is the worst sounding music he‚Äôs ever put out, there is no fucking way. It‚Äôs at the point now that if he put out his objectively best album today you‚Äôd say the same shit. Cred lost for real.
I respect it tbh
you are becoming the reflection of your fans
lets be honest, fantano is just a liberal mf NPC that knows a lot about music<br><br>love u tho, like kanye loves kanye
woahhhhhh that&#39;s a super SERIOUS thumbnail face... THIS IS SERIOUS. :|
uh oh i like music im a lonely teenager now
who values this persons opinion
Domain Expansion: Unreviewable Shrine. A shrine appears allowing the user to use the sure-hit affect, unreviewable. This sure-hit allows whatever cursed energy album to automatically become unreviewable, hindering it useless. The user of the domain will then be able add plus 2 to any cursed energy album. For example, the cursed energy album from sexy redd, instead of being a 8/10 will now be a 10/10. Now this is a special grade cursed album and will automatically trump whatever the next cursed album your opponent uses after the initial scrapped album from the sure hit effect.
Stunning and brave. Thank you Anthony, I‚Äôm glad you found a way to pay your rent this month.
Depressing, truly. Once upon a time, his music meant the world to me, it changed my life. And I hopped on the train late (like, 2018), I was apparently willing to overlook a lot of stuff. But at this point... hell naah, I&#39;m out; I&#39;ve been out for a hot second now. This man&#39;s yet to release an album after Donda in my view. Enough.
Anthony officially CANT separate the art from the artist.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=324">5:24</a> TF
I don‚Äôt value your opinion on this one.
You are washed bro
W review Horrible, horrible album
Fantano used to love Burzum btw
This guy is definitely fun at parties
you‚Äôre washed buddy
How&#39;s the review looking
The Melon meltdown he was having to this live was hilarious
you can‚Äôt say the album is bad just because you don‚Äôt like how he changed the color of his mask from white to black
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=376">6:16</a> the one correct take in this whole video
You mad or jew mad
Crazy that this has actual good songs and is ‚Äúunreviewable‚Äù but an album about being a ho and a hoodrat from sexyyred is a strong 8
Nobody cares baldie, kanye better
You can&#39;t separate the artist from the music because &quot;the crap is in the music&quot;. However you have previously stated in other debate videos that you personally can enjoy a song/album while not agreeing with the politcs or message, like for example the artist Varg Vikernes (Burzum), who is a neo-nazi that has murdered a man aswell as burned down churches and is against jews. You had no problem giving that man a rating? <br><br>I mean, you could&#39;ve given this album like a 0/10 because you don&#39;t like the lyrics and verses etc and that would have been fine. But instead you directly choose not to rate it, which doesn&#39;t make any sense as you&#39;ve never had any problem rating other very controversial and even fascist artists before...
<b>Melon after hundreds of takes</b> oh yeah, this thumbnail is gonna look so hard
Ok yeah I agree but the musics good
I think you need a break, Anthony.
LETS GOOOOO!!!!
üò≠lmaoo
Glad you liked it more then MBDTF
Kids, this the kind of reaction a true &quot;rockstar&quot; would get back when those people were a thing. Ye an absolute legend
Would rather Fantano have reviewed Vultures 1 instead of just reading his ex-wife‚Äôs divorce decree.
You forgot one type of Fan -&gt; 4. People who just like his music
I genuinely think it‚Äôs ok
Womp Womp
uh oh...
remember when you said the n word?
Jewish people love this album, vultures went number one in Isreal? Fukumean? ü§£üò≠
Imagine having an agenda months before an album comes out üòÇ
this a 10 if it was called mr vulture and the big vultures
Who said that to be a great artist you have to be a great person?<br>Pablo Picasso was a misogynist<br>William Faulkner was a racist<br>Lewis Carroll was a pedophile<br>Elis Kazan was a traitor<br>Fernindan Celine was a Nazi<br>Erza Pound was a fascist<br>Jean Genet was a thief<br><br>Political correctness sucks
Him shitting on The Jay and Silent Bob reference really solidified how disconnected i am from Fantanos sense of humor cause that shit was hilarious and i fr can&#39;t get it out of my head. L Melon.
Shush liberal
Just move on bro and ignore this. Nobody even cares what you have to say
The album wasn‚Äôt trying to apologize because he apologized before the album so that it could just be a music album and nothing else<br><br> back to roots
Oof
Find God
If it was called &quot;To Pimp a Vulture&quot; Fantano would&#39;ve given it a 10
notice how he fails to bring up what are considered the best moments like Burn, Carnival, or Good. he just lists the more questionable moments and labels the whole album as trash
Wait!! What about our bestie miss miss Westy
you seriously need to get a grip and review the music, nobody is talking ab the outside noise besides you. not every kanye fan agrees with what he does, kanye is a psycho who makes great music, if you‚Äôre not gonna review it don‚Äôt even listen to him.
L ye hater
I‚Äôm kinda numb to an opinion of Ye as a person, I just wanna hear good music, and to me this album is a 5 / 10 bc Ty carries Ye on every track, some songs have amazing beats like ‚ÄúPaid‚Äù, ‚ÄúBack To Me‚Äù, ‚ÄúDo It‚Äù and ‚ÄúBurn‚Äù, cool features like North, Travis and Chris Brown, and I don‚Äôt want to hate on Ye but honestly what memorable moment does he have on this album? Either he‚Äôs doing weird ass vocals on ‚ÄúPaid‚Äù, or saying the stupidest shit on‚Ä¶ every fucking songs. I‚Äôve never been a Ye fan, he just has some cool songs that I like, like ‚ÄúStronger‚Äù, ‚ÄúBound 2‚Äù, ‚ÄúFather Stretch My Hands‚Äù and a handful of songs from his ‚ÄúDonda‚Äù album, but all I remember from this album is everything that doesn‚Äôt involve him. The only thing I remember of him is he‚Äôs on the album cover, but even then, clearly the bigger focus is his wife‚Äôs butt, because if it‚Äôs not, why is it there in the first place?<br><br>Again, in my opinion, this album‚Äôs a 5 / 10.<br><br>Btw my least fav song is ‚ÄúHoodrat‚Äù.
This video has to be a social experiment
this is the same guy who made about 10 twitter posts about this album and then a livestream where he attacked kanye with personal insults thw whole time, its like were watching fantano on a &quot;downward spiral&quot; because hes TWEAKING over a kanye album üíÄüíÄüíÄts embarrasing asf bro ur a clown
The way you talk about bianca is probably why your wife is gone why talk about someone trashing them when they did nothing wrong and your literally not able to keep a marriage
the 2 MBDTF references killed it for melon unlucky üòû
where yo wife go
Back to Me is great! What is he talking about?
Go to therapy, get help anthony its not too late
üíÄ
Find God
wow anthony. bad review
I honestly thought this wasn‚Äôt so bad
Waiting Kanye fans brigading this video commenting &quot;follow God&quot; lol. they live in a twisted reality.
bro is so miserable for no reason üò≠ album is fire and its on repeat, and it will continue to be on repeat.
Halfway in . . . Is he going to talk about the music??? Lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=423">7:03</a> minutes of yap
lmao
Die the hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villian<br><br>And im not talking about ye
i am excited for the outrage this will cause
So a 10 right?
this is pathetic lol
glad to see anthony speaking up on this
Honestly ye aint even worth a chance anymore he fell off even harder than Eminem (editing for grammar)
Kanye broke the melon. He truly is the greatest of all time.
It&#39;s been so difficult as a long time Kanye fan, man. There&#39;s a part of me that wants to just say fuck it and enjoy the music for what it is, but it feels like his entire discography has been tainted. Even if I&#39;m listening to an old classic like Last Call or something, a part of me is still thinking about how he&#39;s come out as an anti-Semite. It really doesn&#39;t help that his music has been consistently trash for years.<br>I haven&#39;t had a chance to listen to this yet because it&#39;s not on Spotify, but regardless it just feels really weird to listen to one of my favorite artists of all time now so I doubt I even get all too far into it.
The tunes are pretty nice tho
Cringe and clickbaiting
Incredible that somehow lyrics matter now
I&#39;m glad I watched this with adblocker
You‚Äôre a clown Anthony
This foo just a hater now
no one cares about your opinion bro
The fact you didn&#39;t give it a proper review is kinda lame. But whatever.
ü§ì
Absolute W
im not even a big fan but he cooked with this review. no matter what he gives this people will be mad no matter what he rates it. i didnt like him telling everyone their opinion was wrong if they liked the album tho.
cry
he didnt even review the thing
Cucktano got cooked so hard on Twitter he went on a rant on YouTube
‚ÄúBy themselves‚Äù<br>Do charts not exist to this moron
If you really have an issue with the artist/project just take the review down.
not a fan of Kanye but fan of this album
youre trying too hard to be woke
you like like walter white if he was a bisexual resident of LA
Bro got hurt from those wife jokes on twitter üòÇüòÇüòÇ
if it was called ‚Äúto pimp a vulture‚Äù it would be a listenable/10
You gave him a 10 after he said slavery was a choice.
Show us your wife please
What Kanye did to his wife is very dehumanizing
Being honest I like to separate the art from the artist, but with this album can&#39;t do that. I only want to care about the music but it&#39;s impossible. I wanted to hear the album mostly to hear more music from Ty Dolla Sign but that was all. The divorce really messed up Kanye.
if it was &quot;to nigga to a nazi&quot; it would&#39;ve been a 10
Bro ruined his reputation, and I ain‚Äôt talking about Kanye
Loved that part where you actually reviewed the music
Still better than sexy red
Album is a step above Donda and JIK. Come on mel√≥n.
Really questioning if he even gave it a listen. At least the NFR podcast still have their minds in tact and can actually review it.<br>Also kinda sad cause i was really waiting to see your opinions on the music and the production as i find myself agreeing to a lot of the points you are making in most reviews.
nice review bro. i just like the music
The comment section really is just atrocious man.
You‚Äòre bald
But let me guess, you‚Äôll give scores to Black Sabbath /Ozzy despite him saying hitler inspired him. Or how about Carti who beats women etc. You‚Äôre hypocritical af
This is like a 4/10 album I can‚Äôt lie. But there‚Äôs like 2 alright songs on it.
I think your forgetting this is literally a collab album. You can‚Äôt just come at Kanye.
Stop trying to be different baldy
Kanye: 3 bars (30 seconds) of mentioning jewish ppl out of 56 min album<br><br>Fanton: says you can&#39;t separate the art from the artist at all now bc all the music talks about is jews.<br><br>WTF IS THIS LOGIC BRO????? album is 8.5/10
I don&#39;t agree for the simple fact that it seems, even if he released different music, the review would&#39;ve been the same. Truthfully, it seems that Kanye is too controversial for him to review AT ALL. anymore.
This has to be rage bait üò≠üôè
True music leaves an impression
This is insane
Facts
you don‚Äôt know how to have fun
Heisenberg lookin Egg
No one cares the album is fire
Bro this is embarrassing ü§£ü§£
Kanye‚Ä¶.the most overrated artist of the 21st century bar none
Nah but misrepresenting people on twitter that make fun of you for being a crybully/virtue signaling pussy is just sad.
W NICK FUENTES
I wish they still made music like this
Notice how Anthony cleverly made excuses for Ty and Freddie and basically all of the other artist who &quot;platformed&quot; not wait I&#39;ll take it a step further assisted in what Anthony described nothing more than a misogynist and antisemitic art piece. Basically said it&#39;s OK cause they got paid. Lmao HYPOCRIT.<br><br>TAKE THIS TO ITS LOGICAL CONCLUSION AND REFUSE TO REVIEW ALL ARTISTS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THIS ALBUM. particularly ty who full on collaborated the entire thing. This is just as much his album as it is Ye&#39;s. Why does he get a pass?
I&#39;m sure it was tough to know how to react to this album, knowing people would have some critique no matter what. But I think you took the right approach. If you just straight up didn&#39;t review it, people would say you&#39;re too soft or avoidant, if you did a real review, you&#39;d get shit for promoting it and turning a blind eye to the problems. This explains why it&#39;s not worth a review in a pretty irrefutable way.
I mean I get where he&#39;s coming from and yes there&#39;s some lyrics that seem to match what Kanye&#39;s been saying but damn i thought he&#39;d at least enjoy a couple tracks. I&#39;m not even trying to dickride Ye but personally i interpret those lyrics as being ironic, him not taking what he says seriously<br><br>Am i wrong for that? Maybe, but from how i see it, none of the actual &quot;serious&quot; tracks, the ones where he seems to actually mean what he says, seemed to have any kind of hateful message for me. I guess what i&#39;m trying to say it&#39;s that i don&#39;t find fair to use Kanye&#39;s &quot;antisemitism&quot; to write off Vultures as a piece of hateful garbage, because i don&#39;t see it that way, but again, i might be the one who&#39;s wrong, idek to be honest
Didnt expect you to give a 9.  I personally think it&#39;s an 11 but you&#39;re allowed to have your own opinion I guess.
from someone who would consider themselves a kanye fan, this is a totally valid point.
Oh come on, BURN and DO IT are good songs.
I really liked you when I first found you a few years ago and you gave more unbiased reviews. Now it seems like everything is political based and you lost your opinion that I respected
bro ur trash
Womp womp ü§°ü§°
Brittany Howard review when?
Poor Kanye. His demise into the realms of insanity is very sad. He has obviously had several mental breakdowns, one after another after another.¬† He appears to be so deeply entrenched in psychosis that he&#39;s lost his grip on reality.¬†<br><br><br>He has to be surrounded by many spineless individuals too afraid to tell it like it truly is and I can tell you right now that big ole myth in the sky who he believes in so much isn&#39;t going to save him, he&#39;s also too far gone to save himself.¬† Who&#39;s out there with the balls to say &quot;Kanye my friend, you seriously need some help&quot;.¬†<br><br><br>It is worrying as to where his mental health is leading him... It&#39;s all looking pretty dark to me üò¢
REVIEW THE NEW SCRIM ALBUM
review at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=380">6:20</a>
Review The last! VINNIE PAZ ALBUM!  Its fire!
Title should be divorced loser yells at sky
Meh 13/16
you wouldve gave it a ten if it was called vultures 1
If this album was called bald eagles 1 you would have given it a 10
Sir, you are such a bitter human! Second video I‚Äôve ever watched by you and I just wish I never clicked! You are not a musical genius or even a musically talented person. Stick to YT. You‚Äôll never be a Kanye, a Nicki, a FINNEAS, or any of the many great producers or artists you constantly try to bash.
This album is not dumpster fire cmon dawg
Still time to delete this Fantano
Ye da goat no cap
You have gotten way to political to review music
i mean i always knew u had double standards but at least u were still reviewing music and keeping the other stuff on your socials which i can choose not to follow. This is honestly hilarious to witness because Kanye got him so boiled up that he actually lost it
All the crying from Kanye fans prove fantano right
Can someone explain what is going on with the album cover in the background?
Anthony is the fakest SJW ever. Recites ‚Äúbeautiful butt naked bitches‚Äù and Kanye never once refers to the women as bitches, he‚Äôs literally just saying that from his own mind. Misogynistic fake ass personality.
Fontana big mad, you can see the rage and hate he has for Kanye  üòÇ
L take
I thought this was a music reviewer not a political channel
I&#39;m no Kanye fan, but not reviewing the album is weak. &#39;He&#39;s needlessly racist, edgy, and stupid. He infuses antisemitism into his music, which is bad. There is no detectable wit or irony. His new music is bad. Here are some bad verses. I give it a zero.&#39; Saying the project is unreviewable is a clickbaity middle ground. And you basically reviewed the thing anyway, just omitted a score.
Ye the goatüòÉ
This video feels like getting yelled out/roasted by your dad. Thanks anthony
Fantano mental breakdown
im morally superior üòÇüòÇüòÇüëåüèº
Why is Fantano so butt hurt about Kanye lol
7 minute tantrum
I‚Äôm 4 min into a 7 min video and haven‚Äôt heard you talk about music yet
&quot;LIKE A FROZEN MUMMY...&quot;
Crazy cuz if it was called Whole Lotta Vultures you would‚Äôve given it a 10 üî•
Kayne is a joke and his present-era fans are deranged.
this guy is so moist
rent free
Shut up Fantano
Sexy Redd 8/10
Never knew Fantano was Jewish!
9.5/10, album of the year and Vultures is honestly the only one thats mid.
Joe Biden ah review
Review an album on music‚ùå<br>Review an album on controversy‚úÖ
That&#39;s my GOAT. Making a 10 and unreviewable as well as making an anwatchable melon video.
a &quot;fuck you kanye&quot; out of 10. I can get on board with that. and seriously, this is the kind of response kayne and his &quot;work&quot; needs to receive as much as possible. Bravo!
Fantano just mad Kanye has a wife unlike him
I like how you dont force yourself to do a review of a reccord that you couldnt possibly review due to the personality behind it, what im asking myself is. why are you then reviewing ppl like cardi b who is a self admitted r@p31st, and why if you think it is unreviewable do you then go on to still partiually review it in this video? And why do you tweet your opinions about an album that shouldnt be reviewed as stated by yourself? Also why did you use this album as a way to defende your stance on your sexy red opinion? If youre gonna leave thoose albums unreviewed why tweet abt the songs in the first place, the fact that you decide to say you cant review it but then go on to tweet about it in my opinion shows, that you have a bias against him, which as far as i remeber you said you dont have. If you find the artist unseparable from the art like in this instance why tweet about parts of the songs n which you only dissliked the production and the intention wasnt to point out a social/political issue with the text (which would be walid to do imo)
Being honest, I enjoyed listening to the album, but I agree w/ what melon is saying.
I liked a lot of his earlier stuff even knowing some of the stupid and offensive things he would say before, at this point though I just have no interest what so ever, I didn&#39;t like his more recent output I heard occasionally and mixed with his political comments I just will never listen to new music from him again and at this point even some of his older music. isn&#39;t the same.
The craziest thing is that theres people defending this shit. Its just bad and thats okay. Sometimes people who make good art make bad art.
love this man
idgaf people can hate black people but the moment u hate the J**S you are bad ?
DOES HE KNOW that&#39;s not the album title
The music sounds great. I‚Äôm feeling a strong 8
holy own
I hope this doesn‚Äôt become the new MBDTF
Album went number 1 in Israel and Fantano can‚Äôt even review it smh
She looks like a reference? I don&#39;t get it
this is the most secondhand embarrassment i‚Äôve felt watching a youtube video
Got my pop corn ready to look at the comment sectionüçøüçøüçø
Didn&#39;t David Bowie literally do the same exact thing? Literally do the Hitler salute?? Same exact thing?? U never said anything Abt that or addressed it in any of ur reviews???
Idk how hip hop twitter is swallowing this album, it&#39;s some hot ass
Shut up and review the album
10
Love you, Fantano! Thanks for the consistently truthful and thorough music reviews, I always look forward to them
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=1">0:01</a> funniest shit evr ü§£

Un-reviewable but Melon had to make a video. King üëë
waaaaaa the review
Im a jew but the album FIRE üî•üî•üî•üî• (im not)
So it&#39;s 3/10 ? Got it Melon
ok, but Stars is a banger
Ngl this was so intense I was kinda scared<br><br>edit: omg where did you all come from
if it was called &quot;Hood Hottest Vulture&quot; you wouldve gave it a 10
keep yappin buddy we dont care
god i don‚Äôt like you
This the first unreviewable album on this channel and by this fact alone will make more people want to listen to it. Thank you, Melon. Im going to listen to it, It‚Äôs probably better than I expect because you have some trash taste sometimes.
Tl;dr it sucks
Honestly I think is kinda enjoyable tbh. One of his worst works, bottom 3 for me, but it is entertaining. Its lows are LOW, with some repetitive Kanye verses, but the highs are great, I loved the production and all the samples, I think ty$ is great on those hooks. Anyways, that&#39;s Kanye west, if you wanna enjoy all of his great stuff you gotta deal with some bad stuff too, if not it wouldn&#39;t be a Kanye product
Crazy thing is this album is actually really good
50 Minutes Ago Melon woke up and spoke facts.
loved this album ...free palestine...the zionists are colonising oppressors... Rajah must not fall

unwatchable 1
Brother all you had to do was just talk about the music. The absolute majority of people here just want to know your thoughts on the album, you&#39;re focusing on completely irrelevant factors.
I havent separated the art from the artist and I still managed to enjoy some songs and find flaws, my god dude, we know your political opinions, but you‚Äôve reviewed fucking daughters, I can  condemn the artist while loving the art because surprise surprise humans can have music opinions and opinions on the musician, don‚Äôt overgeneralize music fans as fuckjng nazis, Kanye is a bigot and pos but just because I like his music doesn‚Äôt make me one
even though I agree with the fan base problem, i would like to see fantano&#39;s opinions on some other musics of the project, like burn, beg forgiveness and fuk sumn (for me the three best tracks on the project)
Vultures sucked
&quot;but bro separate the art from the artist!!!!&quot; literally impossible to do with Kanye because he&#39;s using his art to  promote his shitty views and doesn&#39;t give a shit about the consequences of his actions. kinda funny how kanye stans constantly shit on swifties yet they have the same (if not worse) parasocial relationship with him and can&#39;t accept any valid criticism towards them
Not usually a kanye fan but gave in for a listen (was curious because of the JPEGMAFIA production too). It was a REALLY fun first listen musically. Very memorable moments and also lyrics (in good and bad ways). I don‚Äôt agree with the antisemetic stuff tho.
I genuinely don&#39;t understand this fool. How can <i>ANY</i> piece of music be UNREVIEWABLE? That is a purely FALSE statement. In the symphony of artistic expression, every musical composition, regardless of its perceived quality, holds the potential for enlightenment through thoughtful critique and appreciation.
Thank you Anthony, very cool!
I think this album have better music than lyrics, Ye is a hell of a producer and while listen to this new release I only wanted for less Kanye and more Ty Dolla Sign. It sound a lot better than most of Donda no cap.<br>And about his antisemetic views in the last years, yes it was very cringy and over the top, but in the light of the recent events down in Gaza, I appreciate some of the horrible things Kanye said, it helped to bring some new perspective to the eternal victim narrative that jewish people have constructed over the years. Free Palestine üáµüá∏
Peggy being on the album destroyed Fantano üòÇ
Hey I‚Äôm from the second group of his fans let‚Äôs gooo
His teeth are unreviewable
stop generalizing every kanye fan to be some hateful biggot
Wah wah
The beautiful irony in his antisemitism is Jesus was a Jew üòÇ
Brother, you have gone at Drake, Kanye, and Eminem. They will unite against you soon. RIP melon
How dare you not like the Nazi album
Also needle drop: &quot;I don&#39;t hate Kanye I swear guys&quot;
I was waiting for this review and how you were gonna handle it. The album is trash also I checked it out of morbid curiosity yesterday
Corny
he is not beating the jewish allegations after this
Good job seperating the art from the artist Melon. Everybody know where you stand politically, obvious move by you mate lmao.
<b>YES</b>
I liked the part where you separated the artist from the art and reminded me that he did in fact make graduation
Wu-Tang clan ain&#39;t nuthin to f&#39; With
Just review the damn music man god damn, 10 minute yap session, ion care about Kanye just tell us the score
he just reviewed kanye&#39;s recent events
It‚Äôs great you think Kanye is a nazi but can you do a whole video on how the Israeli government are modern day nazis
Copie copie cope cope
Anthony I would love to have a genuine conversation about ye and everything you‚Äôre talking about in this video .  all love just really want to understand your logic and what makes you come to these conclusions
Anthony you unironicaly gave a murdering neo Nazi (Burzum) a decent review in the past even though you&#39;ve said his ideas and at least of his songs lyrics were repugnant, but you reviewed the actual music and not just lyrical content. It&#39;s not unreviewable you&#39;re just a coward who doesn&#39;t want to put the work in to explain why it&#39;s good or bad despite the lyrical content. At least shill mainstream reviewers actually reviewed it. This is pathetic, whiny and after being subscribed to you since the black background days of 2009, I&#39;m good. See ya dude<br><br>(P.s I&#39;m not even a Kanye Stan, haven&#39;t been a fan of him consistently since the college trilogy, but I was a fan of you and your criticism (remember can bad people make good music? A video you made.) But I guess a murderous neo Nazi with incredibly racist and anti Semitic and open about it in at least one song is deserving of a 6 (burzum fallen review) but Kanye is unreviewable, you are as deep as a ground floor now, and that&#39;s what saddens me)
I mean, you CAN be in the 3rd group and still not agree w a LOT of his controversial shit and still fuck w the music hard.. no?
If you still support Kanye at this point you are an antisemite. There&#39;s no &quot;separating art from the artist&quot; here. May Kanye fade into obscurity
you‚Äôre delusional if you think ye‚Äôs done anything worthwhile since 2018
I think I‚Äôm done after 10 years of viewership. You have become so insufferable and annoying I can‚Äôt even force myself to look past it anymore.
you can still be a kanye fan and not agree with what he says, most of the lyrics arnt that bad. and i just like the music. i know your not trying to stop me from doing that. just i feel i need to explain myself a little. i dont think hes a good person. but me liking the new record has nothing to do with that. i know the lyrics are bad. if someone said that to my face i would be very offended. not that im not here. its just not the main focus. i just like the album. the production to me is just perfect (except the mixing but he will fix that). i like some of the songs a lot. and in general, i just want to enjoy music. i know your not saying that i cant. i am just failing horribly to explain where im coming from when i give the album a LIGHT 9. i sware i cant explain shit at all. also i do feel guilty about liking it dont think i dont
thats why i love fantano
if KANYE was black women like <b>Sexyy Red</b> is instead of being black man, you would give it 10
Kanye treats his discography as a basement where he can pass out drunk and piss on the carpet without being told anything at this point
POV you get paid to hate Kanye
Bro reviewed burzum &amp; made a tier list on Led Zeppelin but THIS isn‚Äôt okay üòÇye ok
It‚Äôs a 8/10
This a political review lol
This video only makes really annoying people angry üòÇ
Damn, this was a video of nothing.
if the album was called FANTANO  1 it would‚Äôve gotten a 10
estrogenic liberal cringe
But if it was called the vultures store
Engagement farming. Scamtano.
but you&#39;ll happily review ice spice or sexy red...
This is the corniest video on youtube. Hate kanye and his fans all you want, but the album slaps.
Not exactly sure what the point of this is really. it&#39;s basically a video about not doing a video
Also mention actual Christians find his blasphemy on this album disgusting, he is moving like a satanist hypocrite
I guess all of these people in the comments are Anti Semetic
Proud cultish weirdo that follows him
But what‚Äôs the final rating?
Dont forget melons ex wife made him get a vasectomy then left him lmaoüò≠üòÇ
This comment section is painful to read man
GO GO GO GO<br><br>HEAD SO BALD IT&#39;S A HONOR ROLL<br><br>FANTANO SO MAD ITS A HOT ZERO
Seemingly the only bright spots off of this album seem to be from its features, not Kanye, so the people trying to separate art from the artist should maybe just listen to the people who give this album any semblance of quality, not the crazed anti-semite who decidedly ruined some of the songs on this album imo (I.e back to me, which could have been listenable without kanye on it)

I‚Äôm fine with you not liking an album but comparing those who enjoyed it to Kanye himself is completely wrong. Just cause some people can actually enjoy a song despite a few bad lines doesn‚Äôt make them a horrible human being
Ok now you hate Kanye enough melon. Thank you
The fact that you made it ‚Äúunreviewable‚Äù just proves kanye point
Love you melon but this is too much
I could give two fucks about what Kanye thinks and says.. The album is mid anyways. He‚Äôs musically washed
Alot of Nazi sympathizers in the youtube comment section says alot about how doomed we all are. This fascist dystopian death machine will only get worse; especially in the upcoming election season. Brace yourself, hell is about rise up soon.
If kanye was not anti semen you would give it a ‚àö4 at least
shut up ur pushing 40
Man you got trash huh‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I thought you‚Äôd actually do a review
Te hiciste hater por ardido vro
I‚Äôm guessing you didn‚Äôt hear the carti verses easy 10/10 album
A lot of y&#39;all have not listened to this review before leaving a comment and it shows. Even if he did review this it would&#39;ve probably been a 3-5.
I respect your opinion but I love kanye too much so I dont care.
is the dude that your exwife is with now kanye fan or what?
If he wasn‚Äôt antisemitic you would give it at least 6 can‚Äôt give sexy redd that high and not be divorced
To act like there isn‚Äôt any good musical qualities about this album is disingenuous. A professional critic articulates the negatives and positives they perceive, which Fantano is usually good at doing. This is just a lazy critique and I would be interested in hearing other professional music critics opinion on his inability to effectively do his job here. Contrast this with Professor Skye‚Äôs review on the album. To not even mention Tye‚Äôs contribution is insane and it sounded like he barely wanted to give Freddie Gibbs his props. This diminishes your credibility so much and it‚Äôs sad to see.
hall of fame hater
When will Fantano realize he&#39;s an anti-Semite too?
Keep yapping man. This is why your wife divorced you
Me after finding another L take fantano has given out: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4">0:00</a>
So instead of a review you just keep virtue signaling for 7 minutes
if the album was called Vulture Death you would have given it a light 6
Nothing sums up psychotic Kanye fans more than the fact the most upvoted explanation on Genius for the reference line is that he is calling his wife a ‚Äúreference‚Äù because she is an inspiration to many and has started fashion trends‚Ä¶<br><br>Kanye was my favorite artist for a long time, but it is impossible to feel that way anymore thanks largely to his pathetic fandom and his own disgusting/ignorant behavior
if this was called &quot;To Pimp A Vulture&quot; you woulda givern it a 10.
came here to leave a dislike and leave before the ad finished
STILL THE KING üëë
In all seriousness, I feel for Anthony here. Everyone is treating Kanye&#39;s downfall like a reality show when in actuality someone needs to intervene and either make him realize shit or cause a major shift in his revenue sources (like streams) so he wakes up. Most of his current fans just spout the same shit and are fine with him being the way he is. It&#39;s not funny. It&#39;s not endearing. It&#39;s not exciting. It&#39;s sad
this is the only album so far that has caused fantano to have a meltdown on twitter, and start a stream reacting to an album he&#39;s already listened to, tweaking out from sheer rage the entire time and skipping parts for no fucking reason. kanye is truly pushing boundaries and mental stabilities
What happened to this channel. Talk about trash
Just review the album üò≠üò≠üôèüèª
Fantano&#39;s right about how anything he says about the album in this video will convince me that it&#39;s straight trash. Yes it has its flaws but I do believe it&#39;s decent-ish but not anything special. However I completely agree with not being able to separate the art from the artist in this case because of the shit he is saying on the album, Kanye&#39;s recent statements have really pissed me off and I find it hard to believe how somebody who has been a creative genius in music, is so ignorant in the things he says. I hope he like actually does something to apologize but idk at this point if he ever will.
If the album was named To Pimp a Vulture it would have been a 10 smh...
Kanye West has bipolar disorder, and the lack of people who understand this is astonishing. A black man praising Hitler is clearly absolutely insane; Hitler despised black people - perhaps Kanye does have responsibility for constantly dipping in and out of his medication that exacerbates these episodes. <br><br>However, the fact nobody can see these are the ramblings of total insanity and manic episodes is pretty concerning. It shows that &quot;World Mental Health Day&quot; is mostly a virtue-signaling exercise for people who simply want likes on Instagram.<br><br>My cousin is a paranoid schizophrenic and tried to kill my Uncle with a hammer. Do I hate him for it? Do I think he would have done it if he was unwell? Mental health disorders are scary and make people do insane things. To hold him to account as if he&#39;s just some random guy who doesn&#39;t have chronic mental health issues is equally insane. With that said, this album is absolutely horseshit.
Separate the art from artist or don‚Äôt say anything at all
You‚Äôre washed kid
The entire review is a moot point after you called out Kanye for dehumanizing his wife right after saying she has no thoughts or opinions üíÄ nazis are bad, so are mysoginistix music reviewers
The album wasn&#39;t that bad lmao. Calm down. I thought it was easily better than something like For All The Dogs.
Why even put a video out about it at all if you felt this way about the person making it. Just dont even give it a review, i feel like thats a bigger statement than listening to the album, and then making a review like this.
ok sure but Burn and Carnival both go absolutely bonkers
Respectfully this might be your worst review yet. You say this is trash but give the sexy red album a 8?? üíÄüíÄ. No wonder nobody takes you seriously anymore
Fantano just can&#39;t comprehend real artistic expression and depth beyond the surface level.
Hopefully all the Kanye fans and... lets&#39;s just call them &quot;not-sees&quot;.... leave the community now. Thank you for sticking to your Melon.
You need to rethink this route you‚Äôre going down‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. You have positively reviewed albums where artists talk about killing and robbing, but this is we‚Äôre you draw the line? If you genuinely take a step back and look at the stuff Kanye has said it‚Äôs really not that bad honestly, And on top of that he‚Äôs apologized for it. At the end of the day words don‚Äôt physically harm anyone and anyone who claims to act like a piece of shit because Kanye said something was already a piece of shit.
this album wasn‚Äôt nearly that bad
If the album was called ‚ÄúTo Pimp A Vulture‚Äù he woulda given it an 11/10
Sorry Anthony I already like the album i will not let your opinion influence my thoughts on the album
Lol you are such a dork
Fantano gotta be a top three virtue signaler fr üî•üî•üî•
Bro was legit broken
Review music‚ùå<br>Review literally everything else about Kanye and his fans‚úÖ
The moment you used the word &quot;platformed&quot;, my eyes rolled into the back of my skull.<br><br>Yet another socialist gatekeeper.
Dude really thinks his Review matters üòÇ
I‚Äôm not a Kanye apologist, but I do think it‚Äôs possible to separate the art from the artist
Damn, this might be your worst review ever because the project was suprisingly better than his last few efforts. You can dismiss his behavior while also giving the music a more honest review.
I just can‚Äôt comprehend how your ears listen to sexy redd and think it‚Äôs musically ambitious but call this album trash you‚Äôre blinded by hatred
Oh here he goes
He‚Äôs right tho, who runs all the banks, Hollywood and owns all the porn sites?
Waiting for unreviewable 2üî•üî•
We are witnessing a grown man have a mental breakdown infront of us
bruh he apologized in Hebrew to the jews now rate this album
Honestly a great album and I‚Äôm excited with what comes next
If it was called My Beautiful Dark Vultures you would give it a light 7 on &quot;this thing&quot;.
It&#39;s funny you can give Kanye a 10 multiple times AND say he&#39;s unreviewable lol.
Anthony really showed his love for this album
You got the alt-righters real riled up with this one Anthony.
i acc quite liked vultures but it is rly sad to see kanye&#39;s life spiral downwards so crazily, hope he gets the help he needs
These comments prove him right lol
If the album was called The Life of Vultures you would have gave it an 8/10
4. People who just like his music because he is a good musician and don&#39;t care about the crazy stuff he says
Fantano try to have fun challenge (impossible). Kanye obviously just wanted to have fun on this album some of the lines are clearly jokes. And the songs that aren‚Äôt jokes are 8/10 or higher. Not saying it‚Äôs his best album but surely not his worst.
FIRST ARTIST TO GET AN UNREVIEWABLE REVIEW!! GOAT
trippin
It was good üëç
hater
Y‚Äôall dead ass? This music‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs literally amazing. I‚Äôm dumbfounded .
comment section moving so fast no one will see that i‚Äôm currently beating my meat with young thug on in the background
You like VULTURES 1 don‚Äôt you squidward?
If Fantano really hated the album he would have just given it a bad score
I agree with a lot of your musical criticism for this one. There is some empty space that can be filled up better and a lot of the songs aren‚Äôt fleshed out or have awkward transitions
Yeah but if this album was called My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, it would&#39;ve got a 7.
I stopped at Life Of Pablo. I really like his music. He made some really important sounds to me, as a black man, but there is no way i can support the new sound he produces when one of my best friends is jewish. It feels wrong.
If it was called to pimp a vulture you would have gave it a 10
Can you at least try to separate the art from the artist. Like why do you draw the line on Jewish related bars to a point where it&#39;s unreviewable. The end of the videos sounds like you&#39;ll give it a 2/10 honestly. I thought the album was weak too but there just too much bias you have against Kayne even more so than Drake at this point where I doubt you can even separate the art for a genuine review. The part you where talk about the 3 type of Kanye fans and all of them describes a unhinged loser pretty much sealed the deal on where this video is going.
if this album is unreviewable what about that terrible sexyy red???? lmao
This guy is so weird
Dawg there‚Äôs still non Kanye cultists listening to the album u can still review it  lmao
let‚Äôs keep melon in our hearts from the incoming barrage of braindead yedolf fans üòî
First time I&#39;ve seen melon have a meltdown this bad
Fantano will give sexual predators and convicted criminals fair reviews but draw the line at hilarious racist outbursts by a mentally I‚Äôll man
This man has even given Tom Mcdonald a review...... so you know for a fact this hot hot garbage...
I disagree it‚Äôs the best album ever Kanye changed my life and made me happier
Your pushing 40 and your wife left you. This is the average Kanye hater folks
if it was &quot;to pimp a vulture&quot; it&#39;d be a 10
The Kanye meat riders are going nuts in these comments üíÄ
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=249">4:09</a> this part had me rolling üòÇ üíÄ
double standarts as usual , you reviewed burzum :))
I wouldn‚Äôt have a problem with you just not liking the album, or that you don‚Äôt like him as a person. It‚Äôs reviewing the album as if you were ever going to give it a fair chance at all. It‚Äôs fine, you hate him and won‚Äôt ever enjoy his music again - just own it. Acting like you would have ever been objective about this is so disingenuous.<br><br>Also, if you were so morally against him as a person and what he stands for, you wouldn‚Äôt even post this video. But no, you‚Äôll milk as much profit as you can out of this review, the twitch stream and even the twitter engagement bait.
Crazy how way too many people just treated this like another kanye album‚Ä¶
If it was called 808s and Vultures you would give it a strong 9.
I think he likes it guys idk
no one cares about your politics bro just rate the album üôèüôèüôè
honestly i only listened to carnival bc people keep talking about how good it is and its complete shit??? kanye is completely cooked as a rapper and carti sounds like hes pranking kanye with that fucking voice
I thought you were genuinely trolling on your Twitter a few hours ago. But nevermind, you are actually serious about it. yea Kanye said controversial shit, but the way you talk about his music has nothing to do with musically reviewing it, it‚Äôs just pure hate speaking out of you towards him as a person. Yeah you can‚Äôt fully separate the art from the artist. But seriously. What‚Äôs the point of this video. Worse than Jesus Is King? Get a grip
If the album was called &quot;to pimp a vulture&quot; you would have given it a 10
bro makes it sound like the album is a gas chamber, boy you goofy ahh sounds fun at parties <br><br>lighten up bald dork, it‚Äôs not that deep it‚Äôs just beats and hooks, music
He‚Äôs definitely a Jew üòÇ
I won‚Äôt pretend to know anything about their relationship but the way Kanye parades around his new girlfriend basically naked in public at all times is really off to me. Sure it may be consensual but it‚Äôs still weird. He has children is that really appropriate?
If anyone watched his Twitch stream and looked at his Twitter you‚Äôll know this guy is quite literally having a mental breakdown and I‚Äôm not exaggerating. It‚Äôs kind of sad when you realize he‚Äôs 40 years old and it‚Äôs because of a guy who doesn‚Äôt even know he exists.
Nobody cares about your morals Tony. Its the equivalent to the dirt on my shoe.
üíÄ
there&#39;s no point in arguing with nazi sympathizers but just so we&#39;re clear: even if it&#39;s the best album ever kanye is a fucking nazi i dont think Anthony needs to be fair about it lmao
Which one of the only 3 categories of Kanye fan does Jpegmafia fit into?<br>He worked with Kanye on the album, called it a masterpiece and said he learned alot working with Ye.. isn‚Äôt he one of the most outspokenly liberal artists in hip hop ?<br><br>Perhaps there‚Äôs more nuance to this conversation than anything Fantano lets on and part of that nuance is something he can never speak on which is from the perspective  of being a  black man. It‚Äôs easy for him and many white people to cancel black heroes and condemn them as ‚Äúvillains‚Äù with no nuance or good in them but when you grow up black influenced by the culture you have way more empathy and understanding for why someone like Kanye feels the way he feels in the industry. It doesn‚Äôt mean what he‚Äôs saying is right and he shouldn‚Äôt apologize, just that it‚Äôs more understandable if you try to put on your empathy shoes with ‚Äúthe villain‚Äù sometimes and not just the ‚Äúvictim‚Äù
Anthony Fantano started his Ultra SJW arc
Well, looks like that‚Äôs the end of Fantano. Bummer.
Who hurt this bald ass üíÄ
I love how he reviews people who beat their pregnant wives fairly but draws the line at a person that said some words he doesn‚Äôt agree with
can&#39;t wait for unreviewable 2 and unreviewable 3!
Basedüòä
D1 yapping
i fucking hate you anthony
Would have been better to not review it at all, fair enough if you don‚Äôt agree with Kanye. This clearly isn‚Äôt a fair assessment though, agree with the points made about the tracks you mentioned but you didn‚Äôt mention a single good element of the album. Again, agree with your take on the fan base and his views but not mentioning it at all would have been better then surely?
HEAD SO GOOD SHE ON HONOUR ROLL
Just review it bro ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Anthony plz respond to this I don‚Äôt know how to reach you and you haven‚Äôt responded to any of my letters. I‚Äôve grown up my entire life not knowing who my father is, but thanks to some newfound evidence that I spotted hidden in my mother‚Äôs  Melonfield in our backyard, I think you might just be my father.<br><br> So if you had a sexual encounter with a woman named Debra in the bathroom of a Save-A-Lot in the Bridgeport area during the summer of 2004 then plz reach out and I will provide a DNA test to prove. <br><br>I‚Äôve actually been a fan of your channel for a few years now, and I‚Äôve always felt like you were raising me from afar, because it feels like you‚Äôre speaking to me through your videos, like father to son. I hope this can be the start of a great relationship between the two of us.
bruh
Bro is not even flaming Kanye anymore, he just is sadly attempting to categorize a majority of his fanbase into 3 dumbed down groups just for enjoying music. Did Melon forget people can have opinions? Instead of just saying he doesn&#39;t enjoy the album in his own right, he goes on to accuse anybody who does enjoy it of supporting anti semitic practices, or basically just calls their life meaningless. Melon seems a little b*tthurt from twitter to me.
He‚Äôs a narcissist and a nihilist who decided that the most crucial factor regarding the longevity of fame is how captivating your personal narrative is. And also that it doesn‚Äôt technically matter if you play the villain: if you‚Äôre a compelling villain you‚Äôll be remembered. <br><br>He is all too happy to cause harm to himself, his family, the Jewish community, and the wider society so long as it lends to a good story.
Damn, I thought Kanye was rapping his ass off on this album‚Ä¶ the production was pretty underwhelming and 1 dimensional but this is the most energy I‚Äôve heard from him in years, I‚Äôm really surprised that not a lot of people like it.
go give sexxy red a 10 maybe
kanye really pissed you off, so that&#39;s why you lookin for the mistakes in this album,no one said the album is one of the best of all times and actually no one predict something like this , it&#39;s been a while since kanye released so that&#39;s why the ppl are happy , the album very good , enjoyable,i can listen to it all day without thinkin about lyrics or bad mixin or any of other shit , and maybe ye gonna fix all these stuff in future , and also I don&#39;t think that other albums that released in this year or last year is better than this, and as i said u just mad at kanye .
you‚Äôre divorced and will die alone
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=423">7:03</a> minutes of pure yapping
Buena Review y tus puntos de vista son bastante v√°lidos, pero todo lo que dices no me puede importar menos ya que como no vivo en estados unidos, toda cosa que suceda haya por m√°s terrible que sea es para mi como &quot;los gringos son gringos, solo ellos pueden actuar de esa manera y entender lo que sucede con su realidad&quot; igualmente creo que Kanye deber√≠a disculparse por lo sucedido. Pero como est√° la guerra de Gaza todo respeto por la comunidad de jud√≠os es vista como de inmediato como apoyo a Israel, as√≠ qu√© ni siquiera si se disculpara y rectificara ser√≠a visto como algo bueno. Pero como dije &quot; los gringos son gringos&quot;
i get what you mean w some of the thing hes said but bro, its not THAT badüò≠üôè
This is truly a time to be alive
Review ur divorce
Lmao he looks so sad in the thimbnail
Thank u so much ‚ù§
wow melon im not surprised ur meat riding the hate train but this a new low took 5 minutes to actually talk about the album.
weird.... unsubbed
But you loved Sexxy Red üòÇ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=370">6:10</a>
Everyone dislike this video, and after you watch this video(I advise you don&#39;t, however), delete this video from your history so that the view won&#39;t go towards the video.<br><br>I also suggest that you dislike the video, because giving <i>THIS</i> guy support is unfathomable
He‚Äôs actually gone insane lmao
All I‚Äôm saying is I love the album and the fans love the album. I don‚Äôt need this dude to tell me what music I should like. It‚Äôs already one of the most successful duo albums of all time. That should speak for itself
Ok at least we got few mins of music review at theend, was it really that hard?
Biased ü§°
What are your thoughts on BURN??
I&#39;m a massive Kanye fan, up until ye I thought every album he made was gold, everything he created was gold, influential etc. But I didn&#39;t really like ye, or Donda and this album is so muddy, unfinished and strange. I hope he gets better, because I have loved his music for most of my life, maybe his creativity has waned as his illness grows. Idk if he can make music like I love again, I&#39;ll still bump his old stuff. <br>I would disagree with you about the &quot;3 types of fans&quot;, I think there&#39;s the silent majority of Ye fans, ones that like the music, and are disappointed either way
Just gonna be honest.<br><br>I agree with your assessment of Kanye, about his lyrics, about his wife and somewhat about certain tracks. He is filth that is proud of what he is.<br><br>But i just like the music. Im just not politically charged about it. I agree with you Fantano i genuinely do. But i can separate the art from the artist even if the lyrics are disgraceful and i know he means it. I just don&#39;t take Kanye serious i like his music, see him as a human being and get on with my life.
Good, Kanye is undeserving of a review.
wow i shouldn‚Äôt have expected anything different. melon head really is a snowflake and can‚Äôt separate the art from the artist
Didn‚Äôt think vultures was that bad tbh. Kanyes rapping on some songs is a bit iffy but some of the production is really good, songs like ‚Äúburn‚Äù ‚Äúcarnival‚Äù and ‚Äúproblematic‚Äù are stand outs
I disagree with you about hoodrat. I think it‚Äôs a really cool sample
So he spent 7 minutes talking about old ass Ye drama from the past 5 years instead of serving his channel purpose.<br><br>Oh and proceed to insult over the half of his followers for enjoying kanye MUSIC. <br><br>MUSIC is the keyword here Melon.
post divorce mental breakdown coming in
I liked back to me but it sounds so weird now there&#39;s like too much reverb and shit, and the rest of the tracks are forgettable as fuck?
i bet if kanye was ‚Äúanti capitalist‚Äù instead of ‚Äúanti semitic‚Äù he would give this a 10 üòÇüòÇüòÇ
There‚Äôs also the fourth category being the ones that are hurt by his behaviour and don‚Äôt condone it but that can also enjoy the music
Melon being as controversial as Kanye. At least Ye produces fun music while he only drops mid reviews
W review
ü§£ triggered and taking lyrics out of context
Everyone who even sat down and gave this album their time is a ü§°
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=143">2:23</a> calling someone‚Äôs life meaningless over an opinion, while also being mad at peoples opinion of you is kinda wild
Cry about it more melon. Ye will stay winning and people will stay listening to his music, like you lol.
Good review this thing is straight trash üóëÔ∏è
If you&#39;re going to make videos like these, what is even the point of your platform and channel?? Grow some balls man, you can shit on Kanye all you want but dropping a review like this isn&#39;t what a lot of people subscribed to you for. It&#39;s not just a bad video, it&#39;s just bad journalism in general and shows a real disconnect from how thorough and interesting your content was in the past. And if you really feel that strongly, it&#39;d probably say more to just not make a video at all.<br><br>P.S I&#39;m not even really a fan of Kanye&#39;s new stuff, and even I noticed you entirely misunderstood the reference line.
Atp you are just posting these ‚Äúreviews‚Äù and ‚Äúopinions‚Äù for clout
Anthony you&#39;ve completely ruled out the possibility that this is just a kanye clone
Kanye is the Goat. Melon is just a scared left wing 1 Iq
anthony is definitely bustin a jew broad
Kanye still own you
this is one of THE reviews of all time
Why is it like this ‚ò†Ô∏è
Me after 1 minute of listing ‚ÄúBro shut the fuck up and talk about the music, like goddamnnnnn.‚Äù
Focus on your divorce instead
Bro lost it
I don‚Äôt understand how you can call vultures disgusting but rate an album literally about sex an 8/10
If the album was called &quot;To Pimp A Vulture&quot; you would give it a 10
Melon gives me woke vibes about Kanye instead of just reviewing music.<br>Makes sense for someone that‚Äôs <br>vegan lol.
Fantano is just a hater. Even CANDACE OWENS is bumping this album, and Fantano is sitting here calling this <i>unreviewable</i>
is this in the same universe as the Unforgivable saga
Kanye changed my life
Unfortunately lost all respect for this guy, his reveiws got me more into music but between the tory lanez and this review, Im done. Im not major fans of either artists but using their outside of music actions to justify not giving a review is immature and lazy.
hows your wife
Stars is fire ong
What&#39;s annoying to me is how long it took so many people to leave Kanye in the dust. A lot of people seemed to be still cool with him when he announced his support for Trump, when he began propagating harmful ideas about black people (like slavery being a choice), when he began working with fucking Candace Owens, when he ran for president promising to turn the US into a Christian theocratic state that cracked down on women&#39;s rights when he and Candace sported those trash ass WLM shirts. Somehow, he finally reached the point of no return when he went antisemitic. No shade on Jewish people. But I wish the &quot;universal&quot; outrage came a lot earlier.
despite all the bad things in this album like the sometimes cringe corny lyrics and the bad features i think the production and beats were really really good, some of his best production in years
Thoughts on Slayer?  Are you not reviewing JPEG anymore?
So just stop reviewing his music if youre not gonna do an actual review on the music itself but instead the artist. Youve been doing this for how long? And you cant even be professional about it as a music critic.
anthony fantano try not to hate on a black version of himself (impossible)
Leave this comments section while you still can, it&#39;s just a bunch of die-hard Kanye stans talking about how Fantano is too &quot;biased&quot; and &quot;a hater&quot; for not wanting to review antisemitic drivel.
Nah this album was fire Fantano. You like way too much shitty music to hate on this album
Please don&#39;t give this guy a platform anymore, he doesn&#39;t deserve it. <br><br>How are you gonna call this UNREVIEWABLE and give REDD out of all people the best rating of last year, I seriously can&#39;t anymore
i love kanye like kanye loves kanye
&quot;I don&#39;t like your politics so I&#39;m not reviewing your music&quot; also you got the reference line all wrong.
yeah the whole album is a hot piece of garbage, feel bad for his daughter who will grow up realizing how fucked up the album shes on is
Where&#39;s the line where an artist becomes so personally toxic that you can&#39;t review them? I get not being able to separate the art from the artist but what makes Ye categorically different from any other shitty person whose music you reviewed? He&#39;s hardly the first rapper to promote antisemitism.
Why did u review it
ok now review the album
<b>the virtue signaling on this channel as of recently has been off the charts ffs</b>
Just wait for pitchfork to give it an 8 ü§£
Somehow you whine about Kanye being antisemitic but you have a ceasefire now link still running in your stream
i have your bank statements
I hope he drops the album review soon instead of a kanye anti semite rant
appreciate your reviews anthony!
Melon‚Äôs so hurt that Ye is topping the charts üìà
Fantano u the goat üôè
my hommie fantano just described me with his second stereotype of kanyes fan im blushing &gt;.&lt;
Bro got cooked on twiiter
If you guys didn&#39;t see, this guy didn&#39;t even finish Carnival on the album<br><br>How are you a reviewer when you don&#39;t even listen to the album in full. This guy went into the album with such a bad attitude.<br><br>Of course he&#39;s not gonna give it a good review, what a hater this guy is, I think Drake was right guys..
boooooooo , Love you Fantano, but you are clearly too personally biased to actually critique this album fairly. This review does not accomplish anything at all.
i dont even care about kanye, just PLEASE talk about the new mk.gee record, for fucks sake...
Gotta love the Kanye stan spambots in full force tonight.
ok but paid clears fade by 3000 miles and kanye&#39;s verse rlly hits it sounds like thug
if this album was called To Pimp A Vulture, you would&#39;ve given it a 10/10
Kanye West fan type four- The one who just listens to the music?
emotionally driven video for sure, im not sure how you could say with a straight face that this is his worst work when songs like carnival, good (don&#39;t die), starz, paperwork, and problematic are on the album
Actually just here for the music
shocker!
We are literally witnessing Kanye unironically produce his own &quot;Everywhere at the End of Time&quot; meta albums. Start at the beginning of his discography, and by the end you will hear the music of a man who has lost his mind. It is quite sad.
No joke, I am so dissapointed of Anthony. I know that Kanye said some fucked up shit but brother you do realize that you have reviewed Burzum right? And why even make this video if you don&#39;t want to give Kanye a platform anymore... oh right... views. It&#39;s funny how this guy has no problem shitting on artists all of the time and masking it as &quot;It&#39;s just my opinion&quot; but has a meltdown and calls people who like vulture idiots. Like bro... thanks for being an unbiased reviewer my guy üíÄ
it seems like youre reviewing everything except the music
Kanye West: Great marriage with wife, great relationship with his kids, album number 1 in 184 countries, first independent album to hit number 1, shoes and clothes selling out <br><br>Fantano: Wife divorced him, having a mental breakdown on Twitter because of trolls, balding, fat
Soooo light 6??
This surely isn‚Äôt a bias review at all üòÉ
I like the album actually
Kanye West, Ty Dolla $ign, Vultures 1. Forever.
Ok but was the album good?
Just so we‚Äôre clear this is definitely Kanye‚Äôs best album in years for anybody looking for an actual organic opinion not driven by personal politics.
Well. I like it. It&#39;s catchy
Angry melon is a dark dark character
David Bowie literally had sex with a child and you still review Bowie. Weird to seperate the art from the artist only sometimes
Herdrat Herdrat Herdrat Herdrat
Hahahaha I mean we all called it before we even heard the album. The man doesn‚Äôt have a unbias bone in his body. He‚Äôs losing credibility on a yearly basis
can we have a big debate bout yes personality and i will clear ur mind with truth and facts `? @theneedledrop
I know Kanye has said some shit that Is hateful but atleast review the goddamn music. Its your job, its what you wanted to do. If this was the breaking point then do not, under any circumstances review any artist, that has had controversy then. This is just straight hate to Kanye, even as a fan of JPEGMAFIA (who was credited in 3 songs in this album), you just hated that he is a dickrider for Kanye. <br><br>Given the climate of politics of what the fuck is happening, i doubt that one influential crazy black man is enough for you to get scared and not do your job. This a new low
A white bald man telling us how to think lmaooo, <br>the racism on this vid is in another level, stay on ut privilege crak
bro its not THAT bad üòÇ
Kanye stans in the comments literally proving all the points Fanta made üíÄ
You re being misogynistic to kanyes wife then proceed to call him out clown behavour
From 10 to unreviewable, oh has Kayne Fallen
kanye got you heated
This is what being a soy liberal does to a &quot;man&quot;.
r/Kanye in shambles rn
Realistically despite all of Kanye‚Äôs comments some of the production on this album is undeniably brilliant and rivals many of his best projects.
Booooooooooooooo
He must&#39;ve really hated North&#39;s verse
Spot on!
Thank you for this dude, means a lot as a Jewish guy
zoomer atom bomb dropped by melon
You didn‚Äôt get the reference line AT ALL. He means like a reference for the perfect woman for him.
alright lets see if u think its good or not uhh dosnt seem its reviewable so uhh u think its good .i think the album its too sexual. 3 min in the video.I am a meat rider btw .I think he should stop being a NAZE .Uhh 4 mins in no review . I like the album .i think the worst tracks are PAID,talking and the song where he talkis about women falling from the sky.U only said the negative things about it largely because of ur jewish fans.Yea he should stop being lustful , filler and has too much potential buuuut yet just says he hates jews ETC .If he just , u know ,didnt hate jews and have an insane sensation of ruining hes reputation and making lower effort music maybe he could&#39;ve just been the G/O/A/T.People are saying that this is kanyes new era but hes 46 and thats incredibly long for a career.Iam still a kanye meat rider , a proud one.I dont think its worse then donda 2 ,JIS or dodna .I think its better then Donda ,Donda has more lows but some highs .But Vultures had mostly highs .U didnt talk about the other songs but this isnt a review so it dosn&#39;t matter  .<br><br>@theneedledrop . Love the video no hate been wacthing for a couple of years.
I get why someone wouldn‚Äôt like this album, and I even get why someone wouldn‚Äôt want to give Kanye the benefit of even having the album reviewed. But going in on the fans of the project is just really sort of a dick move
But reviewing burzum is fine‚Ä¶
Ngl This is my favourite Needle Drop review
Reminder: this is the same YouTube who literally reviewed a Burzum album for classics week. Fantano has zero integrity left.
antisemites mad
Bad bald take
But he made graduation.....
Runaway
If it was named To Pimp a Vulture it would&#39;ve been a 10
thats not what he even meant by being jesus
Use this as the dislike button
The Js DO have a VERY disproportionate amount of money, and thats a real problem/bad thing. I hate that you cant bring it up because everyone will just assume youre a Nazi
The thumbnail says it all üòÇ
This gotta be bait
Shut up baldy Kanye owns you
Kanye wrote about you in burn. &quot;Who&#39;s not entertained by my pain? Who ain&#39;t cash a check off my name.&quot;
Ur opinions are irrelevant you settled for a 2/10 and got left by said 2/10
I knew this would be a cucked, condescending preaching session where you didn‚Äôt talk about the music itself at all lol.
Bro...
Address the hard r allegations dude
Based
I can see why this guys wife left him, Yezus Christ
So he refuses to review it because he doesn‚Äôt like Kanye, got it. Real professional (Even though he still reviewed some songs)
This album is trash, and I won&#39;t deny that, but it was so strange watching Fantano listen to it live on twitch. It was like he took personal offense in it, and was very angry towards the chat. He claimed that the chat viewers were trying to &quot;gaslight,&quot; but, if anything, I felt like he was doing a lot of &quot;gaslighting&quot; too by putting a lot of opinions as facts. He also responded to a lot of chat member&#39;s comments with more personal responses too, like about things such as divorce. He seemed to think that all of the chat were crazy kanye stand against him, and there were certainly some people there, but I don&#39;t think it was the majority of viewers. I have been a kanye fan for a long time and it&#39;s sad to see how he&#39;s evolved (or devolved), but I&#39;m also a big fan of Fantano and it&#39;s also strange seeing how he acts now versus the way he was when I first started watching him. Just seeing him so bitter and angry was strange and concerning, and I hope he&#39;s okay
If it was called to pimp a vulture 1 you would&#39;ve given it a 10
Skill issue. Also it&#39;s so obvious u just don&#39;t like his politics and it biases your review
Cant wait for the guys at nfr podcast praise the shit out of this, citing ye&#39;s supposed &quot;creative genius&quot; as an excuse for all his bullshit üòÇ big up to you for handling the situation like this.
Anthony is truly the biggest Kanye fan ‚ù§
I was enjoying some songs a looot from the album but it felt weird because of what kind a person he is and this video kinda brought me back to reality. The music doesn&#39;t make him a better person. Still, fuck Kanye.
Anyway .. Name 5 mos def songs
Bro said all this &amp; still listened to the album front to backüòÇ
I love you so much please love me back
Kanye gets more hate for opinions than Woody Allen got for molestation
I still like the music tho
Thumbnail looks like BONES - PaidProgramming cover
LMAOOO HE MAD
HER BODY LIKE THE WILD, WILD WEST‚Ä¶
It‚Äôs crazy cuz i feel like if death grips came out with hoodrat instrumental you would glaze that
kanye‚Äôs album was so good it becomes the first album to get a rating of unreviewable! is Ye the confirmed goat with this accomplishment??
Paid actor
Nice to hear your political thoughts, can&#39;t wait for the full music review!
Bro why r u cryingüò≠
bravo, you&#39;re right
booh ooh the guy is right jews in america dictate who lives and who dies just listen to the music and stfu
I used to be a Kanye fan. a BIG Kanye fan. I stopped listening after the antisemitic shit he was spewing. I started listening again after like a year and honestly once this album released, I realized that he just doesn&#39;t give a fuck anymore. He&#39;s just a hateful person, he is everything he criticizes. I have seen in real time people become more antisemitic after his rhetoric and I don&#39;t think I can listen to Kanye anymore. If I continued to listen to his music and vultures, I would then be endorsing his rhetoric.
Can&#39;t wait for the redux
Congrats to kanye for having an unreviewable album
Longtime viewer here. Props to your integrity, Anthonyüôèüèøüôèüèøcontinue standing on your principles and as a fan of Kanye‚Äôs music myself (who has since stepped away from the mass fandom), I appreciate you saying what many of his fans are failing to understand or comprehend
I don&#39;t like kanye as a person, but I like this album and his music.
Im 3 minutes in, does he ever talk about the music?
Bro hes so mad üò≠üò≠
So strong 7 to light 8
Yes! Another earful of liberal politics, this channel is just getting better and better at reviews!! ü§°
I saw ur lil 100 you gave on AOTY for 2 minutes before you took it down lol
You‚Äôve lost all your credit buddy. Wonder why your wife left your ass.
Bro summed up most of the fans, I do love his music, but I mean‚Ä¶ you cannot come back from this.
Anthony would&#39;ve given it a 10/10 if Ye he said &quot;Marvelous Melon Head Music Reviewers Don&#39;t Just Fall Out of the Sky You Know&quot;
Damn, Ye&#39;s new album got Anthony looking disheveled. <br><br>-Flannel&#39;s not buttoned up, exposing a lot of undershirt<br>-Massive eye bags under his eyes<br>-Goatee looks unkempt
Review 1999 write the future album melon
Ye broke fantano
Idc what y‚Äôall say last 3 songs of the album are amazing
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=334">5:34</a> Thaught he said the n word there
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=320">5:20</a> just here to get paid at least he‚Äôs being honest üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Waiting to see what dunkey thinks about this.
No way this guy can sit down a review death grips with 0 issue like a psychopath, but when an actual artist makes music we have to talk about the politics üòÇ
get some sleep king
If it were called &quot;To Pimp a Vulture&quot;  you would&#39;ve given it a 10
sorry the chorus of back to me is dope and you can&#39;t convince me otherwise
as a kanye fan, this album is horrible. when i say i‚Äôm a kanye fan, i enjoy when he is mentally stable &amp; making good art. this album &amp; the drama surrounding it are horrible. fuck kanye
this shits cringe af just be an adult and review you are no hero not reviewing this
YE LIVES IN UR HEAD
Based, its mid at best. Lyrics is garbage and beats carried even tho they aren&#39;t that good either.
I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm witnessing Fantano history by seeing the first ever ‚Äúunreviewable‚Äù score given.
rent due
6/10 bad bars great production and some really bad bars
Fantano really thought he did something huh
imagine being this bad of a &quot;music reviewer&quot; that you have to start your &quot;review&quot;  by listing what the person you are reviewing has done &quot;bad&quot; (according to your degenrative values) in his career<br>you are such a joke lmfao<br>edit: anthony fantano also supports the monkeys in gta 5 rp who killed 1500 innocent civilians in Israel on oct. 7.<br>Just let that sink in
Notice he aint mentioned Carnival cuz even he know its a banger‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è
Drizzy gets numbers and kanye gets unreviewable scores due to his artistic excellence. The real king!
Ain&#39;t no tellin, Melon!
Waited 3 days just for bro to give a speech and not review the music??
Lmao what about type number 4? I don‚Äôt follow Kanye for social opinions. Just good music. You still listen to R Kelly if he comes on ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
You‚Äôre so cool and different
It‚Äôs okay melon, we all know you‚Äôre waiting for Kanye to dm you so you can leave the two biggest hiphop artists on read
Big L for Fantao
Um idk man i kinda just like the guys music, oh thats not an option? Oh okay
fantano tries too much to be &quot;the good guy&quot; to hating on kanye&#39;s person, while he doesn&#39;t even listen to the music itself. <br>How can you dislike an artist for some words he said while other artists have commited crimes &amp; beated their girlfriends<br>really interesting
no review, we won
7 minutes of Anthony trashing an absolute clown and I am here for it.
but he reviewed it
So many 13-21 years old in the comments saying this album is fire. The sad part is most of yall never listened to his classic albums more than once. 2004-2010 Kanye was the best
if it was called &quot;The Vultures 1 Store&quot; you would give it a 10
Kanye really got the default rating of -1/10 here
Man shut yo hating ass up dawg üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠  and just enjoy the album
ü§° ü§° ü§° clown
Its not that deep
Why did he review hood princess then????
Imagine if the new JPEGMAFIA album is &quot;unreviewable 2&quot;
I like paid
he doesnt want to review it because he knows its amazing
i‚Äôm confused, is this a good thing or bad thing
Rattled
Great review of Kanye, Anthony. I can&#39;t wait for the sequel video: unreviewable 2
STILL. THE KING.
So many triggered ye stans in the comments. Cope and seethe
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=128">2:08</a> are u a jew tho ur acting like a jew
Then just don&#39;t review it? Why make video about it?  Feels like you are just steaming off whatever personal issues you have. Generalizing and calling people who like the new music derogatory terms is just so childish and I wouldn&#39;t imagine professional like you would do so.
Kanye broke the melon and made melonade, a true innovator.
Goat album
its really sad to see a HUGE artist i love so much to throw away his career so hard, although i do enjoy some tracks on the album but the things he says about his wife is absurd. being an anti semite is one thing, but adding on to that by objectifying his wife SO MUCH. its really sad
I don‚Äôt like how he is straying from his faith but I believe he will be back
ive generally been a fan of fantano historically but this shit is so biased and whiny it‚Äôs not even funny, it‚Äôs just sad. I am no delusional Kanye fan. Antisemitism should be condemned. Kanye has problems and needs to get help. We get that. He is far from a saint and he fucked up super super bad. but fantano clearly didn‚Äôt even attempt to go into this with an open mind at all, and comes off as self-righteous and condescending any time he delves into anything remotely political. I still mostly respect him as a critic, but this is disappointing
how are this many people commenting points he directly addressed in the video lmfaoo üò≠üò≠
i largely agree with you, definitely not his best album not even close. However, i think he is too big to fail, and has too many loyal fans that will stand by him no matter what he does. No matter how bad the music gets, no matter how bad his public image gets, people will stand by him. Hes still going to have a platform on some level, even if it is smaller than it used to be.
yeah but &#39;&#39;burn&#39;&#39; is so cool...
Does anyone take this clown seriously? üòÇüòÇü§°
Not kanye making Chris Brown the victim for the backlash of beating up Rihanna &quot;‚ÄúThis is for what they did to Chris‚Äù wow
this is the greatest video you&#39;ve ever done no joking
Basically, don‚Äôt trust anyone who never shuts up about what a genius they are.
So you‚Äôre saying you didn‚Äôt like it or..?
I think he likes it!!
Anthony reminded me of Dr Cox from SCRUBS in this video
nobody cares about the virtue signal. if kanye fans are so deep into the kanye black hole to be rehabilitated by citicism of his actions then why did you make this video and not ignore the release? you sound like you&#39;re about to to start crying lmfao
LMAO melon what is this?
Wow Anthony somehow takes himself even more seriously these days
Class warfare is nazi adjacent
I am all 3 Kanye fans proudly
Womp womp, now play off the grid
even if kanye did have it together artistically enough for the concept to be fleshed out, the concept is still stupid. it&#39;s like Dave Chapelle whining about his actions having consequences on Parasail but for an entire album
People who are saying that‚Äôs he being hypocritical because he‚Äôs refusing to review someone despiste reviewing others who have done much worse haven‚Äôt taken in what he said.He‚Äôs not reviewing it because the art cannot be separated from the artist in many cases, as he is quite obviously adding on to the whole drama.
he clearly likes it!
Bro this whole situation genuinely hasn‚Äôt been good for you. Take a few days off twitter and stuff and separate yourself from this. I know you prolly won‚Äôt see this but debating Kanye stans on twitter who are too far gone at this point is not gonna help you or them.
oh brotherr
Yo didn&#39;t your wife leave you???
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=305">5:05</a> I genuinely enjoyed listening to Paidüò¢üò¢üò¢
You are literally a grandma
He wants to be Breadtube so bad
If this album was called &quot; To pimp a vulture&quot; you would give it a 10
would love to see melon interview kanye one day
FUCK FANTANO ! IM HARRY POTTA
If it was called To Pimp A Vulture, he would‚Äôve gave it a 10
STILL THE KING!
Controversy aside I am proud of Peggy
Fantano is so lame for this.  It was obvious he wasn‚Äôt going to be able to put his bias aside in the lead up to the release
People be running to a 47 year old divorced balding white man who wears Harry Potter glasses and calls himself a Melon for a hiphop album review???
Huge Kanye fan but this album wasn‚Äôt it, and the die hard fans are acting absolutely terrible man, need to grow up
Ending with &quot; Thank you, bye &quot; is brutal üòÜ
Kanye is the Goat. Melon is just a scared left wing 1 Iq
you lazy
This is so funny
idrc that you don‚Äôt like it, no one should, but i don‚Äôt know why people just assume that Bianca is like an object to Kanye. It‚Äôs not like Kanye is her mother picking out all her outfits. Bianca can wear whatever she wants to wear as long as it‚Äôs not like breaking laws and shit.
are you a jew or something why u crying so much
Oh boy. The Ye stans are coming
But what if‚Ä¶ I just like the math.
anthony only has opinions that a liberal white man is allowed to have in 2024. he wasn‚Äôt allowed to like this album. which sucks because it‚Äôs actually quite good.
you‚Äôre actually forcing it at this point lmfao
the second anti-review he made of Kanye, after Donda 2 v22.2.22 Miami
Yedolph makes this, Beyonce is going country <br>Jesus christ, please can Bruno Mars just get in here and save music in 2024?
What does any of this has to do with the album. Talk about the album or be quiet
based
You review ozzie osbourne even tho he said he admires hitler tho ü§îü§î
Kendric can call wyite people&#39;s DNA an &#39;abomination&#39; and openly be a blaac Israelite and get zero criticism but even though Kanye apologized, he&#39;s still &#39;unreviewable&#39;
Bro actually is losing it. I&#39;ll save a rant and just say bro isn&#39;t a social speaker your a music reviewer.... Review the damn music
I‚Äôd imagine it‚Äôd be extremely tiring getting this angered by other people lol
finally Anthony likes a kanye album, there is a first time for everything
this guy created cal chuchesta and calls other music unreviewable
I hate that whenever you talk about kanye being a nazi his fans treat it like you&#39;re trying to cancel him for an edgy joke he made in 2012
Melons political views are seeping through hard
he only hated three songs, thats a dub in my book!
you forgot 4) people who just appreciate art
album was too good it passed the limits
0/10
give it a number melon
Kanye cooked to hard for the &quot;Music nerd&quot; to react to the album
You can‚Äôt milk us for money like this we want the review or nothing don‚Äôt be a Jew
fartano going off at teenagers who like kanye by calling them lonely is crazy üò≠üò≠ you and yo flannel wearing ass can cry abt it ong üò≠ goofy ass
The downfall of Kanye West is just pitiful.
Kanye the goat
then why&#39;d u review it
I respect your opinions Mr.Melon. Even if we disagree on how much we enjoy Kanye‚Äôs work
Cringe
‚ÄúSeparate my brain from my skull‚Äù PLEASE ü§ûü§ûü§ûü§ûüôèüôèüôèüôè
This might actually be my favorite Fantano review; barely any jokes, just the brutal, honest truth
To pimp a vulture would be a ten
Lol who is this bald divorced middle aged man to call anyone racist, worthless or stupid?
I don&#39;t belong to any of the three categories of Kanye fan that you described, and I liked the album
video title: unreviewable <br><br>Fantano: reviews the unreviewable<br><br>Edit: after further inspection, he did not review it
Melon‚Äôs conflicted cuz he wears Yeezys during his reviews. Can‚Äôt be convinced otherwise til we see a full body shot ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
It‚Äôs a 6/10 be honest this reviews too woke
Anthony liked it so much even a 10 wouldn‚Äôt do it justice‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs so indescribably great he had to deem it unreviewable üôèüèøüôèüèøüôèüèøüî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
But he made graduation
He didn&#39;t even do a transition üíÄ
Pizza hut mustache
Sounds like he wants to get to Kanye canceled. Your job is to review albums objectively, so review the album. Put away your feelings
This album fucking sucked.<br>90% of the lyrics is just &quot;I have sex&quot;
Never thought you&#39;d get political. Kanye loves his wife, and I think his new album is quite good. Unsubscribed. And no, I&#39;m not a brainwashed anti-semetic fan
Nice video dissecting Kanye&#39;s personality, hopefully Anthony posts the album review soon ! üòÄ
Was this an kanye review or an  album review lol...
I liked the part where you reviewed the album
if it was called ‚Äúvultures 1‚Äù you wouldve given it an unreviewable
bro wishes it was To Pimp A Vulture
Real talk for a second, what couldve possibly got him THIS tilted?
so silly. just don‚Äôt even mention the album at all if you really think kanye doesnt deserve a spotlight.
I&#39;m just here to get paid
notice how he didnt mention any of the best songs on the album. if your not going t review it on a music level and just blabber about &quot;hes a bad person i dont like him&quot; then dont call yourself a rebiewer
&quot;This is unreviewable!&quot; <br>4th quarter of the video: reviews it.
Stop crying baldy
cry about it
oh. i was thinking maybe strong 6 to a light 7. instead of‚Ä¶.. this.
You reviewed it while saying it&#39;s &quot;unreviewable&quot;. You lost
So unreviewable that the green screen for the album cover is glitching out
You nailed it Fantano. I couldn&#39;t agree with you more. Vultures is absolute trash. But then, how does the saying go?.... If you fill yourself with trash, only trash will eventually come out.
Hiphop has always been ‚Äúfemale degrading‚Äù ‚Äúviolent‚Äù ‚Äúflex-bling‚Äù kind of genre. Take any well known hiphop artist and look up their lyrics‚Ä¶ bro is literally milking viewers out of ‚Äúunreviewable‚Äù album of anti-semite artist, bro ho review a indie rock tf
As soon as peggy said that he was a ye d rider he lost it
Can the review be about the music at least lmao üòÇ
I thought he was only doing gospel music now.<br><br>That was shortlived, huh?
I feel like you keep misinterpreting the whole infowars thing. Kanye NEVER actually sayid &quot;i love hitler&quot;, he says he sees GOOD IN hitler, hes basically trying to say every human being has potential to be good and has innate value to the world, even people who are as seemingly irredeemable as hitler. He also NEVER actually said he hated jewish people, just zionists who hes outed and talked bad abt multiple times. hes said hes actually jealous of jewish people and their culture multiple times and loves them.<br><br> the only reason hes called antisemetic is because hes branded himself an enemy of zionists. ghandi actually denounced zionism too and he was called antisemetic and cancelled for it in the 1930s(that sounds like a joke but its true multiple civil rights activists have denounced zionism and all have been called antisimetic by western media)  and was called a &quot;hitler sympathizer&quot;.same with malcom x and multiple other historical figures. but most people who will read this will either make an unfunny joke like &quot;blud is yapping&quot; or just say im wrong out of emotion instead of ACTUALLY watching the full infowars clip. plus the album was mid like 5-6/10. <br><br>im not a kanye superfan or anything just wanted to add context because this review seems so biased and people throw around the word antisemetic so much it has no meaning anymore
Carnival was heat
He&#39;s so mad ü§£ü§£ü§£
if this was called &quot;to pimp a vulture&quot; he would&#39;ve given it a 11
Weird phrasing for &quot;10/10 best album of all time&quot; but ok
hablou
You know it‚Äôs bad when Anthony doesn‚Äôt even give it a score
fair review but the 14 year olds who dickride kanye as if everything he has dropped since jik hasnt been mid hate nuance and introspection and just want a number to get angry at
First 4 tracks and problematic are pretty good tbf. Albums got a lot of really nice instrumentals, just substanceless wafflin lyrics
Kanye lives rent free in this bums head üòÇ
Where ur wife lil bro
This review dropped on 2/12. If you subtract 2 from 12, you get 10. Conclusion: Vultures is a 10. Kanye does it again!
Lol, for a music critic, you for sure review the person behind the art a lot more than the music itself. Useless video.
If I‚Äôm being honest it‚Äôs definitely his worst but I still like it wish Kanye didn‚Äôt say all that shit makes me feel guilty for liking it
Your video made me think thanks Fantano
Fantano trying so hard to hate lol
Anthony is losing it
People are funny, they know Kanye&#39;s great too<br>But the way he conducts himself, they hate to believe it<br>But they can&#39;t help it, they know he&#39;s great (Right)<br>Why would‚Äî Listen<br>Shit Kanye say is basically affirmations what people say for success<br>And it sounds insane because that&#39;s what motherfuckers do<br>But he sounds insane and that&#39;s signs‚Äî sounds of a leader<br>No doubt he&#39;s got some mental fuckin&#39; issues, most leaders do<br>The delusional issue, &quot;I&#39;m a God&quot;
breaking: anthony fantano says that kanye‚Äôs wife is just a walking naked body with no opinions or voice, very sexist anthony!
Michael Jackson fucked kids you still would review his albums is he was still alive
Damn I can&#39;t enjoy SHIT thank tony
What did he say wrong on this album then?
I think melon might be a little biased against this album
This was probably the right move. Just want to say there is a 4th type of Kanye fan. I myself like to call us Distressed sideliners.
Lacrou mana
Same guy who gave Sexxy Redd a 8 btw
5 min in, what does any of this have to do with the actual music? you&#39;re just spouting off nonsense about how bad of a person he is ü§£ like yeah we know by now Kanye does not care ü§£ <br><br>separating the music from the artist means exactly that friend! what matters is how it SOUNDS, not his stupid lyrics ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è kanye rapped about bleached bootyholes what do you expect lyrically? <br><br>the fact is he makes it sound good to my ears. simple ü§£
fantano when reviewing actual murderers criminals and abusers rapping about actually hurting people and actually doing unethical evil things: üòÑ<br>fantano when reviewing someone who said mean things and then apologized: ü§¨
I mean he has a point tho‚Ä¶ the music is about that. I still enjoy the album but he‚Äôs still saying all this stuff‚Ä¶
I swear this guy said he won&#39;t make any content on kanye anymore all he&#39;s done recently is that
If it was named Butterflys 1 you would&#39;ve given it a 10
I thought it was alright
It&#39;s not Kanye&#39;s best but definitely not his worst
Imagine pissing off a fan base because you dislike someone, sounds like a particular someone who doesn‚Äôt like Jews?üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
i rate your divorce a 9/10. great tracks
It was t that bad. Sure Kanye is off the rails now, but musically it‚Äôs good and you know it Melon
Guys I think he gave it a decent 7 to light 8
clown
* Unreviewable *<br>Proceeds to review
Still the king...
Its not called antisemite, its called ‚Äúopinion‚Äù thank you
&gt;music review<br>&gt;spends 3/4 of the review not talking about the music<br><br>This is like if reviewbrah spent most of his mcrib review criticizing McDonalds for its impact on the climate
He loved the album so much no score was good enough for it
I did like this album, but its nowhere near the quality of his other stuff. I do agree that Jesus Is King, on a lyrical front, is more cohesive. This album lacks any substance lyrically tbh. But, I still like the beats and overall sonic nature of it. But, regardless of my opinion, I don&#39;t want him to release music. I&#39;m not interesting in him being apart of the cultural zeitgiest. I understand why this video needed to be made, but at some point, it almost feels best to pretend he doesn&#39;t exist. At the end of the day, I feel Kanye want&#39;s videos like this to exist. I refused to make a reaction for a reason. I just don&#39;t feel like platforming will do anything except make him realize, good or bad attention, that he is important in some way....and that&#39;s where the problem begins.
Anthony come on you are being so petty. Just give a normal review.
Why am I even subscribed to this Channel
Nobody cares what you think üòÇüòÇ
I can‚Äôt listen to this
I remember like 13 or 14 years ago I decided to learn English just to understand what the Graduation lyrics were all about, and in the midst of the worst depressive episode of my life, KSG breathed life back into me with an optimistic outlook. But still, I&#39;ve never been a fan of YE himself, just his artistry, you know? Like, I&#39;ve been a fan of Woody Allen, Ferdinand C√©line, and others I wouldn&#39;t share a beer with in a million years. But Kanye&#39;s recent antics are just sad and pathetic. I mean, people can have far-right political views, and that&#39;s whatever, but embracing the most miserable narrative humanity has ever produced just to get attention for mediocre, poorly produced music under the guise of being an &#39;artist&#39; is childish and embarrassing. And even if it were a masterpiece, which it definitely isn&#39;t, glorifying speeches that cost people their lives is unacceptable and totally boomer as hell.<br><br>Qu√© decepci√≥n ver a tanto idi0t* aplauidoendo la mediocridas de ese supuesto genio. La buena por ese comentario, mr Antonio.
This is the kanye‚Äôs community review, u forgot the album review silly
hatin fr 10/10 if it was called to pimp a vulture you woulda gave it a 10 if it was called kids see vultures you would have gave it a 10 he d goat stop hating fr
where‚Äôs your wife??
Why is bro hating so much? Just enjoy the album
baldie lost his shit. you love to see it.
Ok so can you review the album and not the person please ?
If it was called ‚ÄúTo Pimp A Vulture‚Äù you would‚Äôve given it a 10
he didnt even button up the flannel üò≠üò≠
Use me as a disappointed in no review button
Kanye now has put himself in the most unenviable position any artist, no matter what medium, can find themselves in and that is now being included in the unwinnable debate of Separating the Art from the Artist. I don&#39;t think any artist wants to have that cloud hanging over their head.
there&#39;s actually 4 types of kanye fans. the other one that you forgot are the ones who listens to the old kanye and misses the old kanye and chpping the soul kanye, and i&#39;m one of them.
Why u gotta go all lib on us
There‚Äôs also 4. People who just like good music. I thought this album was pretty good, better than Donda but not as good as Pablo
Its so good he can‚Äôt publicly give it a 10 without losing pc points
wait 2 years his going to say he was too harsh and give it an actual score
if its üî• its üî•
This guy definetly liked the album
We all know u were vibing to Burn
Didn‚Äôt u give the sexy red album a 8?üò≠
you‚Äôre really doubling down and losing all credibility dude
Dude you are so weirdüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
If you actually, genuinely review the album, gave it a shot, and posted a review saying not good and mentioning this, it would be fine. But this biased, petty video that isn&#39;t even talking about the album, just isn&#39;t it.
Nice virtue signaling bro. Classic leftyüòÇ
&quot;I could never review this record&quot;<br><br>Proceeds to review it
I enjoy kanye&#39;s music and I am aware of everything he has said and done for the past few years but I will make this clear a man is not his song. He makes great music and as a fan of the music I have the right to enjoy the music above everything. No one should look for political affirmation or guidance from an artist, an artist may have comments or opinions where you can agree or not but that&#39;s whitin the artists right to express themselves as people. So yeah is disappointing knowing that you are so caught up with your own ideology and disregard for your audience capacity to think for themselves that you prefer to not review this album but it is your channel dude. I don&#39;t come to your reviews to be educated I come here to listen your opinion on music. I&#39;m Christian and I haven&#39;t heard you say that you are not going to review a blasphemous album&#39;s talking about christianity bc you don&#39;t want to polarized your audience. Hypocritical from you, what happened to you? Btw I really like pure comedy.
what are you doing melon you are attacking the person and not the music, the most people you reviewed you know nothing about how they are as persons
When reviewing the single that came with this album, you were biased from the get go saying ‚Äúnothing fire is being made in that tent.‚Äù You‚Äôre just exhibiting narcissistic behavior. You are a music reviewer, not an activist
Dawg Anthony has lost respect because bro lets words bother himüò≠ if you let words bother you what‚Äôs the point of talking to you because if I say something ‚Äúwrong‚Äù you‚Äôll get mad, worst critic ever lol
you reviewed burzum btw
Unreviewable 2 is going to be crazy
if this was called &quot;to pimp a vulture&quot;, it wouldve gotten a 10
i get if you really hate the lyrics but you can‚Äôt deny that there were multiple bangers on this album just based on how they sound and i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs very fair to deem it unreviewable trash when it has amazing sounding songs like burn, carnival, fuk sumn, problematic, good don‚Äôt die, and do it
Kanye&#39;s become a cult like Trump became a cult
To each his own. I loved the album and glad Ye is back!
i think he loved it guys
this video will become a warzone in about 30 to 40 minutes
divorced melon
ü§£ü´µ
Mk.Gee‚Äôs album Two Star and the Dream Police is a beautiful album
stop talking nerd, go get some money
I can respect someone who is so sick of everyone‚Äôs shit that they just don‚Äôt care anymore and need to rant about it somewhere without giving a damn about what anyone thinks
i don&#39;t think this album warranted a recorded breakdown
Number 1 in over 100 countries. The haters really ended this man‚Äôs career üò©
This might be my favorite needle drop video
You&#39;re yappin like carnival isn&#39;t incredible
hater
Kanye is the only reason this guy is relevant
I think you just need a second opinion on the album, why don&#39;t you ask your wife?
Ye the goat üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ this album is unreviewableüòÇüòÇ
fantano try to separate politics from music challenge (impossible)
Jews do not watch your videos bro
So we&#39;re just passing up a song like burn from the album. If this album was called hoods hottest vultures it would have been a 10
Embarrassing. Everyone agrees this album is in the 5-8 range. Are you just not going to do actual reviews from one of the most popular musicians in the world anymore?
Bro is so madüòÇüòÇüòÇ
I was wondering how Melon was going to approach reviewing Kanye since he‚Äôs still too big to ignore, but I think this is the best way to do it.<br><br>I just don‚Äôt care for the idea that we should just pretend that he didn‚Äôt say the things he did just because we have a shiny new record to distract us with. <br><br>Fuck him.  We‚Äôll always have the college trilogy, but everything else I could do without.
Album is fire your just mad people ratiod you on twitter üòÇ
&quot;Kanye you probably shouldn&#39;t do that&quot;<br>&quot;I&#39;mma do it&quot;
He def likes it
Now I have to understand what is lower between vultures and speedin bullet 2 heaven
Its sad to see you getting so pissed off by kanye i hate his hate speeches and everything he preaches but with all that I have to say the album still brings a lot of quality
I have never agreed with Fantano more than in this review.
Won&#39;t review it but sure do talk about the tracks a lot. Only thing missing was a score. Weak.
But he made graduation
if ye wasnt antisemitic, you wouldver given it s 3/10
the king yapper
Oh boy Fantano is on his soap box creating a category for YE honestly instead of taking something personal that really has nothing to do with you  if you don&#39;t like what YE said what make you think someone wants to hear you talk about it get off your soap box and be the reviewer we respect you for iüòä
nerd
I&#39;m embarrassed to have previously (2014-ish) been a Kanye West fan.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=306">5:06</a> i find this point pretty dumb, like they&#39;re the same genre no shit they sound alike, this like saying &quot;oh why listen to butterfly effect when you could listen to astrothunder&quot;, or &quot;oh why listen to young thug when you could listen to future&quot;, its just another of the same type of song, thats how genres work?<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=327">5:27</a> also you hate fun
so its a seven?
same guy who gave lil pump a 7 btw. bro is a hypocrite and carries insane bias thru his reviews. no consistency at all with his opinions. his favorite artist could come out as anti semite and he would find a way to argue it being ‚Äúempowering‚Äù. fantano fell off after his wife left him
or maybe u jus a hater ü§î
‚ÄúAnthony you can‚Äôt just rant about Kanye for 7 minutes you have to actually review the music‚Äù <br><br>Sounds like a joke comment but it‚Äôs notüíÄ
I get it Anthony, you wished Bump J was on all of the songs. Me too man, me too
not a &quot;not good&quot;<br>not even a 0<br>unreviewable.<br>damn.
spit yo shit anthony
Ur nose looks a little big‚ú°Ô∏è
Bro didn‚Äôt Even Review the album he was just Sucking up to the Jews
DONT CARE DIDNT ASK UR WIFE LEFT U VULTURES #1
Fantano is hating hard. How&#39;s the divorce going? Gonna be lonely now too. Also this album is great and has no skips.
Man rushed this review out so fast, didn‚Äôt have enough time to fix his green screen
Other rappers talking about killing and degrading women: Wow this album is the GOAT, great beat selection and great bars<br>Metal artists praising satan: It&#39;s all just art the gutairs were crazy<br>...<br>Kayne says something: OMG WE MUST CANCEL HIM DONT GIVE HIM A PLATFORM
He wants to be embraced by a certain community so badly, reminds me of Max Kellerman a couple years back
Anthony liked it. Can&#39;t admit it.
radio head
bros hating on Ye&#39;s wife bro get a wife of your own you divorced balding melon
bro talked about three songs üíÄ
Called that you would do some bullshit like this unsubbed lil bro
Kanye broke Fantano, 10/10
unwatchable 1
the tiktok yetards aint gonna like this
NFR podcast has a balanced take on the album, idk why you‚Äôre being  so dramatic
I think not giving it a note is a fair way of acknowledging yet condemning the artist, but i wish he continued giving critiques about the music because ngl apart from hoodrat and a few bars i genuinely don&#39;t know how it&#39;s not at least a 6 or 7 from him
when you can‚Äôt leave politics out of music. <br>paid is a banger. <br>incorrect review, shame.
6/10
you cry too much when comes to kanye, never seen nobody like this lol
Can&#39;t wait for the unreviewable trilogy
Israel isn‚Äôt a legitimate state
You really can‚Äôt separate the politics from the music you‚Äôre really that pressed <br>Bro talk music no one ask for your political opinions
üòÇüòÇüòÇalbum was fire
I liked the part where he repeated &quot;fuck this guy&quot; for 6 minutes in a row and gave it a zero
this album is good. ur hatin bc u think it&#39;ll get u views lol
If things keep going like this, Kanye could be the first artist to have multiple albums in fantanos worst albums of the year list
So what I‚Äôm hearing is it‚Äôs a 10 :)
The Kanye dislikes are rollin in jeeze
When you can‚Äôt even understand the very obvious meaning of ‚Äúreference‚Äù in that bar there‚Äôs just no hope for any intelligent thought on this album whatsoever
cant wait to go into the comments and see everyone making original jokes
So it&#39;s just a 6?
If it was called to pimp a vulture you probably still wouldn‚Äôt have reviewed it
‚ÄúUnreviewable‚Äù <b>briefly reviews the album</b>
Wow I‚Äôm surprised you still gave it a 10 after criticizing Kanye so much
album is fire
Excellent video
Melon mad and jooish lmao
Okay forsure, so it&#39;s not just me. This record was weird af. It&#39;s not like... awful. It&#39;s just like... nothing?
Most kanye fans are americans anyways and that should tell you everything you need to know about ignorance and idiocy
i‚Äôm glad you loved it xx ‚ù§
oh wow
It aint THAT shit
anthony fantano, kanye west, NEVER
Review the album man wtf
it&#39;s not a good album but man you&#39;ve been acting like it murdered your entire family dude
Love using Kanye reviews for clout lmfao get your money bro and handle business
Say what you want about it but he went number 1 in 71 countries in the first 24 hours and yet u call it trash üòÇ
You lost, Melon.
You‚Äôre pathetic sometimes Anthony üòÇüòÇ
Fantano has made the full transition from music nerd to seething lefty culture warrior...oh well
Fantano sounding like the typical liberal he is
Speculating that melon is a jew is somehow the least surprising thing in 2024 so far
Donda and back are all you need to listen to.
This needed a brown flannel
Your mustaches looks like a vacuum
Are you gonna unrelease this video like Kanye did his album on Apple Music?
This guy gave the daughter‚Äôs album a 10/10‚Ä¶ <br><br>but is apparently unable to separate the art from the artist
opinion invalid baldy kanye on top
Shut up circular thing
You‚Äôve given worse people reviews lol
This is embarrassing melon‚Ä¶
This review is rubbish ... jews r no fuckin saints at all... they have to owe it like everybody else does.. wtf why even review it in the first place if u cant handle ur dislike towards  Kanye... nahh I think ur full of shit bro .. and everybody should given a try to this album  is not bad...
I jus like the music bruhüòê
What abt the type of ye fan that has no idea what to do with their appreciation of his impact on the culture after this downward trajectory and try as much as they can to listen to any of his new music going forward objectively , much like Mj fans <br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=124">2:04</a>
Yapyapyapyapyap
Kanye Stans really broke this man
bruh shut up nobody care
If this album was called to pimp a vulture you would have given it a 10 and forgiven Kanye
I fuck with the sentiment in regards of &quot;seperating art from artist&quot; here. I do that to the best of my ability whenever I listen to something, and have done that with Kanye&#39;s music before, but this? Inexcusable. I saw lyrics, I heard lyrics, I don&#39;t want to see any more of them. The blame lies at his own door, but I think we should also consider the people who were in with Kanye on this album, too. Making a quick buck or trying to make something of this project, whatever the reason, its lowered my opinion on all of them to associate themselves with this goofy fucking antisemite. Making good music in the past doesn&#39;t solve this either, so many Kanye stans need to stop dickriding and take a fucking look at who they&#39;re supporting. I love a lot of his older output, but that&#39;s not an excuse for his recent output, nor his behaviour. You can seperate art from artist sometimes, but when Kanye is the artist, the art is a self-portrait. I don&#39;t want to look at it.
Fantano thinks he‚Äôs the hero of the people and thinks he‚Äôs the smartest in the room when he‚Äôs really not. like bro you review music stop acting like you have some voice that are gonna have people stand up with you bald ass
This is a W for Kanye
damn melon if you continue this path we soon will see you on patrick cc channel. take some time off
album so good fantano couldn&#39;t think of a number high enough to rate it ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è this is why Kanye is king üî•üî•üî•
I had no intentions of listening to this piece of dog shit but this review solidified that. Ye is an embarrassment
It&#39;s unreviewable, yet you spend the last few minutes of the video... reviewing it?
I wanted to like this :(
Can‚Äôt wait to see the unreviewed trilogy to unfold
Can someone explain why the &#39;reference&#39; line is so bad? Isn&#39;t he just saying that his wife is the perfect embodiment of his type? Whats wrong ab that?
People really don‚Äôt realize how nothing kanye said had any consequence on Jewish people. And people like fantano are scared of liking anything kanye is putting out because they don‚Äôt want to be called antisemitic or a nazi sympathizer. Just listen to the music and if you like it you like it I‚Äôm not saying you have to praise kanye just have a brain for yourself
this is without a doubt one of his most potent and important videos ever. some things are just more important than music. why should kanyes music matter when his rhetoric helps to exacerbate antisemitic sentiment?
MELON VULTURES IS A 10/10 THEY THOUGHT THEY COULD CANCEL HIM
Everyone taking the piss in the comments, but he&#39;s right about the album being trash. Boring and shallow.
Wait til Vultures see Ghosts drops trust
Seriously though, as a Hip Hop head I would love for the culture of Hip Hop as a whole to callout Ye on his crazy hateful  b.s.  Spreading hate of any kind isn&#39;t good, isn&#39;t smart and given Kanye&#39;s platform is dangerous.
ur just not a serious critic anymore and thats ok
Se ardieron los kanyetards
There&#39;s something so funny about seeing teenage/young adult white men acting like swifties over post 2018 Kanye of all fucking artists, y&#39;all can&#39;t make fun of Taylor ever again lmaoooo
he is so obviously biased and is clearly shitting on the album purely out of spite.. amazing
What does the Jewish community say about black people?
Saying that this album is worse than JIK is absolutely wild.
So is this a 0? Sorry my autism doesn‚Äôt make sense of this
KANYE BROKE ANTHONY
I don&#39;t usually agree with Fantano, but for this case I do
If kanye made the album cover a black and white photo of him and his wife outside of the white house you would of gave it a 10
Liberal
my baby, is hour to sleep. Come on!!
Anthony is so done with Kanye and I‚Äôm here for it
Just say you don&#39;t like the album. Stop crying.
FAFO, Ye
Vultures 2 and 3 are getting 10s
Another L to add to the melons pile
Sexy Redd talks about her booty hole color and this clown gives it an 8 but Ye actually puts out good music and it‚Äôs unreviewableüò≠üò≠
Pretty cool how you cuck out and can&#39;t separate an artist from their art to rate music and let your political agenda overshadow any evaluation you could have on a piece of art! üëç
You are so soft like charmin
Can&#39;t say I disagree with anything he said, props to fantano.
In other words, this is Kanye&#39;s &quot;If I Did It&quot;
as a fan of kanyes <b>music</b>  i agree with everything Fantano said in this review, Kanye is most likely one if not is the most controversial and most delusional people ive seen, it honestly makes me upset to see such a great music carrer go to shit because of the people around ye influencing him for the worst.
What makes 0 sense to me is how you can constantly bring up the whole &quot;Antisemetic&quot; thing and then turn around and support Lil Nas X disrespecting Christianity and say the people who are getting mad just choose &quot;a bad religion&quot;. You pick and choose what you want to support and what you don&#39;t with the incapability to actually remove or even admit to the biases you have. You review music. so review the music. we watch to see your reviews on music. not to constantly talk crap on twitter to a fan base you know damn well won&#39;t listen to you
Oh my goodness gracious ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Yeah but he stills going number one so nobody cares about your opinion Anthony
A 10?!
tran
I have never seen a grown man get so mad at another grown man. Congrats Kanye on breaking fantano
Your inability to separate your bias from your reviews has lost you all credibility as a reviewer
Lets see your wife ü§£
what about the category where people just like the music
But Anthony, only americans (from USA) are dumb enough to listen what Kanye says or do and take it like from someone entitled to give directions on how to live. The wife stuff idk if it is worth mentioning because is not like there are no people who likes to use their looks only to do things, maybe you know more about their relationship and what does the wife think. Everybody got their think, I&#39;m not defending nothing it&#39;s only that sometimes I see that in some things you like to just jump inmediatly in conclusions. I&#39;m very sorry for my english, I&#39;m just a simple man from Chile. Kanye is way distant from what we all liked about him, I only see a broken man that is trying being happy with what is left of his life and now and then doing some dumb shit for shock value. He is a grown man but at the same time if not for the religion idk where he could be. PS: Jesus is king is overhated, I&#39;m not a religious person but the one critic that is true is that the mixing is bad, if not for that it could be a 7/10 album maybe 6.5.
If it was called good kid mad vultures you would&#39;ve given it an 8
‚ÄúY‚Äôall know this is just my opinion right‚Äù, spends entire review saying people who disagree with him are nihilistic teenagers and stupid
This is the most childish comment section on YouTube right now.
Proof that needledrop is biased and is NOT a legitimate reviewer
didnt this guy have a second racist channel im confused
You know the album is legendary when you have a grown man crying over the internet over it
Shoutout to ye always breaking records and unlocking new categories from reviewersüôèüèæüî•üî•
Damn bro you one of them weirdos now
I enjoyed this album alot lmao
REVIEW THE MUSIC YOU JEW!!!!!! I DONT GIVE A FUCK BOUT WAHT KANYE DID!!!!
So still better than angelic to the core?
L Fantno
delete video
Insane bias and virtue signalling. Your downfall is crazy Fantano.
Long story short, it‚Äôs a 10
ngl album is mid to many randome beatswitches etc. kinda disappointed.
I know this a serious video and all but the hairline is killing me LMAO
I&#39;m actually glad I never cared for Kanye, even back on his early albums, because I don&#39;t have to feel conflicted or betrayed.
hi Anthony Fantano famed music reviewer of theneedledrop of YouTube I wrote and recorded an album of 10 mini songs all in one day (February 8th aka the other day). it&#39;s called MANIC here on my youtube and bandcamp and u should listen :] the sound is v raw and unmastered
Kayne &gt; Fanta o
Corniest ‚Äúermmm actually‚Äù of all time.
reference meaning source material‚Ä¶ you misinterpreted the line
never seen someone mald this much because of an album, I applaud you Anthony &quot;Sexyy Redd 8/10&quot; Fantano.
does this mean speeding bullet to heaven is no longer the worst rated in fantano lore  !?!?!?!??!?!
Why are you even reviewing the album when you won‚Äôt even give it a chance. Are Good, Talking, Burn, and Beg Forgiveness that bad of songs? None of them have Kanye slandering people and are all good songs.
What are you talking about? What is even the point of this video? Like boycotting Kanye?<br>We are not beating the obsessed with Kanye allegations...
Kanye doesn‚Äôt parade bianca around lmao, she has always dressed like that, and the reference line isn‚Äôt an insult to her, he‚Äôs saying she‚Äôs the blueprint.
Honestly the album is kind of mid, like 5/10
If kanye named this album &quot;to pimp a vulture&quot; you would of gave it a 10
The album is so trash it doesn&#39;t even get a 1080p upload... it gets a 720p panning.
Look at this man he&#39;s so mad üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£üòÇüòÇüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
bro is just salty
Why does bro hate Kanye West so much üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
Shave
Cringe
I.  Agree!
I bet if it was called To Pimp A Vulture you would‚Äôve given it a 10
Where is ur wife?
FREE PALESTINE
Boycott fantano
in the best way this felt like a hbomberguy video
ALL THIS MONEY ON THE FLOOR

least biased anthony melonhead review
Lmao Kanye actually broke Fantano
we done made a mess they gon have to clean for weeeeeksüòä
There is no dabate. This video sums up everything there is to say about ye right now.
Fantano, thank you so much for making this review. You‚Äôre one of the only people in this god forsaken community that used any ounce of critical thinking to sum this record up. <br>How people actually like this garbage is beyond me, especially when it‚Äôs being described as ‚ÄúAll of Kanye‚Äôs past records put into one‚Äù. Like bitch, if you actually compared this record to any of his past records, you would see how awful it is. Give it three months, it‚Äôll grow off you üòÇ
Also, so Kanye calling his wife beautiful is bad, but you calling his wife a dollar store version of Kim isn‚Äôt INSANELY misogynistic? Been such a big fan for a while but this bias is just sad to see.
just a salty old man
They&#39;re not going to like this one, but i thinks it&#39;s fine to stand on business especially on your own channel.
Unreviewable is better than a 10
This album is comically bad
i hope somebody like kid cudi will tell kanye to realize what he&#39;s talking about and tell kanye to get help.
So... If i like Carnival, F summ, Back to Me and Talking I am either a sociopath or a edgy teen or a cult member?<br>Thats generalize and thats something a german guy in the 1930s with a funny mustache would do to a certain group.
Well this was stupid üòÇ I thought this shit was a light 5, but this right here, this non review, is dumb as fuck
we ain‚Äôt even stress we the new kings and sheiks
so good its unreviewable, kanye the goat for real daaamn
There&#39;s a fourth category: People who just want good music.
Im just gone drop a free Palestine here, Im not really on any side but it feels interesting
Man I just wanted an honest review about an album bro stop yapping, literally everything you said entered my brain fast and left faster.
nice &quot;music&quot; review
This album is mid AF, straight up. But this video screams clout to me. Could&#39;ve just as easily been quiet about it
You‚Äôre getting a lot of hate in the comments but I appreciate your honesty and transparency about your feelings with the record as well as with Kanye as both an artist and person. Keep it up man!
that shi fall of trees to me
Bro just mad this is some of the best producing ever and it comes from a antisemite
Melon Ye
this is the most fantano thing he coulda doneüò≠üò≠
It&#39;s a shitshow
spending all the money like it‚Äôs free to me
10/10 tbh
Melon hates the album so much that he didn&#39;t even care to get the art to not glitch out.
grown man got triggered because of a few kanye fans on twitter and now he‚Äôs having a mental breakdown, this is sad
quit whining lil broüò≠üôè
If the album was called &quot;To Pimp A Vulture&quot; you would&#39;ve given it a 10/10
hahahah good one bro, got the whole squad laughing
hmmm still upset your wife divorced you i see
Yikes
unrelated but why is the album art &quot;glitching(?)&quot; like that. little bit unsettling lol
Bro i made a bet with my brother that fantano was gonna pull a moral high ground type shit and make a video about why hes not gonna review the album, instead of reviewing the album üòÇ<br><br>Im not hating, its just that this is the most fantano thing he coulda doneüò≠üò≠üò≠
he‚Äôs mad cus kanye is married currently lmao
his idol peggy went to help on the album and he genuinely lost it üíÄ
can&#39;t wait for the unreviewable 1 REDUX in ten years where he will not review it again
wtf is this just review the music
fantano u gotta do an interview with sean strickland i think itd be good for the channel
IF I SHOW UP WHERE SHE WORK I THINK SHE JUST MIGHT QUIT
Embarrassing for you ngl
Thanks Ye. You somehow robbed Penith of Worst Album of the Year.
You&#39;re a good person Anthony, you nearly look as stressed here as the Corey Feldman review. I just love Kanye&#39;s old music and was against your judgement towards jpeg because it&#39;s his business. I thought the album still had some interesting samples but I agree it has a lot of shit bars. Yes the antisemitism is a disgrace and Kanye is paying for it. Yeah he has this die hard fan base but that is bc of the value his earlier albums gave
so you liked it?
Album is a 10/10 every song is perfect
The idea that Jesus Is King has better put together songs is just outright untrue. If it‚Äôs unreviewable, why did you still give critiques? Clearly you admit that you can‚Äôt separate the art from the person and headlines sufficiently to make that call. The engineering and performances here are simply better than JIK
hey it‚Äôs me a guy who is NOT an antisemite and does NOT love Hitler here to tell you that i‚Äôm very angry you won‚Äôt review a music album from an antisemite who loves Hitler in which he brings up the fact that he‚Äôs an antisemite multiple times, i am very upset and also crying!
Talking about a minority of people on twitter for 5 minutes straight while not acknowledging that it has been streamed or 100 million times by millions of people who are not X ratkids really undermines  your reviews at this point. Stop talking about delusional fans and get out of home, talk to people, maybe interview them on the streets, and get a real feel for the public‚Äôs opinion
Thank you for this. You&#39;re gonna get so much hate but I&#39;m glad there&#39;s SOMEONE out there who has fucking standards and knows that just because this wasn&#39;t as bad as Donda 2 doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s good, and also someone who actually has morals. Thank you
If you‚Äôre blatantly antisemitic and you write lyrics confirming that it‚Äôs no longer art or music it‚Äôs just hatred. Don‚Äôt listen to this. I give props to Anthony for not reviewing it.
Well said Fantano!
yo yo yo anothy d o double g you lowkey kinda changed my mind, also congrats your bout to get 1 billion views so horray. Thank you for spitting facts bro i fw with that
Pussies still worship this guy even after this mid ass album lol
Bro rly js dissed teens for listening to kanye
This is like a disappointed dad talking to his son
hate from massachusetts‚ù§Ô∏è
Its a great album and nothing he said on the album is actually saying anything negative about jews he&#39;s joking about all the narratives (not saying he hasnt said anything wrong in the past) I hate the fans that made this guy famous, he now feels he can call a whole fan base delusional because we do not all thing the same what an idiot
If Hoodrat was made by Jpegmafia or Death Grips he would have loved it lol
I get the obvious problems with supporting Kanye, but his best quality is that he is incredibly genuine and doesn&#39;t really moderate himself, which definitely leads to problems but I think it&#39;s disappointing for people to write him off because he&#39;s not the made-up nonexistent perfect human that everybody wants their favorite artist to be
im not antisemite but with whats been happening in the world since october of last year im not sure how you dont see that kanye is NOT the problem and he is talking from experience, lets not forget that he has been in the industry for more than 20 years. the comments he made were initialy off putting to me but what happened these past few months has opened my eyes on geopolitics and what are the goals of countries involved, i will never trust a jew, they can exist, obviously but i will never put faith in what a jew say.
Better than sexyy red
‚ÄúBored and lonely‚Äù is a lot coming from a Twitter obsessed divorcee
great review actually ...
i‚Äôm a kanye fan and even i know this album is pure horseshit. y‚Äôall stans brainwash yourselves into thinking this is great music when it‚Äôs not. Kanye has given us MULTIPLE classics and this album AINT IT!!! need y‚Äôall to get real for once. VULTURES IS ASS!!! Fantano is DEAD RIGHT on this one
I knew we weren&#39;t getting a full review.. Vol 2 I could see a 5min video of you washing  your hands
you know it&#39;s bad when bro doesn&#39;t even give it a rating
a man that has apologized, has married a new woman (yet people don‚Äôt wanna see them happy so they say stuff like ‚Äúhe‚Äôs kidnapped her‚Äù or ‚Äúshe‚Äôs under his control‚Äù) has lowered all his merchandise and fashion pieces to $20 for EVERYONE to afford and has always been ahead of his time, people like this bald joke are just too blinded to see it. He‚Äôs the worst person on the face of this earth with no musical talent? Got It. That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs #1 in over a hundred countries right now.
It was so good he couldn‚Äôt even review it
then say you don‚Äôt like it. don‚Äôt AVOID reviewing it. I would rather you talk about how much you hate it
probably the best teview he could&#39;ve done for this. a 0 or 1 with just hating the record would just cause more stress and threats. good job melon
W Anthony
4. People who aren&#39;t partisan hacks that can separate the art from the artist and aren&#39;t drooling over following their favorite artists&#39; lives like a celebrity. Yes I can enjoy the music and the lyricism without agreeing with it??? Yes vultures is a flop but old kanye is still bussin
unreviewable yet #1, don‚Äôt pander to the small % of your audience-<br>you‚Äôll lose the larger numbers. the ones that matttttttter
clown
he uploaded this directly after his stream and you can literally tell lol. He was getting way to riled up by people in his chat dude was so mad he decided to do this.
why tf is this guy getting mad over his 2 years controversies, i get that we should not forget bt it until he takes accountability but bro why tf do u make a 7min video about u just being mad<br>edit: i had to watch 6 mins until he began talking about the music!!
so we praise songs like ‚Äúmask off‚Äù that glorify hard drugs, or misogynistic lyrics or gang banging lyrics‚Ä¶ but politics??? NOPE! NOT ALLOWED lol stop
Would watch a full rant on your second channel about your thoughts on Kanye. I‚Äôm not a Kanye fan personally but this is soft. Give your opinions on the album. Letting dorks on Twitter, both pro and anti Kanye, dictate your way isn‚Äôt a reputable decision. I feel your audience deserves and wants your review of this and the upcoming ‚Äúvultures‚Äù projects even if you can‚Äôt separate the art from the artist. Which I‚Äôm this case, I think is fair.
He&#39;s having his Kanye moment.<br><br>Kanye fans do be mad cringe though.
even your most diehard fans are calling this embarrassing mr fantano üò≠üò≠ you could not have handled this in a worse way
i just like the music man üò≠üò≠
I‚Äôve followed you since 2011 Anthony. I may not always agree with your reviews although I generally do because you take a pragmatic approach to your reviews which generally yields a correct assessment of the music.<br>But it seems that is no longer the case.<br>I do not care about your opinions of Kanye‚Äôs politics. I do not care what you think of his antics. You didn‚Äôt take umbrage with Burzum when your reviewed his album twelve years ago.<br>Would you refuse to review Brand Nubyian? Lord Jamar is a racist and hates white people but I suppose that sort of racism is okay.<br>Since you are no longer capable of delivering and unbiased review of the albums that come across your table, I am no longer capable of enjoying your content. <br>The virtue signaling will get you nowhere. I‚Äôve unsubscribed from your channels as of today and I hope that others do so as well. Good day to you sir
just review the music bro wtf is this cry baby video
He did say &quot;we&#39;re done defending kanye&quot;
this triple vaxxed biden voter doesn‚Äôt like anything that doesn‚Äôt go with the liberal agenda smh
Some good songs, but i feel kanye is still lost
Terrible review of a terrible album.
Pre death threats
Cry baby
I do like some of the songs on this album. Sadly my love for the guy is gone at this point
here we go again
Too bad Kanye hadn&#39;t named this album Unreviewable, cuz that would have checkmated Anthony.
You never have had a good music review LMAO delete your account. Embarassing
unreviewable yet #1, don‚Äôt pander to the small % of your audience-<br>you‚Äôll lose the larger numbers. the ones that matttttttter
Bro just review it
big ye fan here. Completely blown away by how half ass&#39;d this album is. kanyes music has drawn literal tears from my eyes. But this album, mixed with his recent behavior.. Fuck it, to me, he ain&#39;t even make graduation, mike dean did.
womp womp
unreviewable yet #1, don‚Äôt pander to the small % of your audience-<br>you‚Äôll lose the larger numbers. the ones that matttttttter
Aint no way man gave Kim Kardashian as a prime example of &quot;people that should tell Kanye no but can&#39;t&quot;
I don‚Äôt think you know what a reference is lmao, in art a reference is the OG that all other work is based off of. He‚Äôs saying she‚Äôs so beautiful others copy her. Also he doesn‚Äôt own being an antisemite, he says other people call him that. You didn‚Äôt think critically about the lyrics and that‚Äôs ok, but it‚Äôs a waste of your time to make videos like this.
for someone who doesn‚Äôt wanna talk about kanye, you sure love talking about kanyeüíÄ
Imagine if you had the mental capability to realize you could‚Äôve just not dropped a video at all
unreviewable yet #1, don‚Äôt pander to the small % of your audience-<br>you‚Äôll lose the larger numbers. the ones that matttttttter
You could give it a 0 or a Not Good and honestly I would respect it. This is just plain salty bitter hating. Also rage baiting for 12 year old Kanye fan reactions.
Freddie stole the album
this is so sad lmao
L
I‚Äôm over bruh.
But he made graduation
the thing is you were happy to give this man glowing reviews when he was endorsing a guy who says mexicans are rapists but when he says some edgelord shit about jewish people that‚Äôs when you throw this little hissy fit of a review and get all upset??? ü§® idk man
Deranged sexist tweets in the morning to the deranged fatphobic stream to this deranged review upload. Dude having the worst day of his life. Take a few deep breaths and drink a glass of water bro. People look up to you and see you as a legit critic. Youre crashing out rn its not worth it.
Bro I just like his music üò≠<br>I don‚Äôt agree with anything he says obviously but I just like his music
Find God immediately üò¨ üò¨ üò¨ üò¨
this is objectively one of the worst and saddest attempts at a review of all time
It&#39;s funny how an album that went #1 in 108 countries apparently is only liked by psychos, cultists and edgy teenagers according to melon
U can‚Äôt say problematic and burn weren‚Äôt bangers tho admit it
if you thought it was bad when opium fans leaked your divorce papers i can only imagine whats gonna happen now üò≠
This Album should be better than Dark Fantasy ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Stop giving him unique ratings
We wanna hear about the music not the man
Sending hate from Sweden<br><br>Sincerely, someone that usually likes your reviews
somebody tell this melonhead he washed üíÄ
Just tell us you liked it melon
I‚Äôll bet Anthony secretly loves it
Rare melon head L + deep inside he loved it
Do this with every artist then bum
Thank you for the completely unbiased review !
Omg. Here comes the whole US mess and try to defeat their shitty hero. Next thing will be to vote for the orange psycho this year. Clap hands
How is this guy 38 throwing a tantrum like a baby because Kanye believes things that you dont like üòÇüòÇüòÇ
The worst part about reviewing a rap album is how unfunny and uninspired all the top comments will be. Any time you review a mainstream rapper the comments no longer become a place of discussion for the music itself. You should really consider removing key words from the comments like ‚Äú10,‚Äù ‚Äúto pimp,‚Äù etc etc
Fantano has a really good point
Calling people delusional or ignorant children for enjoying some of the tracks off this album kind of kneecaps your arguments. Make your points without name-calling like the supposed fanatic Ye fans you‚Äôre sick of hearing from.
The melon strikes again
bro jus talk about the music
Very Intresting Fantano, but what happened to Noah Thompson on December 11, 1994?
That IG user is 1000% aplasticplant
never thought i would see fantano become more manic than kanye
I know you have been a huge fan of kanye&#39;s recent antisemitism , but don&#39;t you think saying &quot;beautiful big titty butt naked women just don&#39;t fall out the sky you know&quot; summarizes you as a person and is a perfect representation of a ideal economic and political state for the world is a bit much ?
Calling him misogynistic then talking down on his wife who‚Äôs achieved a lot as a creator and artist. That‚Äôs hilarious
Even the album art is undisplayable. DAMN.
Disheartening to watch how other artists couldn&#39;t give a shit. Elucid laughing at people who are mad at Kanye, Peggy fully embracing Kanye with Denzel cheering him on... everyone sucks.
Naah we need this type of scoring more‚ò†Ô∏è
this album sucked so much, itd be a 0 if he rated it
shit at least he has a wife üòÇ
Don‚Äôt you find it interesting that Kanye and his wife have a perfectly fine relationship and this guy is over here claiming she‚Äôs being harassed and dehumanized for no reason? Weird ass mf projecting his insecurities on Kanye because he can‚Äôt keep a marriage
I don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs unreviewable. Ridiculous claim, you‚Äôre just not capable of doing the job. Funny to see you admit it though.
Location: Fantano&#39;s head<br>Rent: $0
Rap Twitter convulsing right now
I don‚Äôt care about Kanye‚Äôs politics. If the music is good, I will shamelessly enjoy it. That being said, this album is a 0 for me. It‚Äôs by far the worst Kanye album. Every beat sounds like trash. Every lyric is awful. Every flow is sloppy. It sounds like Kanye has been rapping for 6 months, not over 20 years. Ty Dolla Sign sounds half asleep on every song. The line ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just here to get paid‚Äù is a perfect representation of Ty‚Äôs presence on Vultures, because he sounds like he didn‚Äôt have even an ounce of passion on this entire album. <br><br>Not a single moment of this album was enjoyable to me. As Pete Davidson once said, MAKE KANYE 2004 AGAIN.
Despite me agreeing in whatchu saying, not mentioning the highlight that is &quot;Burn&quot;, is kinda a crime
Nah he‚Äôs just hating, the ‚Äúreference‚Äù bar isn‚Äôt dissing his own wife. He means Bianca is the blueprint‚Ä¶. üíÄ
This album lit idc I‚Äôm so happy
You would have reviewed it if it was reviewable
nobody gaf lil bro
I mean you&#39;ve reviewed Nazis, white supremacist, and anti-semites in the past. To me this looks more like a political statement than your actual thoughts.
Ngl I fuck with vultures but calling his lady a reference is insane nglüò≠
Here before 5Mil (Currently 13k views)
W
Yeah fair enough
This just looks like an melon.exe file
oh boy he wants money
So why did you review the singles? üôÑ
I agree with Fantano on this one.<br>Listening to this album is like listening to R. Kelly admit his crimes.
I think he actually likes it guys
cope
I can&#39;t wait for unreviewable 9, the avant garde sequel of this video
kanye realising that being a prick ISNT a personality trait to brag about (impossible)
I mean what is he supposed to say about it really, giving it a legitimate score ignores the context and controversy while validating Kanye&#39;s attempt to return to legitimacy, which he doesn&#39;t deserve.
Thanks for another unbiased review Anthony...
bro is like 40 years old having a mid life crisis. go find a new wife bro
I mean he didn‚Äôt say it was not good ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
#1 in 71 Countries
Yeah I&#39;m actually with Anthony on this one, Kanye fans are the worst fanbase out there
He made graduation tho
dislike button:
you know an artist has done some messed up shit when even melon can&#39;t shimmy around it
Is this a review of the album or an review of Kanye? You fell off
Damn.
Come on guys. Kanye situation is really crazy. And it is new music from kanye, but it&#39;s not good. And you can&#39;t separate artist from his art, especially if his shittiness comes out in the art itself. I support Fantano in his view, it&#39;s reasonable. Don&#39;t rate this shit, boycott Kanye, he messed up, he needs to stop trying to be a public figure, get therapy and get his shit together. <br>He&#39;s been unhinged for years, and everyone around him just push him deeper into the hole of madness because he&#39;s a money making machine
This man has spent too much time with Hasan
anyways keep streaming vultures
kanye stans will call swifties a cult when they‚Äôre 10x worse than them
Dawg
lost¬∑cause (n.) - <i>The artist known as Kanye West a.k.a. Ye a.k.a. Yeezy.</i>
Anthony are you Jewish? Why are you so offended by Kanye. If his words hurt you, cry about it
STILL THE KING‚Ä¶‚úÖ
yep. this is a banger
funny taylor video. funny kanye video, all is healed
Didn‚Äôt even bother reviewing the album, just virtue signaled your moral superiority. Face it, Kanye clears your whole life. Shit is sad. Please never review my goat again, you just embarrassing yourself at this point. I cannot wait for the day you bite the dust. Anyways Vultures 1 instant classic Vultures 2 coming.
This is unrelated to the video Anthony but why does your hairline look like a reverse donut
This guy was having a mental breakdown on Twitter and Twitch over a guy who doesn‚Äôt even know he exists, embarrassing for a 40 year old grown man.
if it was called to pimp a vulture hed give it a squillion billion jillion out of 10
Melon L
i think he likes it
At least you can try to lie to yourself and say it&#39;s ty&#39;s fault it&#39;s kanyes worst
Woah woah woah. I‚Äôm a Kanye fan but I don‚Äôt fall in those 3 categories. I don‚Äôt defend him or his actions and Ik they‚Äôve affected real people. I‚Äôm just a fan of the music even though I haven‚Äôt been the biggest fan of modern Kanye. He can still make bangers Imo. You are right tho, most Kanye fans have to chill
ngl listening to the songs and hearing the consistent Jew bars are kinda just like ehhhhhh.... okayy this is weird now.<br>I like some of the songs I enjoy burn the most I think it&#39;s better than Jesus is king, and that&#39;s it.<br>I think many people have and will avoid the album because of Kanye, and the fact he&#39;s musically really hit and miss recently.<br>also, you can just enjoy the album without the politics and public antics.<br>You kinda came off like you just didn&#39;t want to like the album, and your chat is a terrible reference for your introduction thesis. <br>there are plenty of people who enjoy Kanye without being attached to him or his views same you could apply to killer mike for example.<br>just my opinion; overall great video, but some weird takes.
yeah ofc that sexy redd record was better, we are looking at a person that has lost his mind.<br>you can literally see it in his tweets and now videos.<br>everyone knows the album isnt bad, melon is actually just hating.
Fantano went full Kanye meltdown with this record you hate to see it Lol
This is just sad, you&#39;ve clearly let your biases take over. Big L.
Peggy didn‚Äôt meat ride for this üò≠üò≠
bro is malding üòÇ
Womp womp 108 countries disagree with you
Fuk Sumn goes hard tho
Dude let Twitter get to him haha
if it was named &#39;&quot;sinners get vultures&quot; it would&#39;ve been a 10
Boooooo
Anyone tell me when he talks about the album?
honestly doing a review like this is just giving kanye exactly what he wants anthony. if you really won‚Äôt review it, then don‚Äôt. don‚Äôt make a video to still get the views off the album.
go smoke some za
Melon - W<br>Kanye - L<br>Good call, Tony üëç
I don‚Äôt like him but enjoy his album
the album was very good imo, but i understand why you wont review it.
Sadly, he is right. I know the music is subjective but just compare this to any other kanye project in terms of effort, quality of the songs, mix, it&#39;s just a mess like the whole recording procces in crowdy hotel rooms or deserts.
this is the most autistic i‚Äôve ever seen him
kanye stans will watch this and still not process what&#39;s being said and dismiss it
yapyapyapayaoataoa
Lame excuses melon. Go listen to sexy red.
this album is so good that bro cannot rate it
At this point its clear to say that fantano hates kanye
Tbh i do think some ppl wouldve liked your opinion on it but you are absolutely right and im honestly impressed by you genuenly not reviewing it it and standing true to your belives especially considering most people wouldve still reviewed it because it gets attention
Kanye did nothing wrong
L + Bozo
It&#39;s not amazing and it&#39;s ignorant but it&#39;s a good fun album
looking forward to the nuanced, stimulating conversations around art criticism and the legacy of antisemitism that will surely play out in this comment section
Kanye saw the covetted Fantano‚Ñ¢Ô∏è <i>0</i> dangling right in front of him, and Melon just... yoinked it out of existence.<br>Right in front of him.<br>Brilliant.
Try to not let your feelings get in the way of your music reviews. You could argue it‚Äôs a bad album and that would be ok , but clearly you‚Äôre getting your emotions tied up in this - couldn‚Äôt even rate it!
LLLLLL
ty&#39;s cheeks have to be worth a 2 at least
Once you tie reviews to how good of a person is to their music, your entire library of reviews can be judged.<br><br>R. Kelley, tom macdonald, suge knight, etc. If you didnt act the same for pedophiles killers etc, it shows you accept their acts.
Both bald, both had their wives leave them, both like burzum
He shoulda made Yeezus 2
Dude even the green screen is all messed up. This review is a mess
who hurt broüíÄ
GO GO GO GO GO HEAD SO GOOD SHE AN HONOR ROLL I DONE DID THE IMPOSSIBLE
You and Kanye are very similar. <br><br>You both went mad after your wife left
not saying &quot;forever&quot; at the end hit like a truck
What happened with not talking about kanye anymore? üòÇ You realized you fell off without controversy like sexxy red üòÇ
bro it‚Äôs really not that deep‚Ä¶.. Sexy redd and meg will not let you hit!!!
&gt;unreviewable<br><br>&gt;reviews it
Your own fans even hate this garbage you‚Äôre pushing, what happened to you bro
zzz
Fantano completely lost his credit(the little he had) after he gave sexy red a 8
cmonnn we just wanted to hear you give it a 0
People keep listening to Kanye because he is a good musician. They don&#39;t care about his beliefs. <br>And we don&#39;t care about yours. So either review shit or stfu
Is sad to see that your politics undermine your judgment again, totally expected and predictable, 1. you are just cartoonish  2. You believe you flight above the rest of us; Fair!, is your review and your channel, you just imprinted and reviewed your cartoonish self (political lecture)  more detailed than this man&#39;s artwork.
kanye fans are literally a cult. you&#39;d have to be willfully ignorant of everything he&#39;s said and done in the past few years to not get fantano&#39;s point. it&#39;s that simple!
cant believe fantano gave vultures 1 his first ever 11/10. well done kanye!
Kanye has had melon on chockhold since MBTDF
Feezy
in real life though, no amount of jokes or willful ignorance is gonna make what he‚Äôs saying here less true (is he harsh on the music, sure, but if you‚Äôre not seeing why then you just don‚Äôt want to. and the music really really isn‚Äôt that good this IS his worst or second worst album even if it has a couple decent songs.)
I only like 4 songs on this album, paperwork, fuk sumn, carnival, and problematic. The only reasons I even like these songs though is because of the features and flows. I‚Äôve always found Ty very bland, and kanye is unbearable on almost every song (I do like his verses on problematic besides the ‚Äúreference‚Äù line tho)
This guy is just pathetic
interesting how you‚Äôre attempting to do a read on kanye‚Äôs relationship dynamic when you yourself couldn‚Äôt even keep your marriage
I get the point of saying you seperate the art from the artist but from what I&#39;ve heard the art also sucks. So there isn&#39;t anything worth here
The term is coined Anti-Semitic, but Ashkenazi‚Äôs are hardly Semitic, they‚Äôre Europeans. Js ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
So basically you think it‚Äôs a 10?
unreviewable as sexy red would be jealous
I don&#39;t think that is even matters how you feel about the album the fact that kanye  is batshit insane and a antisemtic racist sexist piece of shit makes it impossible for anyone normal to still defend him and he doesn&#39;t even try to change his ways even after everything that happend I&#39;m truely amazed of how such a musical genius that changes so many lifes (including mine) can be such a dumbass
Get yo 50 y/o bald ass outta here anthony üò≠
This is the best Kanye West album since MBDTF
Bro wtf does music has to do with politics u just wanna get kanye attention tho
honestly really well put together video, i know the comments r gonna be mad but this video is absolutely the correct response to this album. Cringe ass album even tho i like the peggy beats.
so u rating a album not for music but what artist did few years ago? ok got it lmao
Appreciate you putting forth this point of view in a constructive and respectful light. I‚Äôm definitely a fan of the album not not a huge fan of the stuff he‚Äôs doing outside of the music, so hope I‚Äôm not bunched into one of the three ‚Äòtypes of Kanye fans‚Äô haha.
Ye fans are gonna be crying
Oh brother ü§£ should‚Äôve titled it ‚ÄúWhy I don‚Äôt like Kanye West‚Äù
If this was called ‚ÄúTo pimp a vulture‚Äù you would‚Äôve given it a 10. Ok give me likes now
Good shit, Tony
GO GO GO GO<br>HEAD SO GOOD SHE A HONOR ROLL<br>SHE RIDE THE DICK LIKE CARNIVAL<br>I DONE DID THE IMPOSSIBLE <br><br>GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO
He should remove his other reviews of his albums then. If it makes this one unreviewable then they all should be. That like saying Hitler was good until the bad stuff happened.
Or you know fans the just like his production lmao
If it was called to pimp a vulture,<br>You wouldve given it a 10
Booooooo<br>Bald ahhh
Im sure r/fantanoforever will have a very normal reaction to this.
he completely misunderstood the &quot;reference&quot; bar lmao
Wtf man this is about music... not politics
A tear just ran down my leg
Angelic 2 The Core is a better record.
Finally a good unreview. A strong 10
I feel like even if you do try to separate the art from the artist, it still is objectively his weakest album. It doesn‚Äôt sound finished at all. Handful of great ideas in a sea of demos. <br>But I have to disagree about the beautiful big titty butt naked women chorus. Easily the most memorable part of the album to me. Absolutely unhinged.
If it were called &quot;to pimp a vulture&quot; it would be a 10
I don&#39;t know how people can genuinely say this is AOTY. Vultures is complete trash
Just remember this guy likes sexy red
Im a huge Kanye fan and I thank you for this video. Bring attention to the horribleness of Kanye and his fanbase rather than tear apart this album and cause even more hostility with psycho Kanye stans.
We‚Äôre gonna hear the most annoying people on the planet piss and shit over this for the whole year won‚Äôt we
Album sounded pretty good.  I don&#39;t take his rhetoric seriously, never did.
Kanye is the only artist on TND to have a 10, and an unreviewable. All he has left to do is NOT GOOD and a goose egg now
only music review ive seen where he talks about everything but the music
great album, great artist
Bro really hopped off stream where he was coping while getting clowned on to record a video and say the same things he got clowned for lmao
Bro is genuinely fuming üíÄ
He looks so done with all this stuff üò≠
Thank you, Kanye, very cool!
Glad you liked it fantano
even the cover in the background dont want to be there
honestly, this was the best way to go about this - props my guy
you are using your platform in the same way kanye is using his platform. you have no argument here, and your only goal here is to push political agendas (otherwise you would never had posted this video to begin with)
What happened is that he thought everyone would act like a self righteous ignorant condescending prick like him and blindessly hate through the album finding the smallest of things to hate on, and now and on twitter he&#39;s having a meltdown fat shaming ye, being mysoginstic towards bianca and just losing his mind simply, there are people who aren&#39;t sad middle aged assholes and will just simply listen to an album, and decide if they liked it or not
Hey melon, still better than sexy redd.
I‚Äôve never seen such a sad middle aged man
I am here for just the music, I don&#39;t really follow him outside of that, and with that said, the last Kanye album I even fully listened to was twisted dark fantasy or whatever it was called with Niki triage on the intro, that was the last good album to me.
U might be more delusional than him
I would love to see you hold your friend husan accountable for the stuff he says. If Kanye made a ‚ÄúAmerica deserved (you know what)‚Äù you would be on him for that. You rate Travis Scott even though he has done worse.
I never understood the people who say separate the art from the artist. Kanye has always been the main focus of his music, the albums are about him, what he thinks, how he feels. The person that he is is in the music and now he&#39;s a deranged nazi and the music sounds like it.
Shut up joo
Insightful take Anthony, thank you for not just using this as free content and standing up to hate. I was initially planning not to listen to this simply because I assumed it would be hot garbage (given the quality of the single). Then people started saying it was decent (musically) and I had to decide not to listen to it because we should not be giving this man streams, clicks, or whatever he wants from us. Kanye needs help. Not a platform for his hate.
i respect you more and more especially when these kanye stans are coming at you
Thank you for being consistent. Some may see this as virtue signalling but i genuinely don‚Äôt think this album is worth talking about.
You have lost sanity, get help Anthony
When is your album review with your wife coming out?!
So are we gonna talk about the songs?
Fair take but I think you‚Äôve misunderstood the meaning of the reference line badly
Bro pulled out the reddit argument üíÄ
im gonna be honest the way the entire music industry is just acting as if kanye didnt go a pro nazi media tour last year is unsettling, most artists still have no problem collaborating with him.
He set a new record in melon history and he‚Äôs gonna do it again üî•üî•üî•
Bro loves the Album
Oh brother this guy stinksss
if only he named it &quot;My Beuatiful Dark Twisted Vultures&quot; you would&#39;ve given it a 6
some say silence speaks louder than words so this is an a 11üíØ
Good shit. Needs to be called out for being stinky
Fantano so corny now üò¢
yeah we dont care about ur opinion
Facts Fantano. These Kanye fans are mindless sheep‚Ä¶.. and I use to be a huge fan of his. Dude is a trash human being
Most unbiased review of all timeü§ì
If the album was called Hood Hottest Vultures, you would&#39;ve given it an 8/10
Ngl this album is some hot ass but it‚Äôs not the worst album ever or unreviewable. Hell you gave the Teezo touchdown which is much worse a 7
Another great album from folk rock outfit GothamChess!
he didnt give it a number score so if we imagine it its a 10
How can you hate hood rat when you are a die hard death grips fan
I actually have to agree with this one. This album is horrendous and the fans make it impossible for me to try my mind. I got through 3/4ths of the album before just skipping around because I was just wasting my time.
womp womp review the album
you can definitely tell this guy is a child of divorce
If this was titled ‚ÄúMy Beautiful Dark Twisted Vultures‚Äù, you would have given it a 6
So glad you liked the album, Anthony
If it was good you would review it
tell us when you actually review the album!
Man, bunch of Ye bootlickers diving into these comments eh
your favorite artist is dua lipa..no one cares what you think.
I really never defended Kanye West for his bullshit. And I had stopped listening to his music new music. And I can‚Äôt support someone who does anything like that. I just hope that he gets the that he needs. But I can‚Äôt support him. And I definitely agree that he had went to far and can‚Äôt come back from it
Kanye when he sees a 10/10 girl but she&#39;s jewish:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=306">5:06</a> is where review starts, thank me later.
This is the same man who gave Andre 3000‚Äôs flute album a 6. But this album is unlistenable? And I‚Äôve never been a Kanye fan. Just review the album you baby..
This album is fire
JIK is IMO still Ye&#39;s worst album. I enjoyed Vultures a lot, but a lot of the issues that you brought up I agree with. <br><br><br>But why didn&#39;t you, like, review the whole album? Where&#39;s Stars, Burn, Carnival, Good, etc. They were outstanding tracks and I would have liked to see your opinion of those tracks. Oh well.
Honestly fantano W Kanye fans gotta hop off this is his worst album
You should do a music review with your wife!
5 mins into the review and nothing has been said about the record‚Ä¶
Thanks for the rec Anthony!
In this video fantano says you cannot seperate the art from the artist in this case because it is engrained within the lyrics, that he cannot review it because he knows kanye fans will not listen, and that kanye fans are hateful psychopaths. In this video&#39;s comments section people are telling him to seperate the art from the artist and just review the music and commenting on his personal life and appearance and telling him to end his life<br><br>Are you guys at all self aware
You should have a look at what Bianca‚Äôs designs looked like and how she dressed before she even met Kanye. Google gadirrajab Bianca Censori, it might give you a different insight.
waaaaaahhhhh waaaaahhhhhhhh
Fantano you slandering all Kanye fans as hateful nazis who are all members of cults is disgusting. The vast vast vast majority of Kanye fans hate what he said. Actually truly disgusting and engagement bating.
I really hope his opinion on the person isnt conflicting with his listens to this album, bc tbh this album was pretty damn enjoyable. The music truly sounded like the color palette thats associated with the album(in a great way). <br><br>To each its own lol ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è<br><br>PS:: im pretty sure at this point yeezy is trolling &amp; taunting everyone with the. . . Imma say &quot;anti-semipro&quot;, stuff. Like a kid, if we just ignore it collectively, even media wise as far as videos go, It&#39;ll prolly die off due to lack of attention. Wish he didnt try to rely on it though for a spark
Talk about being unbiased and detaching feelings from a review.
if this was &quot;Vultures See Ghosts 1&quot; you&#39;d give this a 10
fantanos gotta stick to beefing with teenagers like redveil bro cant handle the heat from kanye fans üíÄ
Is this guy restarted?
if it had sexy redd on it, you&#39;d give it an 8
If the album was called Ok vultures it would be a 10/10 tho
Find God
Fantano has made a video ranking and reviewing Led Zeppelin albums, they had sex with minors. Fantano is losing his fucking mind.
Bro what are you yapping about
shame. i was truly looking forward to a review on the music but it&#39;s just a review on kanye.
Didn‚Äôt want to review the album bc he doesn‚Äôt like the person so he reviewed their life over recent years<br><br>Melon
Let&#39;s not forget that this man is a music critic and also 40 years old and he is acting like this üòÇ the comments got to him
You‚Äôre so cringe
i like a few songs
I can&#39;t wait until todd and the Shadow release, &quot;Kids see trainwreck,&quot;üòÇ.
LOOOOOOL HES SICK OF THIS SHIT
nerd
My god bro kanye got you wilin lmao
the fact that kanye fans are doing nothing but harassing this man proves his point. genuinely depressing.
I&#39;m a big Kanye fan, but can acknowledge that he&#39;s more than deserving of the valid criticism that he receives. I&#39;m also a very left-leaning and empathetic person. That being said, I think Anthony has full-on Kanye derangement syndrome. And I can&#39;t think of any other music reviewer/commentator that I would say that about.
melon is depressed, he&#39;s having a mental breakdown
i hope that you get the help you need, you‚Äôre obviously having a mental breakdown right now
If I got kicked out of 109 bars I‚Äôd start thinking what‚Äôs wrong with me
you‚Äôre genuinely the worst
Put a pill in a McFlurry, I‚Äôm goofy
anthony really fantanoed on this one
Vultures 1, the album that broke Melon &#39;s bubble. Go Kanye!
The fact that this album is Number 1 in Israel proves that you are just salty
ALBUM SO GOOD HE DONT KNOW HOW TO RATE IT ITS INCOMPREHENSIBLE <br><br>MY GOATüêê‚ÄºÔ∏èüêê‚ÄºÔ∏èüêê‚ÄºÔ∏è
Lol he mad
Kanye and Melon need to make a collab comeback album for all the bald divorcees in the world
Kanye is a great example of if you say you‚Äôre a genius and keep saying you‚Äôre a genius, eventually people will just believe it and go with it
It was so good Melon had to shit on it just to sound different and cool!
its official, the curse has been shifted from kanye to melon, melon has gone craxy
Bro took his glasses off, the anger fog was gonna be too much
‚Äúunreviewable‚Äù then why post a review????? just refuse to review, and ignore it. also calling out that line where kanye calls his wife a reference, then saying what you said about her on twitter is superrrrr hypocritical.
he so mad for no reason üò≠
you reviewed burzum btw
I‚Äôd rather just hear your thoughts and opinions track for track. Not this man..
Mf cant fathom that some people just like the music
Anthony woketano
This video should be called &quot;Anthony kills his credibility as a music critic&quot;
üßØ
This is way too hilarious üòÇ
embarrasing
Anthony Fantifa
antony fantano is the most pandering peice of shit of all time. all he does is give good/bad scores depending on whatll get him the most views and interaction
What a coward. Review the music baldie. Pathetic..
Your banned from California
Even if I didn&#39;t like Kanye music, id still like BACK TO ME. I don&#39;t get it how you could hate the song. The beat is awesome, it&#39;s creative and better than most beats from the past years
Damn, Anothony is pissed!
unreviewable albums dont just fall out the sky, you know
Damn score so high he couldnt tell usüò≠
This feels like the review equivalent of &quot;Never in my 20 years of teaching has a substitute left a note this bad&quot;
if it featured mc grips you would rate this a 9/10
Melon keeps adding to his L collection
Some things are bigger than music. Good shit Anthony.
BBTBNWJDFOTSYK BBTBNWJDFOTSYK
top 3 Fantano vid ever
Old Ye, yea. New ye, no.
But how can you still review the music of a psychopathic serial abuser like Carti? He also has a cult like fanbase which defends everything he does. Dude literally choked his pregnant girlfriend a few months ago and I haven‚Äôt seen you bashing/boycotting him<br><br>The double standards are insane<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=279">4:39</a> this guy is honestly just reasonable lol
Angry divorced man child throws tantrum for his queen sexyy red
You&#39;re cooked, melon. Time to retire
Fantano got bullied lol
Just say you fell off and want to be Sexyy Red‚Äôs 2nd baby daddy.
Kanye fans listening to this record by themselves<br><br>Bruh you do realize the album is #1 CLOWN ü§°
Fire production throughout besides hoodrat, lackluster cringe writing at sometimes but songs like burn and carnival show he‚Äôs still got a pen. Ty Dolla sign doesn‚Äôt miss at all in this album so that was pretty impressive. All the features were good imo quavos wasn‚Äôt necessary but it‚Äôs still a decent feat. Kanye does this weird Elmo voice flow that‚Äôs interesting experimentation too. Better than JIK but idk if it beats out any other kanye record. 7/10 best tracks Carnival, Stars, Back to Me, Fuk Sumn, Problematic, Beg Forgiveness. Worst track: hoodrat <br>Seemed reviewable to me
i think this video was completely necessary tbh. even in a hypothetical universe where kanye wasn‚Äôt antisemetic, the music on Vultures is genuinely so bad. the only song people really wanna talk about is Carnival, but on that song he calls himself Ye Kelly. when do we stop taking garbage on the chin and actually start pushing back against this guy. i‚Äôve long since lost all remorse or respect for him, i do think he‚Äôs too far gone for any valid apologies, he‚Äôs still trying to clutch on to relevancy. he still thinks his loyal fans refer to him as a king, which is really bad if kanye has to appeal to his fans that he‚Äôs spent YEARS avoiding. idk man, maybe it‚Äôs time for him to pull an Andre 3000, drop a flute album, but he would still find a way to name the songs something hateful towards Jews.
He had a mental breakdown on both twitter and twitch.
womp womp
Bro is onto nothing üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
i‚Äôm jewish, i think you‚Äôre stupid ngl
Alright this is pure hater shit
Kanye keeps pushing Boundaries!
Swifties are starting to become more mature than kanye glazers now honestly
Extremely common Fantano W
If it was a collab with sexyy red you would&#39;ve given it a 10
so... it&#39;s a 10
Jesus christ dude, Come on. Big L.
Love this!
I still love Kanye, I still love Kanye, I love KanYe, I still KanYe,I still love Ye,I still love Ye,.............Dead. ü´Ä<br>Edit: Kanye is dead and My love is dead . Im a clown ü§°
paid &gt; fade, and i love fade
Dude he lost it why can‚Äôt we just enjoy music
Melon standing on principle with this one
&quot;How do you penetrate this level of self imposed ignorance?&quot;
this album has many high points in my opinion, I don&#39;t see why this is so bad that it&#39;s &quot;unreviewable&quot; as opposed to a &quot;not good&quot;
The guys with the sign on the bridge were leftists cosplaying as right wing to create rage bait and smear the right
This isn‚Äôt even NOT GOOD ü§£ü§£ amazing
To call it AOTY in February is a bit much Anthony, but you do you
You didn‚Äôt even listen to the whole thing lol
lil bro didn&#39;t even give at a second listen just made the review after the stream as quick as possible out of pure irritation lol what a loser
u forgot 4: the kanye fans who only listen to the good music he made that still exists eventhough he has said a lot of bs which we never cared for or supported and never will
Let‚Äôs fucking go fantano
Melon is crashing out
I am number 2
Will you give the same energy to Ozzy when he said on video that hiter was one of his inspirations? No? I thought so
Ehhhhh ~
Truly boundary pushing content from Kanye, he quite literally created a new spectrum on Fantano‚Äôs review system
eh is crazy
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=309">5:09</a> Kanye‚Äôs verse wasn‚Äôt unintentionally hilarious and if u can‚Äôt see that you‚Äôre washed bro
post ur reaction stream!!!!!
I watched your stream 10 minutes ago, how the f did you pull this of so fast
just review the album bro
Lmaaooo get a grip bro
7 minute yap session
If it was called to pimp a vulture you would have gave it a 10
If this was called ‚Äúthe vulture store‚Äù you‚Äôd love it
ok so THIS is bad‚Ä¶ but the blatant misogyny, drug use, and violence glorification is totally acceptable lyrics but politically charged rhetoric isnt? bullshit‚Ä¶ not even funny anymore just review the music or call yourself a political pundit
Bros face was genuinely turning red üíÄ
wtf did this entire yap session have to do with the album
jewish fantano OWNS you
The album cover artifacts are the only thing i can focus my eyes on
separate your brain from your skull to ignore it
Fantano is having a meltdown, the ones that watched the stream know what i am talking about.
This would have AT LEAST gotten a 6 if he kept the ‚ÄúOkay you the king, Burger King‚Äù bar.
but he made graduation
unreviewable üî•
If Ye was just on production and it was Ty and the features this wouldve been stellar
Kanye def loved this lol I feel like this is just playing his game
anthony you‚Äôre being unfair heres separate the art from the artist
Sad to see Kanye&#39;s fall from grace. It&#39;s a bad album, and he needs to stop. He is single-handedly destroying everything he has built. I love Kanye&#39;s music, but this is not a good look. Gonna be hard to continue even listening to his old music frankly.
We‚Äôve reached a new level of ‚Äúbad score‚Äù. <br><br>What is this in the levels between 0/10 and NOT GOOD?
You should delete your tweet about Bianca, not a good look
I wont even bother watching this fully since he didnt bother reviewing the album. I miss the old fantano
crazy
So basically kanye won again..
Yes but the sexxy red record was truly revolutionary
This is just sad
Lmao do you see your own bias that you could not review it, but you still put out a video explaining it‚Äôs unreviewable. It‚Äôs like a how can I still get views from this and get stats like comments going
I&#39;m surprised he didn&#39;t mention how the cover looks like garbage as well
BBTBNWJDFOTSYK
This is gonna be a shit storm
If this album was called To Pimp a Vulture you would‚Äôve given it a 10. Super hyped for Jobe!
u are a Jew NJFG4L
Hey someone in the comments can recommend a critic who does an actual review of the album?
ANTHONY IS IT WORSE THAN REVIVAL
So it‚Äôs a 10?
The only person in Kanye‚Äôs inner circle that I feel bad for is his daughter. Someone really needs to call CPS on this loser.
He changed Hip hop with 808s and now he&#39;s changing the review category, Kanye really is the KING.
ùêñùê®ùê∞
Kanye was one of my favorite artists but I&#39;ve given up on him years ago. Even if hes not as bigoted as he&#39;s putting on, he&#39;s shown time and time again that he&#39;s willing to be manipulated by right wing grifters if those aren&#39;t his true beliefs. The music isn&#39;t even good enough for me to even put in the effort to try and still support his ass anymore. <br><br>Inb4 i get torn up in the replies
If this album was called hood hottest vulture you would&#39;ve given it an 8
I FOR ONE LIKED THE ALBUM FANTANO. COULDNT CARE LESS ABOUT YOUR SOYBOY OPINION JUST CAUSE UR MAD YE GOT A WIFE AND YOURS LEFT YOU G.
Clown
as much as i disagree with you on your takes as of recently, i actually completely agree with this. this type of behavior from fans honestly solely comes from twitter and twitter alone. thats why i dont use twitter anymore lol. its better to pretend these parasocial fans dont exist
Top 1 most consescending album review oat???
We&#39;re here about the f ing music nga idc about controversy.
the real question is: will y‚Äôall still have kanye‚Äôs older albums in your rotation ‚ùì
Even if you did do a proper review, I can already tell it wouldn‚Äôt have been high. Kanye has clearly lost his creativity and it genuinely has been making me wonder if all those connections he lost made him who he was.
Kanye = garbage
now if it was called to pimp a vulture üòîüò≠
You‚Äôre not making sense, what kind of review is this.
Your such a loser
Bad faith
You gave burzum a 6/10 btw
How can a grownman be so soy bro
Mad respect for using your brain when reviewing music
sorry that Kanye fans are so horrible and you have to deal with it - I hope you take some time for your mental health king
This is the most biased review I‚Äôve ever seen of anything ever. Fox News isn‚Äôt even this bad.
&quot;I&#39;m not going to react to everything Kanye does&quot; <br>Fantano after making his 17th video about Kanye in the past four weeks:
clown
The only way I would&#39;ve been convinced to listen to this album is if Fantano gave a yellow flannel revie, specifically because I know he wouldn&#39;t greenlight or positively review something that still had a lot of bigoted garbage in it. This pretty much sealed the deal for me. Hopefully Kanye gets better and learns to grow up and surround himself with people who aren&#39;t yes men
I farted into a microphone. Tuned it to different octaves, than looped it 20x over. Burnt it to a cd and labeled it &quot;Timeless farts&quot;. <br><br>I&#39;m sending you this album Anthony I hope there&#39;s more reviewable than this one.
real! i only will revisit like 4 tracks from this, and only the Carti parts, bc this shit is assssss üî•üî•
Antonio el Fantas
people like this album<br><br>how
A good album i like it i don&#39;t like ye but music is good i am not going to defend him but the music is good but you can&#39;t ignore what he said or says and you should hate him for ir but i think everybody has redemption
I will not review this album then starts reviewing. I am confused.
Bros mad üò≠
This is easily his worst album and if you disagree you‚Äôre delusional
wah wah wah cry about it
Only because the album contains MBDTF snippets you ain&#39;t slick Anthony!
A reference for beauty bro
We get it Anthony, you‚Äôre brand friendly. Way to go.
This is one of the best reviews you‚Äôve ever done. Kanye is too far off the deep end but his fans are too deep into his dick to actually validly criticize him and realize his actions have consequences.
But Melon, beautiful big titty butt naked women don‚Äôt just fall out the sky you know!
‚ÄúHow could you possibly separate the artist from this?‚Äù<br><br>Dude you like Burzum the fuck is this moral high ground you‚Äôre trying to take lol
you job is to review music bozo
fantano seperate art from artist challenge impossible
Thank you fantano for not reviewing this album and not giving another Kanye album 6/10 üôåüôåüôå.
This is why your audience hates you
This feels worse than a zero. Damn.
This is just a person review not an album review
You know what&#39;a unreviewable? Your ex-wife.
Why did you title the video unreviewable and then review it
Is this the first thumbnail with no glasses
If this was a kanye west album you would have given it a 10
Since the twitter meltdown I been waiting for this.
Ur a loser Anthony lol
yap yap yap stfu and do ur job
he knew ppl on twitter gonna post his score and go &quot;he rated this lower than this!&quot; so he just said eh
Well said. Album is scatterbrained as usual too. He hasn&#39;t done great music in a while. It&#39;s shit.
I wonder what makes an album unreviewable. This happened tl Melanie&#39;s Portals
To save your time before watching, he gave it a 10!
we should‚Äôve of known that Kanye would never have faded silently into the background
If Kanye was an unhappy divorced you would rate it as a 10 !!!
Goddaaamn this an awful look for you.. üçÖüçÖüçÖüçÖ
Holy shit üíÄ<br>We&#39;re witnessing history right here.
I love the thumbnail
Bro is malding so hard üò≠
I can&#39;t believe he gave it a 10 omg
Fantano can‚Äôt seperate the art from the artist
Bald fentanyl user that is divorced and haye kanye saying that vultures is a 1 is a surprise üòÆ
what‚Äôs the point of uploading this if you barely talk about the music
new unreviewable type reviews, this is unfathomable üò≠
Once again Kanye is being attacked for presenting new ideas
Fantano out-fantanos himself. Props lmao
This dude is talking nonsense. He still hasn&#39;t reviewed Saya Grey&#39;s brilliant art-pop album from 2019. But now he&#39;s on some meta shit? Get the fuck out of here, Melon.
Kanye‚Äôs the only guy to get a 10 and unreviewable. Incredible
He‚Äôs so butthurt that people enjoy the album üíÄüíÄüíÄ it‚Äôs a fun listen  and he didn‚Äôt even attempt to listen to it because he doesn‚Äôt like ye
Goof ahh
this is st8 facts this albumn is dog water
Music is subjective :)
burn its good you cant say no
if this was titled &quot;to pimp a vulture&quot; you&#39;d have given it a 10
You are the one that put him in a position where he thought he was God and could call himself Yeezus. You‚Äôre the one that told the guy that writes musical lyrics that he was a genius. - Katt Williams
no foreverüò¢
<b>GO GO GO GO GO</b>
Theneedledrop is so political now that he can‚Äôt review music, amazing
fantano has lost it.
L
He didn‚Äôt say it wasn‚Äôt a 10 so it probably is a 10, great review fantano üëç
Fantano try not to virtue signal challenge : IMPOSSIBLE
You are Jewish
wow. the first infinity out of ten. i knew he‚Äôd love it
His 2024 MBDTF
This will go down in history of the fantanoverse
Some petty part of me likes the album more now<br>Also in my humblest opinion it feels like you&#39;re choosing to be ignorant on some things
He is so pissed off man can&#39;t say i blame him
my goat washed <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/W8IfY_bwAfiPq7IPvNCA2AU"></a>
pretentious
Idk how to feel about this, I get Kanye is gone off tracks and said some of the most outrageous stuff. But Anthony has reviewed other artists who have said outrageous stuff and acted on them actions. I feel because Kanye is so mainstream it‚Äôs more unfair to put this out as a review.
Do the review, clown.
Nah that&#39;s a L bro
And 4 people who enjoy his music and his influence in hip hop
Dont diss the beautiful big-tittied buttnaked women that just dont fall out the sky. You know?
This is actually sad<br><br>He‚Äôs having a mental breakdown<br><br>He lets the comments get to him
Such fucking cap Anthony üòÇ you just mad at Kanye, do your job at a journalist Anthony
This album definitely has music on it
I think this means a 10
Ty$ carries the album anyways
Ye fans delulu
You do realize he already had his rating ready. He leans too much into his feelings for subjects and artists. Let a random person that sampled a raccoon in heat: &quot; The melancholy antiperspirant grooves juxtaposed to the THUNDEROUS bass, really adds to the group&#39;s solar platform.&quot; IF youre not going to do a review, DONT DO A REVIEW. Now, Fantano not only looks like a hypocrite, because he&#39;s going against what he claimed his morals are, he&#39;s also a hater. No need for a video. No need to hint to it, the albums and its tracks, on various drops. Hold on to your morals and walk away from it. THIS is just silly and makes you look as loose as your neck line. &quot;LOOK AT ME, I&#39;M AN ALLY!! I HATE HIM TOO!!&quot; This is sad..
spoiler: he ends up liking it
Not melon throwing a temper tantrum like a little kid üò≠üíÄ
If this album was called ‚ÄúThe Vulture Store‚Äù you would‚Äôve given it a 10.
Wow I can&#39;t believe he gave it a 10
This is why you are divorced ü§£
üò°
I am quite happy to separate the artist from the music. Unfortunately Kanye fell off. Only teenagers with TikTok music taste will like this
I feel like not reviewing it would of been smarter move. You‚Äôre giving it more attention
If this album was titled Scaring the Vultures you would‚Äôve given it a 10
Albums fire. grow up.
I kinda understand why fantano is upset but it really rubs me the wrong way when he overgeneralizes kanye and his fans like this. It just feels really disingenuous, regardless of the music or his opinion on it.
WOW!!! No views but 500 comments üôÉ
sooo close! you almost got the name right! keep up the good work and keep improving and impressing! üòÅ
no wayüò≠üôè
Of course he didn‚Äôt say anything about the second half
Me personally I liked it a lot.
Next Kanye album will have a track called ‚Äúunreviewable 2‚Äù and will feature samples from this video<br>6/10
Hatred
kanye still influence , ppl now will try to achieve  unreviewable rating.
I dunno, you can have your own opinion about the guy but hating so hard you call this album unreviewable trash is just petty, because it&#39;s really not, it comes off as you trying too hard to hate it, but you do you I guess, your channel after all.
The best and most thoughtful video I&#39;ve seen about Kanye. Thank you Anthony!
Imagine making an album so good that it&#39;s unreviewable, Kanye the GOAT
Yeezy da üêê no üß¢
antny ! u being   so dumb kamye is goat and u arnot so dontbeso dumb
This Ye<br><br>I disapprove<br><br>Bye
let&#39;s maybe not say &quot;left the reservation&quot; anymore
I liked it.
oh ye&#39;s cooked
This is the video that the album deserves.
Those poor jews. LEAVE THEM ALONE KANYE! DONT BE ANISEPTIC
giant W
Too late melon i have already decided to like the album
Kanye remains as one of the artists of all time.
You‚Äôre a fully grown man talking about ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to give him a platform‚Äù when youre talking about sht that everyone knows about already for 7 minutes straight and not doing your job which is reviewing his music ü§£
imagine having so little credibility at this point, where u hate an album because of someones controversial views, at least give it a normal review, the game album was nice, and even if u hated it at least make a normal review unlike this nonsense
is it a not good, 0 or a 1
oh shit
maybe if he was called Kanye XCX??
congratulations Anthony, you brought the worst possible fandom to the video
Or 4, I just like the music...?<br>why do you review rap records about murder and violence ?<br>You wrong on this one, melon...
I‚Äôm almost positive the comments will prove why this video exists in the first place. Music (and art) critique is dying in the age of TikTok Copypasta.
Just because you have an irrational fear of vultures doesn&#39;t mean this album is bad Melon
Separating the art from the artist is not a real thing. If you don&#39;t understand this now you never will.
sure kanye has apologized, and maybe he‚Äôll change. but i still feel like the damage has been done at this point.
Fantano isn&#39;t fucking around today
I don&#39;t see how it can&#39;t be conflicting being a Kanye fan in this day and age
you ran an alt right youtube channel years ago where you raged at feminism and sjws, but now you want to take some moral high ground against kanye for his remarks LMAO. You are a full on hypocrite who is purposely choosing to not separate art from artist in hopes people will respect your character. If only more people knew the real you that shined years ago.
It‚Äôs pretty clear melon cannot separate the artist from the art üòÇ
Should we not listen to Wagner? It&#39;s a complicated issue, I grant you. But I&#39;d like to know your view.
This may be his most controversial &quot;review&quot; yet üíÄ
Dudes such a nerd
LITERALLY MALDING üíÄüíÄüíÄ
If this album was called &quot;To Vulture a Dolla $ign&quot; would&#39;ve been a reviewable/10
i thought the album was good üëç
If Kanye didn‚Äôt sympathize with nazis this would‚Äôve gotten a 6/10!!
Bro has lost it
this was NOT on my bingo card
The needle drop about to start a civil war with the most insane people
bro got bullied out of a review aintnoway üíÄ
each day you make it easier to unironically hate you anthony
I disagree with what you say about this album being sonically bad, I actually like how it sounds, I am more upset because he turned away Christ, it‚Äôs probably an unpopular opinion but I loved his music more when he was at least trying to portray a Christian image, I‚Äôll forever appreciate what he did for Christian music through donda, just wish he wasn‚Äôt making soulless music that only sounds good with no substance :(
Hey look it&#39;s a liberal political channel<br>I think I&#39;ll unsub
fantano try to separate music from politics challenge (IMPOSSIBLE)
5 minutes and no views?
Damn fantano having a meltdown dawg I was hoping for an actual review even he gives it a 0. I feel like this could‚Äôve been a separate video üíÄ
try to separate personal life from the artist dork
Kanye I belive is mentally ill. He needs some honest help but everyone around him are just using him. It&#39;s very sad to see.
Wow, just wow.....
JEWWWWWWWISHHHHH<br>JEWWWWWWWWWWWWWISHHH
Ironically, the album went #1 in Israel.
Can‚Äôt wait to see this album appearing in the next Hivemind quiz on Fantano ratings. And watch Brad Taste In Music somehow remember this rating.
Fantano proving once again that he thinks his audience is made up of complete imbeciles who don&#39;t know when to ignore an artists political beliefs
In other words he liked the album üò≠
THATS WHY YO WIFE LEFT YOUü•±ü•±üòπüòπüòπ GET A WIFE OH WAIT üò¢üò¢üò¢ü•±ü•±ü•±
burn lyrics about the situation made me realize kanye is absolutely insane and (likely) didnt mean anything he said
If it was called ‚Äúthe vulture store‚Äù you would‚Äôve gave it a 10
So glad you were able to be unbiased and review the music for what it is, great job melon!!
okay but is this worse than a not good or what
Bro is trashing known mental case Kanye for saying crazy shit yet promotes terrorist propaganda on twitter i just can&#39;t with melon sometimes
So you don‚Äôt like it?
This album was so underwhelming it‚Äôs really disappointing
Kanye needs to sit in the time out corner and think about what hes done.
Amazing concept, Anthony. You loved this album so much that it transcended a 10, it‚Äôs now so good it‚Äôs unreviewable! I‚Äôm interested to see where this series goes!
imagine being this pressed lmfao you are such a joke of a person
üßØüßØüßØüßØüßØüßØüßØüßØ
Comment section proving you right
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=277">4:37</a> is this aplasticplant lol
The big vulture
Valid
i don&#39;t get why he hates the reference verse. like it&#39;s obvious he meant that his wife is so beautiful and just the best every other woman wants to be like her so she&#39;s the reference<br>(album is solid 8/10)
7 minute non review üëèüëèüëèüëè
Don‚Äôt care didn‚Äôt ask Fantano. <br><br>FIRDAY NIGHT, LETS ALL GET PAID üó£Ô∏è
I agree but it&#39;s kinda annoying that you are specifically  make a video about this fandom and not a fandom like swifties
you&#39;re such a liberal it hurts
Great review Anthony, but you didn‚Äôt give a rating which either means it‚Äôs a 0 or a 10
Mr. Melonhead please consider Car Colors (the band by Charles Bissell, formerly The Wrens) for a future review, Thanks! I think they&#39;re the bees knees
You lost your fucking mind
Lol Melon is really going out sad
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to give him a platform‚Äù then proceeds to constantly give him a platform
all im hearing is wah wah wah lil bro
Album is fire
You fell off dude, just log off the internet, and delete the misogynistic tweet about Bianca
Sounds like a strong 8 to me
kanye has wife. melon doesn‚Äôt‚Ä¶. hmmmmmmmm
Actual Fantano W
If this album was called ‚ÄúX‚Äù you would have given it a ‚ÄúY‚Äù
there ain&#39;t no way melon made a whole new category for kanye üíÄüíÄüíÄ
Get help brother
No NAV = 0/10 very understandable
this just comes off as salty rather than authentic review unfortunately
if you want a rating from unbiased person unlike fantano, strong 7 to light 8
Buddy having an episode over this albumüò≠üò≠üò≠
thank you
As a kanye fan, you are based
I fucking hate that after a good album like donda he decided to ruin the lives of millions of lives because yes he has ruined the lives of Jewish people as they are getting harassed and negatively perceived by his fans.
Bianca catching strays man wtf
You have to react to the cover of running up that hill by social repose
ur so corny
This gotta be your worst take melon
This album is either going to end up near the top of the worst albums of 2024 list or will subvert it entirely, making it the first of its kind in Fantano‚Äôs review catalog to be acknowledged once and never again.
Kanye&#39;s downfall is crazy. Truly sad to see.
W Album fr
What I&#39;ve heard of it has been good. Vultures (the track) was atmospheric and eerie. It reminds me of trip-hop.
Nooooo
can we have a formal, fair, professional debate Anthony? I come into this as someone who has common ground with some of what you say, but am also still a kanye fan.
Ever since Kanye said about Jews melon head will never like anything further that will involve Kanye ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
i‚Äôm so glad he chose this album to be his favorite album kanye is clearly in his prime and melon notices üôåüèΩ great album review
If the album was called Weezer‚Äôs The Vulture Album he‚Äôd give it a light 6
If this album was called ‚ÄúTo Pimp a Vulture‚Äù you would actually rate it
WE FARMING ATTENTION WITH THIS ONE
Anthony, you can‚Äôt just make volume one of your review. We need a full 21 minute video about how it‚Äôs the best album of 2024
Huge W. Crazy how much an album drop makes people forget
I can positifly say this is the worst album i have heard in the last 15 years of my life. Thank you melon man
First shawn cee, and now fantano, whose gonna review this üíÄüíÄüíÄ
He&#39;s actually abstaining. That&#39;s crazy. Respect it tho.
Fantano you fell off ever since you made that vegan cookie recipe.
yea but did u like ‚Äúburn‚Äù or not
Bro can u just review the album
music so good melon had to review the foundations of music and music review
just review the music brev
I&#39;m starting to think this guy really loves kanye.
bro fell off the deep end
i can&#39;t believe vultures 1 got a unreviewable video before tom mcdonald
So mad he can‚Äôt even review it even tho it‚Äôs his job
This channel is unviewable, bruv
Kanye broke through rock bottom and found a new rock bottom
This is actually just some hating. I know kanye has done/said bad things. However as a music reviewer you have an obligation to provide an unbiased opinion which this is not. Music is objective I get it but there are albums you have given a fair shot that are pure garbage objectively. Other than some wack lyrics most of this music is inoffensive in context of kanyes discog. Release a real review melon‚Ä¶
if it was called ‚ÄúTo Pimp a Vulture 1‚Äù it would have got a 10
I guess we‚Äôre not gonna get YeThony Fantano todayüò¢
This has got to be the worst take you have ever had, and you‚Äôve had some pretty stupid takes over the years
Damn it didn‚Äôt even get a not good lmao
the album is NOT that badüò≠üôè
Lads a music reviewer, review the fucking music
Bros almost 40years old and can‚Äôt comprehend that people have opinions that differ from his own
If this was an instrumental album it would be a 10/10
Out of all heinous things musicians have done, for Kanye to be the limit is insane, then to turn around with the misogynistic things and double down in this video after calling Bianca a Kim K clone is beyond insane<br><br>(Especially because Bianca is quite literally vastly superior to Kim K in every way)
Hi I&#39;m Anthony fantano I am a retard and my wife left me goodbye
holy fuck
Kanye West
Another common Fantano W
Tremeu na base
Is this bait or is this dude actually having a mental breakdown?
bro is mad people enjoy a record
BURN UNIRONICALLY GOATED THO
I can‚Äôt comprehend what‚Äôs happening here
if it was called &quot;Kids See Vultures&quot; itd be a ten
Worst review I‚Äôve ever watched
You are a psycho üòø
Time for the most annoying youtube fanbase to change their opinion on this album.
Fantano is for the people
First ever non-review review? Melon a trailblazer
349 comments in 2 minutes is insane
38 year old attacking teenagers. u odd
I need to see the age of Kanye fans who say this is his best work since TLOP and that he was bringing back his college dropout song because genuinely what the fuck were they talking aboutüò≠
Kanye has officially broken the melon.
Melon we don‚Äôt give af about what he did, separate the music from the person it has nothing to do with it, who cares anywayüò≠
This is lower than a not good and it deserves it. Kanye has reached eldritch levels of madness (he&#39;d probably like lovecraft actually)
Do you listen to the music or just care about the politics?
This video it‚Äôs exist
This bald weirdo is seething hard üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Unreviewable is higher than i expected honestly
Terrible album though. You are right.
We know Kanye has watched you‚Äôre Jesus is king review. I hope he sees this
lmao youre a loser
what a cop out
This would‚Äôve been reviewable if you didn‚Äôt say you just wanted to beat the Jewish allegations the entire time.
I see George Soros paid you for make this &quot;review&quot; instead of making your usual lorem ipsum text with 6/10 in the end.
If only kanye left quavos verse that referenced sexy red this would be an 8 üíÄüíÄ
If this was called &quot; Kids see vultures&quot; you woulda gave it a ten
God you‚Äôre such a cornball
Damn he pissed you off that bad üòÇ
if this album was called ‚Äúspeeding bullet 2 vultures‚Äù it would be an 11/10
This guy didn‚Äôt even give it a chance smh<br><br>He said burn was a ‚Äú2000s pop song‚Äù üòê
I don‚Äôt think this project was bad, but it definitely wasn‚Äôt good imo. Production, ty, and the features delivered, but Kanye just doesn‚Äôt sound good as a rapper anymore for the most part, and it kills half of the tracklist for me.
fantano wants a Ye reaction sooooo badüò≠üòÇüòÇ
Fantano try to seperate the music from the artist challenge (impossible)
This is total bait
I dont gove a shit that youre correct. Its a 7
Stop yapping review the music
You always separate the art from the artist until it comes to Kanye. You let his fans affect your reviews everytime
Just because you&#39;re divorced and he&#39;s married doesn&#39;t mean you shouldn&#39;t give this album a 10 Anthony
Kanye is unbelievably washed and the album is complete and utter dogwater. If you like it, you‚Äôre either a bigot or a teenager. Trash
Not even gonna listen. Bro was already throwing a fit before he <br> heard the album. He went in with the mentality that he wasn‚Äôt gonna like it.
I knew that you&#39;d be biased and talk about the controversies instead of reviewing the album, if i wanna watch a vid from you i&#39;d expect a genuine review. ü´§
Your wife left you, baldy.
not even a 0 it‚Äôs just unreviewableüò≠üò≠
Mid life crisis hits different
since he will not review it I will not listen to it because I can‚Äôt have an opinion
this is actually a pretty fair review
WHAT???
Worst album of the decade?
bro if you dont like kanye, just dont listen to him, dont care about him, save you some time and rest
thank u anthony
üôÄ
crying is all I hear. Review the fucking album
CARNIVAL IS BEST SONG OF 2024
Fantano, just cus it&#39;s not Ty Dolla with the cheeks hanging out, you can&#39;t call it trash...
I liked it
Anthony Cucktano
This is fucking ridiculous lmfao how bad of a hater do you have to be to claim that this is unreviewable but then give Sexy Red a high score, this dude is delusional
How the fuck did an album with professional feature merchant Ty Dolla $ign manage to get Fantano to break character
fantano having a meltdown right nowüíÄ
Peggy really cut his audience in half to produce on some mid
This isn‚Äôt a music review. It‚Äôs a political discussion
as a kanye fan, we can‚Äôt turn ourselves blind and act like this is a memorable album, this is completely bad. one thing that i hate is when drake talks about f*cking women on an entire album, he is corny, but when kanye does? he is the goat, come on, and i don‚Äôt even like drake. mid proyect, underwhelming and 0 effort on this one. totally agree with you on this one melon, the kanye fandom is getting worse and worse everyday.
If this was named kids see Vultures melon would give this a 10/10
If only the Alvin and the chipmunks feature was on every track üíî
tell me you had a negative biased review planned from the start without telling me you did‚Ä¶
i&#39;ve been losing my mind seeing kanye fans go &quot;uh fantano&#39;s gonna give the album a bad score because he&#39;s biased!&quot; as if they themselves aren&#39;t also biased. and they act as if it&#39;s even possible to have an unbiased opinion of something purely subjective
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jEngxUFz4&amp;t=50">0:50</a> realised... and apologised, changed his behaviour, and has moved on. Why does public image matter? If that&#39;s what matters to you, public image, then just say it lol
Love you melon
The point of a music review is actually <br>3. To give your opinion on the music. <br>This is disappointing
I bet you envy my life where I&#39;m not professional obligated to listen to or follow anything ye has been doing in the last 4 years.
Hows the wife doing Tony
Kanye is completely in your head
Rent is due huh
hi
this is why I like separating art from the artist, it works!
so this the worst album you ever heard
clown review. no objectivity, straight hate.
I haven‚Äôt watched the ‚Äúreview‚Äù video but I imagine it didn‚Äôt rate it anything above a 3 if he even rated it at all.
Stop reviewing hiphop
Does this count as a not good?
if it was called to pimp a vulture you&#39;d give it a review
Why do you feel the need to even release this video? I don‚Äôt get it
i can&#39;t believe it
Yurzum has definitely made an album this year, but its all ok because he made Lift Yourself.
If you were still married this would have been a 10
He‚Äôs leaning too far into the politics and antics. Far left Anthony doesn‚Äôt have an unbiased opinion.
LMFAOoo
You mad he loves his wife
But remember guys sexy reds album is definitely better üó£Ô∏èüó£Ô∏è
The album was mid with zero substance and lyrical ability carried by production
where&#39;s your wife buddy
BLUD IS MELTING FOR A MUSIC ALBUM üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
PROUD TO BE THE FIRST DISLIKE
Hahaha based
would have given it a 10 if the album was good and he was a good person and didn‚Äôt do anything bad
if this album was called to 1 a vulture you‚Äôd love it
I apologize for calling you biased on your shorts video. You have the right to call this album garbage if you think it is.<br><br>Me personally, I liked a couple of the tracks outside of some of the gross bars
didnt even bother keying the canvas properly, genuine respect for that one melon
ok you the king. burger king
You know it&#39;s bad when he doesn‚Äôt even put &quot;REVIEW&quot; in the title
If the album was called to pimp a vulture you would given it a 10
You going to review scrims new solo album &quot;lonely boy&quot;.
Ironic that Logic is calling other music ‚Äútrash‚Äù‚Ä¶
üëéüëé
damn.
Here goes fantnao with his &quot; totally not bias review&quot; After his live mental breakdown on Twitter AND on twitch. This is embrassing lmfao. <br><br>And also shit on kanyes fans and his wife insanely immaturity too
bro just do your damned job
Easily an 8.5+
U lowkey right. High 8 tho
When i am in a glazing competition and a Kanye fan pops up: üòûüò©
no shit your wife divorced you
Yeah but how much did you like it on a scale of 1 to 10?
he went from making music ahead of its time to making music that sounds like it was made 5 years ago. also hes a prick.
Nvm I just feel bad for him at this point and it‚Äôs just sad at this point I hope he‚Äôs doing okay ü´∂üèª
Kanye kids seething:
Amazing take Mr.fantananananbobo
lame as hell quit letting your politics get in the way of the music jesus christ
ahhh hell nah
I miss the old kanye
Damn so we just giving up huh
It was a Jewish doctor tho
‚ÄúUnreviewable 1‚Äù shut up nerd
Congrats Kanye on receiving the first ever Thank You/Bye score in Fantano-lore history
Biggest bruh moment
Nice! I liked Burn haha
If Kanye wasn‚Äôt antiseptic you would‚Äôve given this a 0
yap yap yap yap, yap yap!
If the album was called To Pimp A Vulture it would be a 10/10 tho
Kanye might be my favourite rapper of all time but this album is a 3/10 at best
Anthony was gonna give it a 10 if it was named to pimp a vultures
You&#39;re gonna get mauled by the neo-Nazi excusers for this one
of course he gave it a 1 üò≠
L
Kanye provoked an existential crisis in Fantano
Deep, thoughtful, and thorough analysis on this album. Didn‚Äôt watch
welllll
So fucking dumb just review the music
So father of all is better is what you&#39;re saying?
why he kinda fine in that thumbnail
ok cool. Vultures 2 when
40 year old divorced man named Tony having a Twitter meltdown using poop and fart references - now this is sad
this the most anthony fantano shit of all time
Kanye had a good run‚Ä¶ right?
Fantano, is it true Kanye stole your ex wife?
Glad you liked it Anthony
Bro so mad he has to give a near fake review.
Lmao
still made a 7 min review about him ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
no TRAN-sition that&#39;s how you know he&#39;s pissed and done with it
the first ever ‚Äúunreviewable‚Äù video for melon. kanye continues to push the boundaries of music
vultures 1 was so bad to fantano he created a whole new style of review üò≠üò≠
Excellent review but the 3 minutes spent talking about the best lures for fly fishing were a bit off topic
ü¶Ö
thanthonty santano
where&#39;s your wife bro
Fantano da üêê no üß¢
k wea
thanks antony
anthony fantano needs a kiss, man
If it was called to pimp a vulture you would have given it a 10
if it was called to pimp a vulture you would&#39;ve given it a 10
don‚Äôt care stop begging for attention
if it was called vultures 1 you would‚Äôve given it a 10
This album going number 1 on Israel shows that only people like u got offended
Melon would‚Äôve gave this a 10 if it was called ‚ÄúTo Pimp a Vulture‚Äù
This album was so bad he had to lecture us on why he makes content
I don‚Äôt wanna give this guy a platform ü§ì <b>Proceeds to platform him more than any other artist</b>
Anthony it‚Äôs actually sad to watch you break down like this, Vultures is a great album
We all knew this was coming
More like kanye fart
Accurate
Wow after that twitch stream I knew this was coming
I just pooped for the first time in 4 days
Bro went straight from the twitch stream to uploading this. This man&#39;s hustle is unmatched
Melon, what‚Äôs the point of being a music reviewer if ur not going to review music

Bad review

Just say that you‚Äôre antisemite
First ever ‚Äúeh/10‚Äù LETS GOOOO!!!<br><br>Edit: Jokes aside, finished watching and this might actually be one of Fantano‚Äôs most articulate and well explained reviews. Good work!
