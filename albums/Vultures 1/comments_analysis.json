After that, he had some good projects (KSG, Donda), but his music undeniably took a dive. But his spiraling into this lunatic persona was the final straw for me and for plenty of Kanye fans that kind of ‚Äúcame up‚Äù around the same time I did. Now, his fans are sycophants and edgelords who probably don‚Äôt even care for Hip Hop all that much. Honestly, I‚Äôm not surprised that the end of Kanye‚Äôs career is a train wreck. It feels weirdly ‚Äúright‚Äù.",
