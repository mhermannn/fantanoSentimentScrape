@cassiemagann8014,2024-04-13T01:34:27Z,2024-04-13T01:34:27Z,1,I recently had a dream that a mob boss kidnapped me and then he put one of his cronies in charge of watching me. Of course we fell in love and he let me go but I came back to him because our love was so strong. After I came back he morphed into Anthony Fantano and then I proceeded to give him hell for rating this album 6/10. One of the best dreams I‚Äôve ever had.
@pengu6021,2024-04-12T20:09:52Z,2024-04-12T20:09:52Z,2,once again wrong
@DrkKnight2,2024-04-08T17:07:38Z,2024-04-08T17:14:33Z,4,"Okay, I&#39;m not going to open up and flame you for your opinion; you&#39;re absolutely entitled to it, even if I find it thin. I&#39;m a metalhead for most of my life, so I know all too well what it&#39;s like to have my music ridiculed, berated, and outright vilified. I also understand that not all music is for everyone, and tastes and styles resonate differently. That said, I, like most other commenters here, find the Lana Del Rey comparison a bit lazy and short-sighted. I myself feel that the over-opulence of Del Rey doesn&#39;t come close to the Ethel Cain pantheon, but I digress so as not to sound like an over-zealous fan boy. I&#39;m far too old for that. However, I also agree that, as a few have said here, Ethel Cain could well be the voice that music has been pleading for in the last few years.  I&#39;m sure most of the fan base defending her here would call me a boomer old fart, and that&#39;s okay, too - I paid my dues to the music scene enough to know what I like, love and dislike, and I can appreciate their passion and defense of their artist and, in some cases, the voice for the more silent sufferers of traumas untold. They have found their champion and they love her for her honest, painful stories, fictionalized or not, hence such vehement defense. In the only sphere I&#39;d even mention Ethel Cain in the same sentence as Taylor Swift, I will state that both fan bases are insanely protective of and devoted to their chosen artist. For me, Ethel Cain provides far more substance than a messy Swiftie broken love affair (or several, as it were), but I digress again - she has her thing, Cain has hers. This adoration is what happens when an artist speaks to and for you in ways you never could or even would. She&#39;s a generational anomaly to be lauded, Ms. Cain, and she will be if she keeps up this pace as Preacher&#39;s Daughter belies. <br><br>As a metalhead yourself (assuming such from the ND shirt you&#39;re wearing), maybe this record just wasn&#39;t your bag, and I can dig that. I&#39;ve seen people more attuned to your channel and history that lay claims you&#39;re purposefully harder on women artists, and I won&#39;t assume that or poke at it as I simply don&#39;t know, but I do feel maybe you&#39;d like the totality of the piece if you gave it another listen or two. If not, all well and good. But I do find it interesting that the nuances you find critical and / or clich√© are the same attributes extreme metal was built upon, right down to the minimalist production values to the long, drawn-out &#39;epics&#39; that are supposedly for &#39;atmosphere and effect&#39;. That aside, the lyrics / subject matter isn&#39;t as in your face as the ridiculously cartoonish Cannibal Corpse (a band I also enjoy), but Ethel Cain paints stark portraits that would reduce some of those bands to tears. Again, it&#39;s all preference and taste, but I simply found it odd, some of the criticisms your levied at this album, a personal 9/10 for me.       <br><br>Allow me to take up a bit more space to defend one thing, if not for you, then for some men...SOME. I&#39;ve read some comments here, and, to paraphrase, &quot;men shouldn&#39;t be allowed opinions or to listen to Ethel Cain&quot;. Again, I don&#39;t know your personal history on your channel, and I will be watching more of your videos to see what else you&#39;ve reviewed out of natural curiosity, but I think it&#39;s unfair to classify all of us men as clueless automatons unable to appreciate a woman&#39;s suffering and voice. Sure, the misogyny and outright bigotry runs rampant in the music industry (and in most areas, come to think of it), but I&#39;ll only say that you gave Cain&#39;s record an honest review as you saw it, and assuming you&#39;re not on a one-man crusade to bring down the voices of women everywhere, all men shouldn&#39;t be reduced to such disgusting criteria. I&#39;m a 52-year old straight, white, metalhead that has seen, heard and done it all, and some of us can actually hear Hayden&#39;s messages here and appreciate and applaud them, as well as the base she&#39;s reaching. I&#39;m glad to call myself an Ethel Cain fan, and I&#39;m not least bit ashamed to defend Hayden when the closed-minded assholes in and outside the metal community come blasting their insipidities. I&#39;ve always loved music and artists that touch me and show integrity and honesty; Ethel Cain represents that, and this album is a bit of genius to my ears, but, as I said oh so long ago in this booklet I left here, we&#39;re all different. <br><br>Give her older material a listen, man - she&#39;s got a very distinct voice both sonically and intuitively. Thanks for reviewing her and giving it a small push, despite it not hitting you as it has others."

@theMuzicpainter,2024-03-28T22:36:34Z,2024-03-28T22:36:34Z,1,"I&#39;ve been pretty obsessed with this album as of late, because it&#39;s so different from the usual sounding music I listen to (i.e. different from goth, black metal, general heavy metal etc). I actually found it MORE disturbing that this incredibly dark and.... somehow weirdly familiar story (I also come from a small town in the Midwest) was blended with some &quot;pop&quot; music aspects. It made it creepier and more liminal to me and actually got to me harder than just straight forward heavy and/or dark music usually does. I was really impressed with this album and look forward to more of it. I do understand the points you&#39;ve made here and I think those sorts of things have been a generally divisive part of whether people like or don&#39;t like this album. I think it just depends on how it hits you."

Pretty sure Hayden basically says she is Ethel. This is evil art at its finest.  If you are true to yourself, you will be forced to admit that even duning  the incredibly beautiful moments on the album, you are still left with an intense uneasiness. That&#39;s because the source of this type of creativity it so unpure. To reach a certain level of fame and/or wealth on this realm, there is a similar deal that must be made. This album is basically revealing something you start to see everywhere when you start to look into the occult. &quot;Revalation of the method&quot;.

I really hate to say &quot;you just don&#39;t get it&quot;, but, yeah, you really don&#39;t.  Which is fine, but you&#39;re reviewing it, so."

@danielporpino3189,2023-10-26T10:09:32Z,2023-10-26T10:09:32Z,1,bullshit Ethel Cain is a goddess ‚ù§
@SherwinCeleste-cj7ng,2023-10-20T16:00:24Z,2023-10-20T16:00:24Z,0,"I love the dark story unfolding as i listen to the album. I thought the instrumentals are kinda bland and one note, (i love varied soundscape in an album) but still liked the album. I give it 8/10, I&#39;m looking forward to Ethel&#39;s next album i think she can do much better."

@user-ry3ei2vq3n,2023-10-09T10:47:02Z,2023-10-09T10:47:02Z,4,Ethel Cain is what Lana del Rey ever wanted to be
@samhill618,2023-10-07T21:25:21Z,2023-10-07T21:25:21Z,1,"For me this album grew on me and I would highly recommend it. Though Inbred and earlier singles for me had a quicker impact, the more I listen to Preacher‚Äôs Daughter the more I‚Äôm drawn to it, even as it (and much of her work) emotionally wrecks me as a parent."
@a.t.3192,2023-10-06T09:02:28Z,2023-10-06T09:02:28Z,2,"I don&#39;t like every song on the album, but it&#39;s pretty interesting overall and Ptolemaea is absolutely incredible."
@vollmilchbaum6873,2023-10-05T18:45:06Z,2023-10-05T18:45:06Z,2,"the producing could use some seasoning? BOYY that is literally the best seasoned album ever dafuq. the producing is so deep and full of layers, be fr"

@barbz6603,2023-10-04T16:36:41Z,2023-10-04T16:36:41Z,2,no way he gave it a 6/10. what the fuck
@800cherries3,2023-10-04T02:28:37Z,2023-10-04T02:28:37Z,0,this might be his worst take ever bruh
@Diablo98415,2023-10-01T05:37:27Z,2023-10-01T05:37:27Z,0,As usual came to the comments for the true review
@beauavpc,2023-09-26T04:02:48Z,2023-09-26T04:02:48Z,270,"We don&#39;t need an album front to back with Ptolemaea-esque tracks because that track has a moment that stands completely on its own. The blood curdling scream plus the overall arrangement being the most horrifying on the album is what makes it special. The whole album doesn&#39;t need to be that dark. If anything, I would say a full understanding of this album&#39;s plot is what really gave me chills, not necessarily the production&#39;s darker moments. The lyrics really shine through."
