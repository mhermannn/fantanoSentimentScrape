this album is one of the only ones to creatively capture religious trauma and the sense of unwellness you carry with you as a woman, you would never understand it and you&#39;re bald so why should any of us care what you think anyway
‚Ä¶ i hate you real bad
Wrong it‚Äôs a 9 or a 10 üò¢
Damn bro, you‚Äôre loud and wrong
my friend paul thinks ur lost and dumb, he says its an 8
Men will never understand this album
he‚Äôs bald‚Ä¶ HES BALD AND TORTURING EVERYONE WHO HAS HAIR!!!
This is your worst video
what is this, melon?
Y‚Äôall remember that video of that guy screaming about Glinda being a princess, that‚Äôs the energy I feel right now lol. GROWWW UP
The statement ‚ÄúI expected something darker‚Äù from Preacher‚Äôs Daughter is pretty crazy lmao but alas it is a very slow burn. It‚Äôs one of those works that has to catch you at the right time to click. Took me about a year of listening for it to fully resonate
6 for this album it&#39;s insane omg
this album is an 11 sorry
WHAT THE EFUCK
horrendously wrong about an incredible album done by a woman yet again.. fucking yawn dog
This album DOES feel a bit like &quot;we have Lingua Ignota at home&quot; but I think her next album will likely be a huge standout. Good foundation, just needs some tweaking. I enjoyed what this had to offer, but I did leave it wanting something a little more harrowing.
this was/is a fantastic self produced record. it‚Äôs giving hater. grow up brother
Pls review inbred, I‚Äôm curious about your thoughts
I am sick when you just start shitting on it ripping it apart
Bro gives mumble rappers a higher rating than Ethel? wild.
Sun bleached flies is NOT dragged out üò≠üò≠ it&#39;s good
bruh
I just can‚Äôt see a world where you would rate this 6. I guess it has a lot to do with how hard it can be for a man to connect with the pain of a trans artist
This album is easily a masterpiece 10/10 for me idk what this guy is on about
Shouldve listened to it 5 or 6 more times. It&#39;s now in my top 5 albums tbh but i agree the slow progression makes it one that has to grow on you.
You stay lackin!!!!! üéâ cause of shit like this
I recently had a dream that a mob boss kidnapped me and then he put one of his cronies in charge of watching me. Of course we fell in love and he let me go but I came back to him because our love was so strong. After I came back he morphed into Anthony Fantano and then I proceeded to give him hell for rating this album 6/10. One of the best dreams I‚Äôve ever had.
once again wrong
Okay, I&#39;m not going to open up and flame you for your opinion; you&#39;re absolutely entitled to it, even if I find it thin. I&#39;m a metalhead for most of my life, so I know all too well what it&#39;s like to have my music ridiculed, berated, and outright vilified. I also understand that not all music is for everyone, and tastes and styles resonate differently. That said, I, like most other commenters here, find the Lana Del Rey comparison a bit lazy and short-sighted. I myself feel that the over-opulence of Del Rey doesn&#39;t come close to the Ethel Cain pantheon, but I digress so as not to sound like an over-zealous fan boy. I&#39;m far too old for that. However, I also agree that, as a few have said here, Ethel Cain could well be the voice that music has been pleading for in the last few years.  I&#39;m sure most of the fan base defending her here would call me a boomer old fart, and that&#39;s okay, too - I paid my dues to the music scene enough to know what I like, love and dislike, and I can appreciate their passion and defense of their artist and, in some cases, the voice for the more silent sufferers of traumas untold. They have found their champion and they love her for her honest, painful stories, fictionalized or not, hence such vehement defense. In the only sphere I&#39;d even mention Ethel Cain in the same sentence as Taylor Swift, I will state that both fan bases are insanely protective of and devoted to their chosen artist. For me, Ethel Cain provides far more substance than a messy Swiftie broken love affair (or several, as it were), but I digress again - she has her thing, Cain has hers. This adoration is what happens when an artist speaks to and for you in ways you never could or even would. She&#39;s a generational anomaly to be lauded, Ms. Cain, and she will be if she keeps up this pace as Preacher&#39;s Daughter belies. <br><br>As a metalhead yourself (assuming such from the ND shirt you&#39;re wearing), maybe this record just wasn&#39;t your bag, and I can dig that. I&#39;ve seen people more attuned to your channel and history that lay claims you&#39;re purposefully harder on women artists, and I won&#39;t assume that or poke at it as I simply don&#39;t know, but I do feel maybe you&#39;d like the totality of the piece if you gave it another listen or two. If not, all well and good. But I do find it interesting that the nuances you find critical and / or clich√© are the same attributes extreme metal was built upon, right down to the minimalist production values to the long, drawn-out &#39;epics&#39; that are supposedly for &#39;atmosphere and effect&#39;. That aside, the lyrics / subject matter isn&#39;t as in your face as the ridiculously cartoonish Cannibal Corpse (a band I also enjoy), but Ethel Cain paints stark portraits that would reduce some of those bands to tears. Again, it&#39;s all preference and taste, but I simply found it odd, some of the criticisms your levied at this album, a personal 9/10 for me.       <br><br>Allow me to take up a bit more space to defend one thing, if not for you, then for some men...SOME. I&#39;ve read some comments here, and, to paraphrase, &quot;men shouldn&#39;t be allowed opinions or to listen to Ethel Cain&quot;. Again, I don&#39;t know your personal history on your channel, and I will be watching more of your videos to see what else you&#39;ve reviewed out of natural curiosity, but I think it&#39;s unfair to classify all of us men as clueless automatons unable to appreciate a woman&#39;s suffering and voice. Sure, the misogyny and outright bigotry runs rampant in the music industry (and in most areas, come to think of it), but I&#39;ll only say that you gave Cain&#39;s record an honest review as you saw it, and assuming you&#39;re not on a one-man crusade to bring down the voices of women everywhere, all men shouldn&#39;t be reduced to such disgusting criteria. I&#39;m a 52-year old straight, white, metalhead that has seen, heard and done it all, and some of us can actually hear Hayden&#39;s messages here and appreciate and applaud them, as well as the base she&#39;s reaching. I&#39;m glad to call myself an Ethel Cain fan, and I&#39;m not least bit ashamed to defend Hayden when the closed-minded assholes in and outside the metal community come blasting their insipidities. I&#39;ve always loved music and artists that touch me and show integrity and honesty; Ethel Cain represents that, and this album is a bit of genius to my ears, but, as I said oh so long ago in this booklet I left here, we&#39;re all different. <br><br>Give her older material a listen, man - she&#39;s got a very distinct voice both sonically and intuitively. Thanks for reviewing her and giving it a small push, despite it not hitting you as it has others.
Horrible take
you could never understand. just go back to your shitty bland male manipulator music
missed the entire point
Ok woman hater!
This might be your worst take ever...this album is absolute gold. One of the best artists out rn that&#39;s making actual good thought out art
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Imagine being this wrong
I&#39;ve been pretty obsessed with this album as of late, because it&#39;s so different from the usual sounding music I listen to (i.e. different from goth, black metal, general heavy metal etc). I actually found it MORE disturbing that this incredibly dark and.... somehow weirdly familiar story (I also come from a small town in the Midwest) was blended with some &quot;pop&quot; music aspects. It made it creepier and more liminal to me and actually got to me harder than just straight forward heavy and/or dark music usually does. I was really impressed with this album and look forward to more of it. I do understand the points you&#39;ve made here and I think those sorts of things have been a generally divisive part of whether people like or don&#39;t like this album. I think it just depends on how it hits you.
Honestly what the fuck.
this is a lesson not to listen to critics all the time
If this album was called &quot;Hood Hottest Preacher&#39;s Daughter&quot; you would have given it an 8
Ptolamaea (or however you spell it) and Sun Bleached Flies is NOT 6/10 material dawg üò≠
Folks, you know that you can still listen to and enjoy the album without Fantano&#39;s blessing right?
that is so amazing.. lana is amazing.. but that is so not lana
Never disagreed more with a Fantano take
Dawg whatever
this album takes more listens than the obvious one or two you gave to understand it because every word, every note, every breath, every break and stripping down of the production, it all serves a purpose
this score is transphobic
Sir, you wasted my time
an album like this wasnt intended to be a &quot;horror&quot; like sound because the songs where you say that the album is lacking because of the reverb are completely intended to be that way, the songs are made to give the album life, those tracks are simply letting the album breathe between tracks.
im sorry but did you listen to the same version of ‚Äòsun bleached flies‚Äô i did?
Finally unsubscribing because i think you just hate women
I agree ü´¢
this is probably <b>the</b> single worst take you‚Äôve ever expressed publicly boy what
Are you deaf?
I don&#39;t understand the comparison to Lana. Why does everyone say that? I genuinely want to know.
genuinely don‚Äôt know how a music critic can listen to this album and make this boring ass 5 min review like it‚Äôs insane
Sun bleached flies was my #1 song on Spotify in 2023, an entire year+ after it came out. To say the piano and instrumentals are stiff - when the whole point of the song is her reviewing her journey through the album, a massive undertaking - is to miss the intention of the track entirely. I‚Äôm so tired of men washing women‚Äôs experiences into neat categories and moving on as if they‚Äôve spoken something profound. Let‚Äôs let Lana and other indie artists stand on their own please.
not him saying theres cliches when the naive cliche lyrics are the point.........
HE CALLED HOUSE IN NEBRASKA TEDIOUS - TRIAL THIS MAN AT THE HAGUE NOW!!!
literally a criminal review like how do you rate that low?
Shut Up
You should Paint the walls with your brains &lt;3
Can always count on you to shit all over anything lmao.
Why do I still click on these videos? üòÇ Terrible critique.
this is definitely my fav album of all time
oh wow - i love house in nebraska and it was a fave on my first listen. guess it&#39;s just not for u
no offense bc I dont listen to music like you do but wtf are you talking about‚Ä¶.
Man, you are lost.
This one is so in our face, its obvious. It&#39;s a deal made with a high level demonic entity, possibly Satan himself.  It&#39;s all there.. .mocking God, religion, societal norms, destruction of any remaining good that can be claimed about America and the American family. Pretty sure Hayden basically says she is Ethel. This is evil art at its finest.  If you are true to yourself, you will be forced to admit that even duning  the incredibly beautiful moments on the album, you are still left with an intense uneasiness. That&#39;s because the source of this type of creativity it so unpure. To reach a certain level of fame and/or wealth on this realm, there is a similar deal that must be made. This album is basically revealing something you start to see everywhere when you start to look into the occult. &quot;Revalation of the method&quot;. They have tell us what they are doing/planning to do us. And occasionally, like with tjis album, tell us exactly how they do it.
Melon- you need to be tried at The Hague for this review because what the FUCK
You always have the same thing to say about indie female artists. Maybe you should really open your mind to music. Once again you‚Äôre disappointing
Any record would be okay with everyone. Any Fili Album and its fine, Any Album......
reality love this album
Hayden does not care about ‚Äûthe interludes being too long‚Äú it‚Äôs a story in one of them she does in the tower she ascends two the afterlife it‚Äôs not supposed to be anything but a cinematic masterpiece
im literally under ur bed
I‚Äôm listening to this album in 2023 and came back to disagree with Fantano. Everything he dislikes are stylistic choices I loved. A strong 9 for me.
this album is a 10/10 truly a masterpiece the songwriting is actually so well crafted it‚Äôs insane as well as the production it just blew me away also why compare her to Lana? I see you do that a lot in places where it‚Äôs not necessarily true
Dieses Album ist besser als alles was du jemals machen wirst du glatzk√∂pfiger Freak
it‚Äôs okay Melon man, everybody has to be wrong sometimes. the day you posted this review was your turn üòå
he said &quot;i wanted something darker&quot; when a sentence before he talks about how the last song depicts ethel being consumedüíÄ
the way you talk about this album makes it sound like you‚Äôve never lived life outside of a 4 walled white room making as many music review videos as possible to find relevance
if you listen to the a capella version of this album, which is available here on youtube, you&#39;d actually think that 6/10 is a nonsensical fantano rating. this album is freaking incredible. full of layers, just in the production value alone. i think it&#39;s ageing really well
I feel like the fact that she&#39;s trans ads lots of layers
NOOOONONNONONONOOOONONONONOONONONOOO<br>This is my mbdtf
That happens when you haven‚Äôt had hardships in life. Every time he reviews an album like this he does the same.
I was literally bawling my eyes out all night listening to &quot;American Teenager&quot; over and over.  I just discovered Ethel, and her lyrics + music resonate so incredibly strongly with me.  This album is astounding.   I really hate to say &quot;you just don&#39;t get it&quot;, but, yeah, you really don&#39;t.  Which is fine, but you&#39;re reviewing it, so.
Honestly hard agree<br>There were fleeting moments of brilliance in the album<br>I felt like I wanted to love it, but it‚Äôs just too disjointed and left me wanting more
bullshit Ethel Cain is a goddess ‚ù§
I love the dark story unfolding as i listen to the album. I thought the instrumentals are kinda bland and one note, (i love varied soundscape in an album) but still liked the album. I give it 8/10, I&#39;m looking forward to Ethel&#39;s next album i think she can do much better.
Were you really a Christian if you were  a Baptist?
Oh you haven&#39;t been this wrong in a minute, Melon.
Ethel Cain is what Lana del Rey ever wanted to be
For me this album grew on me and I would highly recommend it. Though Inbred and earlier singles for me had a quicker impact, the more I listen to Preacher‚Äôs Daughter the more I‚Äôm drawn to it, even as it (and much of her work) emotionally wrecks me as a parent.
I don&#39;t like every song on the album, but it&#39;s pretty interesting overall and Ptolemaea is absolutely incredible.
the producing could use some seasoning? BOYY that is literally the best seasoned album ever dafuq. the producing is so deep and full of layers, be fr
man shut up üíÄ
no way he gave it a 6/10. what the fuck
this might be his worst take ever bruh
As usual came to the comments for the true review
We don&#39;t need an album front to back with Ptolemaea-esque tracks because that track has a moment that stands completely on its own. The blood curdling scream plus the overall arrangement being the most horrifying on the album is what makes it special. The whole album doesn&#39;t need to be that dark. If anything, I would say a full understanding of this album&#39;s plot is what really gave me chills, not necessarily the production&#39;s darker moments. The lyrics really shine through.
‚Ä¶ light 6?! A LIGHT 6?! I‚Äôve never ever cared about your reviews  (meaning like your opinion is your own opinion) but damn man‚Ä¶ this was a BAD bad take.
People are waaaaayyy too passionate in these comments lmao. My favorite albums got low ratings from him but Jesus Christ this isn‚Äôt some endemic symptom of closeted misogyny from Fantano. He just didn‚Äôt like the album. Please stop being keyboard warriors and move on
heheh what I find funny is that this album is technically better than Midnights
I think it got a bit overhyped for you and you went in with false expectations. This is not normal music. You&#39;re analyzing it like normal music and you know too much about what music should be. This is not that. You should listen to this like an epic poem is being played out as a movie soundtrack visualizer. üéûüìΩ
Im going to give a strong disagree!
hoy kalbo nagkakamali kaüò†
im actually surprised this got such a low rating. i was expecting to see at least a 7 possibly an 8. I really enjoyed this :o
He is actually a lizard, and he could never understand poor thing.
Can u stop comparing any indie girl singer to Lana del Rey seriously
This review and the one for Chelsea Wolfe‚Äòs birth of violence kinda prove that he hates women lol
I think Neo-Southern Gothic is only going to grow in popularity in the next five years or so, and the work of artists like Cain will be looked at as crucial in that revival.<br>That context will end up making this album more significant for publications/reviewers like Pitchfork and Fantano
okay this review has led me to unsubscribe lmfao i can‚Äôt trust your opinions after watching half of this video. how do you not get it? like i can accept someone‚Äôs opinion when their opinion is based on an actual understanding of the music but clearly this record flew straight over your head (it‚Äôs not even THAT deep like how do you miss this hard???)
Sounds like someone didn&#39;t understand the narrative of the album. I had high hopes that you might be able to bring some cool insight on the story or production or anything (even if you weren&#39;t a fan of it per se) but I think I&#39;d much rather watch a react video of it where someone actually steps into the experience and gives a bit of a shit. HtHaze comes to mind.
So glad everyone disagrees with mr clean ‚ù§
Absolutely loving to see the comments disagreeing with this review.
this was one of the most negative 6/10 reviews i‚Äôve ever heard üò≠
she‚Äôs nothing like Lana. Inspiration, yes, but she tells a story THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE ALBUM. ethel is her own person not just a copy of lana
Reminder that you&#39;re a man that doesn&#39;t get it
lana has a completely different vocal range cadence style production everything wtf are u talking about. her main inspiration was nicole dollanganger and bruce springsteen. can you be serious
comparing ptolomaea with lana del rey is insane. stop focusing on the singles.
I haven‚Äôt watched the video but I do wanna hear Anthony praise the songs/aspects of her music that he likes but I don‚Äôt want to hear the criticisms cause I‚Äôm too sensitive for that: can somebody who‚Äôs already watched the review please make an edit where it‚Äôs only the positive remarks üôè
How do you not like american teenager even obama likes it. Its so good a president of america liked a song criticizing america because ethel cain the goat
You are wrong!!!! album is 10  :D
I can‚Äôt disagree enough this is easily one of my AOTY‚Äôs. Definitely on the short list.
this man just said &quot;bland vocals&quot; okay buddymelon
Ptolemaea made me crumble inside. As someone who‚Äôs been used and broken for what feels like forever i couldn‚Äôt stop listening to it again and again. Someone putting this experience, this feeling into sound. It‚Äôs a masterpiece.
It&#39;s not horror, it&#39;s southern gothic.  This album is for southern queers. It&#39;s southern gothic drone with gospel influence.  Not Lana del Rey
How does it feel to be disgustingly wrong
I heard a lot of Chelsea Wolfe in this album
Nah he got the alt girlies madddd with this one
He just doesn‚Äôt get it
saying that you&#39;d expected an album to be darker when it haves like HARD TIMES on it
Yet again proving us you are u able to connect with a woman‚Äôs point of view. Shows your your lack of knowledge of pop female culture and general emotional immaturity.
Wtf
this review is a crime against humanity
Personally I find her a lot more compelling than Lana.
Once again, Anthony fantano proves he has no taste
it‚Äôs giving every woman-made indie album review you do, redo it :) before it‚Äôs too late
this video was tedious
I feel so validated that literally all of the comments sing this album‚Äôs praises: I came on here, after only having recently discovered this TRULY INCREDIBLE album hoping to find folks having the same reaction as me. It‚Äôs been ages since I‚Äôve found music this amazing, I‚Äôm so grateful for it!
That&#39;s a very half-assed, dry and lazy album breakdown from you Anthony, you&#39;re deffo showing bias here. I suggest everyone to check out We Saw the Devil&#39;s breakdown of Preacher&#39;s Daughter - she goes well into detail of what&#39;s going on here. Ethel Cain is probably one of the most important artists of our generation and this album is pure artistry.
ur just wrong
He is getting mad lazy with these reviews
Hypocrite. If Lingua Ignota did this same album, you would have loved it
petition to not let fantano touch trans music
Calling every female indie artist with hazy vocals ‚Äúlana del Rey‚Äù equivalent is just lazy and a little misogynistic. Just say you don‚Äôt enjoy the genre or style, but come ON, they don‚Äôt even compare.
Your worst take ever
The album is true detective season 5.
Needed more bops like teenage dreams, there is too many long slow songs.  Just like movies these days. Movie are getting too long again and now music. I thought kids attentions spans were gearing shorter?
Wish dislikes were still available just so I could see them for this vid
male doesnt understand female rage album. color me shocked.
jk should‚Äôve actually listened to this
should‚Äôve done inbred
Bruh u got called misogyny for reviewing this album 6/10üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
I know its your opinion but critics are supposed to understand taste, and if you think this album is a 6, you just don&#39;t have it
u wont get it
You‚Äôre right and I‚Äôm happy to see you have the chronically online normie phoebe Bridgers taylor swift fans mad love to see it love you Fantano x
bum
Shut up
white man thinks all music is made for him and him only
American teenager is the ‚Äúsmells like teen spirit‚Äù of 2023
you&#39;re ill
This is what happens when one person reviews too much music. It not being your taste doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs lacking in anything
you just dont get it, youve never been a teenage girl who lives in the bible belt
I think this album is more difficult to have strong feelings about if you&#39;ve never experienced some of the subject matter. Not verbatim but in some shape or form.
you simply don‚Äôt get it
This is just misogyny lol
Just came to view these comments because I thought I may have been the one in the wrong here, but I‚Äôm glad we can all critique the egg man‚Äôs critiques so to speak. This album is a masterpiece, I can‚Äôt wait to see where she goes after this
Not every female artist who uses microphone reverb who writes about tragedy, sex and religion is a Lana copy.
im so close to blocking this man lol, what is his issue lmfaooo
Antonious Fanta gives a shit take one more time
i love the album, one of the best of the year, but it was too long with too many 6 minute songs that didn‚Äôt build into anything, but that was my only complaint, but fantano needs to stop comparing every single woman doing art pop or indie pop to lana - none of this sounds like anything lana has ever made
you can just say you hate women, it wouldn&#39;t be a shock to anyone &lt;3
I don‚Äôt know why I came to your channel for an analysis of this album lol
&quot;It&#39;s just not my year&quot; fits well in a song called American teenager. So what if it&#39;s cliche
Imma just say it, bitches with BPD feel this album on a multidimensional level
Personally I&#39;m a fan of Ethal Cain. I really enjoyed her &quot;Inbred&quot; EP and I&#39;ve seen her live and had an amazing time. Unfortunately I too did not connect with this album as much as I&#39;d liked to. I wasn&#39;t nearly as gripped with these songs as I have been of her previous output and I feel like this was a pretty bloated project. Idk why people are so hung up on the Lana comparison, I think they have their similarities and that&#39;s totally fine.
This review has me going let‚Äôs hope the heteros fail, learn, retire ‚ùå‚ùå
Idk why I clicked on this review, you‚Äôll never do the trans experience justice (just look at your review for transgender dysphoria blues). Love my badass trans women from Florida ‚ù§
I think she still considers herself southern baptist but not Christian? idk.
Just for that post playa tonight u get to go 1 on 1 with the federal bureau of investigations
i‚Äôm convinced he didn‚Äôt listen to her album.
I feel like this is definitely one of the reviews you got wrong. This album does not need every track to be dark to tell a dark story.
you literally look like the guinea pigs from g-force
no hair = no opinion. 9.5/10
tbh i liked a few of the songs but it really wasn&#39;t anything that I would re-listen to. I&#39;ll stick with hozier and lana lol
RIOT!!!!!!!!!! A House in Nebraska is a 10/10
If I see you on the street you abt to end up one somebody‚Äôs T-shirt with clouds and gates on it best believe that Fantano!!!!!
&quot;Competent singer&quot; ü§£<br><br>Clueless as always.
cant wait for the redux review in like 4 or 5 years
bro just hates women
I‚Äôm sorry but this is the worst review fantano has ever done. Obviously given the album 0 time mindlessly comparing any female indie artist to Lana deal rey proves his lack of knowledge about the artist. Seems as tho every1 in comments agrees. L review.
dude came into it expecting LINGUA IGNOTA and got mad when it wasn&#39;t exactly that lmao
I&#39;m a little surprised at a light 6 based on how much Fantano likes Lingua Ignota. They&#39;re very similar projects.
Common fantano L
can we all just collectively agree that anthony fantano can stop reviewing women&#39;s albums? stick to frank ocean or something you obviously don&#39;t have the artistic depth for this album
wrong!
Cool, made me cry
strangers is bland?! flavorless?! bro
i don‚Äôt think he gets it guys
Seems your opinion is a lonely one by the people on your comment board. I agree with them‚Ä¶not you. by about 10,000%. Sorry for you
?????????? Its a 10
No way you gave it a SIX!!??!?!?!? RESPECT THE ALBUM OF THE YEAR YOU SPHERE SHAPED HEAD
i will never forgive you for this
Just admit it, you‚Äôre a misogynist
Don‚Äôt agree with mention of her use of cliches, like they seem quite deliberate to me. Throughout the album she‚Äôs interrogating the various staples of American mythmaking and nostalgia, her own position within those shibboleths and institutions, and whether they deserve to be romanticised at all. So there‚Äôs almost a satire present in her using those cliches.
Idk man, you&#39;re pretty bland :/
men should never have opinions again
it&#39;s scary how little this guy knows about music lmfao
The poetry though!
I stopped taking this dude seriously when he gave Miss Anthropocene a bad review‚ò†Ô∏è
its so funny how he can break down intricate details about song composition is his videos but doesnt have enough media comprehension skills to understand this album AT ALL, i dont know why people even take him seriously hes like one of those foodies who dissect every part of a dish instead of just enjoying itüò≠ i dont understand how as a man you can listen to this album about the trauma of being a queer woman and think you would understand it in the slightest lmao
I mean I don&#39;t disagree. I listened to it twice and it still felt bland and hollow to me. Just didn&#39;t mesh with it and I don&#39;t feel the need to listen for the third time
Just finished this album a few minutes ago. Holy shit, this is one of the best pop albums I‚Äôve ever heard. There‚Äôs not a single note or lyric that I don‚Äôt like. And it all comes together amazingly. This is a 10/10 for me right now, and it‚Äôs dethroned Little Simz‚Äô Sometimes I Might Be Introvert as my favourite album of the 2020s. Holy shit dude<br><br>Edit: ok it‚Äôs not THAT good. Certainly one of the best albums of the 2020s imo, but not THE best

too straight to understand
The Daughters are coming for you Fantano
The length of the songs is justified because of the lyrics. (If you actually paid attention) Don‚Äôt make excuses.
why did he flip a 9 upside down and calling it an album score
Comparing Ethel to Lana is so stupid it just shows how stupid men are unable to understand their music with all offense u&#39;re tasteless
HAHAHA WHAT I love this album, 2022 best album. But thanks for your input.
Lana didn‚Äôt create ‚Äúalto singing to a moody track‚Äù, but I swear that‚Äôs always his first comparison every time a song could even begin to fit in that category.
HOW IS HOUSE IN NEBRASKA THE WORST SONG . SEEK GUIDANCE FROM THE LORD
Hate to break it to ya, but this is a fucking L take fella.
I&#39;m sorry Anthony but your wrong about this. Preachers Daugher was a very BIG surprise for me.  I am not a fan of Sadcore or country music but this album is dripping with darkness and dread but you totally misread this album. It&#39;s honestly one of my favorites of 2022.
just watching this now and his tales are horrendous i wonder if his opinion has changed
this is my beautiful dark twisted fantasy
A house in Nebraska as the worst track... oh you&#39;re sick.
We get it bruh, you don‚Äôt like shoegaze or anything super reverb-y
10/10 √°lbum, its made this way on purpose
A House in Nebraska is one of the best songs I‚Äôve heard in years. Thank you for helping me realize I don‚Äôt need the opinion of a music critic to help me decide what to listen to<br><br>This video is five minutes and 41 seconds long. I‚Äôd be better off listening to the album for that long and deciding for myself. I can‚Äôt remember the last music review I watched before this and I don‚Äôt expect I‚Äôll be watching another anytime soon
light 6‚Ä¶ be actually so fucking for real
Everyone is entitled to an opinion, but yours is wrong
ANTHONY FANTANO YOU WILL NEVER BE A TEENAGE GIRL!!!!
Damn this review is STINKY
I used to love your reviews but honestly it seems like in the past few years you‚Äôve lost it. Started to feel like my dad reviewing music.
Anthony missed big on this
these are some of the absolute worst takes i‚Äôve ever heard
getting a little big for your britches here, baldy
I think Nicole Dollanganger does all of it but better than Ethel‚Ä¶darker and more provocative
While I agree with a lot of what he‚Äôs saying, I‚Äôm honestly still taken aback of how great this album ended up being. I‚Äôm pretty excited to listen to her follow up now
My introduction was Ptolemaea just a few days ago, and it was legitimately terrifying and uncomfortable. It felt like the soundtrack to a malevolent and diabolical utter nightmare. <br>But even still I found myself going back to it over and over again, partly in disbelief but more so in appreciation.<br>From there I saw her KEXP performance of A House In Nebraska, which was also uncomfortable and made me feel so sad, almost like I felt the same longing that was being portrayed.<br>The fact that she was able to convey these uncomfortable and raw emotions so well that it made the listener also feel them - is an extremely hard skill, and more than deserving of high praise.<br>~ end rant
Late to this album and still just processing it. She actually reminds me of Sarah McLachlan whom I love with a beautiful voice and great sense of melody, melancholy and emotion that for me has rarely been paralleled by anyone since her 90s era. This is in my sweet spot with many Sarah Mc tender and powerful moments.
Honestly, I love her use of cliches, like &quot;its just not my year&quot; in the context of the song is so funny because the whole song explores America&#39;s misplaced priorities (in war, etc) when it centers a religion that preaches that Jesus is here for you, etc. Having this encompassing doom in the song and then the teenager brushing off her inner turmoil as it just not being her year is hilarious bc like of course it&#39;s not, it&#39;s awful out here. Same with &quot;it&#39;s you and me against the world&quot; because she&#39;s a young, naive woman running away and the artist points out the foolishness since she knows what happens to the character at the end.
Vocals not the strongest????? You&#39;re delusional babe
ive gotta say‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..no<br><br>just no. the slow pacing is GREAT and it really seems like he didnt pay much attention to the lyrics, or get the storyline ethel wrote to go with the album. this album is a minimum 8/10 VERY VERY minimum
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyLkPLnoDlo&amp;t=92">1:32</a> does he actually know that a cliche is a stylistic device? üíÄüíÄüíÄ
reading the album as a modern southern gothic will make all of it make much more sense
A house in nebraska ‚Äútedious‚Äù to listen to bruh
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyLkPLnoDlo&amp;t=96">1:36</a> is irritating me so much like do you not get the fact that these clich√©s are purposeful as she‚Äôs playing the character of a woeful teenage girl oh my GOD ofc a man cant get itüíÄ
Ur so annoying for not taking time with an album omg you need to listen to each song like 5 times to get it
kys
ITS A FUCKING 10/10
Ethel Cain, meaning &quot;nobility acquired.&quot; This is a man turning into a girl and what does that entail? The supposed birth name that I don&#39;t buy tells you. Hayden Silas Anhedonia, meaning &quot;burned wood (or the action completed), but inability to feel sexual pleasure.&quot;
meemaw deserves better
Boothany Bootano. How the hell could you diss the vocals on this thing?
the vocals are NOT THE STRONGEST? have we listened to the same album?
i hope you suffer pain from disrespecting mother like this.
Surprised this dude is still around
Any time you don‚Äôt like a female indie record you make the Lana comparisons
I feel like this album reminds me a lot of Visions era Grimes with the reverb. I think she‚Äôs an interesting newcomer but just needs to hone in on some things
u will become a daughter of cain eventually
20 bucks says he revisits this album. it will age INCREDIBLY well.
Nah, I love this - and it is not &quot;Lana&quot; at all. American Teenager is amazing and her story is inspiring. We need more people like her with authentic stories, not just phoning it in. Agree to disagree - but I just see a pattern of Fantano not liking the whole &quot;Midwest&quot; vibe.
respectfully this is a bottom 10 video you‚Äôve posted
What I will say about &quot;Preacher&#39;s Daughter&quot; is that, while it largely isn&#39;t to my taste sonically speaking, I was still extremely impressed by it overall. I had to keep reminding myself that this was a debut album by a 24-year-old and not a body of work produced by someone at least four or five albums into their career. I think the sprawling tracks, while so far out of the norm for today&#39;s albums, worked really well for the subject matter.<br><br>There are a few songs that stand out to me: Family Tree, Gibson Girl, Ptolamaea. But even though it wasn&#39;t my favourite album, I think it sounded like an instant classic and it feels like a very important album.
Decided to listen to American Teenager based on a tweet by the artist where she expressed surprise that Obama liked an &quot;anti-war, anti-patriotism&quot; song. Only to find that I couldn&#39;t understand enough of the lyrics to piece together what it&#39;s about. Feels bad man...
This album is amazing, it was a long time I wasn‚Äôt feeling this much towards an album.
I thought this album was bland on my first listen too, but I kept coming back to it. It‚Äôs an album that needs time to marinate in ur brain. The more I listened I realized this album is one of the most genius things I have ever heard, especially lyrically
fat
This album is literally a 10/10 and I NEVER rate albums that high‚Ä¶.
how you gonna give this masterpiece a 6?
u just disliked it cause ur a man honestly.....
this review made me go listen to the album and now it‚Äôs my favourite album of all time and Ethel Cain is my favourite artist, so thanks for that üñ§ 10/10 imho
its ok to be wrong ‚ù§
AOTY!
U will never recover from this
august underground is meant to depict her attempted and failed escape from logan and august underground is her sonically passing into death
men need to stop trying to like ethel cain like girl you will never understand her
my favorite album of the year.
no
this review is making me confused. I feel like we heard different albums. i connected with this album on a level I haven&#39;t felt since punisher by Phoebe bridgers. this album has everything I need in music
wrong
for a dollar give a woman a score of 8+
STAN ETHEL CAIN
one of the best albums of this year for me idc
I find it curious that with your highly analytical and technical approach to music, you find any enjoyment in music at all. Song lengths? Reverb? Who considers these things when a song speaks to them and pulls them in? It‚Äôs a timeless experience to be touched by the abstract, and I‚Äôm not fully convinced you have the capacity to be. Reducing a song to the sum of its parts and grading it like a piece of software‚Ä¶yikes‚Ä¶
Everything you said is incorrect ‚òπÔ∏è
Album of the year. 9/10. Surprised you didn&#39;t like it more tbh
This is one of the best albums of the year for me. Very surprised it didn&#39;t connect with you!
REVISIT IT.
u probably didn‚Äôt like it bc the album isn‚Äôt made for a cis straight man to relate to. üíî
A house in Nebraska is tedious in the best way imo. it&#39;s about pain and how loss can make that pain feel drawn out and never ending. like you&#39;ve been hurting you&#39;re whole life, but then you stop and realize it&#39;s only been a few days. and how it still hurts even months or years after, because even though you&#39;ve healed, what&#39;s gone is gone and you&#39;ll never get it back. pain is tedious. especially emotional pain. because it hurts more than any physical pain you can ever experience.
Sun Bleached Flies is by far my favourite
Glad to see this album get an honest review. Seen this person coming up and shocked at the fandom level.
This is my aoty without a doubt
i always respect your opinion but you make it really hard sometimes
You are a very bad man
House in Nebraska tedious? Be serious
All of ur reviews make me wish i never watched them
You just can&#39;t you connect with woman
Once again and ironically comparing it to UV as something less than maybe a high 7 to a light 8 at minimum is criminal lol
one of your worst takes everüòïüòï this album is incredible
6?!
i feel like everyone who listened to this album absolutely loved it, except the critics which is strange. i thought it was incredible and one of the best debut albums ever
I&#39;m feeling a light 3 on this review.
This is a 10/10 album.
Wrong
kinda feels like he did this just to be contrarian and get attention. like there is simply no way he genuinely believes this is a six.
Without a doubt one of my favourite albums this year, a story driven album driven by Hayden&#39;s shoegaze influences. Preachers Daughter plays like a David Lynch adaptation of a VC Andrews novel. Looking forward to the next instalment from Ethel Cain.
tough review. this is an amazing album.
As far as the two instrumentals, August Underground and Televangelism being too long: Ptolemaea freaking shook me to my core, man. Its probably the most affected I&#39;ve ever been by a song, and the following two songs, as dark and moody as they are, kinda felt like aftercare almost. They give you space to recenter, without diminishing the themes and impact of Ptolemaea.
the fact that you compared it to lana del rey just shows that you don&#39;t get it lol
It‚Äôs the best album released so far this year!
sorry but it&#39;s a 10/10
I love the album, goddess
AOTY.
House in Nebraska is so beautiful üò≠
hard disagree on this one but im still stoked you gave it a listen
this feels transphobic
Crush is so good though.
As a big fan of Ethel Cain‚Äôs previous work, I was a bit disappointed in this album and generally agreed with most of what you said. I thought her performance as a vocalist was much more profound on her Inbred EP, although like you said, the story on this album is more or less the reason to listen to it
common L
This album SLAYS
A 6???? WTF. TASTELESS
Nah. This is probably the most impressive debut of the year and is going to end up on a lot of 10-best lists. (Many - maybe most - critics have already included &quot;Preacher&#39;s Daughter&quot; in their &quot;Best of 2022 (So Far)&quot; postings of the past few weeks.) I appreciate your work and agree with many of your assessments ... but frankly this is your most wildly off-point review since your infamous &quot;light 4&quot; dismissal last year of Wolf Alice&#39;s &quot;Blue Weekend&quot;, which emerged as the 11th best album of 2021 in Metacritic&#39;s mash-up of 182 critics&#39; Top 10 lists. I wonder if there are just some genres or types of artist you just don&#39;t get - even if their work is compelling, accomplished, original and/or important. I&#39;m reminded that it took you a long time to give Lana her props - 5 long years, in fact, after she dropped her first masterpiece, &quot;Ultraviolence&quot;.  Might be time to start a rival review channel ...
‚ÄúDarker‚Äù? This is one of the darkest listens in years for me. It‚Äôs very tough to get through sometimes. The lyrics on Strangers alone are deeply disturbing and uncomfortable.
I LOVEEEEEE THIS ALBUM
It&#39;s confirmed. Cis men can&#39;t understand Lana Del Rey OR Ethel Cain.
his lazy comparison to lana del rey is just a spotlight exposing the fact that he didn‚Äôt give this album the space and attention it deserves to be appreciated.
PLEASE review the album Mother or Rose in the Dark by Cleo Sol ! Underrated artist!!
I literally met Ethel Cain at a party in Tallahassee. I only vaguely knew she made music, so it blows my mind to know I just happened upon a potential celebrity in the making
Ptolomaea is one of the scariest songs I&#39;ve heard in a long time. Listening to that in pitch darkness on the way home from my friends cabin in the woodsü§£ü§£ü§£ Excellent though, 6 is insane to me got to be at least an 8
Good ass album
No mention about western nights? That song is gorgeous
this album grows on you like a leech, i find myself coming back to it more and more im deeply obsessed<br><br>Edit:Its been a year im still listening, she put some pabst blue ribbon pussy meth into this record
Ethel is one of the best vocalist/song writers I&#39;ve heard in a very long time. To say that you&#39;d struggle to pick Ethel out of line-up, or that they are a, <i>&#39;competent enough singer,&#39;</i> is quite an understatement. I realize your review was for the latest album, but check out some of Ethel&#39;s live performances or back catalogue, they are one of the best most unique performers I&#39;ve heard in a long time.
This a good album
I&#39;ve decided after watching this review that cis men should not be allowed to listen to Ethel Cain
hey can you review MUNA by MUNA next? ü•∫
I love this album a lot, so I&#39;m glad it&#39;s getting attention, even if the attention is mixed
This record is a decent to strong 7 to me, very cool record that I&#39;m glad was covered.
the absolute worst take.... this is the aoty
It&#39;s a bit unfair to rate the album after just one listen. It definitely gets better after several listens and you also get used to the song lengths (which are appropriate for slowcore). Ethel has always rejected the wrong comparison with Lana Del Rey, it even annoys her.
You always hate the stuff I love. I don‚Äôt even think you listen more than once.
Long time watcher first time ever commenting because house in Nebraska is the least liked song?? What the fuck???
I love it. Strong 8.
Bruh how dead inside do you gotta be to give this masterpiece a 6
A 10/10 album in my opinion. Literally never been done before, and that‚Äôs saying something in modern day music.
To me, her vocals are what make her interesting. I partly agree with the criticisms. I think the best  tracks are Hard times and televangelism, and family. The production is a tad bit rough but I have found that recently vocals is what attracts me to non drum and bass music recently. Also what through a breakup in 2021 so yeah. <br> <br>I like the golden age ep the best so far. She is good, I just hope she gets big at some point even if she changes or drops the Ethel Cain persona.
AMERICAN TEENAGER NOT IN BEST TRACKS IM OUTSIDE YOUR HOUSE
She confirmed on am Instagram live on the Friday it released that the insect sound on the beginning of Ptolemaea is in fact that of bees. She justified that bees have a smoother sound than that of flies. She also confirmed that this is the first of a trilogy.
do janky star by grace ives
Absolutely adore this album, thank you for bringing it to my attention, even if I disagree with the score!
Can you review False Light by White Ward? Please and thanks
You missed so hard with this one
Are you kidding me? Just a 6 for this masterpiece? üòÇ
you sound like you didn‚Äôt want to review this album
I enjoyed the whole thing more than you did, but I still have to agree with you about the album‚Äôs length. Some moments could‚Äôve been cut out for sure, and we would have had a much more concise record.
i checked my bible and i found a verse where it says you&#39;re incorrect. god loves the sinner just not the sinüá∫üá≤‚úùÔ∏è
I haven&#39;t heard Ethel&#39;s music before. I thought it was engaging, but for an album so long it just seemed like it was a one trick pony. I have real optimism for her next album though.
if you want her to flex a lot more vocally listen to inbred bc‚Ä¶.
So the Logic interview got pulled due by YouTube, eh? üò≠üò≠üò≠ Time for artists to knock these talentless arrogant reviewers down a couple notches. Hi melon üëã
Fantano do the new white ward album, give some Ukrainian musicians some love
Should check out White Wards new album false light some jazzy blackgaze
Any score lower than an 8.5 means you have horrible taste. Periodt
ohhh you‚Äôre going to hell
Her voice and the production on the record negates a lot of the obvious aspects that could have made this forgettable and average. One of my fave discoveries this year.
For me golden age is her best album and the one that I always go back to.  I  think less is more sometimes but she is an amazing singer
Anthony, do a review on your main channel about Honestly Nevermind by Drake. That album sucks!
We don‚Äôt care. Now review the Drake album.
Broo where&#39;s that logic review we starving out here
Honestly, Nevermind.
Logic? üëÄ
Personally, I find the pacing and slow compositions part of the appeal of this album. Really emphasizing the gradual tragedies that come in the lost love, faith, and life of the narrative.
I would love to see a review of the album &#39;Baby&#39; by born without bones in case you may be interested in a video suggestion
It‚Äôs hard for me not to want to reference Lingua Ignota, bc there is a thematic element here that‚Äôs definitely consistent with her work. I shouldn‚Äôt, bc it‚Äôs unfair to Ethel (it‚Äôs unfair to most artists, as Kristin is in her own league), yet I find myself doing it after I listen to the album.. and I frankly agree with this review more than I usually agree with most reviews period, right down to the score. More than anything I think the vocals are what hurts my enjoyment, and I completely agree on the ‚Äúyes she‚Äôs talented, but I couldn‚Äôt pick her out of a lineup,‚Äù or however he put it. I‚Äôm very uninspired by that, but I‚Äôm not going to say she‚Äôs a bad vocalist, because she‚Äôs not. <br><br>I‚Äôll have to explore her music more, listen to this more, and maybe it will grow on me. Maybe she‚Äôll improve on things I‚Äôm not personally into, and I‚Äôll love some future release.. it wouldn‚Äôt shock me. For now though, it‚Äôs a lite 6 from where I‚Äôm sitting. ‚ôæ
Wait till he see drake album
I agree it doesn&#39;t hit as hard as Inbred does (you should check that out if you actually read what a 60 year old thinks) though I found it compelling listening to it completely through

ANTHONY FANTANO NEW DRAKE ALBUM REVIEW NOW PLZ
Preacher‚Äôs Daughter AOTY
Album absolutely sucks, almost fell asleep to it. There&#39;s no need for it to be so god damn long and boring
AOTY.
This review was some garbage. You should work for Pitchfork
honestly gotta thank u melon for this review, even if it is a 6. without it i probably wouldn&#39;t have ever listened to this album that i can confidently say is now one of my favorite albums of all time. ptolomaea is just otherworldly, one of the greatest songs i&#39;ve ever listened to
&quot;House in Nebraska&quot; under worst tracks?! YOU&#39;RE KILLING ME SMALLS!!
When Johnny Depp and Jeff beck release their upcoming album can you please review it
NO MELON DELETE THIS
Maybe I‚Äôm crazy but the white balance on your video seems to change quite a bit from blue to orange and back and forth. Like each cut was from a different time of day or something
I can def see where another listener may find a lack in reward for the lengthy songs. I think the narrative described in the lyrics helped keep me hooked in the absence of any big return at the end of each song. Super happy to see this one reviewed, def one of my top three albums this year so far.
listen to drakes new trash album
Common L for fantano yet again
Hey Anthony you should listen to tim bernardes&#39; sophomore album &quot;mil coisas invis√≠veis&quot;, brazilian artist that has been getting a lot of recognition for his crazy talent, he has worked with fleet foxes, badbadnotgood and devendra banhart
Next video‚Äôs gonna be interesting (honestly, Nevermind)
Where the fk did the new logic interview go
As usual, a review that completely misses the point. However, in spite of Fantano and Pitchfork,  this is and will remain one of the greatest debut album of the last decade, at least. And of one of the best of this year.  <br>Listen to it with open mind, immerse in it and you will be obsessed by the voice, the music and the story. You cannot ask for more from an album.
don&#39;t piss me off
As usually happens when someone says to me, &quot;since you like Joanna Newsom, you should check out _____,&quot; I was disappointed with this. It was boring and, I felt, uninspired, despite her obvious inspiration. &quot;Light 6&quot; is a little generous.
This gotta be my AOTY contender, I&#39;m sad you didn&#39;t connect quite as much with it as I did and other people but super glad you gave this album a review regardless with an overall positive sentiment
i disagree with you on this one. have a nice day fantano.
Would you please review a DkhaBrakha album?

Can&#39;t wait to hear your review of Westside Boogies new album that released today
I&#39;m honestly &#39;okay&#39; with your review considering you didn&#39;t totally trash it as I was afraid you&#39;d do it. Personally, this is one of the most enjoyable albums I&#39;ve heard over the past years. I&#39;m kind of disappointed you didn&#39;t mention THOSE OUTROS on every song. They give that ecstatic experience that are amplified by the pacing and definitely justify it. She just created that cinematic world that you dive in when listening to this album and rarely albums I&#39;ve heard do the same.
review the drake album melon.

She has a lot of potential
Prolemaea is honestly such an amazing track. I wish the album would have focus more on that darker side, as you said.
Why have you not reviewed the new Fontaines D.C. record yet? It&#39;s been out for a while now.
great video, I think I will bring this format to my channel too
Dont care drake dropped
I personally liked it a lot. To me the album felt very ambitious for a debut, many singers can‚Äôt get to this level even after many dropped albums under their belt, so it was quite impressive.
BRO WHYYYYYY????? it‚Äôs literally aoty

Drank new album strong 10?
STAY AWAY FROM HER WEIRD BALD MAN. You will pay for your sins.
I was hoping she would return was something that matched the energy of American Teenager, but that track kind of became a tonal one off for the album.
I noticed the absence of the yellow flannel in the thumbnail and knew this is gonna be one of the days where he has a wrong opinion
I don‚Äôt really see that she‚Äôs going for ‚Äòhorror‚Äô necessarily, but more the solemn tragedy behind the horror that happened. Also, House in Nebraska is my favourite.
AOTY for me until Caroline Polachek drops her sophomore LP!
Good review.
WHAT? 6?
This album is an easy 9/10, thoroughfare is probably my favorite song of the year. I can‚Äôt fucking believe you didn‚Äôt necessarily like this
you‚Äôre tripping, it‚Äôs one of the best albums of 2022

A house in Nebraska, Hard times, and Thoroughfare were the best. I actually listened to this right after Mr Morale and that night did NOT disappoint. That night also had Florence, Quelle Chris, and The Smile, and I loved all those albums
i absolutely adore this album, it‚Äôs close to AOTY for me
awesome. the album is a 10.
i discovered her music not too long ago, so i was pretty stoked that you reviewed her album!! it‚Äôs a personal favorite of mine but i understand your views and thoughts on it
PET FOX - A face in your life <br>out today
Yeah i disagree but it‚Äôs cool you covered the album on your channel, giving her a platform. <br>She‚Äôs got magic and is a true artist.
Hey Anthony, not sure if you‚Äôve listened to their music at all but please check out the new Mt Joy album. Would love to hear your thoughts on it
For me AOTY<br>And AHIN its SOTY just like sunbleached flies<br>Both songs got me SOBBING (still) <br>I connected a lot with AHIN, and thats sad
you‚Äôll regret this melon man
hey anthony you should check out shearwater&#39;s new album
YOU WILL REGRET TGIS ANTHONY !!
Seeing you not enjoy this album to the same degree i did definitely cracked my heart a bit, but in the end i do enjoy that you took your time to cover it nontheless, for me it&#39;s definitely my album of the year personally and hope you get to enjoy her future projects since she really is one to look out for.
Please try and get the album cover in focus next time, Anthony.
Where is the Honestly, Nevermind review?? smh...
She working with abuser
a house in nebraska is literally the best song. tasteless.
Its sounds like a lot of things, pulling from artists like Boniver and maybe Lana Del Rey (imo). It manages to not stand out from what already exists.<br><br>Edit: lol should have waited like 2mins to comment, mr fantano basically said what I thought.
Nah. Give me a broken, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do anything to keep you‚Äù type of girl. She nailed this.
Hey Anthony I know you have been busy but I would love to hear your thoughts on Alanis Morissette&#39;s new album that just dropped an hour ago! I think you will be very surprised. Much love! ‚ù§Ô∏è
could not care less what you have to say about the project just bc Ive never aligned with your opinions on anything other than Sawayama but I am still grateful to see the big youtube reviewers are catching onto Hayden&#39;s art and reviewing it. I never see trans artists discussed anywhere aside from Arca, and I&#39;m grateful if we are talking about trans art it&#39;s something as compelling as Ethel Cain.
A house in nebraska being the least fav...
Honestly you all should be thankful he gave it a 6 because watching the review, from his overall tone I felt he‚Äôd give it a 4 or so. He essentially shit on nearly the entire album outside of its narrative lol
I didn&#39;t know Ethan Klein dropped an album
If this was Andrew Wiggins performance in the NBA finals you would&#39;ve given this a 10
go listen her song Mondays! iykyk üòâ
awful review
Yeah nah, sorry but you took too long chump, i already formed an opinion and its a 9 üòé
A House In Nebraska is literally one of the best songs what the fuck
thoroughfare is one of the best slow burners I‚Äôve ever heard
constantly proving your lack of taste im afraid
Man, Anthony is NOT gonna be happy listening to LaDonda by Logic
6 ain&#39;t it chief. But you do you.
Epic
Hey, what about new Thornhill - Heroine album?
Hey Fantano you should review coast contra‚Äôs latest album
bald head
can critics stop comparing ethel to lana del rey üò≠ as if lana could ever come up with such a genius body of work as this
best album of the year
Was really surprised to hear that you found ‚ÄúA House In Nebraska‚Äù not justified by its length. AHIN &amp; Thoroughfare are my two top songs of the year. I‚Äôve listened countless times to both and I get lost in them every time. Still glad that you made time to listen to this album, though!! Keep covering Ethel Cain!
I remember seeing this girl around Tumblr
Yes melon
Should‚Äôve been lower
Maybe you would have enjoyed it more if it was named &quot;To Pimp a Preacher&#39;s Daughter&quot;
Let&#39;sthony Gotano? LET&#39;STHONY GOTANO? He is a mad genius.
I CANT BELIEVE YOU BURNED DOWN THAT HOUSE IN NEBRASKA. SHE DESERVED LOVE.
Your description of this album makes it sound like soft girl core Lingua Ignota
a house in nebraska is a good track, tony. i‚Äôm sorry you disagree.
This review is a hate crime
I mostly agree, with the exception of the closing track being boring for the first half. Sure, the instrumentation isn&#39;t all that interesting, but the vocal melodies are really emotive and intriguing, especially in the chorus. I really like the backing harmonies she does.
1. Finally.<br>2. Wrong. <br>3. Thank you for at least reviewing it.
Since YouTube removed the dislikes, we‚Äôll never see the 250 likes to 2000 dislikes ratio.
Use me as a dislike button
Me patiently waiting for a Ethel Cain review : üòå<br>Me when my aoty is given a 6 : ü•≤
Even if people disagree, you have to respect Anthony giving an honest opinion instead of going with the &quot;this album is amazing&quot; majority.
No idea who this artist even is, but thanks to this vid popping up on my notifications I&#39;ll probably be checking them out. Seems interesting
It was a 7.5 for me but hey, I don&#39;t put 1/100th the thought into the music I listen to.
Is this cottagecore Lingua Ignota?
10/10<br><br>review it again
I thought it was a bit better than the review, but shit I&#39;m glad she&#39;s getting it. Great record
this man is a nemesissss
wilco
A House in Nebraska doesn&#39;t deserve that treatment
this is my personal aoty for me. the expansive songs with the very molasses-y production really paint suburban/rural america in an incredibly vivid manner, i love it to bits. the narrative and lyrics on tracks may be stereotypical but i think that was her intention: she‚Äôs trying to illuminate the universal experience in these places while simultaneously depicting her incredibly harrowing narrative. she juxtaposes the two very nicely. it‚Äôs very reminiscent of joni mitchell‚Äôs ‚Äúhejira‚Äù which is also one of my fav records
to anyone who&#39;s only hearing about this album now: just remember to listen to it yourself at least once!
slowcore is becoming too underrated these days, and this is coming from a nightcore person
Will you review ‚ÄúBedroom Demos‚Äù by Owyn Davis next or soon please ??
So curious to hear your opinion on new black midi track. Hopefully tomorrow for New Music Friday. My new fav song from my fav band!
I really feel like Ethel does a fantastic job in justifying those 6-7 minute long tracks that you feel aren‚Äôt as justified. Her storytelling abilities through her music slowly made me crave her longer tracks in a way no other artist has done. But i‚Äôm glad you covered her album, she deserves all the recognition in the world :)
Not every girl from the south has to be Lingua, Tony. Expand
10 outta 10! review it againnnnnnn
The album cover is a 10/10 though
Yeah absolutely not. This clearly went over your head and it‚Äôs not for you.
anthont fantano you will never be famous
Love this record.  So glad it&#39;s getting more coverage even if it&#39;s not as positive as I&#39;d like to see
As someone who adores this album, I was a bit sad to see it didn‚Äôt connect with you, but that‚Äôs okay! I feel like this record‚Äôs production, story, and aesthetic hit harder for those of us that grew up with religious trauma ‚Äî especially if you‚Äôre queer and/or trans. Glad to see that she‚Äôs getting some attention on your channel tho!
a 6??
A review where I get where you‚Äôre coming from but I vehemently disagree with.
One of the albums of all time
nahhhhh this album is perfect, big time disagree
Ethan Kleins dyslexic band
We don&#39;t care its 10/10
Love love love this album
sorry fantano you&#39;re but i already formed an opinion and this album is 10/10
Definitely disagree with you but ecstatic you actually reviewed her album.
Personally, I find the pacing and slow compositions part of the appeal of this album. Really emphasizing the gradual tragedies that come in the lost love, faith, and life of the narrative.
Melon head, where&#39;s your review of Zach Bryan&#39;s &quot;American Heartbreak&quot;?
A house in Nebraska in least fav tracks I have to laugh
during pride month? you just sealed your grave melon
American Teenager is definitely one of the best pop songs of the year
Good review Anthony, but you only gave this a 6 because she blocked you on twitter 3 years ago
I mean that‚Äôs fine I didn‚Äôt think you‚Äôd love it
I definitely agree with this review. This album seemed right up my alley and all my friends loved it and are hyping it up as the best album of the year but I found it so lacking in terms of production. The reverbs literally bored me so much because there was nothing distinctive to catch my ear
Would have been a ten if it was called Preacher&#39;s Daughters
whack rating
brain rot
I‚Äôm just happy this got a review, Anthony :)
L rating
i genuinely cant believe u didn‚Äôt like this..
i will throw tomatoes
9/10 review it again
L
Oh shit, u dead
Bru
I kinda wish it was darker too....Ptolemaea is one of my favorites
&quot;least fave track: House in Nebraska&quot;<br>SEEK HELP
Crowdfunding for melon to get his eyes fixed because he be reversing 9s a lot
Glad you&#39;re covering Ethel Cain, even if it isn&#39;t a glowing review. I feel similarly as a fan of the overall style and aesthetic (adored the God&#39;s Country video) but not totally into the actual compositions of the songs on this album. Very glad if it&#39;s done more for others though!
how‚Äôd you drop this while you‚Äôre on stream with logic
Remember when I asked you to review the album? Yeah, delete this video‚Ä¶
Day 228 of commenting until Let&#39;sthony Gotano reviews Carriage House by Woodward and Parker
How tf is house in Nebraska ur least fav track???
Hey tony! Haven‚Äôt started the review yet but I can already let you know that I‚Äôm going to cyber bully you eternally!
never mention ethel again u incel bye.
I had a strong feeling he wasn&#39;t going to love this one lol
A House in Nebraska being the worst track is why there will be riots in the street
Finally early to a video and I can‚Äôt think of a single overused meme to comment. What a shame.
Hi there! FASTONY FASTANO here!
So cool to see this, been a fan of hers since 2019, when Golden Age came out. I will agree I thought this album could&#39;ve been stronger, and there are some songs that really don&#39;t need to be as long as they need to (...thoroughfare...)
I‚Äôm so happy you‚Äôve checked her out finally!!
What an interesting sequel to YGTUT&#39;s Preacher&#39;s Son
If this was called ‚ÄúCome home, preacher, your daughter misses you‚Äù you would‚Äôve given it a 10/10
Badthony Taketano
wrong
Anthony, we get it, you only gave this a 6 because it has the word &quot;preacher&quot; in it. We get it Melon, you&#39;re an atheist!
Do you see banana man?
Uh oh
american teenager song of the summer
You&#39;re bold fantano
U cant give this album a 6 just cuz you&#39;d prefer it&#39;d be named devil&#39;s daughter melon..
A 6? Cmon man. This album is absolutely incredible and so different and unique. This is straight up like some southern metal Lana del ray stuff
Former Southern Baptist, huh‚Ä¶. Sounds very interesting üßê
it&#39;s okay if you didn&#39;t like the album fantano but you didn&#39;t have to call her all those transphobic slurs
ok
I thought it was really great, but yeah definitely a little too slow. Super excited to hear more from her though!
melon hella
Watch him give Drake‚Äôs new album a 3-4/10üò≠
Too slow Anthony, I already formed my opinion on this one
Album of the Year
ratio + AOTY
drake
Yeah but if it was called Preacher‚Äôs Melon it‚Äôd be a 10/10
SECOND
slay
FORTNITE
i‚Äôm convinced u only reacted this cuz i kept commenting it and i‚Äôm not up for debate
Thought this was another Morale review
If it was called Melon&#39;s Daughter, you would&#39;ve given it a 10 Anton.
WHO EVE NIS THIS GUY?
Vibez
Huh? How üòÇ
where my gibson girls at
Ethel Cain twitch interview when?
Oh they aren‚Äôt gonna like this one, Tony‚Ä¶
FINALLY
FINALLY SHE IS BEING REALIZEDDDDD
He took a while to review this
best album of the year
Vdd
