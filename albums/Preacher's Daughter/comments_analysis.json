Of course we fell in love and he let me go but I came back to him because our love was so strong. After I came back he morphed into Anthony Fantano and then I proceeded to give him hell for rating this album 6/10. One of the best dreams I‚Äôve ever had.",

        "original_comment": "Okay, I&#39;m not going to open up and flame you for your opinion; you&#39;re absolutely entitled to it, even if I find it thin. I&#39;m a metalhead for most of my life, so I know all too well what it&#39;s like to have my music ridiculed, berated, and outright vilified. I also understand that not all music is for everyone, and tastes and styles resonate differently. That said, I, like most other commenters here, find the Lana Del Rey comparison a bit lazy and short-sighted. I myself feel that the over-opulence of Del Rey doesn&#39;t come close to the Ethel Cain pantheon, but I digress so as not to sound like an over-zealous fan boy. I&#39;m far too old for that. However, I also agree that, as a few have said here, Ethel Cain could well be the voice that music has been pleading for in the last few years.  I&#39;m sure most of the fan base defending her here would call me a boomer old fart, and that&#39;s okay, too - I paid my dues to the music scene enough to know what I like, love and dislike, and I can appreciate their passion and defense of their artist and, in some cases, the voice for the more silent sufferers of traumas untold. They have found their champion and they love her for her honest, painful stories, fictionalized or not, hence such vehement defense. In the only sphere I&#39;d even mention Ethel Cain in the same sentence as Taylor Swift, I will state that both fan bases are insanely protective of and devoted to their chosen artist. For me, Ethel Cain provides far more substance than a messy Swiftie broken love affair (or several, as it were), but I digress again - she has her thing, Cain has hers. This adoration is what happens when an artist speaks to and for you in ways you never could or even would. She&#39;s a generational anomaly to be lauded, Ms. Cain, and she will be if she keeps up this pace as Preacher&#39;s Daughter belies. <br><br>As a metalhead yourself (assuming such from the ND shirt you&#39;re wearing), maybe this record just wasn&#39;t your bag, and I can dig that. I&#39;ve seen people more attuned to your channel and history that lay claims you&#39;re purposefully harder on women artists, and I won&#39;t assume that or poke at it as I simply don&#39;t know, but I do feel maybe you&#39;d like the totality of the piece if you gave it another listen or two. If not, all well and good. But I do find it interesting that the nuances you find critical and / or clich√© are the same attributes extreme metal was built upon, right down to the minimalist production values to the long, drawn-out &#39;epics&#39; that are supposedly for &#39;atmosphere and effect&#39;. That aside, the lyrics / subject matter isn&#39;t as in your face as the ridiculously cartoonish Cannibal Corpse (a band I also enjoy), but Ethel Cain paints stark portraits that would reduce some of those bands to tears. Again, it&#39;s all preference and taste, but I simply found it odd, some of the criticisms your levied at this album, a personal 9/10 for me.       <br><br>Allow me to take up a bit more space to defend one thing, if not for you, then for some men...SOME. I&#39;ve read some comments here, and, to paraphrase, &quot;men shouldn&#39;t be allowed opinions or to listen to Ethel Cain&quot;. Again, I don&#39;t know your personal history on your channel, and I will be watching more of your videos to see what else you&#39;ve reviewed out of natural curiosity, but I think it&#39;s unfair to classify all of us men as clueless automatons unable to appreciate a woman&#39;s suffering and voice. Sure, the misogyny and outright bigotry runs rampant in the music industry (and in most areas, come to think of it), but I&#39;ll only say that you gave Cain&#39;s record an honest review as you saw it, and assuming you&#39;re not on a one-man crusade to bring down the voices of women everywhere, all men shouldn&#39;t be reduced to such disgusting criteria. I&#39;m a 52-year old straight, white, metalhead that has seen, heard and done it all, and some of us can actually hear Hayden&#39;s messages here and appreciate and applaud them, as well as the base she&#39;s reaching. I&#39;m glad to call myself an Ethel Cain fan, and I&#39;m not least bit ashamed to defend Hayden when the closed-minded assholes in and outside the metal community come blasting their insipidities. I&#39;ve always loved music and artists that touch me and show integrity and honesty; Ethel Cain represents that, and this album is a bit of genius to my ears, but, as I said oh so long ago in this booklet I left here, we&#39;re all different. <br><br>Give her older material a listen, man - she&#39;s got a very distinct voice both sonically and intuitively. Thanks for reviewing her and giving it a small push, despite it not hitting you as it has others.",

The blood curdling scream plus the overall arrangement being the most horrifying on the album is what makes it special. The whole album doesn&#39;t need to be that dark. If anything, I would say a full understanding of this album&#39;s plot is what really gave me chills, not necessarily the production&#39;s darker moments. The lyrics really shine through.",
