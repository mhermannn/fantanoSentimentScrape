bro just say sorry
Macadelic was underrated too
Pandering of the highest order
giving it a 8 bc he died will never not be funny
A 3 was ridiculous
now he need to do a redux on The Divine Feminine. He didnt give that album a fair review and score
This album review is wack. Don‚Äôt even review my music in the first place if you don‚Äôt appreciate my music when I was alive. <br><br>It seems cynical for Fantano to review a Mac Miller project that deals with substance abuse and he didn‚Äôt feel the lyrical content of Mac‚Äôs issues being authentic when he first reviewed the album but his struggles of substance abuse was only authentic after he died. <br><br>It‚Äôs offensive and disingenuous to review Mac Miller album positively after his death cause u never cared for the struggles this man was going through when he was alive. <br><br>And that‚Äôs the problem with Fantano, hes bias and judgmental. Fantano refused to review Kanye‚Äôs album based on offensive things he said, reviewed XXXtentacion‚Äôs music harshly due to his legal issues, ignorantly called Lil Baby a Young Thug clone until he released The Bigger Picture and had some many other bias ways he reviews music &amp; artists.<br><br>Fantano ignorantly put Mac Miller in a category of a Frat boy rapper like a Asher Roth but he evolved from that but he couldn‚Äôt get away from his prejudices no matter how Mac evolved through the times. <br><br>The problem with Fantano is that he‚Äôs bias, ignorant, judgmental and not objective about music especially hip hop music, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs hard to take his reviews seriously
If Mac was still alive he wouldn&#39;t have changed his review
I didn‚Äôt like his slower stuff either at first.  Now I can‚Äôt get enough of it.
this is only because he died and u cant convince me
This is the moment I realized that Fantano just says whatever could get him the most engagement. Ain&#39;t no way you&#39;re gonna tell me that bro dying made you realize that his album was actually good üòÇüòÇ so corny.
Fair points. But please. Don‚Äôt try to sing.
Swimming was like a memoir
Ladders is an incredible song. That song alone makes this album a 9  in my opinion.
One of the most emotional albums that will hit your soul every time. Glad you saw the light and appreciated this album. Rest In Peace Malcolm.
Remember when Anthony gave this album a 3 while making fun of it for 5 minutes
It is an 8 minimum so I‚Äôm glad Mellon made the right choice in reduxing his review. A 3 is just too low on the original. Even if you aren‚Äôt a fan of Mac, the production value alone of swimming, mixed with Mac‚Äôs flow, emotional creative concepts intertwined together makes this an 8+. I‚Äôd give it a 9. It‚Äôs crazy how many parallels there was between his life &amp; death, the joy he gave hip hop people and general while also fighting substance abuse. You can feel and hear his mind coming together to make something spectacularly sad but healing for others who can relate. Mac is a legend. Rip.
we finally won
Perfecto being the least favorite track is insanity
Everyone talking about how it‚Äôs a good redux review. He gave it a 8 it should be infinity out of 10, greatest album of all time
massive W, Mr. Melon. I strongly disagreed with your initial review
Just a tad late buckaroo
This album will always have a special place in my heart
I‚Äôve been waiting for this for 5 years. I was an avid watcher of fantano back then and swimming was the only review where I felt he was genuinely talking out of his ass in some of his commentary. There was a lack of genuine criticism mostly just personal anecdotes and insults. Seriously go back and watch, one of his worst reviews. Whereas previously when he negatively reviewed an album that I liked I could see where he was coming from and he made good points. I think the maturity and contrast on this redux shows the beauty, eeriness, sadness, and importance of swimming. It‚Äôs an album that seriously keeps getting better with time. And not just because of Macs passing. It was one of those weird albums that you just don‚Äôt understand upon first listen. It‚Äôs definitely in my top 5 for that year though. Listening to it after his death felt like he was talking to us from beyond the grave. He communicated his headspace so well. It felt like such a down to earth performance. It felt like he was pouring his heart out while simultaneously spitting some of the most cold shit I‚Äôve ever heard but all while sounding super relaxed like he was recording while laying back in a recliner. There‚Äôs just nothing else like that album. For me this album is a 9 but bumping it up to an 8 after giving it a 3 just makes me so happy. This is the review Mac deserved.
Unpopular opinion prolly but I think this entire thing&#39;s pretty fuckin weird... I mean it basically took bro death for you to appreciate this album, its contexts and themes, and really care bc you did a whole 180. cuz a 3 to an 8 is pretty wild. yeah I might just be being a bitch but ion really care. at least you&#39;re able to see its greatness now
now redo divine feminine, you&#39;re biggest gripe about it was that it fell short because of the &quot;neo jazz rap&quot; trend at the time, but i find that unfair as a basis, and as that he legit just wanted to make a album exploring love.
2009 wasn&#39;t even in your Favorite tracks...god you still dont get it.
I don‚Äôt understand how, if this man claims to be so musically intelligent, how a rating can alter that much from initial listen. How much of the change of opinion was accredited to the Mac Miller fan base engagement on the previous video??
My fav album
Finally.
Did he mention Dunno? This is probably my favorite song on the album, although I although I listen to the whole thing from start to finnish.
How the hell is he not even going to mention Come Back To Earth?
Yes
It&#39;s shocking and almost comical to watch who is probably the most relevant music reviewer in the online space to be this spineless and backpedalling.<br><br>You didn&#39;t like the album, gave it a way below mediocre rating, the artist died, now it gets an excellent rating.<br><br>Whatever you or I think of the album or Mac doesn&#39;t matter, this shit is disgusting. Needless to say if he hadn&#39;t died this video would not have happened.
Fuck this guy. Trying to fool loyal Mac Miller fans into watching his fake positive review now that it‚Äôs popular to like Mac. So convenient that he has had such a change of heart since the album first released.
Just like a circle, I go back where I‚Äôm from ‚Ä¶.
I feel like it‚Äôs not fair to review an album in a week, it‚Äôs just impossible to truly digest.  Honestly all reviewers (in all areas of art) should take a longer time to review, because they‚Äôre reviews are rushed just for the algorithm.<br><br>Months to years are put into art like this and you just know how good it is in a week somehow‚Ä¶ ok
So I think you should shut your mouth because you obviously know nothing when it comes to meaning of lyrics, or POV. Ik you‚Äôre trying to fit a personality but you aren‚Äôt what your ego says.
People are fucking crazy. It&#39;s an opinion, not an attempt at an objective statement. People treat Anthony like he&#39;s some objective marker, whether they like him or not.
Anthony, you can‚Äôt just improve your review by THIS much by reassuring us that ‚Äúthe feet grew  on me‚Äù. Enough is enough.
Now do Red Light Redux and give it at least a 7
Thoughts on the sonf &quot;Wings&quot;?
back peddling, the movie.
You know what? Credit to Melon for going back and fixing his review, but honestly, this is why critics like Fantano will always be mediocre and full of nonsense to me. It&#39;s a total lack of integrity when someone goes back on what they said previously about an album and changes their opinion due to its creator&#39;s passing. Contextualizing Mac&#39;s struggles with depression shouldn&#39;t change an album review score. The album was great then, and it&#39;s great now. This is something you see time and again with films too ‚Äî where people initially give an incredibly negative review of a film like Kubrick&#39;s Clockwork Orange or Full Metal Jacket, and then change their tune because it has become more popular or is better appreciated over time. It&#39;s lazy criticism and speaks to the lack of honesty among some critics. It should be remembered that art shouldn&#39;t be judged differently due to passing life events, but rather on its own merits. Again, appreciate that he went back and changed the score, but don&#39;t be lazy. Be honest.
Please do a redux review of Divine Feminine. It deserves better than that 4.
Mac will always be the greatest <br>multi-talented instrumentalist/rapper/musician of our generation. thEEEEEEE GOAT.<br>      John Mayer also on the guitar for Small Worlds‚Ä¶.‚úåÔ∏è<br> Mayer also covered Small Worlds Live in concert‚Ä¶dedicated to Mac. <br>He showed up at Mac‚Äôs crib to just listen to music. Didn‚Äôt even bring a guirtar.. heard small worlds and use one of Mac‚Äôs guitars to make the riffs for the final product. Legendary.
the newest comments here cement to me the fact that people are no longer used to other people changing their opinions now and then. thats apparently become such a foreign concept, which is so weird to think about honestly
Idk 2009 was my favourite track
This really made me loose respect for Melon, to me keeping your opinions even if unpopular should be the ultimate job of a critic, to go from a 3 to an 8 just seems like you went ‚Äúof shit my fan base loves him and he died so I need to pander to them‚Äù
I feel like this review isn‚Äôt genuine,not to the fault of your own Anthony.
Fake
I personally feel like 2009 is an underated track in the album.
wow i just saw this
Re-review of Jawbreaker‚Äôs ‚ÄòDear You‚Äù. I‚Äôd love to hear it. That album went from straight up trashed to highly revered
So glad i saw that &quot;whats my worst take&quot; i dont hate you anymore(yes I do) xoxo
Anthony fraudtano is a sentient Che Guevara t-shirt
Im still dont buying this shit, an apologize would be better
I can‚Äôt believe that it was originally rated so low, context or not, going into it deeply or not, it‚Äôs such a pleasantly sounding album, even at a surface level.
ALBUM IS A TEN
Time for a Circles redux from a strong 8 to a strong ‚ôæÔ∏è
Yup this is on point album was great
Melon Culpa.
I knew you were gonna pull this bs the moment I saw you bawling at Good News. Took ya long enough phony
The song 2009 blew my mind
Funny how he couldn‚Äôt stand how ‚Äúboring‚Äù this album and the divine feminine were, and now he‚Äôs completely changed his tune after Mac‚Äôs passing
Best redux you‚Äôve ever made
Honestly i knew he was gonna like it
wearing your dancing shoes for that walk back? i appreciate the acknowledgement but the damage was done.
So this guy just redoes his reviews when the popular consensus ends up disagreeing with him? If Mac was still alive this video would not exist, this man is a cancer on music discourse.
If you ever did drugs and your ever made music‚Ä¶ this is a fucking 20‚Ä¶ get your little 8 out of here
This dropped right when astroworld did, and because I was such a Travis fanboy at the time and wasn‚Äôt at all familiar with Mac‚Äôs music, I admittedly didn‚Äôt even give this album the time of day when it released. I‚Äôm kind of embarrassed to admit that I only gave it a listen after he died, but when I finally did, it was love at first listen. I had a horrible episode of depression in 2019 as a senior in high school, and music was one of the only things that brought me any sort of joy in my life. This album was a large part of that joy. I related to its themes and emotional content deeply. Smoking boof dab cart and driving around listening to ladders is one of my favorite memories of that time. I just wish I had been musically open minded enough to be a fan while he was still alive, because he was so awesome. At least he left us with this beautiful work of art.
This made me feel good inside. Blocked and reported.
This isn‚Äôt cool you can keep this shit. If Mac was still alive this album would‚Äôve never got a redux review
THANK GOD
While mac&#39;s death do bring new perspectives to the album, this review didn&#39;t seem catered to that, it felt like a genuine growth and view on old things
His lowkey, raspy and quiet vocals are part of what make the album what it is.
Godbless u I actually like u now
A 3 to an 8 makes me question your integrity on the original review. Thats such a drastic opinion shift.
Do a rereview of 2014 by cole
so it sucked when he was alive???
This is dope.  I&#39;m glad you got to have a better experience with this album. I think its one of his best albums, up there with Faces and Watching Movies With The Sound Off. His NPR performance is so good. The way he performs 2009 and what&#39;s the use sounds way better live than the album version
It sounds like he needed to die for you to understand
That‚Äôs more like it
His next redux review‚Ä¶ he gives chances the big day a 10/10 üòÇ
Yeah I feel like this was just to keep face based on the first review
That‚Äôs crazy how much  he likes it now
cant believe I haven&#39;t seen this yet lol I remember being unreasonably offended at the go negative review, it blew my mind,  this is nice to see. RIP Mac
For Anthony to go from a 3 to this score - goes to show you should never take Melon‚Äôs reviews too hard if you‚Äôre a fan or artist üëçüèª
bro acting like he ain‚Äôt give it a 3 the first time around, fuck outa here
about goddamn time melonhead
This review has killed your credibility, it&#39;s just bad practice as a critic. You have clearly shown bias because an artist has died. It&#39;s the most pathetic attempt at careerism I&#39;ve ever seen.
giving it a 3 at first and then after years an 8 makes me question if there really is any rating method
Take this L brah. Mac&#39;s album was always great regardless of your dumbass opinion üòÇ
House of Balloons should get a Redux Review imo. Even if your opinon hasn&#39;t changed, I&#39;d be interested to see how you view it in light of how huge and influential he has become.
FACES also need a redux review.
Circles Redux soon?
Forget about MBDTF. This is the good ending right here.
Ok now do The Divine Feminine
Yah the original review for this was so far off. Hard 8/10
how on earth did u rate it so low the first time?
Sad Mac didnt get to see this
redemption.
You know full well its mediocre music Anthony, this is such a spineless move from you.
This prolly was his best record...
I&#39;m glad that after all these years the album grew on you. I went from thinking it was decent to loving it, cool to see you love it as well :)
took you long enough.
Finally you did justice for this album. No lie I was kind of mad and disappointed at your first review of this because it was such a raw classic that he never got to fully depict the narrative around it himself. Plus for it to be his last album and they way you chopped it up in your first review üò¢. I‚Äôm glad you finally gave it another chance. Mac was changing right before our eyes even tho we will never get a full thoughtful project. Easy Mac with the Cheesy raps will forever have the greatest evolution in music history. I still wish he was here üòîüò¢. Rip Mac üôèüèæ
I forgive you Anthony.
I honestly think all these mac reduxs are cringey af cuz like. Bruh. you just had it out for Mac and should chill w negative comments on other peoples art in general cuz like god forbid Drake dies smothered in hoes and you‚Äôre like damn. Maybe he was smothered in Hoes.
1/10 dirt feet cover
Swimming one of the greatest hip hop albums ever made. There&#39;s nothing else like it.
This is my favourite album, just cuz of the unique sound you can find anywhere else, and also Just the album that got me into macs music, I legit had a fit when Anthony gave it a 2 before, I&#39;m glad he reduxed it, RIP Mac You&#39;ll forever be my biggest inspiration
Insane that you gave this a 3 when it came out. I fell in love with it immediately. Happy you did the Redux but I also hope that you take this as a lesson and listen to stuff a little more and with a more open mind for a couple of listens. It wasn&#39;t bad in the past either you probably just didn&#39;t give it the time nor the attention needed to appriciate the bars and his struggle in this album. It&#39;s a beautiful piece and hard wrenching at the same time. Timeless art none the less. To give this a 3 was your biggest L. But from watching the video it seems like you agree with that.
Thank you Anthony we can be friends again
lil ugly mane - oblivion access needs a well deserved redo. Definitely your biggest L after this
in oblivion, yeah yeah
still so many people mad in the comments its pretty sad honestly.
Too late shithead, I hate the ‚Äònow that they‚Äôre dead, their work means so much more‚Äô mentality.  This album spoke to who it spoke to the very day it came out and we were all still rocking it that morning when we heard the news.  This, circles, and most of Mac‚Äôs later works spoke to us in ways that gave a voice to our struggles, as many as they are, as well as a shining light.  Most dope ‚Äò92-infinity.
You‚Äôre overdosing on  your<br> entitlement.
Buy or wash your shirt
You keep saying lazy
I make 0 dollars a day. I‚Äôve been homeless and unemployed for the better part of a year now. I used to seek you out for solace. I‚Äôve never felt so entirely opposed up until now. Smile and buy some more flannels. Fuck your discourse, because it‚Äôs valid and shortsighted in regards to the artists who actually make the shit. <br><br>Get your check tho
It‚Äôs easier for you do delve back into this project now. <br><br>Be an artist and not a gatekeeper on bullshit.
Have you ever taken Heroine, Anthony? <br><br>Perfecto involved a drug addiction vocal performance. You have to get the fuck away from what matters and that‚Äôs the culture. Step down. Fucking A
Do you do drugs? Speak on addiction and your dead friends. That or you‚Äôre entitled and sheltered and shielded and self righteous as fuck.
Suddenly, Anthony? Nothing about this is sudden aside from your realization about this record. Mac wouldn‚Äôt have ever co-signed your platform. Shouts out to Mac and my dead homies. You‚Äôre a cultural cuck. Don‚Äôt flag me for speaking so much truth please and your smile doesn‚Äôt matter because I frown over the role you occupy and have created for yourself.
pipoqueiro tu √© um pipoca
2009 not on your fav is crazy
Thanks man
I&#39;ve needed this.
It‚Äôs a 10/10 album and there‚Äôs really no reason it should be anything else. It‚Äôs creative, artistic, deep, produced great, and an intimate album overall. You can feel the honesty and connection Mac put into this project. He proved so much with this. Ever giving it a bad review is unjustifiable.
RIP MAC
FINALLY CAME TO YOUR SENSES
I think So It Goes deserves more love when talking about Mac Miller‚Äôs best songs. Such a moving and mellow outro that feels like it encapsulates all of the sounds and themes of Swimming. I can‚Äôt think of a more perfect way to end the album. The synths at the end add just enough grandiosity too. This album is subtle and somber because Mac was in a depressive and hopeless state. He knew he was on a downward spiral soon to face a tragic end.
2009 is my favourite song of all time, this album has a special place in my heart
if it was death grips you would have given it an 8
Justice has been served
I hope this may serve as a reminder to let art speak for itself.
Come back to earth one of the most beautiful songs ever. not even exaggerating. still the only song to bring tears to my eyes besides the og naruto ost tracks.
rip mac we miss you
Melon just wanted to clear his image cus bloke&#39;s dead
Surprised you didn‚Äôt comment on how the album opens. Come back to earth has got to be one of the best openers of all time imo
i think so it goes is the most complete mac miller song
need a redux review on psychodrama
Rate of 8, and thats great
Jet Fuel may be one of the best songs ever made iykyk
Thanks for the redux review I can now listen to the album and like it
Swimming came out in a time in my life when I really needed it. Thank you, Mac.
Honestly, I‚Äôll start watching your videos again now. Thank you for clearing that one up ü§ôüèª
Pure Art üéâ
Never forGET CARDI B WON BEST HIP HOP ALBUM OVER SWIMMING, ASTROWORLD, AND VICTORY LAP. GRAMMY&#39;S ARE A JOKE.
You looking for a good singing voice shows you still don&#39;t get it. It&#39;s mac&#39;s unique vulnerable voice that makes him so relatable and draws you in. This isn&#39;t about being the best singer you goof.
Shows you never gave it the proper chance in the first place ...now its an 8/10...lol your credibility is a joke.
Disliked the video still. But I forgive you. All peace and love.
you missed the chance to say &quot;swimthony pooltano&quot; in the intro
10/10 album idgaf what anyone says
Crazy that this is just an example of no one cares until you die
Can you review React-Redux?
The first review was better
Redo cartis WLR after touring and everything I want to hear new thoughts
FINALLY A W
his greatest sin has been corrected
Character development at its finest ü•Ç
He really caved in cause the guy is dead. I guess the next XXXTentacion redux reviews will be 10s
Ladders changed my life
Don‚Äôt forget he first gave it a 3/10 and gave ice spice a 5/10 WTF?!
Ok so let‚Äôs just say it like it is, he didn‚Äôt like this album when Mac was alive but now that‚Äôs he‚Äôs dead hes listened to it again and yes, he does like the album. üôÑ <br>I‚Äôd just like to note that Swimming was nominated for a Grammy so clearly it was never macs ‚Äúworst yet‚Äù like he said at the end‚Ä¶and it was nominated before mac died, not after.
W
Finally fixed it
L reveiw. its a 10
the redemption has cometh. yes
mac is such an amazing artistüíï
Yes Anthony, Just yes.
Conformist.
we were right along friends
Fair Fantano W
Hasan really put this guy on
Just goes to show all you have to do is die and people will give you recognition
if this piece of garbage went from 3 to an 8, then you‚Äôve just discredited 10 years of reviewing.
Common Anthony W thank you for doing this album justice
Still feel like this is too low.  But he gave this a 3 originally so whatever.  At one point, on his original he referred to the synth part at the end of So it goes to fart sounding synth.  Here he points it out as a positive.  I propose another re-redux review five years after this, where Anthony admits again how this is Mac&#39;s best work and further swallows his words.  Rarely, do I hear him address every track and wonder how much further he really dug into this one.  Maybe it&#39;s a lack of time thing, but there is a lot recorded and written out here that I;m surprised he still is not mentioning here.
YESYESYES THANK YOU
Thank you sm for this redux absolutely sadden when I watched the original review but glad it‚Äôs grown on you like it did for us‚ù§
LFG
We miss him too man
I remember this come out the same week as astro world and I remember thinking this was better.
Literally watched your original review for the first time a couple weeks back. Was excited to hear someone articulate why it was such a great album. Was not the review I expected, and Im assuming the army of comments clowning Anthony&#39;s take may have inspired this re review lol
Gotta thank NFR for this review
My absolute favorite mac miller album. I remember distinctly the day I heard it. I came back home pretty drunk from orientation week party with my fellow med school friends and was excited to listen to Astroworld‚Ä¶. After listening to it I knew macs album was coming on and as I heard it I was blown away and listen to it multiple times a month. Love you easy max with the cheesy raps. Rest in paradise ‚ù§
REDEMPTION ITSELF HAS CAME
W
I was very displeased with the prior rating and kinda always held that grudge. Im glad you got to see the beauty of the work, hopefully at your own behest. It is rare to see a critic redo such a heated topic and for that you earn my subscription. Stay swimming
Fantano is a leech
Thank you for admitting you were wrong ‚ù§
I need more love for Watching Movies With The Sound Off
I don‚Äôt want to say he only did this because Mac passed away but if he didn‚Äôt there‚Äôs no chance this gets a redux review. Idk man
You&#39;re first review of this album was when I stopped watching you&#39;re videos. You obviously don&#39;t know much
Name an album that you can listen do over and over again and it never gets old:
Glad you‚Äôre finally joining us in reality Tony, Mac is a true artist and not to be slept on (side note Good AM is my second favorite so we totally agree there)
u foul as fuck my nigga for this one, it been great
his work keep growing without him <br>that is a statement of how good of a artist he was. rest easy Mac
some people&#39;s soul operate on a level you don&#39;t feel. top 5 album of that decade for me
Long live Mac Miller ‚ù§
Nice üëåüèΩ RIP MAC
Why would anyone care about your initial let alone your redux opinions? You just arrogantly misrepresent an album to millions and then change you mind stfu
Everyone loved Circles but I&#39;m not gonna lie, it just wasn&#39;t my vibe. Rollin w Mac since How High and was fortunate to see him coming up as I had friends and fam in the Burg. <br><br>It&#39;s kind of crazy as I do enjoy DF but I always land back on two albums, Good Am and Swimming. Maybe Swimming is my favorite because I relate to it more and circles for me, although a wonderful piece of Art with strong song writing just never hit me the way Swimming did. Besides Swimming being a beautiful collective piece of art and IMO his most honest and creative writing, I do think it is better live, ladders was never my favorite but after hearing him do it on Colbert, its a top 10 (if you haven&#39;t seen it or heard it, plz do). Then you have his Tiny Desk performance of Swimming and I gotta say... I just put the whole video thing on my playlists and have it downloaded vs the actual tracks on the record. Swimming for me will always be my favorite, I think certain songs on that record are much better performed live and think if Mac was still alive we&#39;d more than likely see him re-tweak these songs to mimic these performances. <br><br>Also! If you haven&#39;t already and you&#39;re into circles, look up Mac miller Lo-Fi, you&#39;ll thank me later.
That‚Äôs more like it melon
I‚Äôm glad you had come to context of the album. I was super upset of what you gave the album in your last video. This album is pure genius everyone who worked on the album is genius.
Thank you Melon‚ù§Ô∏è
YESSIIIRRRRRRR I&#39;VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE
HOLY FUCK WOW<br><br>(good on you for allowing ur opinions  to be fluid / admitting when you feel you made an error !!!)
92 til infinity
good job
Still don&#39;t appreciate 2009
I love this album, so glad he reviewed it again. 7/8 is so much better i&#39;m glad you enjoyed it
Rick Ross deeper than rap redux
yes swimming in circles..... knew youd change your mind smh you also need  to re listen to  tame impalas the slow rush
This is the issue with shitting on peoples albums :( when Mac was alive it was negativity towards their art, but now that he‚Äôs gone he can‚Äôt hear the positivity
WE WIN.
Glad to see this review isn&#39;t getting memed to shit in the comments. Fantano&#39;s really built an amazingly respectful and thoughtful community.
Like why do you even care about this person&#39;s opinion? We always knew Swimming was a masterpiece and is not even a 8/10 its a 10/10. Do not make these people feel their opinion is on another level. Theyre just human. Critics (especially art critics) are the most dumb things that could ever exist.
Strong 7! Ahahaha. You‚Äôre something else. Happy to see this man. Devine Feminine will slap the shit out of you in a year or so. I couldn‚Äôt stand it. Especially live. I‚Äôve been learning all his songs and how to perform them live in a sense and him live is completely different, especially TDF &amp; Swimming. Kid was a Prodigy. GOAT. David Crosby just died. Damn it. He was really cool. So is Willie. RIP Mr. Crosby ü´∂üèº Mac Miller Forever ‚ôæ
This will always be a 10!!  First time i listened to it I thought it was a masterpiece‚Ä¶  this was my first real experience w Mac Miller‚Äôs music too.  As an older person (older than you Fantano)‚Ä¶  I have enjoyed listening to all his music bc it shows the maturity and talent from his teen years until his death‚Ä¶  you don‚Äôt get that with every rapper/performer.  He is my ‚Äúfamous‚Äù person I‚Äôd love to have dinner with that has passed away.  Hands down!  I cherish his music and this album will always be on repeat for me.  Got my son listening to him too which is always fun!  RIP Mac
This LP and Circles have been on repeat lately. RIP
Damn, can Pomo get a shoutout for What&#39;s The Use and Ladders? He is why those songs sound like they do.
This was genuinely one of Anthony&#39;s worst reviews.<br><br>I&#39;m glad he went back and realized how wrong he was. Score is still.bad though. I&#39;m not saying that because Mac is one of my favorites, this album was just perfect, even the flaws. One of the realistic projects I&#39;ve ever personally heard.
Now we‚Äôre just waiting for that Blank Face redux.
Fake af lol
:)
I was really hoping you&#39;d bump it down a score just to watch the seething rage wash over your comment section, but I was pleasantly surprised. Still can&#39;t believe you called him a &#39;no good culturally appropriating crack junkie who&#39;s only redeeming and original songs are Up All Night and Larry&#39;. A controversial opinion to be sure, but not one I think anyone here can disagree with.
Thank you for re reviewing this one.
JS but mac slurs on most of his raps an songs... I guess he was drinking alot...
This guy a tool man.<br>For a guy who prides himself on reviews, you sure missed A LOT of meaning off the first listen. And proceeded to bash it.<br>Now you‚Äôre back trying to reverse üòÇ all good. But I can‚Äôt respect that in the slightest
deja vu
Nicely done swimthony
All we need now is for Kanye to get admitted to a mental health care facility and that My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy score will increase with fine margins
I give it a 9/10, solid album
rates and album 3 then the guy dies and gets an 8 lmao
:&#39;)
I would die for an 8
Next up do Earl I Don‚Äôt Like Shit
I maintain this album is a lot better than Circles
To be more concise: it&#39;s psychedelic heavy lol
I forgive you ‚ù§Ô∏è
Please do K.I.D.S
giving people their flowers when it‚Äôs already to late, no one cares now bro you shit on him but saw he‚Äôs now popular and you need the clout
Seems like he‚Äôs reaching a bit to enjoy a dead man‚Äôs work
Did y&#39;all know fantano is the name of the scientist that created him and not the monster
Colossal dub bossman
now i can finally watch theneedledrop again!
You didn&#39;t have to redo the review if you didn&#39;t like the album. I always thought this was mac&#39;s best work the moment it came out. It&#39;s his most complete album. If you didn&#39;t like it though, that&#39;s OK. I think you are redoing the review because people criticized you for it.
You need to re-review Nas‚Äô Life Is Good. 4/10 is disgusting
good boy
&quot;Feels like I&#39;m sitting with Mac &amp; his thoughts&quot; Yep &amp; that&#39;s why we love Malcom. Tomorrow 1\19\23 is his 30th üéÇ Imma celebrate for 30 straight! LONG! LIVE!! MACADELLIC!!!
his plan was to have this album be a start to a finish. Enlarging the idea &quot; swimming in circles &quot;.
1. Swimming<br>2. Circles<br>3  GO-OD AM<br>4. Faces<br>5. Watching Movies
Better late than never to the party
THANK.. GOD!
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING!!!?!?
Wonder if this redux woulda happened if my man Mac didn‚Äôt pass ü§î
I love all of Mac&#39;s flaws. Rip the GOAT
Lmaooo nice redux
The thing he did this because people can&#39;t over a different opinion in music, it makes us know what the majority horrible pop albums have lately got 80+ in Metacritic
reasons why you sit with the music first. you have the responsibility of a person with a lot of viewers to do so.
the album I go back to whenever I&#39;m sad.
I knew back in 2019 that it wasn‚Äôt a 3 despite your review. I‚Äôm glad you came around
No finality to so it goes cause it‚Äôs a transition to circles‚Ä¶so it goes in circles
It still kinda feels like your trashing his musical choices and singing abilities
Faces is one of my favorites. It‚Äôs just so out there.
Thank You Melon, this made my day :)
Thanks to nfr
Glad you made this. Easily my biggest disagreement with a rating you gave and I felt that way before his death. This album sounded like the music Mac always wanted to make. Very solid and it‚Äôs sad because I really believe this was the beginning of him reaching his peak
Now we just need a redux of The feminine devine
the pure, unfettered amount of anger I had towards the previous review of this has been somewhat alleviated and I can probably stop going to therapy for the time being.
wow, thank you sirüëè
Happy he changed his opinion on this album with a REDUX. The album didn‚Äôt deserve an 8 and I could understand at the time before his passing he would critique it differently, but a 3 was very harsh. He must‚Äôve been in a weird mind set at the time of that review.. thanks for giving an update on the album @theneedledrop
I do agree with his 2009 take. I hate the studio version. Why can‚Äôt it sound like his tiny desk? üò©
Thank You. That&#39;s it.
Uncommon Melon W
I still listen to Mac almost every day. Find myself going back to Blue Slide Park a lot because it was such a care free time in history. Forever missed for sure.
Swimming in Circles üëçüèæ
This Record is a Masterpiece. RIP MACüêêüò¢
After years, I can finally rest easy now knowing you have discovered the beauty in this album
just be quiet
The time has come.
The most amazing thing Mac could do through his music is like you said about Wings. You feel like you‚Äôre sitting with him. You feel like you know him.
Swimming is an album that means a lot to me. I&#39;m happy to see that you&#39;re enjoying it more after the years, it definitely deserves the appraisal it gets.<br><br>Great redux review
The melon came back from earth I see
Love that you have a Danng Brown album on display considering he was someone who talked shit about Mac when he was alive then came around to his music later on.
Best redux on your carrer lad
would you still say kids see ghosts is a 10
Glad you finally took your head out of your ass to listen to this record again
I forgive you melon‚Ä¶
Dude I listened to the first track again after a really long time and instantly got chills and tested up haha. I thought I was such a hard ass all this time.
Warms my heart actually
Who else thinks Melon had character assassinated Mac and felt bad about it. If Kanye died MBDTF would be a 10. Don&#39;t even like this comment btw
When mc ride dies, melon will give every death grips album an 11
now do a redux on juice wrld&#39;s DRFL and GBGR lmfao weirdo they both atleast a 8 and GBGR is literally a 10 even tho i like DRFL more but album wise GBGR is a 10
death impact
This was very cathartic to watch, it reminded me of seeing a friend of yours fall in love with/appreciate a piece of art they never understood why you enjoyed. <br><br>Seeing Anthony come around on this was really great to see, and I think this is the case for most ppl who were detractors of Mac and/or this album.
the good ending
Mac taught us a lot of things.. <br><br>one thing he taught me was to do what I love and forget the rest. Go for your passion even if you don‚Äôt make money from it  ‚òØÔ∏é  <br>(now I‚Äôm making videos) <br><br>Thank you for making this video he definitely deserved way more attention, the album is nothing less than a masterpiece!<br><br> Rest Easy Mac ü§ç<br>We miss you bro üñ§
redemption
FINALLY
Please Redux Review Lil peep COWYS
This review almost makes me cry ‚ù§ RIP MAC
There has always been a sense of foreboding and reckoning in Mac‚Äôs music, and that‚Äôs what takes his later projects beyond the scope of the frat boy rap that started his career. With each proceeding record, his lyricism and direction got darker and deeper, hitting a climax with Faces; afterwards, he began to shift towards a lighter direction after working extensively with Rick Rubin, which is what prompted GO:OD AM. This in turn continued with The Devine Feminine, but the progression was unfortunately cut short with his passing after Swimming. His lyrics and messages as displayed throughout his music serve as a representation of his vulnerability, spoken to his fans through his music. RIP to a legend
Thank you Anthony!
Great! You did this album dirty the first time lol<br>You gotta redo Yeezus and At. Long. Last. A$AP tho, they are way better than 5/10
Finally, that&#39;s a great redux review!
finally
everyone knew this was deserved /needed
swagtanos opinion isnt law
Easy 9 but okay I respect your opinion nonetheless
Really happy you went back to this, I will admit I was a bit hurt with the initial score lol
Finally justice for swimming!!!!üèäüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
üëç
The good ending.
I fr fr thought they released a deluxe version when I saw this video dropped :(
Spectre
we all know you‚Äôre just backpedaling because he‚Äôs dead
Finally I can enjoy this album, thank you melon
Finally.
very happy you decided to go back and review this album again
Mac Miller forever.
YEEEEESSSSSSS
wanna see a cherry bomb redux :3
i hadn&#39;t listened to swimming before this redux dropped, my only exprience w/ mac was KIDS. and i&#39;m glad i didnt cuz that 3 woulda pissed me the fuck off. tony got a thing for giving decent hip-hop albums 3s, birds in the trap for instance. but this shit is a 9, its so majestic and the mood it set up from start to end was amazing. theres almost no weak points for me here, besides jet fuel&#39;s chorus maybe. but im gonna be reslistening to this so much, the vibe it gives off is one of a kind, and i can already here more modern hh albums being inspired by the sounds on here.
Melon all-time Mac Miller hater
YYYESSS
Anthony fantano after mac miller died is so fake brah
Finally
I really liked this album. Other than 100 grandkids good news off circles was my introduction to him. Like this better than circles honestly.
hi
Will you be reviewing the new an soul????? I think it‚Äôs worth not skipping over dude üò¢
Thank you Melon &lt;3
Thank you
This was the one chief
This is so fucking shameless Anthony
5000% he never does this if Mac didn‚Äôt die
i KNOW that&#39;s right
You need to do a better job at dissecting the lyrics instead of getting so caught up in instrumentals. This album was incredible but you tend to fixate on the superficial qualities of the music rather than the spirit/deeper meanings in the lyrics.
I was SO mad at your initial take. I feel you still missed the true undertone of the album but I get why you won‚Äôt speak on it. Props to you for running it back and correcting your initial take
Really an amazing record in my opinion but I‚Äôm not the worlds biggest music nerd sadlyüò¢
ü•∏
idk i liked this album right away. it seemed like he finally found a lane and an identity, i remember immediately once the album finished I said this is good, the next one is gonna be <b>&quot;the ONE&quot;</b> but unfortunately we&#39;ll never know R.I.P.
I miss him so much
I&#39;m sorry it took you this long to come around to this album
The redemption arc,finally
‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ rip Mac
I&#39;d love to see your review of some of Redveil&#39;s work!
Mac Miller‚Äôs last two albums helped me go through some of the loneliest and darkest times of my life which I was experiencing back in 2019. <br>Lately I‚Äôve been feeling down again so I came back to his music and now that I‚Äôm less of a self absorbed prick I truly can feel his pain, especially throughout Circles. This breaks my heart. I feel like I could‚Äôve been one of those ignorant people around him who didn‚Äôt truly see him while he was alive.<br><br>Mac Miller was there for me like a real friend. Even after his death. Which is why I truly miss him, from the bottom of my heart. <br><br>Malcome, You‚Äôve became immortal with what you brought to this world. I wish one day I see you on the otherside and give you a big hug brother.
FACES will forever be Mac&#39;s best work
Finding Mac late, this is the record that always resonated with me. Deserves its dues
YEAAAAAA FUCK EM UP FROM THE GRAVE MAC üò≠üò≠
light 8 after a 3, im speechless, thank you Anthony
Yeahhhhh !!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg3HTairH5g&amp;t=228">3:48</a> didn&#39;t edit that well enough lol..
Thanks for giving this another critical listen to. I keep coming back to this album because of the rawness and how it emotionally resonates with me, the added productions from J Cole made it such an impactful experience
Did the NFR podcast appearance convince you to revisit the album?
well said as always
mac was hard. took me a min to catch on ngl.
We accept your apology letter.
Your original review made me so sad because I felt you missed out on the undeniable groove and honesty in this album. So happy you went back on it and enjoy it now!
I always though they he should have ended with ‚Äú2009‚Äù instead of ‚Äúso it goes‚Äù, but maybe he was going for more of that ending vibe of hopelessness or something.
I used to watch your reviews religiously until you gave swimming a 3, I just couldnt wrap my head around any of your opinions. It is refreshing to see this get album the review it deserves, truly unique and beautiful. This shows your ability to stay objective and unbiased because youre able to humbly take accountability, I greatly respect the work you do and am glad you did right by this. A 3 to a 8 rating is very telling and very deserved. I appreciate u melon. PS this album will always be a 10 in my heart
clar√≠simo
One thing I see all over social media nowadays is people doubling down on their strong opinions and beliefs, while simultaneously refusing to explore new evidence or hear other takes that could help shape your opinion. It‚Äôs very rare for a person to change their stance, especially as drastic as a 3-8. Really respect that aspect of this review and the willingness from Melon to admit his change in opinion.
I can rest easy now
Hey Anthony Fantano! You should review some of Origami Angel&#39;s LPs. Somewhere City and Gami Gang are some of the DYI pop punk/midwetern-emo scene&#39;s best works and they don&#39;t get enough love for how talented the duo is.
Review 6 dogs RONALD
Thanks Melon
The Waffle House has found it‚Äôs new host!
I&#39;ve been listening to this record recently. So good.
Hello, nice album
Idk, it feels like you&#39;re giving this album its flowers simply due to the fact that the artist is no longer with us.
RIP MAC ‚ù§üïäÔ∏è
Be honest. You thought he was corny as fuck when he was alive and now that he&#39;s passed you can lister with possibly less bias, but more likely you are treating him like most dead rappers get treated. Better than they were when alive.
This is redemption
bout time
melon, review Mellon collie and the infinite sadness by the Smashing Pumpkins
I love this album with all of my heart- just everything about it. It is my all-time favorite album, just barely above Mac Miller&#39;s faces. Although this may not be your cup of tea Anthony, i do appreciate that you giving it credit for some of its best parts that are undeniable, like the emotions and deepness of it all. Thank you for this review, it cool to hear other people&#39;s honest opinions.
The good ending
This a 10/10 for me
respect
You should review More Black Superheroes by WESTSIDE BOOGIE
Jet Fuel the best song Mac ever made.
Lol I thought death doesn‚Äôt equal good music
This makes me happy
Got a little emotional when I saw the score, takes a big man to change an opinion in front of millions.
The thing with Mac Miller albums is you may not understand it at first but with time you go ‚Äú oh wow, this is genius‚Äù
I love You Anthony thanks for this üñ§
Love this album. For me it‚Äôs my favorite Mac album so glad to see this reduex.
I was always so confused with ur takes in the last Swimming review, I understood the album sounds raw and vague in some ways but that being the point of it, Im glad you corrected yourself!
I totally for got that anthony. Did these redux reviews since we only get one a year. I&#39;m glad that he picked this album since I am a mild Mac Miller fan. I listened to circles right when it came out. I had to order a cd and everything from my local record store, and I have listened to some of his older stuff, but not this album yet. So, this video popping up in my feed was the perfect excuse to finally sit down and throw it on. In my opinion on of mac&#39;s best work, he really puts his heart on his sleeve and still totally raps his ass off on this album. It&#39;s a solid 7 to light 8 for me. How does everybody else feel about this album.
Mac. We love you. üíö This album was and always will be a 10.
You can already play Short Skirt/Long Jacket if you know What&#39;s the Use. If you find this comment go look it up
Good to see the like/dislike ratio&#39;s back to normal.
peace restored
review the godamn ab soul album
I was always so perplexed as to why  he gave it such a low initial score. One of the greatest records of the 2010s
RIP MAC, MISS U MAN &lt;3
Top 10 album all time for me. I didn‚Äôt appreciate Mac enough when he was alive
This album has always had such a surreal feeling to me. I loved &amp; appreciated it so much when it dropped &amp; both of those feelings have only grown stronger with time. The initial review &amp; overall reception of this album when it dropped was genuinely frustrating to me, so to see this redux feels like a wonderful close to a chapter. Thank you for this, Melon.
I can finally sleep at night now
tiny desk 2009 is the best song Mac has ever made
Nothing like having Melon for breakfast
I guess context CAN double an albums score. Callback to a lets argue a couple months ago. It‚Äôs a spicy meatball of context
THANK YOU
The album version of 2009 isn‚Äôt as good as his Tiny Desk performance of the song.
much better
This is art. I don‚Äôt think art can have floors. This is Mac, the music, then lyrics, the vocals. Fair enough it‚Äôs not for you but don‚Äôt think it can be technically reviewed. Nice tache brother
Mac miller is a legend bro all his work is legendary. No one can come close to his talent.
‚ù§Ô∏è
Smiled throughout this whole review because I really felt he put so much into this body of work
Thats what I thought
This melon redemption arc is hitting different
25k likes?!  holy shit the like to view ratio is insaneüéâ
this really deserved a redux!
Holy fuck. The original review was easily the most polarizing Fantano review for me. This made me happy, sad, but mostly thankful for the appreciation of Mac‚Äôs music and legacy. Thank you Melon, you done good
This was my biggest beef with any of Anthony&#39;s reviewsüòä Well done for rereviewing this, melon!
You gave Faces an unexpected Redux Review. I was so happy to hear how you came around to the mixtape. Glad to see you‚Äôre keeping musical tastes growing and being open-minded.<br>I have a REMember Music tattoo with a yin yang symbol tatted on me. It‚Äôs one of my favorite music themed tattoos. Been a massive Mac fan since KIDS dropped, but hated BSP. Came back around when the single ‚ÄúErica‚Äôs House‚Äù dropped. Led me to getting heavy into WMWTSO, Macadelic, Faces, and eventually unreleased albums like Balloonerism, Pink Slime, Your Shoes are Untied, and more.<br>There‚Äôs a Mac project for every music taste. Want jazz? You. Want a sexy r n b tape? Divine Feminine. All around tape? GO:OD AM. Depression? Faces and Balloonerism. Horrorcore? Delusional Thomas. Drugs and death are a theme in every project. Every mainline Mac Miller LP ends with Mac dying, just a fun fact. Dying and/or being in some afterlife.
So we were right and you were wrong. Nice to hear you admit it.
Redux birds in the trap?
I love and adore this album and I feel so awful that I never gave it a chance until Mac was gone and I heard Circles
still too low
Larry Lovstein  The Red Velvet Revival in my eyes is macs beginning to his beautiful signing
‚ÄúAwkward auto tune veneer‚Äù on 2009. HUH????? I don‚Äôt hear any such thing lol
This is the review I‚Äôve been waiting for. ‚ù§
im glad this is getting a rereview as it was very underrated, its just a shame mac isn&#39;t here with us anymore... his music has made an impact on so many lives ü§ç
you should do a redux review of those 2 murders you committed in 1993 cincinnati ohio
I stop scrolling, see the thumbnail, the title. <br><br>My heart flutters a bit and a smile slowly spreads across my face. <br><br>I‚Äôm so excited to watch this. Thank you for revisiting this work, Anthony.
Wings is the last song I wanna hear before I go, if I didn‚Äôt find this album when I did I don‚Äôt think I would be here today.
Finnaly I can have good opinion on this album
merindinggggg
YEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Faces<br>Movies with the sound off<br>Swimming<br><br>RIP to a real one
Such a fat W
Respect regained
check out Q stereo driver or forest green
I haven&#39;t finished video yet.<br>Still in first 2 min..<br>I hope Anthony cries again..<br><br>His review of good news had me in tears..<br>Felt good seeing melons feelings.
i really think this should‚Äôve won album of the year, this album impacted me greatly throughout my high school years, and really helped me get through tough times, and i am forever grateful for mac, thank you for relooking this.
This is your best redux review
i would love to see you do a review on Ballonerism by mac miller. I would love to see your take on it.
thank you melon
He gave swimming a 3 at first? Holy fuck
Meh. Keep that same energy even if the dude passed.
Funny how I revisited this album as well recently because it didn‚Äôt really catch my attention but when i listen to it back I fell in love with the album my favorite from this album would definitely be self care or 2009üî•
When are uu doing AB Soul bro.?
thank you for this
*everyone liked that
and he finally gets it. years later :( at least you gave it another chance
Thank you for giving this brilliant album another chance. I miss Mac.
Fantano giving swimming a 3 was the only thing that made me feel like I had my own opinion on music. Now I don‚Äôt know what to think.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg3HTairH5g&amp;t=280">4:40</a> ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs really not that different the more you think about it‚Äù
Ten redux goat
2023 is looking good so far
daaaamnnnnnnnn thanks for this
react to spectres kendrick full discography but it‚Äôs just my voice
Bout time u got it üçà
Great album
can you please listen to monsta x&#39;s new mini album titled reason? 5/6 track are self produced by the members and it&#39;s been a while since you&#39;ve reviewed kpop üòî i promise it&#39;s worth it
&quot;Look how far we done came, still they throwin&#39; dirt on my name but it never worry my brain. Heads turnin&#39; like a hurricane swirlin&#39; Tell the sun, get up outta my shade! They don&#39;t get the picture, cut em out of my frame. Shii I&#39;m up 30 thou miles plus change. It&#39;s been a while but I&#39;m down till I&#39;m out and it is what it is till it ain&#39;t !!&quot;
So when Kanye dies, MBDTF is getting a re-review and an 11/10.
Dude literally just grew so much as a person right before my eyes by correcting his ultimate mistake.
Bro was tired of getting flamed online all the time for the first review
Good now do the same for MBDTF and give it a 9 minimum
From a 3 to an 8, god damn
it&#39;s too late bro, roasted him while he is alive huh fuck you anthony. the album was already beautiful 5 years ago.
W
it feels so good to see an album get the love it deserves from my favorite reviewer lol
8+2 right
Red light next
I respect it Anthony
I do wish Fantano took notice of So It Goes&#39;s lack luster monotony being completely in reference to the Kurt Vonnegut novel Slaughterhouse Five. The quote &quot;so it goes&quot; is reference to the lack of importance of finality, the aliens that use the phrase in the book can view any point in time they so choose, hence viewing life as a circle constantly re approaching one self, rather than the linear view that humans see past present and future. So death is simply something that happens and nothing more. When someone dies on their planet &quot;well so it goes&quot; and the aliens in the novel can revisit a time when the person was once again alive.
RIP
my first time hearing Swimming, i sat in silence just staring at my desktop background or the wall behind it, for an hour or so , just absolutely washed over me like a hit of the most wicked drug
We forgive you for the first review
you were visited by the ghost of Mac  and told you to change your grade yep ?
I remember telling Anthony he&#39;s wrong about Mac and that he&#39;s basically just upset that a rapper has more musical talent than he does. <br><br>I&#39;m sure he knows that now. üôÉ <br><br>You&#39;re part of the reason why this world is a trashcan. <br>I&#39;m sure Anthony&#39;s music is a light 2 at best but on average days it&#39;s a NOT GOOD
Thank you for giving it the respect it deserves. A three was crazy...
This doesn‚Äôt have to be ‚Äúrefreshing‚Äù to anyone. As long as you have your own opinion that‚Äôs all that should matter lol
Whether this was intentional or not, it still gets me that So it Goes ends with those crescendoing synths that almost sound like an ascension into heaven, while Circles starts off sounding like he&#39;s already there, like a warm auditory hug from the other side.
from a 3 to a 8... the internet has done it üéâ
Really frustrating take. It feels wrong to me that because he died you liked the same songs more? Seems like you just didn&#39;t really internalize or listen to them in the first place
I can finally like this album. Thank you fantano
Very happy to see this one
~guilt review
mac miller is the nick drake of the 21st century
Bout time
Sad that the man had to die for you to hear him for real. This isn‚Äôt hating on you‚Ä¶.. just hope you see.
Where‚Äôs HERBERT?
PLEEEASSEEEE REVIEW CONTINOUS BY CURREN$Y ITS THE BEST ALBUM OF 2022
For me personally,,,, THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING FOR FANTANO
mac miller forever
Wthony Wtano
when you said anthony mac miller forever that hit deep
This album was Macs Mona Lisa‚Ä¶ R.I.P Mac
i think this the first vid i&#39;ve watched of yours, never was interested after i heard u trashed this
im a happy boy now
Glad u did a redux review on this album, This is one of mac‚Äôs better albums as time goes on in my opinion. Is there no redux review on Deathrace 4 Love or GoodBye &amp; GoodRiddance by juice wrld üò¢
Should&#39;ve stood on it, L
Always thought this was a crime against the arts. Glad the Melon ripened
bout time
RATE BUTCHER HOUSE ALREADY
Finally
its too late!
This made my day, I am glad the Mac is now getting the acknowledgment that he sadly did not get when he was alive.. this album is still one of my favorites and got me through so much. Glad to see you appreciate it now too
w
Finally justice
Ngl you shitting on this album so harshly the first time around made me completely stop following this channel. Always thought you overlooked the subtleties of what he was doing
This relieved my anger since the 2018 review. This redux is in fact really unexpected swimming deserve better
Check out out band LUCK, we just released an album called BURIED DEEP. ‚ù§Ô∏è
W redux review ty melon
it grew on him guys!!! let‚Äôs get the MBDTF‚Ä¶no? ok üòî
Probably my favourite rap album
Choose your weapon redux
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg3HTairH5g&amp;t=318">5:18</a> Happens. Mac&#39;s music can be an acquired taste so it can take a couple listens before people realize how well put together it actually is. And the whisper-like vocals, that some have a problem with, could not fit the album theme better
and that&#39;s on period
People give Anthony a lot of shit for his reviews, but how many reviewers take the time to revisit an album 5 years later and say &quot;hey, I was wrong, I like this thing now and I see its value&quot;? If he was as pretentious as people say he&#39;d never do shit like this.
Fantano made this in preparation for the NFR Podcast premiere.
The waffle house found it&#39;s new host
I&#39;d be interested to know what Fantano thinks of Mike Skinner
Im so happy right now.
Somehow the melon is still wrong and I hate him
He rates Mac so low in the past years for him not being a good singer......
Album was so good from the day it released idk why Fantano cant rate a Mac album high until its been out for 4 years
I remember when mac first started becoming popular we wrote him off as college bro rap (kinda like asher Roth and macklemore) just some white kid trying to rap. But recently I rediscovered Mac Miller and man was I wrong. He was great and we lost a true talent
What album is below Danny Brown?
Great review, although I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d end up giving it a lower score...
Thata boy tony
This is my favorite album of the last few years. It‚Äôs got a little funk, blues, jazz, pop, and r&amp;b. I personally love the singing because he‚Äôs not trying to be a singer. He‚Äôs just being himself. Which is what true art is about. I think you are missing the point in that aspect melon. Either way an 8 is what it is‚Ä¶always has been
most dope for life. rest easy mac!
2009 to this day is my favorite Mac Miller track
Fun fact. Mac made circles and swimming to sync together. It all lead to him always swimming in circles
Yeah that‚Äôs what I thought
ya done good melon, ya done good...
This is the best video Fantano has dropped in the past decade.
I really hoped for this video
The waffle House has found its new host
Wheezy winter doo‚Ä¶ where are you?  We‚Äôve got a review to do now.
Perfecto being the least favorite track is wild. An amazing song, one of my favorites from this album.
finally anthony you were being a major hater with that 3
FINALLY
came back and made it right,<br>I have always discredited all of your views because of the original review(lol). Thanks for revisiting.
Never too late for reparations.
Thank you for this Fantano. Mac ü§ç
YES YES YES YES
Alive - Light 3, Dead - Decent 8
Now this is what we call character growth
Wow I can finally let this go. üëç
Glad you did a redux.
Was not expecting to hear a &quot;Mac Miller Forever&quot; today. Thank you Fantano
Did it justice. Thank you Melon üôè
here we go lemon head
THANK YOU
Redeemed
I was kinda hoping you&#39;d give it another three just to see people&#39;s reactions, lol.
Probably redux because of how much hate he got
Time to revisit artists who are no longer with us for clicks, well done Anthony.
hmm, convenient
Like everyone else, I&#39;m glad this is getting its due from you. I didn&#39;t even know about Mac Miller until after his death, and not even from news about it - I just organically heard &quot;self care&quot; through someone else and the vibe of it got to me and got me looking into the rest of his work. Mac became easily one of my top 10 artists (and this is from someone who has prog bands like Rush/Dream Theater in a theoretical top 10 - I like hip hop but I have a much bigger rock/metal/alt influence overall.) I was living in Los Angeles at the time, (originally being an East Coast kid with a jewish background) and going through the most difficult/painful personal arc of my life while also trying to maintain the hustle that LA demands of you professionally. It was all a very potent combination for me - Mac&#39;s similar travels to mine, how he framed his personal demons, his Capricorn perspective and demeanor, his musical background and how that was expressed. It felt like I had developed a very personal relationship with him through his music and made me feel like I missed him even though I never even knew who he was when he was alive. My coworkers even had a past story/run-in with him when he made an appearance at their house during a party. It felt like he was right there, just out of reach. His music helped me through the darkest time of my life and I&#39;ll always be grateful for everything he did and left us.
‚Ä¶ and the world was finally at peace üòå
Please don‚Äôt mess this one up like last time Anthony
thank you melon, thank you
oh my fucking goe
Talk about redemption
Well well well what do we have here it&#39;s almost like the album is a masterpiece that deserved more love than you gave it we&#39;ll done for coming back to it
Justice was done
Would you keep this energy if Kid Cudi died after Speedin Bullet to Heaven?
Fantano redemption arc
Such a clown. Gave it a 3 prob shat on it, then Mac dies and years later when it‚Äôs safe to come out, he gives it a high score. What a flip flop
Probably u won&#39;t see it, but go back and relisten to Perfect Circle/God speed. That song has such heavier impact since his passing.
Mac aged like wine for fantano.
YES YES YES FINALLY
war is over
Damn it‚Äôs almost like you‚Äôre <b>almost</b> self-aware of the fact that your criticisms and dismissals of artist‚Äôs emotions in their lyrics as ‚Äúmelodramatic‚Äù are actually super fucking reductive of the struggles with mental health that literally every artist who sings about it actually has.<br><br>Anyways, Faces for classics week?
Fantano est√° basado de cojones
Dude really caved after Mac diedüíÄ
I have a feeling what Fantano would do next is regular programming
Review sematary
L take, light to decent 10

I felt drowning it&#39;s still my least favourite album from Miller <br>3/10
New review for Forever Story at a 10
....Fixing ur mi√ütake I seeüôèüèæüëèüëè
could you review the new obituary album pretty please
I appreciate you revisiting this one. It&#39;s a really good record and at times, great. I personally felt like you didn&#39;t give it the props it deserved, but It made me happy seeing this revisit. Noice
RIP Mac Miller
Good review Anthony. Now do a redux for The Ooz and you will be forgiven.
oh thank god
Please review Stick Season by Noah Kahn please
Best YouTube apology ever
thank you anthony
incredibly uncommon fantano w
Thank you Anthony Fantano
Thank you ! That swimming review was one of your worst!
Oh thank god he Changed it
JUSTICE!
Better than TPAB
The actual üêê artist of all time. W RE review. Much needed
you can criticize macs talent all you want, but the way he can display his soul on a track is like no other
I was wondering why in his worst score reviews he didn‚Äôt mention this album. It makes sense now.
Mac up in heaven saying <br>‚ÄúFinally, the melon understands‚Äù
This album has always been incredible its a shame mac had to die for you to actually give it a chance.
Finally dawg
He only changed it because he died tbh
This was the first Mac album I‚Äôve ever listened to. Completely changed the way I viewed him as an artist and as a person. Incredible.
W
Talk about giving flowers too late‚Ä¶
Small Worlds is one of my favorite Mac cuts. John Mayer actually played the guitar on the track and did a great tribute of the song.
Anthony really did himself a favour with this one, i dont know one single person that doesnt like swimming
They don&#39;t love you until you&#39;re dead
Thank you sir, thank you.
finally
Part of Anthony overlooking the &quot;poor&quot; singing is how bad auto tune, hip hop &quot;singing&quot; has gotten in the years since
this man is the definition of fake
you did the whole world a favor by dropping this
easy 9 RIP MAC
it‚Äôs always been an 8 just cause he passed away doesn‚Äôt change the context of the album just gotta be more open minded to a change of pace and theme
Still dont think he understands the true love and appeal of this album and his just doing this because mac died. Giving this a 3 was a crime.
Well well well what do we have here. Take that MBDTW Stans. Mac one of the GOATS IMO. RIP Larry Fisherman.
thank you.
?????
Just here to say the 3 you gave this great album when it came is bullshit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg3HTairH5g&amp;t=519">8:39</a> and the Big mac fans Thank you for this, but your not forgiven
Listen to and review the new semarary album
Good am is hands down my favorite album but everything after that has been really good as well
Still confused how this was a 3 when you reviewed it. Absolutely disrespectful.
I needed this redo review so badly. This being a 3 by anyone‚Äôs standards really didn‚Äôt sit right with me.
React to Lincoln&#39;s new album
Thank you
well you know guys, this is coming from the guy who rated Swimming 8/10
How the FUCK did you even give it a 3/10 in the first place...? Like what were you smoking on brotherman
Thanks for this
UUHYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEAAAASSSSSSSSS ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨
review sematary&#39;s new album melon
You only have to die for Melon to actually listen to your music and put his biases aside.
Kinda well disingenuous tho you&#39;re only doing it now he&#39;s died.
LETS GOOO
If you&#39;re doing the old reviews can you can you look at the first 2 Arctic Monkey&#39;s albums because you&#39;ve bashed the rest of their discography
Could you check Spectre&#39;s work, especially Kendrick&#39;s discography done only by using his voice?
They call them double entendres lol
Yo can you pls review DJ Chrisyelroy&#39;s Smiling Goat (Part I and II) - 100 sounds of autism? I think you will enjoy it.
Now I‚Äôm finally allowed to like this album, thanks Anthonyüëç
I would&#39;ve loved to hear him mention JID&#39;s vocals on Self Care
MEANWHILE STILL NO AB-SOUL HERBERT REVIEW
I love you for this cute guy‚ù§
i would definitely give this an 8 if it was an instrumental album, but his vocals just ruin it for me.
This video already has over twice as many likes as the original review lmao
All of your other reviews I don‚Äôt agree with I could at least see where you were coming from. But with swimming I couldn‚Äôt understand where you got a 3 from. The album is just too beautiful. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre finally seeing the magic and charisma of this album üôè
This is one of those takes you take to the grave, the mea culpa just makes the original crime even worse because you do know better
Your original review was so unbelievably negative that it still doesn‚Äôt sit right with me, but I‚Äôll give you props for relistening
My son told me Melon&#39;s first review on this album was his most disliked, before they got rid of the dislike button.
AHAHAHAHHAH HE MADE IT AN 8 NO FUCKING WAY
FINALLLY
Im glad you came around.I loved that record when it came out.<br>I was so sad there would be no more, im still sad about it, miss him.
Now review new sematary
Thank you.
Nah fam
Bro doin everytyhing but reviewing HERBERT smh
Fantano popping reduccy rn
Still have so much circles/swimming merch that I wear regularly. Listen to swimming more than circles but man he was expanding so much as an artist at the time. Ladders is very underrated imo.
thank you anthony.
finally
Good on you for correcting this
the only complaint i have ever had with this album was the vocal performance on 2009. after watching his Tiny Desk concert and seeing how well he performed it, it‚Äôs hard to imagine he would sound so awkward on the studio version
It‚Äôs still a 10/10 but I‚Äôll let an 8 slide I guessüòÇ
L
thank you.
He‚Äôs fixing all his wrongs before the @NFRPodcast collab üòÇ
That‚Äôs what I thought, bald headed dork
Common anthony W
the backlash really got to u
I‚Äôm so fucking glad he didn‚Äôt pull a DAMN, or My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy on us and actually saw the album for what it was, A Masterpiece üëèüëèüëè
still personally feel a light to decent 9 on this one but im glad you just got it above a 6 now lmao
his hand at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg3HTairH5g&amp;t=305">5:05</a> had me trippin thought that shit was animated
Love Mac!!!!!!!!!
MADE ME LISTEN TO THE ALBUM ONCE AGAIN
Hypocrite
It never sat right with me that your previous review was how your Swimming listening experience would be remembered.  Subjectively, it is a more impactful album than you gave it credit for, but contextually it has so much more to offer than the sum of its parts, especially after his passing and in conjunction with Circles.  <br><br>I don‚Äôt care how you rate it, it‚Äôll always hold a special place in my heart.  But I‚Äôm glad you could come to understand what we all saw in it.  <br><br>‚ÄúIt is what it is til it ain‚Äôt.‚Äù
All that mattered to me was more jet fuel appreciation
Thank you for this Anthony. The fact that he passed away and already had all the material for Circles recorded. He had taken his music in such a soulful direction and sonically, Swimming and Circles were from the same era in his life. It‚Äôs no wonder the record grew on you. <br><br>What‚Äôs the Use and Self Care are all time bangers from Mac. How can you not groove out as soon as you hear that funky ass bass line? On top of razor sharp flow switches that to this day I can‚Äôt keep up with. ‚ÄúBut the breeze ain‚Äôt flowin like me mothafucka hol up‚Äù He will never be forgotten, Rest In Peace to the legend Mac Miller!
I&#39;m so glad you finally redid the review. This album helped me fall in love with music, so I&#39;m glad you can see now that it has a hell of a lot going for it.
This makes me so happy. I always believed the original &quot;laziness&quot; fantano attributed to this album was intentional and more of a display of his emotional state then the lyrics even. Makes me wish he could see how much people love his last 2 albums. rest easy
finally, i can sleep well at night
Thank the lord ima about to be in tears ok now mbdtf yeezus n watch the throne
your original review of this was wayyyy worse than MBDTF
Can‚Äôt believe I am finally allowed to like the album, thank you
the fact that you originally gave this a 3 makes me sick to my stomach. you vile vile human. slight redemption here‚Ä¶
good work fantano, justice has been restored.

anthony, respect man<br>better late than never, context is everything
Appreciate you for giving this album another chance Anthony!

Surprised you didn&#39;t hate on the album again like you did 4 years ago
YES
Melon in his redemption arc
Redux review for Ohms by Deftones
We unlocked the good ending
The redux review we didn‚Äôt know we needed. So glad you can back to this one.
TE QUIERO MEL√ìN
Thanks Anthony, now I can enjoy this album
Alr cool now give Ken carson a 10
Fuck man... i miss him... when we lost him I felt like I lost a friend, someone i grew up with and felt like i knew.... RIP Mac, thanks for the redux this album was always a favorite
Swimming &gt; MBDTF
please redux review red light from bladee
Glad that he didn‚Äôt sweep his hate for the album under the rug.
WE WOOOOOOOOOOON
Thank you for this Anthony ü•π
The good ending.
About time
now give KOD a redux melon
What a turn around. Always liked Selfcare. Rest easy Mac‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüèª
Look man. I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôre deleting some comments, but I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only one who feels like I was holding in a lot of resentment for this channel because of the original review. Like I had to take EVERYTHING you said with a grain of salt. You had to do this, and it doesn‚Äôt seem as genuine as a lot of people in the comments think.
Mea culpa is &quot;my fault&quot; in Latin.
This was my first Mac Miller music. I still love it.
You were so wide of the mark with this one first time around but props for facing up to it. Some records take time
Uncommon Fantano W
Everyday we get closer to faces getting that 10 it deserved.
this activated my ‚Äúsightseeing to Hurt Feelings‚Äù nostalgia
Really happy to see this redux. 8 is a very fair ranking for this album. This is one of my favorite rap albums, very unique for the genre, lush, engrossing, and personal. On top of that, the context of the time of this release relative to Mac&#39;s death made it extra hard-hitting. Have a good one Melon!
Cant believe hes gone. Its so sad. üòî
I no longer have a bounty on your head, fantano.
blonde redux
honestly man you shoulda jus doubled down on the old review like you did with MBDTF or WLR I woulda respected you way more
WHOLE LOTTA RED REDUX NEXT?
thank u for redux anthony i can finally move on goodbye :,)
Now we need a Faces redux cause it&#39;s arguably his best work and you originally only gave it a 6
finally.
Thank you
Fantano ragged on Mac‚Äôs singing for years and now switches up after he passed. It doesn‚Äôt feel genuine at all that he would move it from a 3 to an 8.
Finally he got it right.
Anthony DUBtano
i can‚Äôt wait for anthony‚Äôs first re-re-review
Thank you Fantano. We all appreciate this.
No... it cannot be...
That og review is still your lost disliked video, going from a 3 to an 8 is wild üòÇ
I still won‚Äôt forgive you for shitting on him only to change your mind after he died
When are you gonna do Paramore self-titled review
This may be the start of the melon redemption arc
I have waited so long for this
the fact that this even needed a redux review is sad
Rest in peace Mac üïäÔ∏è
Vindication
i love you
Thanks for fixing this
This album is his best. No debate.
Was a real head scratching moment watching fantanos intial review of this album. This redux is bitter sweet, with an emphasis on the bitter...
Weird foot fetish cover RIP
I really love you Antony!!! Send you a big hug
Great ! now redux all of j.cole&#39;s career
Thank you for seeing what we all see
Redemption arc üôå
finally im allowed to listen to this album! thanks melon, very cool
pls review ab soul herbert
Great vid. Looking forward to MBDTF redux redux review
Antonio el Fantas
review more reggae.
this album is a 10/10 for me.. there‚Äôs some real magic to it man
Bro folded under peer presure
Now it‚Äôs time for the Care for Me redux review, where he finally gives it the 10 it deserves.
I waited almost 5 years for this Redux melon üò¢
So It Goes also references the book Slaughterhouse V. In the book, so it goes is said every time someone who has died is mentioned. I think it‚Äôs such a fitting title for a song that has ‚Äúthe ascension to heaven‚Äù as Mac called it playing the album out. Love the return to the album and glad your perspective has changed.
Swimming all day today, like the past 5 years. I grew so much from listening to this album. 5 years ago i was depressed, hardly being able to love myself, surrounded by drugs and friends who didn&#39;t appreciate me.  Now I&#39;m sober and living life the way I was supposed to live it. Can&#39;t help but feel grateful for Mac Millers last two albums. Rest in peace King.
Now Fantano can finally like this album after it getting an 8
I love that you did this melon
We smokin Fantano pack tonight boys. Long time coming. <br><br>Glad my boy is getting his much deserved props. Could almost cry about him not being here to see it. I personally, was hoping for something more along the lines of good AM when this dropped and couldn&#39;t fully grasp the brilliance or how much it would mean to me at the time. BUT I&#39;ll be god damned if I didn&#39;t cry in my room listening to it the day he died. His evolution was something we probably will never witness again in our lives rap definitely misses him. Hope he found some peace in the end.
YOOOO
Thank you
bro got bullied into redoing a reviewüíÄ<br><br>glad he did it tho, love mac and his previous review was awful.
Uncommon Anthony W
Anthony is a legend for this one. It helps too knowing that Anthony almost certainly isn&#39;t just doing it to please people or because he feels bad but because he&#39;s genuinely come around on the album
THANK GOD
Pretty good. I would give this one a 7/10
this album growed on me too i would give it a 8 too
He is now swimming
Great review I‚Äôd give it a 9 tho üëç
Bruh didn&#39;t you SWEAR somewhat recently that context could NEVER EVER bring an album up this much?
We won
I must be dreaming
Ab-Soul album?
love how this already has more likes than the og review
Artist: <b>dies</b><br>Fantano: +5 points!
This album is truly a masterpiece!
This is amazing‚Ä¶ I just told my friend who randomly mentioned you giving swimming a 3 that you would be doing a redux and then I look and BOOM randomly. THIS ALBUM IS A MANTRA‚Ä¶ WAY OF LIFE‚Ä¶ masterpiece
character development at its finest
Imagine he did the same thing as with MBDTF, giving it the same rating again just to put salt in the wounds.
Wait i thought he died?
Dude, when are you going to review Ab-Souls Herbert !!!!!!!!
shouldve been this from the beginning..
now i just need a cherry bomb redux
This is all I ever wantedüò≠
Yeah you were always so wrong about this one good job
it‚Äôs moments like this people use as benchmarks in musical history
Can u do MIMA by nicole dollanganger üò≠
Wow, I‚Äôm in disbelief
finally this album gets the rating it deserves
Now do House of Balloons
Let&#39;s goooooooo. We&#39;ll take an 8
We forgive u now melon
Thanks Melon, I was waiting for so long to be able to enjoy this album
This is the single best video on his entire YouTube channel ‚ù§
It‚Äôs nice seeing this get the credit it deserves but it is longgg overdue. Where was the love when he was still here..?? :(
FINALLY(I haven&#39;t watched it yet)
It‚Äôs about time he writed this wrong
w
Like it pisses me off so much when he talks. He knows it all without any show of talents. Mac put a ton of passion into this work and it came out beautifully. You got it wrong. Get the fuck over it. Fuck I hate Anthony. Goodam isn&#39;t even his best work fucking watching movies and faces wayyyyy better and anyone who&#39;s been a Mac fan knows this
So all you gotta do is die to get respect from this dude
You were right the first time. A junkie overdosing doesn&#39;t make their garbage any better.
Fun fact, I was having a bad time tripping once and &quot;what&#39;s the use&quot; was able to stop that...greatful
Redeemed yourself melon. Albums incredible üôå
Other Redux reviews you should do:<br>M.I.A. - Maya<br>Joanna Newsom - Have One On Me<br>The Weeknd - Trilogy<br>Lana Del Rey - Ultraviolence or Born to Die<br>Childish Gambino - Because the Internet<br>Sufjan Stevens - Carrie &amp; Lowell<br>AJJ - Knife Man
Finally people can shut up about how Anthony gives Swimming a 3
Ab Soul review coming?
Are you sure about sabas care for me? also sminos noir pls
There we go Anthony. All has been made right in the universe again.
LETS GOOOO
From Mac Miller‚Äôs great catalogue, this forever will be my favorite album. It even fits me better than Circles. The groovynes, the singing, the flows, the lyrics, it is all so great and feels so cohesive as well. Literally no bad song on this thing. One of my favorite albums of all time. Thanks Melon man
Wait until he finds out GO:OD a.m. doesn&#39;t say &quot;good a.m.&quot; but Go OD a.m.
Finally melon. Finally.
Please Fantano you should review volumen 1 of grupo marrano if you do it I stop crying to my ex
Damn Anthony. You just went from a light 6 to a strong 8 in my heart. Subscribed. ‚ù§
I love Anthony and am still a big fan but am I the only one who finds it kinda frustrating that an artist needs to die tragically young in order to take their lyrics of mental health issues with seriousness? It was kind of similar when he spoke about Peep before versus after his passing
Absolutely my favorite Mac project, with Circles as a close second. He really left us too soon.
thank you melon
Miss Mac more every day
lol he caved in
I needed this
Justice is served üò¢
Atta boy fantano üñ§
FINALLY
Good redemption my boy, ur original review was a war crime

This guy just talks and talks eh just give me the rating dawg
LETS FUCKING GOOOOO
Mac Tier list? üëâüëà
when i tell you i yelled with excitement at the 8, finally‚Ä¶ Justice.

This is Awesome for Mac to get the recognition he deserves for this album.üíõüñ§ <br>Anthony can you do a classic review of some Pigface? üê∑
Light 8????? This album was so bad
Hopping on the bandwagon I see. I&#39;m sure the change of score had nothing to do with him dying and becoming a beloved cultural icon and sacred cow. Gross. I&#39;d be pretty embarrassed about scoring the album a 3 too but to flip flop like that... I don&#39;t buy it
The fact that cardi b won best rap album over this still makes me mad
LETS GO PERFECT 17/10
This made my day
Holy shit thank you
your best review in a while anthony! this made me smile from my heart :)
Now that you‚Äôve done this justice, you should redux M83‚Äôs Hurry up, we‚Äôre dreaming. 4/10 is blasphemy
2009 not even in best tracks is criminal. Great to see this album getting more love from you though!
THIS IS A W
Fantano should do a redux review of The Weeknd&#39;s House of Balloons mixtape
I will critic Anthony who is a critic I would like to say that it only my opinion you are doing what you trash artist with like doing the same thing and what not and finally you are a hipocrite I know the spelling is wrong
I agree more with your old review
can sleep peacefully knowing you‚Äôve done justice to this beautiful album
this is an L swimming is literally a 0
HAHAHAHAHAH
Thank goodness. Relief years later.
This was so needed.
Considering how many critics online are happy to stand by bad takes for clout, it&#39;s good to see Ant willing to revisit his more maligned reviews and reconsider his positions. They&#39;re not always gonna change, but I think the energy behind the backlash to this was way different than something like MBTDF, and came from a much more sincere, loving place
Thanks melon I appreciate the sentiment. This just made my day a little better :)
Holy SHIT
You are forgiven for your sins
Mac is missed, i didn‚Äôt know him personally yet apart of me is missing knowing he‚Äôs not here with us anymore:/ So it goes i suppose
he did it finally i asked so many times
you know the vids gonna be good when he starts with &quot;my name is Anthony Fantano&quot;
mac miller is my favorite artist, i love all of his albums
i forgive you
I cannot express how grateful I am for this.<br><br>You do such a great job of articulating everything I love about this album &amp; it means a lot to hear you did indeed come around.
Swimming in Circles - 16/10  confirmed
You&#39;re actually the biggest fraud LOL
We want your opinions on Herbert!!
HE FUCKING DID IT OMG THIS HAS BEEN MY BIGGEST FANTANO OPINION THAT WE I HAVE NEVER CLICKED WITH
It‚Äôs about time
this review made me cry
mea CULpaa
BOUT TIME
Now do it with Kid cudi &quot;Man of the moon 2 &quot;
Giving Swimming a 3/10 was a soul-damning crime, melon. Review HERBERT already. Thanks for giving Mac the respect he deserved when he was still around. Always missing him in the music scene
Still the biggest cop out from fartface considering he didn‚Äôt bring up his original review of swimming in his most hated reviews video. That like/dislike ratio was insane. Since YouTube got rid of it heres his revisionist take and biggest flip around considering macs passing. No integrity, no foundation, all cap. Be better fartface.
Thank you
Reviewing records by a guy who died over 4 years ago....smh. you should be reviewing the best attitude era WWF (WWE) matches instead. Way more relevant.
fantano redemption arc
Glad you realized how wrong you were lol. I remember how widely disliked your review was.
3/10 was fucking crazy dawg. You were buggin
The most anticipated re-review ever when you gave swimming a 3 back in 2018 I didn‚Äôt watch YouTube for a while and questioned life and my region after years of searching for answers I found this video thanks fantano üôèüèª
Melon man aka tofu tony aka ohthony notano you are redeemed for your blasphemous take in 2018
Wow yes!
This made my day. Thank you Anthony
Even melons change their minds
Good for you Melon but I don‚Äôt agree.
Swimming was my favorite album that year. I listened to it front to back CONSTANTLY. <br><br>This was my single biggest gripe with you lmao
W
Bro, from a 3 to a 8? How can I take ur present  opinion on anything serious anymore, guess I&#39;ll have to form my own opinion from now on
Anthony prepares himself for NFR podcast
thanks melon now i&#39;ve been a sobbing mess for an hour and a half after finishing your video
My personal favorite album. This is awesome that you took the time to go back and reevaluate. I also wish you could go back, grab your shoulders, shake you, and ask, ‚Äúwhat were you thinking???‚Äù Glad to see you finally give it some of the recognition that it deserves. I‚Äôll take an 8 over a 3 from you any day for this album.
Thank you melon, now i can stop commenting about it on &quot;the worst fantano reviews lists&quot; and start defending you :D
I thank you for giving this album another fair and critical look. Despite what you initially thought on it; this album when it came out; it...helped me a lot as I was going through some trouble with an ex partner and what Mac was saying/visualizing was really helping putting my feelings at that time into words I could I understand myself.
I&#39;m not terribly into Mac Miller&#39;s music (it has nothing to do with him as an artist, I just haven&#39;t a chance to give his work a deep dive), but I always found it weird that the difference between Circles and Swimming was that large.
MASSIVE W MELON . Appreciated this!
Man i did not expect the light 8, im glad youre seeing eye to eye with your fanbase on the album now its very unique in hip hop imo
goofy angle üò≠
FANTANO REDEMPTION ARC!!
What.
POMO&#39;s contributions to this record can&#39;t be understated!!
Maybe if you gave people a chance and put yer ego aside  before they pass away ... I always loved this album and I strongly disagreed with you then but everyone is the prodigal son I guess ü§£ü§£ü§£üò≠üíîüêªüé∂üåàüôèüòò

Good job üëèüèø
This is a bigger flip than when Anton Ego goes back to Gusteau&#39;s restaurant, takes back his comment of comparing it to Chef Boyardee after having the best Ratatouille of his adult life.
You needed this w melon. Justice is served.
Ngl after seeing this notification I thought Mac&#39;s estate released a Redux version of Swimming and went straight to YT Music to try and find it and couldn&#39;t and googled it and for like 10 minutes I was trying to find this &quot;newly released&quot; version. Then I started watching the video...
For me, the most haunting like in hindsight has to be &quot;you could have the world in the palm of your hand, you still might drop it.&quot; It almost feels like foreshadowing to his tragic passing. We love you, Mac.
NOW REDUX BECAUSE THE INTERNET
Rip üëë Mac
DO A REDUX REVIEW ON CHERRY BOMB
I NEVER THOUGHT HE WOULD DO THIS
oh look, another &#39;selling-out&#39; episode, mixed with the &quot;they died, they are now better than Jesus&quot; thing I have seen firsthand within my own family<br><br>notice the use of quotes, or be stupid and get stuck in a cul-de-sac
We need a Fleetwood Mac review melonhead
cant wait you redux review Eminem‚Äôs Revival so you fan rate it as Eminem‚Äôs best album EVER.
rip to mac. his tiny desk performance was legendary. even though i was never a huge fan, i really enjoyed and appreciated how that live set sounded. a redux that everyone agrees with antknee
finally.
Now we need a redux of Red Light
Hell yea!
WHAT WHAT
I feel like I&#39;m in the same boat as fantano when it comes to this album, I liked a couple tracks when it dropped but as time went on I grew to love this album more and more.
Has he not watched the Mac Miller Tiny Desk concert??? 2009 aint autotuned there and Mac absolutely kills it. Probably his best live performance ever.
Ty melon
A 9 in my book but 8 is fair.  My favorite album of all time either way.  Thanks for the revisit
Never seen this coming
Now go back and listen to Mac‚Äôs Tiny Desk!!!
WWOOOOOOO
thank you mr. fantano
Didn&#39;t mention 2009? STILL NOT HAPPY WITH YOU ANT ANO
Really what is the point of this. Because he died you wanna go back and change your mind?
Whats the point bro
Thank god. Literally his best album
Melon really said ‚ÄúMac is gone, automatic +5 to the score‚Äù
I fucking love Jet Fuel, amazing song
the first mac album I&#39;ve listened too. Never will forget that time
EXACTLY.
It‚Äôs not a redux, you were just misinformed the first time
WANTONY WANTANO

holy W
This was always an 8 Anthony&#39;s ears just grew up.
ABOUT FUCKING TIME
Balance has been restored in the universe
My music ranges from Mississippi John Hurt &gt; Earl Scruggs &gt; Buddy Rich &gt; Johny Cash &gt; James Brown &gt; Zeppelin &gt; Charlie Daniels &gt; Zappa &gt;  Nas &gt; Primus &gt; Biggie &gt; Darkthrone &gt; Judas Priest &gt; Mountain Goats &gt; Eyedea and Abilities &gt; Aesop Rock and everyone in between. Man, it is all over the place I have listened to so much music and Swimming is the only time I was able to confidently say it is my favorite album of all time. Thanks for doing this review this albums means so much to a lot of people.
You should do a classic review of K.I.D.S. . great work melon
honey wake up fantano is repenting for his sins
omg
was just listening to good news
thank god, I can finally listen to this now.
Heck Yeah

Finally, the good endingüç∑üóø
Love this
üò≠üñ§
A whole 5 points up damn.
This is insane to me. To see you change your opinion on this album gave me goosebumps. I remember being so disappointed in your score that I didn‚Äôt even finish your review. I knew this album was great, and means a lot to me. Rest in peace to Mac Miller, gone but his music lasts forever. I always salute when his music comes on.
Sad that it took mac‚Äôs death for this album to get the respect it deserves‚Ä¶ but the redux was certainly nice.
Thank you Melon
Cmon, you know this isn‚Äôt right. The original 3 was generous.
He is redeemed
Justice finally, thank u for this. Now for DIVINE FEMININE!!
Thanks for the redux Anthony. Honestly I started listening to Mac Miller in the 7th grade in 2011. Koolaid and Frozen Pizza will be cemented as one of my favorite rap songs of all time. So simple and the bars were incredible. Mac Miller put me on rap music and gave me the appreciation for production and lyricism. Gave me a whole genre flip. I&#39;m so grateful I got to witness Mac&#39;s career from K.I.D.S to Circles. What a ride too. Swimming felt like that sober moment in your life. The moment you reach some clarity in your life and take a look around. I always wish for more, but I&#39;m glad he&#39;s at rest. RIP to the most dope.
we finally got him boys
thank god
I would love to see a house of balloons redux review given it‚Äôs undeniable influence on dark rnb throughout the whole decade
I love what&#39;s the use it always gets stuck in my bed, best song to sing
HISTORY
HE FINALLY CAME TO HIS SENSES
Honeslty, Nevermind next!!!!!
this is the best thing you‚Äôve ever done
THIS IS WHAT WE&#39;VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR!!!! SO HAPPY YOU ENJOY IT MORE NOW!!!
I don‚Äôt understand the depth to which this guy goes with his music.
i would rather Swimming be an 8 than MBDTF honestly
we forgive you melon, you were only 5 years late but glad you appreciate it now
this album gets me everytime rarely does shit make me feel the way this album does, really helped me thru some dark times
WE WON
Mac Miller was that guy.. So sad. Never forgetting tho.
While this is cool, I just want to point out how me and the rest of your fanbase are utterly disappointed you didn&#39;t review the Ab-Soul album.
Bullying works apparently. Where&#39;s Ab-Soul review?
‚Äúif you aint fuck with me you fuckin up‚Äù<br>thanks for this anthony
bro redeemed himself
Gs needle drop gs
CHUR BUM REDUXX
We ever gonna get a review of Ab Souls new album?
CHERRY BOMB REDUX
Bro knew he took a giant L and now he‚Äôs trying to make up for it. I guess I respect it
Biggest character development in Fantano lore
now all we need is a third review of WLR üíØüíØüíØ
@macmiller<br><br>the end of so it goes is so beautiful man<br><br>I told jon brion to play the ascension into heaven and he nailed it<br><br>1:00 AM ‚Ä¢ 07 Sep 18<br><br>much deserved redux. r.i.p mac
Swimming finally gets the respect it deserves<br><br>Maybe I might forget the other review...
Redux review! So basically, mac miller died and as always i have to boost dead niggas scores a fuckton
‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
Redemptiony Arctano has made this the best Friday the 13th ever. My opinion is finally valid.
thank you Tony.
You reviewing Herbert or what?
He did it.
no, no. Lets not inflate Mac Miller&#39;s legacy just because he&#39;s dead. He was an average artist and always will be. Opinions change but I feel like it&#39;s only changed for you because of his passing. Not because it was just quality from the get go.
first and only time ill ever agree with him
Damn, now Mac Miller has three 8/10 ratings (Swimming REDUX, Circles, Faces reissue).
Been calling for this rereview for a while. The needle heard. Cheers bro
Some of the best character development I‚Äôve ever seen
correct.
Am I the only person that‚Äôs still not crazy about this album?
I don‚Äôt believe your tune changed just because he passed but that maybe your in a better headspace to absorb how beautiful this body of work truly was. Thank you Anthony for going back in the crates and taking the time to re-review this record. Long Live MAC MILLER ‚ù§ü•π
Thank you for reduxing your review on this record.  I was pretty angry with you the first go &#39;round.  This record definitely deserved a re-listen.
now you gotta fix sabas üôè
Lol
Yes finally god
Supposedly a new album coming on the 19th this month for his birthday üôå hope you review it
Look at the size of that W
all is forgiven melon man.
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOO
yes!
Anthony.. i take back everything i love you
Shoulda gave Mac his flowers while he&#39;s still here.
A need more views review

Finally!! Honestly I couldn&#39;t take you seriously when you gave it a 3. Glad you finally get it and are spreading the love!!!!
Thank you for giving this album a second chance dude, massive respect for this. RIP MAC
lord has blessed you

bald man redemption
Bro grifted after his death. Swimming was always a 8 and bro was in it for the long-haul. Awful practices. Sincerely reconsider how you score albums and leave personal opinions about the artist out
i have been waiting 5 years for this video
I can finally respect your opinion again thank you
do luv is rage 2 next. Easily one of the most beloved trap tapes of the last decade along with LUV vs the world
VINDICATION AT LAST
I wasn&#39;t a big fan of Mac when he dropped Swimming, hearing his untimely death, and listening to Swimming for the first time back in like 2020, I relate to it, since I&#39;m going thru something that time, it made me a big fan, and seeing him as my hero now, he became one of favorite artist, and Mac never left my top 5 Spotify yearly Wrapped Up Artist, for me he&#39;s one of the biggest artist in this generation, not just a rapper, but an artist. Love live Mac, we miss you!
Awesome to see you&#39;ve come around over time melon!
Mac Miller fans: I can‚Äôt believe you gave Swimming a 3 we demand a redux review. <br>Fantano: <b>does the redux review and gives it an 8</b><br>Mac Miller fans: this is obviously fan service I can‚Äôt believe you gave it an 8 just because he died. <br><br>Pick a side, people.
Swimming is still one of my personal favorite album because of how raw and genuine it feels. Mac always seemed to be able to pull the listener into his state of mind and it always felt like an invitation to self reflect alongside him.
It‚Äôs a 10/10 for me still
This is peak fanservice
OMG HE DID IT, HE FINALLY DID IT!! AHHH
What about Balloonerism
finally redeemed yourself
PROTIP: die to have a better score
Glad you actually feel this album at this point. We can confirm Anthony has a heart guys lol. Jokes aside, doesn&#39;t seem you did this or even you as a person would do this to please others opinions. But you definitively did tho xD
It sucks artists have to die to get the respect they deserve
Finally doing this record some justice
obviously the original score was shocking but i dont know which was worse, the score or comparing 2009 to a torture chamber
Dunno is one of my favorite songs ever.
APOLOGIZE ANTHONY
Thank you Mr. Melon. Long live Mac Miller
the good ending
We won.
Grande Fantano! No pens√© que este d√≠a llegar√≠a üò¢
YEHAHAHHHHHH
Anthony Fantano is Officially Valid again
W
I know it‚Äôs just his opinion but seeing it with a 8 made me smile. Long Live Mac 92 til Infinity
He&#39;s only doing this because of NFR isn&#39;t he
YESSSSSSSSSSS
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOO
you just had to wait until he DIED to give him his props for making this masterpiece???
This is proof that bullying works.
I thought your first Swimming review was the worst one I have ever seen, by far. I kinda stopped taking your opinions seriously after that.
Such a relief that he came around to this outstanding piece of art and recognized its significance. Shoutout to Melon, RIP Mac Miller ‚ù§
god bless melon, god bless üôèüèªüçà
Yes.
Wantano
Don&#39;t let this distract you from the fact he&#39;s trying to erase the fact that he gave Hurry Up, We&#39;re Dreaming by M83 a 4
3 to an 8..... literally just hating on the original review. took the dude to die to realize how good the album is. pretty sad tbh
When producing the end of so it goes, mac asked his producer to &quot;play the sound of someone ascending to heaven&quot;. That ending of the song was the last thing he posted on his story before overdosing.<br>This is my all time fav album, getting a mac related tattoo next week ‚úå
Every time u listen to Swimming it gets better and better
I‚Äôve been waiting for this for so long man. Long live Mac ‚ù§
Rip Mac most dope forever thanks for redoing this review Anthony
Thanks for reconsidering, melon.
My respect for Anthony is back, his willingness to accept how he misunderstood the deeper meanings and beauty in his first review is huge. I still believe that the album still had a lot of meaning before his death, and that his death didn&#39;t change or make the album better, but it is understandable to see just how deep his lyrics hit after the fact. He comments on how Mac&#39;s vocals arenn&#39;t amazing but I think that adds to the beauty of the album and how beautifully imperfect mac was,. This album will always be a 10 to me, but an 8 from Anthony is respectable. Mac was too good for this earth, rest in peace.
I believe Mac would have been proud and genuinely happy to see this, which means a lot. Thanks for taking the time Anthony!
&quot;Woke up this morning with a bright idea... Maybe I can exist forever right here&quot;<br><br>RIP Mac üôè
Not a fan of this review.<br>Not because I care about your opinion on Swimming, necessarily, but because you have gone on record saying that your opinion has drastically changed. It demonstrates that you aren&#39;t infallible, are human, and are not the definitive tastemaker. Instead of doubling-down like always, you changed your mind and it has thrown my opinions into chaos.
YES YES YES
Just here to say that &quot;Mac Miller forever&quot; felt nice
Thank you really for re reviewing it. It‚Äôs easily one of Mac‚Äôs best albums ever.
The mounting pressure from Lil Xan finally got to him.
Alright I see some progression. Next step, House of Balloons.
thank god
This Is Fake love
Still one the best NPR Tiny Desks
SB2H REDUX NEXT MELON, YOU GOTTA ADD A 1 IN FRONT OF THAT 0
Thank you for un-3-ing this masterpiece dear daddy melon.<br>I will be looking for you in heaven once i die. &lt;3
First Fantano W in a long while ngl
I wonder if you would have done this if Mac was still alive.<br>Not trying to call out any hypocrycies, I would probably assign more impact and emotions to this album now too.<br>The question is, do some artists need to die for us to take them more seriously?
Thanks Anthony. RIP Mac‚ù§
Can finally subscribe to melon now
I‚Äôve been watching your videos since 2015 and I must say that I think this is the most respectable and necessary review you‚Äôve ever done. Thank you for showing that art and our digestion of it can be a process that is shaped by our environment and the events surrounding the creation of said art. I appreciate you melon for all you‚Äôve done and I hope this is a moment that we as a fan base will remember when we consider your legacy later on.
Hope one day he sees the light with trilogy
This is a historic moment for the Anthony Fantano lore.
nice
You should redux review public strain by women
So Kanye just has to die to get MBDTF above a 6?
Where‚Äôs ab soul
Faces redux?

Loved this album immediately and it only hit harder after Mac Miller‚Äôs death. Now it makes me cry every listen and even watching this video made me teary eyed. Appreciate your new perspective on the album!
There is justice in this world
All is good in the world
Its time for a redux of House of Balloons by the Weeknd.
His singing was so good I think hes gonna get a strike
Yes, thank you ü§©
thank you for this melon man. RIP MAC
what did u mean by &quot;2pac but without all the crime&quot;?
W
Always thought this man was crazy for the the first one
Thank the Lord you fixed that review üòÇ
OH HELL YEAAAAAAAAAAA<br>fav album all time wooooo
ANTHONY PLEASE TELL US WHAT MAC PROJECT YOU THINK IS HIS BEST! You‚Äôve given Faces, Circles, and Swimming an 8 now!!
YOOO
hollly fuck holly fuck it HAPPEND LFG
i always find it funny that people don‚Äôt realise you cant make an accurate review based off just one listen through an album. i have found MULTIPLE times that various albums that don‚Äôt particularly impress me at first, get better and better on repeat listens until I end up falling in love with them. so much more goes into how you feel about music than just your two ears - your emotions and feelings at the time, where you are, what you‚Äôre doing, how your weeks been going. a lot of people should be more open minded imo.
Biggest W redux
im gonna cry thank you
this is one of my favorite albums of his
Ok now do &#39;The OOZ&#39;
based fantano no notes
ITS FINALLY HAPPENING BOISSS
Thankyou Anthony
Holy Fuck he gave it an 8
nice runback anthony
watermelon based for this. feelin a 10
this is a moment for the BOOKS!
I‚Äôve always loved this album since the first time I listened to it and it really surprised me that melon initially didn‚Äôt like it,but this redux review really put a smile on my face.<br>Rest in peace Mac
LETS GO
LET&#39;S FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
YESSSSS
Yesssss
eyyy finally ü§©
This was needed, and apreciated
Says he doesn‚Äôt like the singing on swimming as his excuse, but probably ate that shit up on Circles. Faketano. <br>Being real, I don‚Äôt believe anyone with real emotional depth can listen to Swimming and say it isn‚Äôt an unbelievable album.
sensational (in future&#39;s voice)
I miss Mac Miller. ü•≤
Holy fuck what a thing to wake up to
So when u gonna give revival redux review?
Now go back and re-review ‚ÄúThe Most Lamentable Tragedy.‚Äù You really biffed it on that one.
nice to know its good now that he died
Mac gettin the paraise he deserves, puts a smile on my face
About time Melon, we appreciate this
this is my all time favorite album no question, thank you Anthony for taking a better view
This felt very genuine. It‚Äôs heartwarming and almost emotional to see Swimming get this review from the world‚Äôs most consumed critic. Love seeing people enjoy it. Thank you, Anthony.
I sincerely hope not recognizing Mac&#39;s talent and sincerity while he was alive haunts you beyond the grave, cuz this redux, nor your tears at Circles will ever change your trash take.
finally
Where ab soul tho you stinky littlean or smth I don&#39;t mean it fr fr ly
Where‚Äôs my AB SOUL review
You we‚Äôre right the 1st time
HE&#39;S DONE IT!
a 3 was rough to say the least, but more context and time with the album getting it up to an 8 from the same person is fantastic. long live mac, and thank for you for the review
We need a redux of Because of the Internet by Childish Gambino
god thank u for doing this, ive been listening to swimming and circles a lot recently and seeing swimming get its redux is the cherry on top of the cake
REDEMPTION ARC
This is mad vindicating.<br><br>I&#39;ve always been a massive lover of this album, feels nice to hear him come around to appreciating it.
Honestly this is my favorite Mac miller album. It‚Äôs his most mature and tightest.
YES
mac miller forever
No way NFR actually bullied him into doing a redux review
okay now do care for me
Melon redemption arc is in full effect
W redux review
Thank you so much for this Anthony! üíó
:)
My favourite album of all time, What‚Äôs The Use? is such a banger
Very nice Tony, it was always an 8. Happy for the redux
Mea culpa mea culpa mea maxima culpa.
I know it‚Äôs just his opinion y‚Äôall but this meant a lot. Thanks Melon
Never expected this. Im happy
Damn right ‚ÄúMac Miller forever‚Äù ü§ç
im just too proud of melon rn
this is great
FINALLY!
FINALLY
Fantano finished the circles to turn the 3 to an 8... what growth
YES YES YES
thank you for this, mustache man
Grande la caida de un clavo por hacer justicia a este √°lbum
I‚Äôm not gonna lie something about hearing you review mac‚Äôs music again made this hit me exceptionally hard. Rest In Peace Mac Miller. Most dope forever.
ok good looks teeth man but you need to do the same with because the internet. RIP MAC
This is top tier character development
Mac Miller forever. Damn straight.
Ab soul bro wtf
Fantano is gonna make us cry
This is interesting. I can‚Äôt remember where but I think on his meme channel he had an interview/questionaire where he mentions that he almost never commits drastic changes in terms of review scores; iirc he‚Äôd usually only raise it a score or 2. <br><br>Going from 3 to 8 is pretty interesting
W
Now do Stoney
Anthony actually seems really positive as of late. Fingers crossed everything is cool in his life atm.
THE WORST REVIEW HAS BEEN REDEEMED
Finally a redux for posthumous first albums with Mac miller RIP bro Mac‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è.
I remember wanting your melon on a spike after that original Swimming review. I still love that album to this day.
if you actually thought this album was an 8 you would have given it more than a 3 when it came out you fraud. all of a sudden he died and now you‚Äôre a fan
i used to pray for times like this
This is essentially the wet dream of any person‚Äôs favourite album that got a 3.
YES. APRROVE
So sorry anthony I already paid the mafia members the deposit to bust your kneecaps from the last review
3 to 8 is a bit of a copout fantano ngl, i find that hard to believe
Thank you Anthony for giving us closure, fans anticipated his passing and felt the details<br>im glad you came to terms
Nature healed after this one<br><br>One of my top 5 albums of all time :)
Wow. I never thought I‚Äôd see the day.
Who‚Äôs pants are melon trying to get into redoing this review?
IT&#39;S TIME FOR ULTRAVIOLENCE RE-DO
U were dumb, but no longer (perhaps)
Long live Mac. You helped me grow as a human being through your vibrations. Thank you always. And I‚Äôm so happy it has grown on Melon, Mac was reaching an artistic peak before his passing, and I feel blessed to be here to witness his beautifully fun and warming discography.
All is good in the world now
You changed your mind because he died pretty much, nice
nice
‚Äûmy regrets look just like reviews that I once did‚Äú <br>-Macthony Swimmtano (2023)
Mature of you melon
If anything, this review is concurrent with the albums messages of yearning for  second chances and growth. Good on you, Anthony.
Fantano does a Swimming Redux.<br><br><b>Everyone liked that.</b>
When I heard this album, I just loved it and always assumed it reviewed well. Next I&#39;ll find out you don&#39;t like mdbtf.
W
this album is at least a 9 but ill take it, thank you melon
still don&#39;t like it
If I had to choose one album to listen too for the rest of my life it‚Äôd be this one. It means that much to me‚ù§Ô∏è
We did it! Bullied him on TikTok enough to admit Swimming is a W
i made you do this
W Melon
good review
YEEEEESSSSS THANK GOD
Starting the year off STRONG
Thank you rethony duxtano
Glad you finally saw the light
I get it.. but as a fan of the channel... what should i do with your future takes??? Art is subjective especially if the artist has passed away?? Love u melon keep it up.
I&#39;ve fallen in love with his music and i&#39;m so glad this got such a high grade, really hope his relatives decide to rerelease another mixtape like they did the last 2 years
Most needed redux
mac miller sucked.
Long live Mac Miller &lt;3
Uh oh
He‚Äôs now corrected his worst take

MBDTF Redux
I‚Äôm proud of you Melon. That old review made me question every review after it, well done
humilitythony admitiwaswrongtano here
justice
you have been made whole in the eyes of the lord
best review of all time
ok now mbdtf
I think what happened is that melon finally understood it. Why Mac to him sounded so down lifeless and monotone, is because that‚Äôs exactly what it‚Äôs like being in that dark place. His description of wings illustrates this perfectly just assessing your bad state one on one.
Not a lot of people were talking about this album now they are enjoying it. Goes to show artists don‚Äôt get their flowers until they‚Äôre gone . RIP Mac
I did enjoy this album. But that doesn‚Äôt mean your original review was wrong. It was a simultaneously good and underdone/boring at times album. I think 6 or 7 out of 10 for me.
Props for going back and admitting you&#39;ve changed your mind, especially when so many people were giving you shit for your previous opinion.
DAMN RIGHT
Finallyyy
10k like and 55 dislikes. <br><br>Dude, that&#39;s Jesus will.
Yeah yeah but he dead now. Should made this review when he was still Alive dumbass
He finally gets it. üôå
Only switching up cause Mac died
This album literally saved my life and despite me recognizing that it‚Äôs just your opinion I was bothered with how dismissive your first review was. He‚Äôs never been a great singer, he‚Äôs hardly a good one but it‚Äôs the dryness of his voice and his delivery that makes the songs hit so much more. It feels so much more real with his singing voice, you can tell it was just an expression of his feelings. I can‚Äôt play a song off this album without feeling emotional even still and to have you review this again didn‚Äôt further validate my own opinion but gave me a relief that others appreciate the deeper meaning of everything he‚Äôs saying
Finally i can rest in peace.
you are a liar
oh that‚Äôs crazy
Do Yeezus next!
2 hours after posting, this already has more likes than the original review.
anthony never rate a mac album again please
Now do my beautiful dark twisted fantasy
REDUX = getting so fed up with negative comments you get pressured into giving an album a higher score
I remember giving you a dislike in the previous review, was really disappointed with that 3/10 since it was my favorite album of that year. Glad the score&#39;s changed
finally, swimming and circles are my two favorite albums to date. Ive spent more time with the albums than id like to admit but something about em man i will never stop listening to them. Its nice to see your feelings have changed and that most the people in the comments seem to enjoy it. Thank you for giving swimming the flowers it deserves.
Massive W for this redux review, this album went from a 3/10 which is a crime against humanity to a well deserved 8/10! One of my favorite albums ever, RIP to Mac.
‚ÄúThe arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice‚Äù -MLK
YES
Maturity
I literally was watching that review this morning
I can finally listen to this album!
We stan growth now re review Luv Is Rage 2 another classic you called a 3
FINALLY
REDEMPTION !1!!1
redemption arc
my favorite album has finally been done justice üôèüèº
Swimming and Circles from Mac Miller üñ§ü§ç Saved my life from taking it myself these two albums will always be my favorite.
i love you fantano, i really do
Its so ironic i was actually re-listening to Mac‚Äôs catalogue recently. I‚Äôm glad Anthony has too
Now do Circles that album 10/10
Sad that themes of the album became more interesting to some people only after his passing but that&#39;s how it is I guess
Finally you did the album justice melons
My top 5: Small Worlds, Jet Fuel, 2009, Conversation, Self Care<br><br>such a good album
Now its time for MBDTF Redux Redux review where you finally give it a 10,  Melon.
FINALLY BITCH DAMN
What !!!
Last summer I got really into this album. Jet fuel was on repeat.
now redux drakes&#39; clb
first W in your career
Much love Fantano‚ù§
What a redemption arc. Well deserved
Wow. I was talking about when you&#39;d drop this review just yesterday and boom.
He&#39;s written one of his wrongs
biggest W ever
This album sucks just as much as when it came out what u on about. It didn‚Äôt change
Ditto
The original Swimming review was always the one I disagreed with you the most on, so I‚Äôm glad that you‚Äôve come around on it.
Thank you for taking the time to do this album justice.
This is the one of the very few times where melon&#39;s goofs would have not been tolerated. On its own, swimming is an album that was readying us for what&#39;s to come, which circles over delivered. There will never be another Mac
tldr didnt like him till he died
Don&#39;t forget swimming dropped the same day as astro world.<br>definitely feel like that impacted its reception as its quite the leap to go from that albums punchy beats to mac&#39;s moody lyrics.
Justice is Served.üôåüèæ
Mashallah
Damn went from a 3 to a 8
Still one of my favorite rap albums ever
LONG LIVE MAC!! fly high mr. fishermanüïäÔ∏è
i am fucking healed. thanks for giving it more thought and a chance fantanthony
Always wondered how he ranked this so low it is a great album
All is finally right in the world.
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HOLY SHIT
Great, you‚Äôve gotta die to give import to lyrics
If Mac hadn&#39;t passed away he&#39;d still be getting Decent 3&#39;s on his new stuff. The post-death hype is all smoke and the revisionism is crazy.
he gotta do this with a lot more records
NATURE IS HEALING
finalmente careca, fico feliz com esse redux ü§çüñ§
time for the house of balloons redux review üôÑ

Waiting for Divine Feminine now ü•±
Wtf review Ab soul
YESSIR WE DID IT
made me tear up, Melon Man. thank you for this.
i was hoping for an Enquiring Minds classic review for Gangsta Boo but this is cool too
It‚Äôs always been an 8 you mf
Could‚Äôve told you this during the first review but nooooo Melon-head wouldn‚Äôt listennnn ‚Ä¶
Nah too late bro i already formed my opinion on this. Its a 3/10 imo
2009 makes me cry
I don&#39;t even care about the numerical score you gave it, I&#39;m just truly joyful you came around to appreciating this album like so many of us have :-)
You don‚Äôt know how much this means to me I love your videos and this is one of my favourite albums of all time‚Ä¶ so happy you finally see what everyone else sawüíôüíôüíô
Finally, I‚Äôve been waiting for this for years, thank you
Thanks for re-reviewing this one Anthony, I‚Äôm glad you came round to it. I knew you would.üíôüíôüíô
Don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve seen the video, but Dissect podcast discovered that the whole rhyming scheme in Conversations Pt. 1 is actually just the ‚ÄúAy‚Äù sound. I don‚Äôt think I noticed it until it was revealed to me, he blended it in so well.
Justice is served.
thank you ‚ù§
Thank you, Anthony! I can finally tell everyone how much I like this album XD
YEESSSSSSS!!!!!
Learning to admit when you‚Äôre wrong takes strength. Great review Anthony
ive been waiting for this for years - thanks for making things right.
Dude dies so he goes from a 3 to an 8? Come on dude. You don‚Äôt have to like it bro, this is just sad and disingenuous. Everyone else can be excited about their favorite druggy white boy getting respect üíØ or whatever, this is just goofy to me
Big L, this album sucks.
Big w for melon here giving this album a fair shake
Perfect timing, just got my mac tattoo. Thanks for doing my boy justice, such an amazing album
real
Finally.
He shouldn‚Äôt have given it a score
House of Balloons next
Now do Bladee some justice you clearly like him now
Thank you fantano i‚Äôm allowed to like the album now
LETS FUCKING GO
This feels like a deep wound finally healed. Glad it came around to you

this made me happy
long live mac<br>thats insane how you just correct yourself from your previous rating 3 to 8 you just gave mac his flowers
Im glad you found your ways mr melon
Justice
good boy
This is the review I was hoping for the first time around, and I remember being so confused by some of your criticisms. Thank you for your re-review on this, Swimming remains as one of my all-time favorite albums from an artist who left us much too soon.
This change in score has convinced me to reveal that I watched two children get kidnapped in on june 18 in the summer of 1996 and did nothing to stop it.
THE CLASSIC
MASSIVVEEEEE W
finally!
Please Rereview CHERRYBOMB
nice one fandango
Vindication!!
Your last review of this album was vomit buddy
this just made my day, thanks anthony. rest in peace mac ‚ô°
Finally!! Swimming is undoubtably the best Mac Miller album if not the best.<br><br>R.I.P Mac Miller
i forgive you
HOL UP!!! FROM A 3 TO AN 8?!?!?! Ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmm....okay.
Revisit Care For Me by Saba
I stopped watching you for like a year after you dropped the first review lol. So glad to see the redux
Its a ten buddy but we will let you slide this time DanFanto.
This really made my day. Thank you Melon for recognizing the magic that&#39;s within this album that has helped a lot of people ‚ù§
Yo didn‚Äôt realize you gave Swimming a low score initially, that‚Äôs so wild to me man. His vocals aren‚Äôt meant to be top notch, it‚Äôs a vibe. I love this album . I‚Äôm questioning you now Anthony üòÇ. At least you came to your senses . RiP MAC üôè
Listened to Swimming for the first time around last October or so and it‚Äôs quickly become and all time favorite for me. He was on another level. Glad you came around. Rest in love Mac.
Top 10 anime villains who redeemed themselves
Biggest W of all time
DONT FORGET ANTHONY STILL GAVE DAMN a 7/10
WAS NOT EXPECTING THIS
IVE BEEN WAITING SO LONG
excellent character development anthony
I stand with the original score. 3/10 album all the way.
Percecto bangs, you still managed to fuck this up
Wings truly stands out from the rest of the album as a depressively honest 10/10
RISPEKTTTTT
I stayed subscribed, but after your first take on Swimming I really can‚Äôt recall watching any of your reviews after that. Glad to see you have redeemed yourself on this insanely amazing album
Def needed this justice
Shoulda kept the same energy as the first review lil bro
Anthony I‚Äôm just glad you finally enjoy this thing. Redux review did it justice
Thank you.
I think this goes to illustrate how subjective and ephemeral music truly is, that you can hear the same material at 2 different times in your life and have completely differing responses
amazing.
Now I by no means know even a fraction of the music that you do but the Swimming 3 was always the single biggest thing that made me question the validity of your opinions. <br><br>I would think ‚ÄúOh, he gave ‚Äúsuch and such‚Äù an 8, maybe I should check it out, but then again he did give Swimming a 3..‚Äù <br><br>I always said to myself that whether you like Swimming or not it is objectively much better than a 3 and should be closer to a 7 at minimum. <br><br>This redux was well needed and seeing that you not only changed your opinion but that you changed it to a light 8 removes a huge asterisk I always had next to your reviews and I appreciate the effort. <br><br>With this redux you‚Äôve nudged us ever so slightly into a timeline I feel better about living in and I‚Äôm here for it ü§ô
THANK YOU MELON ü´°ü´°ü´°
ALAS, REDEMPTION!!
Great job tony, now time for Carrie and Lowell redux review
Now fix 2014fhd
MAJOR W
My life is finally worth living again<br>RIP Mac<br>üíô
This was my first Mac Miller album and I loved it from start to finish, then went back and love the rest of his discography. Glad you‚Äôre able to enjoy this album now too
Finally Fantano came full Circle
Thanks for sharing melon, glad you like it too
Gracias Anthony por hacerle justicia a este hermoso √°lbum &lt;3
LETS GOOOOOOOOO
Now we need a redux on house of balloons
Wow, the original score is the main reason I don&#39;t respect Fantano&#39;s opinion on music. Good thing he&#39;s recognizing the error of his ways.
I love life, thank you
Thank GOD now redux the Saba album
Looks like Anthony finally learned how to Swim üôèüèæ RIP Macüò≠üò≠
YESSSSSS
mac miller forever &lt;3
Long live Mac Miller
Wow, finally Anthony changed his opinion on an album he disliked and we loved, this is the happiest day of our lives.<br><br>Unsubscribed.
Love you Mac
Wow this is a major Fantano W
ü•áü•á
now do MBDTF
I give this review 6/10
HE APOLOGIZED.<br><br>(Peter Parker voice) I forgive you.
Glad to finally see the score it deserves!
alright egg head, i&#39;ll listen to your reviews again
I CAN FINALLY DIE IN PEACE
Faces next?<br>Mac Miller forever ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
A well needed review, enough said
W
W
Shame on you for not giving the praise that was deserved when he was alive to hear it
Yeah that&#39;s right. That&#39;s right
Wow my heart hurts
His performance of 2009 on Tiny Desk is fantastic
WHAT
Wow was not expecting this but I‚Äôm glad you decided to give it a re-review and rate it more fairly. This is my favorite album of all time but you know what‚Äôs funny, I actually didn‚Äôt like it upon my first listen or two. This album is one you can‚Äôt ingest immediately.
holy shit he undid it. He undid the worst review on the entire channel
You&#39;re going to need to REDUX those latest Brockhampton albums as well.
Ironic i listened to this album again this morning not knowing this review was coming out only to see him recognize how great it is
the world didn‚Äôt appreciate mac enough while he was still alive. glad you‚Äôre giving this record the props it deserves.
This has gotta be the greatest comeback of all time
This is my favourite album so far. This album is magic to me. It still pulls me in and makes me tear up. I love you Mac, from 92 til infinity
Most dope, that&#39;s forever
i never thought i‚Äôd see the day, tears in my eyes‚Ä¶
I definitely didn‚Äôt rate this album super highly when it came out. I personally gave it something like a 5-6. But lately I‚Äôve been listening to it more and it‚Äôs definitely a good album. Amazing
I can finally be at peace with my original positive thoughts about this album
<b>Offtopic</b> Can you pleaseeeeee review Sematary&#39;s new mixtape butcher house?
Finally a review i can agree with. God bless üôè
This was always the most L fantano opinion to me.
praise be
Mr melon sir can you do a redux for testing
Thank you üôèüèº
Mac miller Forever
Me too bro. His last couple projects were all like 7-8 for me. I was a big fan since movies with the sound turned off. But my roommate is a massive fucking mac fan. So i would hear random tidbits and then remember oh yeah. I think he has very livable, very approachable groovy type music.
Finally giving this album the score it deserved. Now if we could only get a BECAUSE THE INTERNET REDUX REVIEW
Im very happy you did this Melon, truly done it justice how it was meant. Big love, RIP Mac.
this feels the same as keemstar not being transphobic anymore
Your god damn right
GODDD DAMNNN I‚Äôve never been happier in my whole lifeeee‚Ä¶.. thank you, melonnn
Would this score be getting reduxed if he didn‚Äôt die though ?
Such a beautiful album
Legit stood up and applauded my screen watching this vid. Glad u like it melon
OPRAH GIF
I hated this album when it came out. I agree with the melon though. It really grew on me. Still doesn‚Äôt hold a candle to his party rap (that shit was special) but I would say I agree with this new score much more than the old one. RIP Mac
Fuckin love this album. Good on ya for the redux here. Was needed
are mac miller fans happy now? i want blank face now
So Ab-Soul and Westside Boogie‚Äôs albums just dont exist?
Come to earth not a fav??
I hate to be negative, but to me, this proves you‚Äôre bias in your reviews. I don‚Äôt believe this was a ‚Äúgrew on you‚Äù type situation. I believe you just didn‚Äôt give it a fair shot the first go around. And this is not the only case.
LETS FUCKING GO
knowing the fate of mac, going back and re-listening to a lot of his music hits way different. Some examples: Ascension, Perfect Circle/Godspeed, The Festival, I am Who Am, Someone Like You, Aquarium.
This album is not that great
Legendary
FINALLY
It‚Äôs nice to see you change your opinion for the better on an album with themes of mental health. How about you do Oblivion Access next?
Massive W
Wait, what is Fantano&#39;s worst take now?
REVIEW HERBERT!!!
This album saved my life. Most dope forever, hope you‚Äôre doing well up there Mac.
Wow, I actually got tears in my eyes after hearing the score... what a victory. This album is still a 9 in my mind but this&#39;ll do for sure.
Holy shit this album really grew on him
Speeding Bullet 2 Heaven redux next let‚Äôs gooooooooooo
THANKS GOD
This vid made me wonder if Anthony will do another ‚Äúten times I changed my opinion on an album‚Äù vid. I‚Äôd be excited for that honestly
fuck yes fuck yes fuck yes. Redemption arc completed.
Jeez someone feels guilty
Stop writing tons of comments so fast.
He only did this because of the woke mob
yeah I know u feel silly this is an amazing album
Huge W
No matter if it took you almost 5 years to make a redux of the album, you still have have my respect melon! MOST DOPE ‚ô•Ô∏è
You&#39;re allowed to come to Pittsburgh again. Thank you Anthony
I do wish that Fantano would have liked 2009 but at least he appreciates the album as a whole more
FINALLY
do mbdtf now
I thought there wasn&#39;t any context that could double an album&#39;s score
Thank u this album means so much.
Anthony did you ever review ab souls new album?
YES HE DID IT
This is awesome man. Thanks for doing thisü§ç
you didnt like any of his albums before he died, why are you like this?
3 to 8? <br><br>Mac Miller‚Ä¶ uhhh, forever!!!
Wow look at that üò¢
üåÖü§≤üèª
YES
I just have to remind myself that this was designed as part one of a two piece project when taking into account it‚Äôs one  dimensional themes and motifs. Aside from that, this album honestly is a no skip for me on most listens. It was a confident unpacking of some very uncomfortable demons and issues.
This is definitely one of my favorite Mac albums next to Faces and Watching Movies, glad you came around to it man
Although I like Anthony and his reviews, I&#39;ve never seen it more than just an opinion. But I&#39;m so glad he re-reviewed this album, as a huge mac fan I liked the album at first, but as time has gone on I&#39;ve loved it more and more. I&#39;m glad Anthony gave it another shot and hopefully this encourages new listeners to such an incredible artist.
all macs music sucks cock, i cant find one redeemable aspect of it. just look at the awful tiny desk that he did before he died and thankfully stopped making music
Wow wow wow. Never thought I‚Äôd see the day. Love this, rest in peace Mac.
Can&#39;t help but feel like if he was still alive it would still be a 3. Death of the artist can cause quite a bias..
This doesn‚Äôt make any sense
this gives me peace!
Thank god, I always thought that you did this album way too dirty. Thank you Mellon
I forgive you :)
a frustrating sentiment in some ways that he seems so much more appreciated after his death, but still beautiful to see the impact and appreciation going beyond what was here in his time. long live mac, glad this album is getting the love it deserves
Nice try, but I still won&#39;t forgive you for the first review Melon
look at melon all grown up and shit. much deserved redux, im so glad that 5 years after its debut I can finally tell my friends I like this album
It‚Äôs so refreshing to see him put this on the same level as Circles instead of say Certified Lover Boy. This and House of Balloons were the reviews I felt warranted a redux the most so I‚Äôm glad to see this one bump its score up by so much.
Very happy. I could cry
This made my day. Im glad you gave thought on every piece of the record, I‚Äôve had this on vinyl since it‚Äôs release because I knew it was amazing from the start. Long live Mac
This is the most important review he‚Äôs ever done.
Thank you
I was in a similar spot. I found Swimming really dissappointing at release but reassessed it a little after his passing and now after Circles I think the two albums play into each other beautifully. sometimes it does sadly take losing someone to truly appreciate what they brought to the world. RIP MAC MILLER ‚ù§
If only we got that third album in Mac&#39;s series. 1) Swimming, 2) Circles, and whatever the third album may have been. Maybe one day we get a release somewhat but I&#39;m not sure. Even some tracks from this third, or just a preview PLS
Thanks for the act of humbleness.
Yo the sharpness on this video is a bit strong
Now we need a real re review of whole lotta red
Thank you Anthony, Swimming is so intricate and deep. To me, it is the better album of the Swimming in Circles cycle.
Don‚Äôt u dare disrespect this again
wow.
My favorite review descriptions are the short ones.<br>‚Ä¢ Mac Miller ‚Äì <i>Swimming</i> (Redux, 8/10): &quot;Mea culpa.&quot;<br>‚Ä¢ Lingua Ignota ‚Äì <i>SINNER GET READY</i> (10/10): &quot;Hallelujah.&quot;<br>‚Ä¢ Tones and I ‚Äì <i>Welcome to the Madhouse</i> (0/10): &quot;Where&#39;s the exit?&quot;
DAMMMMN STRAIGHTTTTT. Love to see Melon changing his mind on this one, respect.
Too late. The damage is already done, Melon.
Thank you
‚ù§
I know that mac miller is not the best rapper or artist in the industry, but he will forever be one of, if not my favorite, artist of all time
how is 2009 not in fav tracks fr
This makes me really happy. Thank you for looking back at it.
Him talking about learning the bassline to whats the use was surreal lmao I was the same way I just had to learn it after I saw that tinydesk with thundercat
LETS GOOOOOOO this is huge ‚ù§
Thank you
The good ending
I remember considering getting into Mac&#39;s music around the time this came out even though I was put off from his frat boy personality. I saw the reviews for Swimming and Devine Feminine, and decided to just skip on him altogether. Halfway through 2020, I randomly decided to listen to Swimming, and within 20 seconds, I was so mad I didn&#39;t give him or this album a chance based on some reviews. I almost teared up so soon into an album from someone I never knew much about.
RIP Mac Miller, forever.
Very glad you came back to this
Well done, Anthony. I knew you wouldn&#39;t fail us. This is a very important moment to your legendary legacy.
absolute respect. this was probably my favorite mac album after it dropped and was incredibly stoked for the upcoming support tour. after he passed, it really made the album hit ten times harder. your first review was very disappointing. super happy to see this redux!
wow he finally did it he DESPRERATTEE
Rip to my favorite white rapper Mac Miller üôèüèæ
R.I.P Mac
holy shit what a big W finally
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
It made me very happy for someone to describe this album so eloquently . Swimming holds enormous emotional weight to me, even its faults add a special flavour that makes this record amazing.
Knew the redux was gonna up the score
I never thought id live to see this happen, this is one of my favorite albums of the past decade
Yeezus redux next
Great album review as always.
Big smile on my face this entire video
best redux
It&#39;s happened
been waiting for this moment all my life
History
This has to be one the best redemption arcs
Nah, most of mac discography is still mediocre at best.
Anthony you suck for not rating this album higher. When it first came out. Suck an amazing album you can really tell Mac put his spirit in this album.
I wonder if the NFR Podcast has something to do with this, considering they have a video with Fantano coming out on Monday about some of his more controversial reviews.
Bravo Anthony. One of my favorite albums of all time and thank you for reassessing your opinion.
I&#39;m glad I gave this one more time cause I didn&#39;t love it at first. A really beautiful album. RIP.
I was just glad he gave it a redux at all, then he leave me with an 8 üò£üò≠ happy fucking Friday everybody
The best redux review ever
He finally righted his biggest wrong. Proof that humans can evolve and change with time. <br><br>(Btw I&#39;m getting a swimming related tattoo tomorrow, give me some poggers(or just tell me to fvck off, that&#39;s cool too) please üòÅüëç)
Holy Mac you just made my day melon
Lmao, we bullied him so much in the comment section in the original review.
Only rating it good cuz he&#39;s dead
NO WAY
This made me happy
Everyone hated on Mac cuz he was white but when he died everyone suddenly forgot
Justice :)
I&#39;m speechless <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Fantano really gave this album praise
I knew this album was good, I fucking KNEW IT
I‚Äôve always felt like mac‚Äôs singing and cadences are performative and added to his ‚Äúhigh life‚Äù persona that developed into addiction and pain (what it‚Äôs REALLY like living a life high) as he got older
HELL YEAH! So happy this album grew on you, I love it so much.
House of balloons next por favor
Now Thats what I call character development. Now do The Ooz Redux
Anyone interested should also consider checking Dissect Podcast breakdown on this entire album.
YES FINALLY<br>Respect on this gem
Dirty feet üò≥
Giving Mac Miller an 11/10 is a great final tribute to him, Realthony Mantano ü´°ü´°
amazing now do HOB :D

Swimming is a top 10 album of all time. Front to back I feel like it‚Äôs one of the most complete albums I‚Äôve ever heard
Okay now do Chur Bum &amp; give it a 10/10
THIS IS WHAT WE NEEDEDD
Wow, what a redemption arc for the Melon.
I commented on the original review few years back. It&#39;s good to see that you&#39;ve come to your senses. I knew that it&#39;s not me who&#39;s crazy. Well done, Melon.
Anthony Wantano
Viva el mel√≥n!! Y su humildad por aceptar un cambio de opini√≥n sin verg√ºenza.
Only made this because he died
I love when historical injustices are righted
Good boy
Good.
It really is amazing how, retrospectively or not, this album has touched a lot of hearts ‚ù§
THANK YOU! I just never understood how you loved Circles so much and basically hated this one. They were made for each other. I can see preferring one over the other but there was no way one is a 3 and the other an 8.
Fantano redemption arc?
This was needed for your channel. I can&#39;t believe you gave this a 4. Even before Mac&#39;s passing, I always said this was my favorite and his best. It was my favorite album of the year as well. It&#39;s just soo soo soo soo good.<br><br>I miss my guy Mac man...
Finally, you giving Mac the respect as an artist he always deserved since the beginning of his career
I know opinions can change and I&#39;m not trying to gatekeep, but to me this kind of feels disingenuous to me. He was adamantly against this album when it first came out and even defended that a year later. To me this comes off as a cultivation of 2 things. 1. That Mac was beloved by many and his career ages very well in the public eye, especially the more &quot;educated&quot; hip hop fan, which is largely fantanos base. And 2. Mac&#39;s passing. I wonder if he was alive still of fantano would even like the album more today, yet alone 3 to 8. But hey thanks just my review of this review. Do you agree disagree, let me know I&#39;m the comments below. Feeling a mild I don&#39;t believe youre music takes are always sincere/10
WOW SIMPLY WOW
LET&#39;S FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
No, they don&#39;t like it when I&#39;m down But when I&#39;m flying, oh, it make &#39;em so uncomfortable So different, what&#39;s the difference?
I legit screamed in excitement when he gave it a 8, Swimming is a top ten rap album and I‚Äôve been waiting 5 years for the score to be higher then a 3, this is the best redux melon has done
Is this canon?
Finally came to your senses I see
happy about the 8 compared to the previous score, but to me its a 9 or 10. one of the grooviest, intimate and emotional rap albums ever
Yo
Now we just have to get another redux for MBDTF
Always thought your take on this album was completely perplexing <br><br>Nice to see you came around to it
This is the best redux ever. I really felt like you didn‚Äôt even hear the same thing as everyone else when this released. It‚Äôs super beautiful and emotional, even before his passing
Your biggest blunder is finally fixed
Yea ü•πtodays a good day
Hell yeah!
I listened to circles last week after an year. I genuinely started crying by the time i reached hand me downs. Also, finally justice for this album man :)
sou mais um que fica realmente feliz demais com essa mudan√ßa de vista do fantano sobre esse √°lbum ‚ù§Ô∏è
much better
This is one of those moments that let‚Äôs you truly know that anything is possible when you believe
Could you review &quot;Portal Of I&quot; by prog-death metal group named Ne Obliviscaris?
So Happy we finally got this ‚ù§
NO WAY! So happy this project finally clicked for you. It&#39;s truly one of his best.
I can‚Äôt believe Anthony is going to bring Mac back to life with the new score üôè
Thank you Anthony, very cool !!
FINALLY ANTHONY CAME TO LIGHT!!!!
Top 10 anime character arcs
Proud of Anthony for acknowledging a change of opinion. I&#39;ll always regret disregarding Mac when he was alive, since he&#39;s died he&#39;s become one of my top 5 favorite Rappers and it just kills me to know I didn&#39;t show that love when he was living. That fucking sucks.
Yessss finallyyyy
Justice was madeü•π
Saying &quot;Backstroke... 2, 3, 4! Frontcrawl, annnnd breeeathe!&quot; for 8.5 minutes is not a review, Anthony.
Finally!! At the time Fantano and a lot of others wanted to write Mac off as a corny white rapper that could not do anything outside of rap. Hope this was a lesson  for everyone, we should judge the art that‚Äôs provided not our own preconceived perceptions of something or someone.
Man I loved Swimming so much right when it came it out cause it felt like Mac was on a whole other level and it really showed. Good AM is still my favorite besides Watching Movies but Swimming was so good
FINALLY
Weird. I have been listening to this album for like the last month now and I can&#39;t get enough of it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
This made me happy.
thank you. just thank you.
im looking forward to Babytrons rating on his album he dropped yesterday; BR3 New TestamentüèÜ
we fixed the melon, thank goodness
Thank you melon
biggest W I‚Äôve ever seen this man take
The biggest W in Anthony‚Äôs career so far
YES YES YES YES
Thank you Anthony, very based!
HOLY SHIT IT HAPPENED, IT HAPPENED, IT HAPPENED <br>THANK YOU MELON!
always felt weird about your og review i guess music just hits a later times depending on the person good to see this
this guy just won back 50k of his fans, impressive move melon
Nice to see this
Lets go
Weird to redux this and knock it extra points because mac died, Anthony. Gonna have to disagree on this one.
justice
About time
3+8=11. And people didn&#39;t believe me when I this album was an 11/10 four years ago.
wtf Anthony?why?why u keep doing this?
I felt the ‚ÄúAnthony Fantano, Mac miller forever‚Äù Rip Legend
Thank y
lmao from a 3 to a 8 wasn&#39;t expecting that thought u were going to rate it a 6 or smth
Fair.
I used to pray for times like this
I‚Äôm so happy rn
We finally got one, YES!
hell ya
ok now that u redeemed urself on this give bladee red light a 10/10
Please re-review House of balloons
We love you and miss you Mac. Very very much.

Thank you fantano and rest in peace to Macüïä
R.I.P. MAC MILLER

Too many things I can say about how much I love this album, feel like he would‚Äôve absolutely killed it on the swimming tour performances, Long Live Mac
only know self care but that song is amazing
Loved this Anthony ‚ù§
Small Worlds is a fuckin masterpiece
Mac Miller FOREVER
i personally agree with the original review,  but glad you&#39;re enjoying it more these days. rip mac
God damn, in the past I knew Anthony would change his mind but not that strongly. Didn&#39;t he originally give this a 3!? I&#39;m so happy he enjoys this more, but still it&#39;s incredible to hear him change his mind so drastically, I wonder if it clicked or just slowly grew
Bullying works
MASSIVE W
This is what I have been waiting for my entire life
Perfecto is a good self reflection track.
Now redux Red Light

Thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you
Faces needs a redux por favor
this definitely makes a lot more sense given your overwhelmingly positive review of circles, feels right

So all Kanye has to die for MBDTF to get atleast a 8? Bet
Yeeeeeeeeeeees üëè üëè üëè

This video makes me respect you a lot more
RIP Mac Miller üíô
After all these years I‚Äôm finally able to enjoy this album! Thank you Anthony
REDEMPTION, a part of me feels like he‚Äôs doing this to save his own ass with a jump from 3-8
This album makes me so sad, I still haven&#39;t been able to sit and listen to circles fully, it hurts too much
Character progression.
LETS GOOOOOOO
Finally, peace <b>I start evaporating bc my soul can finally rest</b>
Actually really glad you did this. Not that the original review was bad tho
MFDTF REDUX DELUXE REVIEW üßê
Long Live Mac ‚ù§Ô∏è
Ladies and gentlemen, we have witnessed the unexpected. In other words, R.I.P Mac
yea mbdtf is a classically low one, but this one was really his worst score
History just happened üëÄ
How is 2009 not a fave track?
A 3 was dumb as fuck but an 8 is too high this album is a 6-7 for mac imo<br><br>GO:OD AM is way better
W,  now red light redux
That shows that Anthony is a human too, his opinion is not immovable and precise 100% all the time. Respect for that melon, solid video. Long Live Mac
One of the greatest moments in YouTube history right here.
I feel like it got a higher rating with our society&#39;s cultural acceptance of liking feet
So, you gave Swimming an 8, but gave Swimming a 3?! Really shows your bias with artists, Melon
The NFR boys mustve pressed him lmao
Good shit melon üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº
Memento mori.
HE DID IT, HE GAVE IT A GOOD REVIEW FINALLY
thank you for coming back and recognizing more about the album than you did before. the jump from a 3 to an 8 is incredible. thank you Anthony for this beautiful update &lt;3
really like this album. wouldve liked to see what he did next.
Tony you were right the first time
Great review but did you really have to film yourself dancing on mac‚Äôs grave yelling good riddance?
It&#39;s nice to see this album get the credit it deserves.
I‚Äôm not gonna lie, I‚Äôve always been a Mac Fan, watched Mac Millers MDF and even listened to him every drop. but I‚Äôm sad that I didn‚Äôt appreciate Swimming while Mac was here. I remember thinking to myself ‚ÄúDropping on the same day as Astroworld is a mistake‚Äù <br><br>Sadly I only listened to a few tracks which was Self Care and Wings. I liked the cuts but never appreciated the whole record until later. <br><br>Some of my favorite Songs by Mac are from this album, like 2009, Dunno, What‚Äôs the Use? and Wings stay in my rotation to this day and I‚Äôm so upset that I didn‚Äôt give this record a fair chance upon release
Mustaches are symbols of the Illuminati. Don&#39;t believe me? <b>Starts folding dollar</b> ......as you can see Fantano&#39;s stache is an unfinished pyramid, and if you put an eye sticker on his nose, he is clearly sending a message
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS<br>MELON. YOU DID IT. A REDUX. A 8. <b>JUSTICE AT LAST</b> .
Yeah, that‚Äôs what I thought Anthony.
This and house of balloons were the only redux reviews I ever wanted, MAYBE some stuff like 2010&#39;s Beach House and LCD Soundsystem records too since Anthony was still finding his groove as a reviewer
Finally
Stop enjoying music.
Oh yes, the cowards review
The tiny desk of these songs is still prob the best tiny desk to date
Respect for Anthony for this!
Context is the most important thing man.
it takes a big melon to admit his mistakes. and you are that melon
When are the MBDTF and Birds in the Trap videos coming out?
FUCK YES
No memes, I appreciate seeing you dive back into this music. This record may have saved my life
I miss Mac‚òπÔ∏èbeing from Pittsburgh I wish I could‚Äôve seen him in concert when I had the chance
We forgive you
big w bald man
Can&#39;t wait for a redux on navs catalogue now that melon finally got a better understanding of music and it&#39;s emotional depth
Finally‚ù§
Unfortunately my very first introduction to you was a Mac Miller review, and I thought you did my mans so dirty, too dirty actually. It&#39;s nice to see you have come around, at least to this project.
This is why Melon will always be the best
Waited on this one for a long time.. I knew it would eventually grow on you. THANK YOU MELON. RIP MAC
Long live MAC
i love that you re-reviewed it but the vocals on the intro are just incredible
Maybe Forest Hills Drive can finally get the score it deserves as well
Holy shit
Daaamnnnnnnnn!!!!
Holy shit, he finally did it. Ahhhhhhh, I thought he forever buried it in the depths of his failures
i knew this boy was tripping with that 3/10 man swimming is a beautiful piece of art
YES! THIS IS WHAT THIS PROJECT DESERVES!
the biggest redemption arc
SAME
Thank you mac for this album and thank you melon for giving it the relisten it so desperately deserved. We love and miss you mac ‚ù§Ô∏è
This is the best Christmas gift ever! It‚Äôs like a father coming back after finding cigarettes for 4 years!
LETSS GOOO<br><br>(tbh I fell in love with this album on the first listen and was so surprised on Fantano&#39;s first review of it. Swimming and Circles are both beautiful albums that complement each other in such a nice way.)
holy shit
How did this go from a 3 to a 8
3 to 8 is insane
YES ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è
Fantano making justice to the late Mac Miller. We love to see it
‚ôæÔ∏è
Ahhhh. The score he shoulda got in the first place. Glad to see that this really grew on you this time around
melon clearly only changed his review after he realized jid was on self care
I feel like a part of me has been genuinely restored
we NEED a redux of Kacey Musgraves&#39; Golden Hour next. You&#39;re still wrong for that 4.
So glad Anthony knows how it feels to be bullied into thinking a certain way. Noe he knows how we feel
Nfr podcast talked some sense into him
No ab-soul review??
you&#39;ve made my year melon
MASSIVE W
The madman, he actually did it.
thank you for the birthday gift fantanoü´Ç
Crying at the club right now. So proud of our melon!
I saw this posted and got stoked, then when I first clicked the audio wasn&#39;t working. My heart sank, but I&#39;m glad it&#39;s no prank.
He probably did that after NFR conversation. Seems like they succed in the redux of it
RIP Mac
This made me so happy. Thank you fantano
Yeah that‚Äôs what I thought, Melon.
RIP MAC. Appreciate the re-review melon man
Now House of Ballons
thank you for doing this as mac is my favorite artist to date. Dude makes me cry on some songs to this day and I will never stop listening to his stuff. Hell its why I got a guitar actually and plan to expand to other instruments.
You only gave it 8 because you killed him.
LETS FUCKING GOOO!
The new canon ü•≤
I&#39;m so glad Anthony finally corrected his worst review. This was so much better and actually touched on the lyrical and thematic components of the album, plus with a score the album deserves!
I was so pissed after your previous review, I was not even a huge Mac fan before swimming but after that I really came to love him as an artist. I love this, that&#39;s all :)
Finally! I‚Äôm happy to see you correct what I knew at the time was a bad review. ‚ù§
redux review on sour soul by bbng &amp; ghostface killah next papi
I‚Äôm so proud of him for seeing this album for what it is. I was adamant that few things truly upset me about his reviews, but Swimming at a 3 is what really stopped me. I‚Äôm happy it grew on you. The world is healing ‚ù§
that was unexpeted as well as rewarding
look em long enuff
I&#39;ve always wondered if Circles changed your view of Swimming. I appreciate and respect that you gave this a more thoughtful review. Delighted that you just about love it now.<br><br>Btw, it&#39;s okay that you hated it before. Idk why some people need you to love some records as much as they do.
Mac finally got the redux üôè
someone‚Äôs not happy to get exposed by NFR
Mac finally got the redux üôè
This album hits so hard. Rip
Stating the obvious: proof that initial opinions on an album can change.<br>Glad you appreciate Swimming now.
such a good album, cant skip one song
Wow!! Finally it got an 8 instead of a 3/4 whatever I remember the first review was
Glad that XXX is still up Melon
now just redux review blonde and give it the 10 it deserves
agreed about 2009, but the Tiny Desk Concert version of that song is impeccable
ain&#39;t no way
I was here!
Perfect.
IT HAPPENED, IT FINALLY HAPPENED
Now we need Justice for Take Care and MBDTF üò≠
It‚Äôs about fucking time.
This is insane.
JUSTICE
Not me pausing Swimming to watch this video
I was so surprised when the original review came out, but I really appreciate the thoughtfulness of this revisit, and your openness in expressing how your feelings on the record have changed over the years.
Bro did this for clout
Justice is served...
Thanks Tony!
my favorite album of all time. rest in peace Mac Miller. 92‚Äô til Infinity ‚ôæÔ∏èü§ç
Absolved üôåüèΩ
W
It ain‚Äôt 2009 no more üòî
Good way to start this year, no cap. And remember folks, it‚Äôs never wrong to reflect and change your mind.
Nice redux, now redux Care For Me (i love you Anthony)
My question now is how does this affect the Top 50 Albums?
One season of dissect made you change your mind this much‚ÅâÔ∏è
UNBELIEVABLE<br>ONE OF THE WORST WRONGS FANTANO HAS EVER COMMITTED, IT HAS BEEN RIGHTED
Disingenuous, calculated move...
listing an artists death as a reason for your opinion changing is pretty lame fantano, this album deserved the score when it came out regardless of macs passing
Wow. Mac Miller passes so now his album is more than twice as good as it was? And you‚Äôre getting nothing but praise for it. Well done ü§Æ
I predict Fantano is going to make a Redux review of Exmilitary and Money Store, and he&#39;s gonna give them 11/10 score
Officially 5 years ago, and he added 5 more points to this score...
Now to a redux for Faces
Changing your mind is one of the bravest things a person can do.  Good review.
finalmente
Thank you melon for finally coming to terms w the realization that this album, is a beautiful masterpiece <br>R.I.P Mac üíô
So glad you reduxed this album. It is a great album and has been so impactful for so many people and it really helps to consider his lifestyle and mindset when making it when assessing his art. Bravo üëè
So happy you did this.
You only changed your review because he died
bullying works
L take turned W, well done melon, you&#39;ve come round to appreciating this album of bangers
FINALLY
I‚Äôm so happy! My dignity will allow myself to subscribe to you again
Nice to see Mac getting his flowers. He&#39;s already been an artist I grew up with in late high school and throughout college, my formative years. I&#39;ve loved every project, obviously not all same to the same levels. I got to see him live and up close here in my city like a year or two before he passed, amazing night and I had some bad bitches grinding on me in front who I met there. <br>Some of my favorite projects have to be, in no particular order: K.I.D.S., Best Day Ever, Macadelic, Faces, Watching Movies with the Sound Off. Of course tons of songs across all his releases.
I always thought that your review of this album was reductive, and missed the point in a lot of ways. While this is a consummate 10 for me, you did a great job giving the album the justice it deserves. Thank you, Anthony.
You should listen to Baloonerism. No need to review it as its a leaked album but you can trace a lot of what he did Divine Feminine - Circles back to that album in particular. It also feels like a companion piece to Faces, similar to how Circles is to Swimming.
Absolute restitution. Let‚Äôs FUCKIN‚Äô go. üò≠
They bullied bro into a higher score üò≠üò≠
<b>SLAMS THE TABLE</b> THANK YOU!!
Me scrolling down to the description to check the rating* THATS WHAT I THOUGHT! RIP Mac
I ain‚Äôt even one to comment on shit much. But god damn why you got crying during my lunch break????
This is the most important redux review ever. Really.
W
from a 3 to an 8, damn...
I don&#39;t know if fantano knows how many people he just brought to tears rn
LETS GOOOO
Good on you for changing your mind. Especially on 2009, which is just a majestic beautiful and heartbreaking song
Thank you Anthony. This album really is amazing.
time for me to listen to the album aswell
I swear for a split second I thought it was April 1st and my heart sunk. But now that I know that I just have no grasp on time, I‚Äôm glad you did this re-review. This was very deserved
Today is a great day. ‚ù§Ô∏è
this is the most he‚Äôs ever changed his mind on an album ever, from a 3 to an 8.
FINALLYYYYYYYY
Of course you up the score after he dies
Well done, Melon.
‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
omg
FINALLY
WHAT????
Danny Brown‚Äôs XXX was soo good man so happy i saw that behind you
So he took him for granted and when he was gone he realizes macs growth. All y‚Äôall consumers is fucked
‚ÄúMiller Mac with the illest raps‚Äù.. rest easy Mac your art will forever touch and save people. ‚ù§
the homie &lt;3
So for context i was born in 2005. I was around for the mac miller hype of the early 2010&#39;s but truth be told i was just too young to really resonate with him. It was until like mid high school in 2020 i started listening to swimming. one of my teachers actually recommended the album to me. I didn&#39;t know what to expect but the TLDR version is this album made me a mac fan and its what made me go back through his catalog and respect who he really was. Even if i missed it in realtime. This album was important to me though for that reason, its what made me a mac fan to begin with and seeing you praise it higher in retrospect is exactly the type of way i felt when i listened to it the first time. Because in my situation, mac had already passed. All his music WAS retrospect. so its just refreshing to hear you talk about swimming because it encapulates all the things i loved about mac when i first heard him and the album really presented a refined experience and it was something not entirely unique to mac miller, but rare to say the least these days. We really lost a legend, rip mac.
1/10 RIP
This was my prime example of opinions I have different from you. Now you took that away from me.
Tell me you weren‚Äôt bullied into making this without telling me
born too late to explore the earth, <br>born too early to explore the galaxy, <br>born just in time to see Mac Miller - Swimming REDUX REVIEW
Can‚Äôt wait for Anthony to redux review all of his reviews when all forms of negativity are banned in the future
I really appreciate this redux üò≠üñ§
üôè great score, feel the same
I can&#39;t wait for all the Redux reviews of Nav&#39;s albums
We forgive you melon.
NO WAY HE GAVE IT AN 8
Rare Wub
LONG LIVE MAC MILLER
My friend got me into the album when it came out, and I was never much of a Mac fan. I loved this thing... Then Mac died, and it felt so much more potent. Glad you&#39;ve had a change of heart, this album definitely deserves it
I can&#39;t judge anyone for redoing their review or even altering their priors from their previous opinion. It&#39;s not bad to change your mind based on new information or just re-evaluating
Melon redemption arc
Mac definitely has the best fanbase and community. Makes sense as Mac truly was a good human being
I‚Äôm glad I was on the right side of history
related to the album so much, that I knew I needed to take a step back, slow down, and enjoy what I had around me.
anthony, you can&#39;t just give the album a higher score solely because mac&#39;s feet are in full view on the cover
Now I wonder if any of those X albums you reviewed negatively have grown on you too
Thank fuck
justice has been served
Now do a redux for house of balloons
Ever since the swimming review I&#39;ve come back every now and then to check if he made an update to it or adressed it in any form, I know its not that big of a deal but over the years I&#39;ve somehow gotten really invested into Melons opinion on Mac and especially Swimming as the review really felt like one of his most controversial ones while never being mentioned again. <br>Seeing this long awaited Video pop up in my feed just now somehow brings me a lot of closure, embarassing as it is to admit that haha
LIGHT 8 THANK YOU ANTHONY!!!!!
Sweet justice üñ§
Thanks Melon now I can enjoy Swimming
LETS FUCKING GO
bro atoned for his sins
Anthony this might be your biggest W to date
Somewhere out there, Thundercat rescinds a hit order: &quot;All is well&quot;
You got it right this time
Do it all for the likes Anthony
Where is the Herbet review ?
Finally u have a good opinion
It‚Äôs baffling how so many people still can‚Äôt see through Fantano &amp; his disingenuous bullshit.
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
i used to view mac miller as a juvenile white rapper that annoying stoners in high school would listen to. one day my brother played 2009 for me without me knowing who the artist was. i was taken back when he told me it was mac because the song is so beautiful. swimming resonated with me after his death. circles tore me apart. seeing this redux review is like watching my character growth on judging mac to embracing him. thanks anthony.
Been waiting for this. It was one of the only reviews I&#39;ve ever completely had an issue with
This was definitely unexpected.
good for you melon ü•π
LETS GOOOO, House of Balloons now...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg3HTairH5g&amp;t=313">5:13</a> reminded me of the Danny Devito &quot;omg, I get it&quot;
Mac finally gets the score he deserves for one of his greatest works ‚ù§<br>Thank you Anthony
Damn what a huge score difference a 3 to an 8 holy shit this makes me so happy
mac miller forever
Oh my fucking god, he finally did it
goddamn
A well deserved redux
Fantano W
His original review of this being followed with praise for circles always really bothered me, I&#39;m really happy this happened
Was NOT expecting this. WOW. üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº
aint no way
SO GLAD YOU CAME AROUNDDD
I don&#39;t think the album has aged any better, it&#39;s still mostly a snooze and outside the context of his passing.
Incredible review, thank you anthony.
YESSSS THIS MADE MY DAYYYY
ü•∫
oh cool jon brion worked on it
YEEZUS REDUX REVIEW BEFORE KANYE CLAIMS HE&#39;S NOT BLACK PLEASE
long live Mac ‚ô•
What a pleasant surprise thank you Antney
That‚Äôs quite a jump to say the least
Thank you Fantano. The score it deserves
Appreciate your new opinion. I thought this album was incredible proof of his ability to grow endlessly as an artist.
Thanks melon
Anthony, we know you still think it‚Äôs a 3 and gave it an 8 to dodge the criticism.
Too much damage control Anthony too much.
Yeah, wtf was up with that original score?
The craziest character development
üôåüôåüôå
JUSTICE WAS DONE LET&#39;S GOOOO
I hope you do the same with ohms
This is great. Now fix the NAV album reviews.
Okay now please make a Mac tier list Anthony ‚ù§Ô∏è
i think we were all waiting on this one. well done mel
Wooooaaah. WOW
WHAT A FUCKIN REDEMPTION
Yeah tbh this was in your top 5 wildest takes easy, glad to see it grew on you
This is a good review
Use me as the 2009 is the greatest song ever recorded button
he is finally allowed to appreciate white rappers
THANK YOU<br>I LOVE YOU FOR THIS
I though he would give it a 5 or 6 but he gave it a 8 which just makes me so happy.
It‚Äôs about damn time
pathetic.
The best ending
wow the biggest turn around...
Day 30 of asking for a deathconsciousness review
Balance has been restored
we won
Only like 5 years late but good job I guess
I heard circles,feel in love with the music and rest of the album. When I went to search older music from him, i found out that he died. Swimming really hit different
Same score as MBDTF? ü§î
How this wasn&#39;t the original score, I&#39;ll never understand
thanks god
I fell to my knees at Walmart. Swimming finally got its comeuppance! MOST DOPE
For me, Swimming was my first Mac Miller album and I listened to it for the first time in preparation for Circles (as I loved the Good News single so so much), and man, was I blown away on first listen. Swimming was truly a sublime experience to listen to back in January 2020, and to this day it still is - Wings, for example, takes me to another place every single time, it is truly visceral and by far my favourite track on the album. The more melancholic and less energetic tracks on the album are what encapsulate my resonance with this LP, particularly with tracks like Wings, 2009 and So It Goes (a perfect musical finale for the life of Mac Miller) - but even then, the Hip Hop tracks such as Hurt Feelings and Self Care are still excellent and are among my favourite Hip Hop songs of the 2010s. With the themes and personal experiences Mac is speaking about in Swimming in mind, as well as the context of what happened to him only soon after, for me, I believe I managed to appreciate Circles far more BECAUSE I listened to Swimming first. Swimming will forever remain my favourite Mac Miller album as not only shaped through his final potent statement and arbitrary, but more importantly, because of the effect it had on me personally. It is a serene record and I truly do think it deserves far more appreciation. Thank you for doing this album justice, Anthony - it means the world.
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
When will the mbdtf redux redux come out?
Finally this album gets the respect it deserves
J.Cole producing Hurt Feelings makes the track even more legendary.
Finally Justice. Thank you Anthony, it takes a lot to admit that you were wrong.
&quot;Anthony is like that teacher that refuses to curve your grade&quot;<br><br>Also Anthony:
It took you 4 years for the people to finally correct you, old man?
So glad you&#39;re re-visiting this.  This final album is soooooo good.  The emotion is SO MUCH there. I listen to this album regularly.  RIP Mac ‚ù§
Not gonna lie but I heard Swimming after his passing and I think it&#39;s almost as good as Circles if not better in certain aspects. RIP Mac Miller üôè
All you gotta do is die and then your music magically becomes ‚Äúdeep‚Äù and ‚Äúpowerful‚Äù
‚ù§ I am sure Mac is smiling at you right now, Melon
Mac will forever be in my top 5 he made alot of music where he was watching himself in 3rd person
I&#39;m glad you finally came around. Wonder how sincere  you are or just pandering to the people and tryna get a nice view count.
Redemption
Thank you for the redux, lemon!
dark fantasy prolly crying in the corner lol
Mea culpa
oh thank god-
JUSTICE PREVAILS
THIS GUY WOKE UP. FROM 3 TO AN 8? HELL YEAH ANTONIO, SAW THAT WHITE PLAID SHIRT AND I WAS HYPED OUT OF MY MIND. Gonna give this album a listen again after some time
When you‚Äôre pandering to your viewers and you feel bad for giving your honest opinion.
My favorite album of all time
I remember the night this dropped. Mac dropped this the same night as Astroworld. That‚Äôs fucking crazy. I heard astrowolrd first having no expectations and not knowing much of Travis Scott, so it blew my mind, and so when I went right into swimming afterwards it just wasn‚Äôt the right vibe.  I took it off after a couple songs. Been a fan of Mac since Macadelic, and all that, but at the time for some reason I just wasn‚Äôt listening much to him. When he passed, I felt terrible because his album didn‚Äôt really do too well, I didn‚Äôt hear much about it in conversation, I never revisited it really, and all you heard about was astroworld for months. I drove out to pittsburg to attend one of the 3 Album release parties they held across the country for the release of Circles and everybody was crying in the room for a lot of that, but it was one of the most beautiful experiences of my life. I‚Äôve since come around on Swimming, if you haven‚Äôt given his music a chance, I really really think you should. RIP to one of the most under-appreciated musicians of our time.
This is character development from the Music Melon himself.
Ahh man can&#39;t wait for him to revisit Drake&#39;s Honestly Nevermind and give it an 8 after he passes away.
I think everyone was waiting for this video for a very long time and also not only R.I.P to MAC üïäbut shoutout and love to his estate and family for keeping his legacy alive.
HOLY SHIT HE DID IT
I feel 2023 is gonna be a good year
i got so much hate for being vocal on one of your lets argues and comparing your original review of swimming to your review of circles and im so glad you finally came around to enjoy it and also see what was envisioned by mac when he made the album ü§ç
I LOVE UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU MELOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
So glad you revisited this record, it truly is one of Mac&#39;s better works
now re review faces
made me happy
melon was just late to the party that‚Äôs all .
We won
nice
And everything was well again.
WE WIN!!!!!!
I just know NFR pressed you on this and you caved
Thank you Melon man
So just bc he‚Äôs dead now it‚Äôs good? What is the one more light redux gonna be a 10 now
8 minutes and 38 seconds of you practicing your backstroke isn&#39;t a review, Anthony.
Damn straight!
Almost 5 years later I didn‚Äôt expect to be tearing up seeing this get an 8/10
Looked at the score and ran around my house naked screaming ‚ÄúEIGHT! EIGHT! EIGHT!‚Äù Thankyou for this melon
About damn time
This made my day
I was just listening to Swimming. Literally just finished, turned it off and this is the first thing I see. Awesome
thank you for finally giving this album justice
Where is ab soul review
I&#39;m very happy you finally re-reviewed this album. This review is worth of you! How about doing the same for AM (Arctic Monkeys)?
Now this is what I call &quot;growth&quot;. Well done Anthony
Rip mac ‚ù§Ô∏è. Mr.Fantano, how many albums or EPS do you have that you want to redux
Boo
i hope you didn‚Äôt do this because people got mad at the original reviewüíÄüíÄ
Thank you, it‚Äôs about damn time.
Thank you. Genuinely, thank you.
Hell yea Anthony!!
This is what we call a Melon Ex Machina üôèüèº
YES, W FANTANO FOR ONCE, THIS ALBUM DESERVES SO MUCH PRAISE
ITS HAPPENING
Much more accurate of a review, the album overstays its welcome tho. I would give it a decent-strong 7
I finally can live in peace with this review. Thanks Fantano &lt;3
swimming helped me thru a lot, beautiful album from a beautiful and talented artist
Thank you so much this was easily your worst take of all time, much worse than your MBDTF take
Self care finally on fav tracks üôèüôèüôè
we needed this
Glad you give this one a second chance üôåüôè great record, still miss him
Fantano did the impossible. RIP Mac Miller, you have saved my life with your music.
This is one review of yours I never agreed with, so glad to see it got a revisit for sure. This album kills me üò•
his entire online reputation was saved with this one post
I legit was so confused by the original review after listening to the album, now this is more in line with what I&#39;ve thought back then lmao
Great, now I can&#39;t even hate watch the original review anymore.
I agreed with the original score of a three and thought circles was a major improvement. Idk how it happened but one day, Swimming just clicked with me. It started with Self-Care then Wings then the whole album. I don‚Äôt know how and I don‚Äôt know why but all that matters is that this is a truly special album
Now I can&#39;t answer &quot;Swimming&quot; anymore when someone asks what I think your worst take is
on 12 january 2023 my opinion on mac miller&#39;s swimming went from a 3 to an 8
Been waiting for this a long time, Glad you actually changed your mind on this.
Wow, I honestly never thought I&#39;d see the day. I can&#39;t believe my eyes right now - all I can say is: life is good...
Tony redemption arc
I weirdly wondered if you would ever do this just this morning when 2009 came on shuffle. Deadass
Good job melon!!
Good, this was a long time coming.
When I saw the title of the video, I assumed the album had grown on you more because of Circles, and I assumed you were going to say that having these albums play together really adds to the experience. Yet, hearing that the songs themselves grew on you was not what I was expecting. I know sonically the songs are the same, but there is an ear worm with a lot of these tracks that I can never pin. I know Ladders was not a least favorite of yours, but crazy to hear you praise it. I remember personally loving each track on the album even if they had flaws. I still found myself going back to them even all these years later. Mac really was an angel on this earth.
YESSS ANTHONY YESSS
It‚Äôs only a matter of time before we get the MGK- tickets to my downfall redux review where you give it an 8/10
I know the community really pressured you into doing this but thanks anyway
such a wonderful album
Gorgeous. Glad you came around:)
NO WAY

RIP MAC. ‚ù§
Opinions can change. Even Melons.
Couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better start to the year. thank you for this anthony, it means so much to the community
THANK YOU MELON
Legend
Congratulations. Even tho you have a moustache that looks like the Pizza Hut logo, you are forgiven
CYBERBULLYING WORKS
FANTANO REEDEMED OMG
Finally justice
I love Swimming by Mac Miller it‚Äôs the first Album of his that I listened to and it drew me in. I wish I would‚Äôve listened to him when he was alive and well. I wish I could‚Äôve seen him live. I started listening to him end of 2020. I‚Äôm so glad you rereviewed Swimming it‚Äôs easy Top 3 Mac Miller Albums for me I love Swimming and Mac Miller. R.I.P. Mac Miller forever in my heart ‚ù§Ô∏èüïäÔ∏è Fly High üëë
I&#39;ve been waiting for this redux for years.
I can enjoy this album now
Thank you. This album deserved a second chance‚ù§
it‚Äôs insane how far you‚Äôve come Melon. RIP THE KID FROM PITT ‚ù§Ô∏è
Glad you came back to this album. Most people that didn&#39;t like it on first had or grow on them a lot
Day 371 of commenting until Anthony Fantano reviews Carriage House by Woodward and Parker
good melon
W
I can‚Äôt even think about this album without feeling so heartbroken. Thank you for the revaluation melon.
That&#39;s the spirit anthony, now mbdtf
W opinion. Do u think there will be a ‚Äúballads 1‚Äù redux?
You have many more Redux reviews to complete lol
the smile i had throughout the whole review wows
I am so happy you released this redux. some of the more notorious grades like the MBDTF 6 or Damn 7 have never really bothered me that much bc I do think there was a lot of good points raised in those reviews and they were still overall positive, that swimming grade on the other hand has stuck w me lol
Never gonna forget his npr appearance. The 2009 performance is perfect
Can you do a 2014 FHD Redux? üëÄüëÄ
I‚Äôm happy that you re listened to this record. &lt;3
I can‚Äôt believe you finally made a redux review for Swimming. My life is now complete
My man finally getting the score he deserved
From a 3 to a 8. Deserved.
long live mac miller we still love and miss bro
You fucked up the first time &amp; still managed to give this album a lower score than it deserves the second time around. Great job Melon Teeth.
The tiny desk version of these songs needs to be put to streaming and vinyl. Absolutely beautiful
THE WRONG HAS BEEN REVERSED
Yezzus?
I will always consider this record to be one of the most heartfelt and magical projects of my lifetime. thanks Mac, we love you ‚ù§Ô∏è
Dude got pressured by the stans. ü§£ü§£
Anthony certainly came back to this out of the respect he has for Mac Miller&#39;s memory and legacy üôè
It was said that Melonhead‚Äôs small heart grew three sizes that day. Justice finally served.
From a decent 3 to a light 8 is absolutely insane.
Finally
Justice has been made
I‚Äôm glad the fog has lifted
Next can we get a redux on Bon Iver&#39;s 22, a million????
this was the only review of yours that i ever really disagreed with, so now i don‚Äôt have much to argue about
MAC MILLER FOREVER
i hate to say it, but you were right the first time Melon
So no Ab-Soul review? Smh
I can finally like this album. Thanks Anthony :)
I&#39;m so happy you like Self Care now, it&#39;s still one of my favourite of his singles
great maturity
OMG I CANT BELIEVE IT, YEAH THATS BEAUTIFUL
might be the craziest score i&#39;ve ever seen on a fantano video. 3/10 to 8/10 is INSANE
W FANTANO LESS GOOO
Melon changed his mind cause he noticed Mac&#39;s grippers on the cover
&quot;he&#39;s only giving it an 8 because mac died&quot; wow its almost like death changes context (but also no he&#39;s not)
WE WON
LIGHT 8 LETS GOOO
Man, if Fantano doubled down and gave it the same score it would be the biggest bruh moment
WE DID IT PEOPLE
&gt;It&#39;s good because he died<br>He has good albums but this one is still pretty shitty. Still RIP to a great artist
so well deserved
YES YES YES YES YES YES YES
Melon sounds like the food critics in The Menu
FINALLY HE CAME AROUND
OMGGGG
POG
W
FINALLLLLLLYYYYY
Really got bullied into doing a redux
i remember watching your original review after first listening to the album following the release of Circles, and was just blown away of how low of a score you gave it. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re finally doing it justice. such a fantastic album
FINAALLLLLYYY
Finally, I can actually admit I love this album
We never thought that you would be gone<br>It&#39;s not alright with me<br>You were the personification of all I tried to be<br>It&#39;s something deep inside of me<br>threatening my sobriety<br>Questioning my sanity in this twisted society<br>Intuition dont lie to me so I never doubt my gut<br>Watch my problemz pile up<br>They tell me that I&#39;m not enough <br><br>Lift the bottle up, I‚Äôd like propose a toast<br>To the Most dope forever<br>an overdose could never<br>Overshadow a holy ghost that&#39;s heaven sent<br>We know God will let you in<br>To sections you&#39;ve never been<br><br>They said you went comatose from the medicine <br>Heard that they arrested him <br>But that won&#39;t take the pain away<br>Tried to keep my homies close<br>But I just watch em fade away<br>So even when the sun is shining it feels like rainy day<br><br>Why, why does it feel like a rainy day?<br>I need someone to take the pain away<br><br><br>Ay, Mac Miller  <br>you was the illest ever‚Åπ<br>in my eyes you were nothing short of a living legend <br>still a legend to some, to others a hidden treasure<br>and when it came to the music, nobody did it better<br><br>So here&#39;s an ode to the albums that I have cried off<br>One day I plan of visiting Blue Slide Park<br>Til Then Im Watching Movies with the Sound Off<br>And haters stay with them stank Faces <br>I stay from round yall<br>It&#39;s GoodMorning to mourn the lives ended since<br> Any day I could drown inside the Divine feminine <br>Until that day, I‚Äôm Swimming in Circles<br>Wishing I could have a word with the all the women that hurt you<br><br>Wishing we were back to when Mac was hitting the purple <br>Tears in my eyes cause them drugs didn&#39;t deserve you<br><br>Wish you were alive but im glad you were here<br>You were living in disguise and trapped inside your fears<br><br><br>You were crying out for help<br>with Nobody to hear<br>Or maybe they heard you but they wasn&#39;t listening clear<br>So listen here, cause these are my biggest fears<br>They never see you for who you are til you disappear -C2
how do you go from giving a album a 3 to a 8 üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
It was nice to hear this review reevaluated within context of the artist mental state and where they were in their life. Would love to hear more albums reviewed based on details like that. Because the internet comes to mind in regards to all the gambino letters we saw back then and what we know now watching Donald glover in other things
The Melon has gained Redemption
Unexpected redemption arc!
one of the greatest turnarounds of all time
Fuckin finally, the album gets a redo. It‚Äôs such a good album as well, have played this 6x times while working.
My dream came true üò¢
nah its still a 3 for me
good.
No memes this time. I really, truly appreciate Fantano viewing this album from a different lens and redoing the review. Sometimes you need a different perspective to see an album the way others do. It‚Äôs sad that death is what changed that perspective, but it‚Äôs important Anthony is honest about how his feelings have changed. Many would stand their ground and try to maintain the album wasn‚Äôt for them in order to ‚Äúsave face‚Äù but this was really refreshing.
OH MY GOD IT&#39;S ACTUALLY HAPPENING
He is wrong on many other things not just this one
Mac will forever be a legends. We&#39;ll never forget you<br>üïäÔ∏èüïäÔ∏èüïäÔ∏è
So glad you re reviewed it
Swimming is one of those albums on first listen felt like where Mac used all the improvements he made  on previous albums and culminated it into this album. The fact that circles is even better (imo) is amazing and testament to his talent which is sad because it proved he had way more in the tank artistically
Wtf this is insane. I was literally thinking I&#39;d put this on tonight. Swimming and Circles are my things when people say &quot;this saved me&quot;
Thank you for atoning for your sins
JUSTICE
This album was fire from the jump. There‚Äôs only 1-2 songs I don‚Äôt love on it. Wish we coulda seen more progression from such a talented artist, RIP Mac
ANTHONY GOT GOATED
Mac Miller sucked
HE DID IT,  THIS HAPPENED, THIS IS REAL
Let it be known that Melon is capable of changing
We could all make a joke about this video, but we are more happy Anthony found the enjoyment we all had for this album
11/10 is certainly the score this album deserves, anthony, glad to see you circling back to this review.
let‚Äôs fucking go man
Never thought I&#39;d see the day but I&#39;m happy to be here
wow i love this album now
Growthony Fantano
cheeky
THIS ONE BEEN DUE
This is the exact moment Anthony fantano became anthony basedtano
Lmao
Thank you for doing this record justice
Anybody else do a double take when they saw this in their feed
this is the problem with reviewing albums a day after they drop
WHOA HOLY SHIT
I can&#39;t believe this is real üòÇ
Justice has finally been served üòå
FINALLLYYYYYY THE CORRECT SCORE üòè glad you came to your sense bro üôèüôå
After all these years..
Redux Review? No, might as well call it what it really is: a Redemption Review. <br><br>Glad the album clicked with you later on, it really is one of my favorite works of Mac&#39;s.
bout damn time
Best day of my life
Rejoice men, the melon lord blesses us today.
THE BULLYING GOT TO ANTHONY???
top 10 anime redemption arcs
I got a little emotional, thank you Fantano!
It&#39;s not as good as Circles, but 3 was a crazy low score.
Lol
Finally Righting your biggest wrong
YES
My love for swimming came after I fell in love with Circles. I wasn‚Äôt a Mac Miller fan until circles dropped. I had listened to swimming when it dropped but wasn‚Äôt impressed. After circles made me cry multiple times I went back to listen to swimming and it sounded completely different from when I listened to it the first time. I don‚Äôt know exactly what changed with me but I‚Äôm glad I did change
He did it. He really did it. ü•≤
Can&#39;t wait for that XXXTentacion Redux üî•üî•üî•<br><br><br><br><br>xdd
This is incredible. Fantano fixing his errors one by one. Next up: DAMN!
Shiit now MBDTF is the only one left
it takes a lot of balls to admit that you were wrong. <br><br>what a great way to start off the new year. thank you melon. <br><br>RIP MAC MILLER ‚ù§
THANKS MELON, I CAN FINALLY LISTEN TO THE ALBUM FOR THE FIRST TIME BECAUSE YOU LIKE IT NOW üòä‚ò∫Ô∏è
He sounded like Randy Newman drunk trying to rhyme.
Finally, I can like another mac album
justice
so nice that you finally announced the redux review for bladee-red light, thanks Anthony
This is like the pope apologizing to Galileo like 600 years after his death
Wow I was not expecting this. Super happy
He‚Äôs hurting! Hurry up Year bring on the releases!
Well, this is what it looks like
This beats Plastic Beach as one of the biggest changes for a redux review. I‚Äôm happy to see Melon go from thinking Swimming is weak to having a greater appreciation for it.
Don&#39;t run from NPR
No way you folded
First
He&#39;d be thirty right now. Weird feeling since we were once the same age.
justice has been served
Now if he did this for MBDTF I‚Äôd be pretty happy
NO WAYYYYYYYYY
ONLY AFTER HE DIED
Can&#39;t wait for MBDTF RE REDDUX Review üòç
Biggest Fantano W of the decade
Incredible album, deeply personal, one of Mac‚Äôs best efforts, this DESERVED a redux
How is mbdtf still a 6 but this got changed to an 8
Christmas came 346 days early
weird how you shit on it so hard when he was alive
Why isn‚Äôt come back to earth or 2009 in favorite tracks
The Redux we&#39;ve been waiting for
Never thought I‚Äôd see the day üôè
thank youüôèüèº
Another good redux review melon! This is up there with when you gave MBDTF and DAMN the high scores the deserved and not 6s
THIS IS NOT A DRILL
‚ù§
An 8/10, I agree.
YES HE FINALLY DID JUSTICE TO THIS THING
I WAS LITERALLY JUST WONDERING ABOUT WHETHER YOU WOULD CHANGE YOUR MIND ABOUT THIS ALBUM DEADASS TWO NIGHTS AGO!!!
I can‚Äôt believe Fantano just gave this album a 2 after the redux
Now give after hours a 10
No way he just corrected his worst take ever.
WANTHONY
Thank to NFR
Ngl I still don‚Äôt enjoy it. Light 4 for me.
What the hell did Anthony eat to make this Album go from a 3 to an 8?
great! now do house of balloons
mac miller
WOAH
Ratio
no way
Good,now do house of balloons
But isn‚Äôt he‚Ä¶dead?
Anthony, you make the score lower because you‚Äôre still upset you can‚Äôt swim.
thank you melon.
WHOLE LOTTA RED REDUX NEXT
Justiceüôè
You gonna give Jakeys album a formal review melon?
I bet a fuck ton of people feel incredibly vindicated right now
Mac Deserves This. W Melon
In 5 years, Anthony will release a &quot;Ken Carson - X REDUX REVIEW&quot; and give it an 8
This will probably be the greatest redux review of Anthony‚Äôs whole career
wow
huh? are we in an alternate universe?
no way
Oh damn
is this a dream?
Don&#39;t you fuckin dare. This comment is before I watch this video...but be nice
You  can&#39;t give this an 8 just people would disagree with you less,anthony.
Where‚Äôs the Ab-Soul review
fantano finally becomes based
you only gave it an 8 because its actually a very good album
Amazing W
Greatest comeback of all time
for all those who don&#39;t remember the original album reveiw was the most disliked video on melons channel
YES FINALLY
NO SHOT
Melon I appreciate this because I went through a similar realization that I did not appreciate the beautiful and creative soul he was when he was still with us. This is a beautiful record out of a career full of lovely music
AM I DREAMING RIGHT NOW? YES<br>AM I CREAMING RIGHT NOW? FUCK YEA
Glad he came to his senses ‚ù§
ONG HE DID IT
Wow an 8/10, up 5 points! That‚Äôs got to be the biggest increase in a redux review ever. Cheers melon. Unsubscribed
This album will always be something special to me
now I can die in peace...

Melon would&#39;ve given this a 10 if he could swim.

That was unexpected

Finally correcting the record, literally
much deserved redux.
Now we just need the Red Light redux review and we are good
Yeah, just what I expected. Knew that u would change your mind

Your sins are forgiven Melon
This marks the second time fantano actually changed the score on a redux review.
MBDTF in 2033 is gonna be a 4/10
WHAT WE&#39;VE ALLLLLL BEEN WAITING FOR

Redemption arc has begun
