@anthonycelestin3559,2024-04-20T23:33:16Z,2024-04-20T23:33:16Z,5,"This album review is wack. Don‚Äôt even review my music in the first place if you don‚Äôt appreciate my music when I was alive. <br><br>It seems cynical for Fantano to review a Mac Miller project that deals with substance abuse and he didn‚Äôt feel the lyrical content of Mac‚Äôs issues being authentic when he first reviewed the album but his struggles of substance abuse was only authentic after he died. <br><br>It‚Äôs offensive and disingenuous to review Mac Miller album positively after his death cause u never cared for the struggles this man was going through when he was alive. <br><br>And that‚Äôs the problem with Fantano, hes bias and judgmental. Fantano refused to review Kanye‚Äôs album based on offensive things he said, reviewed XXXtentacion‚Äôs music harshly due to his legal issues, ignorantly called Lil Baby a Young Thug clone until he released The Bigger Picture and had some many other bias ways he reviews music &amp; artists.<br><br>Fantano ignorantly put Mac Miller in a category of a Frat boy rapper like a Asher Roth but he evolved from that but he couldn‚Äôt get away from his prejudices no matter how Mac evolved through the times. <br><br>The problem with Fantano is that he‚Äôs bias, ignorant, judgmental and not objective about music especially hip hop music, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs hard to take his reviews seriously",1

Even if you aren‚Äôt a fan of Mac, the production value alone of swimming, mixed with Mac‚Äôs flow, emotional creative concepts intertwined together makes this an 8+. I‚Äôd give it a 9. It‚Äôs crazy how many parallels there was between his life &amp; death, the joy he gave hip hop people and general while also fighting substance abuse. You can feel and hear his mind coming together to make something spectacularly sad but healing for others who can relate. Mac is a legend. Rip.",3

@Vernoypottery,2023-11-05T05:16:30Z,2023-11-05T05:16:30Z,0,"I‚Äôve been waiting for this for 5 years. I was an avid watcher of fantano back then and swimming was the only review where I felt he was genuinely talking out of his ass in some of his commentary. There was a lack of genuine criticism mostly just personal anecdotes and insults. Seriously go back and watch, one of his worst reviews. Whereas previously when he negatively reviewed an album that I liked I could see where he was coming from and he made good points. I think the maturity and contrast on this redux shows the beauty, eeriness, sadness, and importance of swimming. It‚Äôs an album that seriously keeps getting better with time. And not just because of Macs passing. It was one of those weird albums that you just don‚Äôt understand upon first listen. It‚Äôs definitely in my top 5 for that year though. Listening to it after his death felt like he was talking to us from beyond the grave. He communicated his headspace so well. It felt like such a down to earth performance. It felt like he was pouring his heart out while simultaneously spitting some of the most cold shit I‚Äôve ever heard but all while sounding super relaxed like he was recording while laying back in a recliner. There‚Äôs just nothing else like that album. For me this album is a 9 but bumping it up to an 8 after giving it a 3 just makes me so happy. This is the review Mac deserved.",1

Credit to Melon for going back and fixing his review, but honestly, this is why critics like Fantano will always be mediocre and full of nonsense to me. It&#39;s a total lack of integrity when someone goes back on what they said previously about an album and changes their opinion due to its creator&#39;s passing. Contextualizing Mac&#39;s struggles with depression shouldn&#39;t change an album review score. The album was great then, and it&#39;s great now. This is something you see time and again with films too ‚Äî where people initially give an incredibly negative review of a film like Kubrick&#39;s Clockwork Orange or Full Metal Jacket, and then change their tune because it has become more popular or is better appreciated over time. It&#39;s lazy criticism and speaks to the lack of honesty among some critics. It should be remembered that art shouldn&#39;t be judged differently due to passing life events, but rather on its own merits. Again, appreciate that he went back and changed the score, but don&#39;t be lazy. Be honest.",1

I had a horrible episode of depression in 2019 as a senior in high school, and music was one of the only things that brought me any sort of joy in my life. This album was a large part of that joy. I related to its themes and emotional content deeply. Smoking boof dab cart and driving around listening to ladders is one of my favorite memories of that time.
