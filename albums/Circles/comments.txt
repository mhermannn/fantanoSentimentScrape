CIRCLES is a top album of all time give that a ten out ten or at least a nine
Mac always had 1 song off a project that seemed to be a passion project for him weather it be with objects in the mirror, 2009, or hand me downs. And to get a whole album (circles) of it is the best send off in history
This album helped me grow out of the mindset I had as a teen carrying over to my 20‚Äôs. I wish I could thank his parents for the amount of times mac helped me get through it
this is a 10/10 fym
How do people think swimming isn‚Äôt good
This is a 10/10
RIP THE GOAT. ‚ù§
This is Mac Miller&#39;s Opus.
9 wrrrrr
This album will always hold a special place in my heart, dropped right when I was going through some deep shit, it help keep me sane
The surf bass solo is worth nutting to
Giving swimming a 3 is fully criminal. It‚Äôs an EASY 7.5. One of my favourite albums to listen to on vinyl icl
Icl. I can see was one of my favourite tracks
Hand me downs is the only song I&#39;ve ever heard that&#39;s about sex to have a kid
Being on mushrooms and listening to this album is the best therapy money can buy
i‚Äôm currently crying to this album in my living room with my girlfriend. this is a 10/10.
is the greatest album ever made but it&#39;s okay, I forgive you
This album is so good, every song grows on me and each song as been my favorite at some point
i def personally think of i can see as one of the best songs on the album. the combination of everything during the chorus, his beautiful vocals, the verses???
Happy birthday Macüïäüôè
Thank you, man; this made my day.
FUCKING EVERYTHING IN THIS ALBUM MAKES YOU CRY :/. Literally no surprise that melon&#39;s breaking point was good news
If an album brings a grown ass man to uncontrollable tears then it&#39;s a 10/10
‚ù§
Always really gonna appreciate how much respect he will give to genuinely good music. As hated as his swimming review is. It has genuine critique and it sat very differently with people then it does now that Mac miller has passed. I will always understand that and it‚Äôs crazy how people will go so much hate to what was just an opinion. Because even despite all that melon still was more than willing to give circles an 8. Which just shows as long as artistic development continues and that produced a good record. Melon will approve. To be frank I‚Äôve always agreed with this for most artists.
I loved devine feminine
abr√≥tano
melon: swimming is too moody and emotional<br><br>also melon: circles is too moody and emotional<br><br>right
Surf has to be one of my favorite songs of all time.
Never forget that he gave Swimming a 3/10, and that unoxidized Lithium that can be found inside of batteries explode when exposed to water for an easy-to-make DIY pipebomb.
thank you
I get your opinion but Surf is a masterpiece. Every song on the album just hits. 10/10
Back tracking ass
Best correctly done posthumous release of our generation. R.I.P. Mac, gone way too soon.
i never checked this review because of how im emotionally attached to this album and didn‚Äôt want to see a bad score.. glad i did finally!
Washed out production on swimming. WHAT? ü§£ü§£ü§£
Kinda werid how he&#39;s reviewing his own album
Melon turned his shit around
4. good new<br>5. I can see<br>6. Everybody
Circles is my album of the decade so far. We‚Äôve had great releases thus far. Gorillaz, Tyler the Creator, and Kendrick have all came with some of my most listened to albums with some of their best work. Not only that, but artists I have just started to listen to like Little Simz or Denzel Curry, or even Spellling (an album this channel introduced me to) all having great records. But this album, which came out right at the turn of the decade, has managed to deliver such a powerful statement, which is oddly strengthened by Mac Miller‚Äôs unfortunate passing. This album is fairly minimal in a lot of ways, but at the same time lush and intimate. It‚Äôs near perfect. I can only dream of what he could‚Äôve done musically after Swimming and Circles, but what a note to leave on.<br><br>Rest In Peace.
You are so wrong about divine feminism and swimming both albums where amazing he took a leap of faith with the divine feminism and his fans liked and gained alot more fans because of it Kendrick even told Mac while making the divine feminism ‚Äúthis is what you should be doing‚Äù and it just was so different idk if you have experienced changed like that I mean mac even said an album is like a life time it start with life and ends in death he always tide that in either with words or melodies from a instrument
L for NEEDLE<br>mfk NEEDE of peoples opinions on his hate then drops a video after dudes dead about how great his music<br>i know youre just a guy an have opinions about music but i will never appreciate the fact you judged this guys discography so harshly until he was fucking dead then you made a post praising his music and crying at it. that just spells fake to me i cant appreciate it<br><br>rest in piece mac and im sorry you were so harshly judged for your time here
while i don&#39;t agree with your hate on swimming and feminine, circles is more cohesive than both
Good news is one of my favorite songs ever. Thank you mac.
How can macs voice be horrible on swimming yet beautiful on circles? Did him dieing change your opinion or your hearing?
I&#39;ve loved Jon&#39;s work for decades and was rather surprised to see he was the one that did this and I couldn&#39;t think of anyone better for the tone of this. The emotion he conveys in the scores he&#39;s known for fits well here beyond measure
In my opinion, there is nothing I can criticize about this album. Its just fantastic from start to finish
Still can‚Äôt forgive you for what you said about swimming
Hip-Hop is missing and will miss Mac so much
If you don&#39;t like somethi.g don&#39;t review you disgusting human Mayne people won&#39;t kill themselves
You are so fake it&#39;s disgusting  I hope you feel guilty for what you did to swimming
Back with the rebound so my fans won&#39;t hate me for blindly hating swimming
this and swimming are both 10s
Not sure about why but I keep coming here every now and then, but I do. Maybe I just need to hear some &quot;news&quot; about him. Are you with me?
duality of man
one of my personal favs of all time
8??!
8/10 but gave his prior album a 3. How does that even happen? You gave him this rating simply because he passed away.
Broo do you really listen to the lyrics????
That‚Äôs right bitch.
Favorite album or all time
the &#39;&#39;please don&#39;t cry&#39;&#39; at the end hits hard on this one..
Fantano always finds a way to speak so detailed about these albums. For me I woulda probably said ‚Äúthis is ayt‚Äù ‚Äúthis is cool‚Äù ‚Äúnot a fan‚Äù etc.
first time listening to good news i thought it was sad, but nothing too bad. first time i saw the music video i broke.
YOU GIVE CIRCLE AN 8 AND SWIMMING A 3 FOH
this was the best final album anyone could ever produce
I hate to say this but if Mac Miller was still alive I don&#39;t think fantano would have liked this one. Not that I care, but The Divine Feminine and Swimming are both masterpieces and he hated both,
In My Opinion: Circles: 10/10<br><br>Fav Tracks: Circles, Complicated, Blue World, Good News, I Can See, Everybody, Woods, Hand Me Downs, That&#39;s On Me, Hands, Surf, Once A Day<br><br>This feels like catharsis, like a hug from Mac saying that everything is gonna be ok, don&#39;t feel sad that he&#39;s gone, be happy that he was here. üò¢
Just gave this album a listen and all I can say is Wow. Might be a 10/10 for me, But and eight seems fair. Gonna definitely revisit this album, its a masterpiece
i really thought you might like Surf, in my opinion one of the best tracks, absolutely beautiful and at ease.
top 10 anime redemptions
Completely disagree, surf was nearly perfect
so what are YOU doing to be able to have these opinions about mac miller‚Äôs albums?
IMO I CAN SEE is a phenomenal track because it vividly depicts Mac&#39;s struggle to find balance in his life when it was being pulled down by addiction. I love the oscillating synths that act as a bridge between sections, and I think the rest of the production is very dreamy and cloudlike. It kind of makes me feel like I&#39;m floating through the sky with Mac and he&#39;s sharing his sagely wisdom with me.
how the fuck do you have this opinion for Circles, whilst also possessing your opinion of Swimming. fake af
didn‚Äôt faces come out after this video was made
this dude is a joke as a reviewer. Laughable.
Melon, if you really like this album. Then you have to give Swimming at least a 7.
this album would have not received an 8 had he not died. fuck offffff
I have to really strongly disagree with his take about that‚Äôs on me. It‚Äôs lyrically very simple but I think it fits with slow simple waltz. Something about the don‚Äôt really resonated with me and I come close to crying every time I listen to it.
I dont like any other albums from Mac Miller. But Circles man, Circles hits different. Its amazing
Waiting for faces review
Gotta do a faces review you damn watermelon
I&#39;m going through all your video to just disslike
4. Good News<br>5. I can see<br>6. Everybody<br><br><del>cries in Mac Miller</del>
Tears
You have to do a faces review when in comes out in October
The hardest or perhaps best part of Mac Miller‚Äôs discography is that we literally watch him grow up as he goes from this innocent kid that just loves his mom and wants to get rich and famous, eventually get rich and famous but isn‚Äôt really happy because drugs have taken over his life and he‚Äôs trying to do better for himself but things keep pulling him back in. Eventually his life comes full circle with him losing his fight, and it‚Äôs so sad because I know how hard he tried to put himself on the right track. When you listen to Mac Miller, you can tell he‚Äôs changed not only musically but as a person from K.I.D.S to Circles, and if you listen to his whole discography it‚Äôs apparent why.
Dude didn‚Äôt even know the album is a whole music circle
Circles and swimming are my two favorite albums. I am really sad that I cant find more music like this. Does anyone have any recommendations?
Still don‚Äôt understand but believe he only gave this an 8/10 bc he passed away. The full project is literally called ‚Äúswimming in circles‚Äù how is swimming a 3/10 but this an 8? What does fantano give them together as one whole piece
this is the best album of the past decade to me. this is Mac&#39;s version of Johny Cash &quot;when the man comes around&quot; ... this is bigger than music or art, it&#39;s pure emotion and spirituality. if you don&#39;t feel this in every fiber of your bone, we don&#39;t speak the same language.
Dam I can see is one of my favs
jon brion thank you so much for sending off mac miller in the best way possible
Doesn‚Äôt understand the album swimming and circles. Maybe out of his music listening levels
This was album of the year of 2020 for me. And it really doesn‚Äôt have any competition. Not that great music didn‚Äôt come out, great music definitely came out in 2020. But this was on a different level, and of course I am incredibly biased towards him.
Great George Clanton record. Very cool to see that in your rotation.
Este tipo es el mayor hater de mac
sooooooo lemme get this straight your praising macs singing on this project when you bashed his singing on swimming...
I never listened to Mac before this album and I&#39;m so glad I got around to him.
It kind of sucks that nobody is talking about the fact that the album is a circle in it self.<br><br>The album ends on a note that is not normally a note to end on but to lead to and end but the first note of the first song is a note that is normally used to end you are meant to listen to circles as it shows you a circle with music fully completing the deeper story through out the whole album. With themes of everything around mac feeling like a loop just restarting over and over like a circle. Truly one of the best albums in my generation just wish we got to see more from him
Swimming 3/10 though.
Hand me downs is one of my favorite songs all time
Ive watched a few clips on twitter of you (i know. dumb as fuck lol) and took it as is (This dude doesnt know shit, he just pukes as much as he can on whoever he doesnt like or for the views) I been on a binge of you because you popped up on my recommended after my daily healthy dose of 1 of my favorites mac. Youre so honest and really do actually love music, you know what youre talking about and give honest opinions. I cant wait for you to review me one day.
I know a guy that dismisses Mac Miller because of his voice, yet gives Imagine Dragons a pass despite the fact that Dan Reynolds is one of the most melodramatic singers in the mainstream right now.
It‚Äôs sad Swimming was so overlooked for Circles. Personally Swimming felt like Mac himself while Circles felt like Mac in the booth with an amazing producer (which is kind of what happened). Both are amazing, Swimming and Circles getting different scores shows how inconsistent Fantano is with music that legit sounds like the same project
this album feels like it was sent from heaven and mac made it after he passed. 9/10 imo
Swimming and Circles are just so good
Do a Mac Miller Albums/Mixtapes/EPs worst to best!
Literally 2-3 years later i still miss his presence so much.‚ù§
What about the forever melancholic &quot;once a day&quot;? Mac&#39;s life sadly will live forever in this song.
He made up for swimming
You seem like a real piece of shit
He gave this an 8/10 and Swimming a 3/10. üòµ‚Äçüí´ Both are 10/10.
Swimming deserved a better, way better rating
<b>*****</b>
i h8 swimm*** !
i love swimming
How Anthony started video made me so sad
how could he even possibly rate swimming a 3 and circles an eight they&#39;re 2 sides of the same coin rly shows how fake fantano is that just because mac died he feels the need to be fake to him. both 9/10-10/10 records
LOL
I will still never trust your opinion after your review of swimming...
hand me downs is goated
i hate you
if Mac never died, you would of never gave this rating.
Great review! <br><br>Now go fix the Swimming review.
Been viewing for some years now, but think I‚Äôm finally gonna subscribe. I‚Äôm finally starting to relate to everything you say you damn melon
Probably one of the best posthumous albums we will ever get out of this generation
Lowkey my favorite posthumous album
John Brion really did Mac justice
It makes me so damn happy to finally see you giving Mac the credit he deserves. Unsubscribed.
Regardless I think your music is tasteless you only give this a great review cause it‚Äôs post Mortem album I think you are ass but it‚Äôs an opinion of yours but I think swimming was his best album before he passed
You still a bitch for how you treated swimming but i agree with this rating
Having this recommended just one year later the same day. Can&#39;t believe even Swimming was a year ago, time flies man. Time flies
Love Mac but people overhyping him as this really good rapper is just irritating. He&#39;s an average-decent rapper and saying is good just go get likes from pretentious people like you is just wrong
its been a year? wow
&quot;Worth more dead then alive&quot; - Music Industry
I guess we all know how bad he would have ranked this album if Mac was still with us after seeing how he shitted all over swimming... what a hypocrit
hey, could someone tell me how this is a totally posthumous release as many say it is.<br>they say its like stitched together by voice memos etc but i thought mac wrote and recorded all vocals and even completed production on some songs on the album?<br>also planned to release as a sequel to swimming, working on it during swimming?<br>i thought jon just improvised with having to produce what mac unfortunately disnt finish but for writing it was done.
This album is very good. It almost sounds like something that the Beetles would release.
i come back to this review once a month
Speaking as Swimming and Circles being companion albums, these two were supposed to be a part of a three album group, Swimming, Circles, and Forever, or Swimming in circles forever. Through the development of Mac&#39;s music in these two albums and the way he was taking his music at this time, I think Forever may have been the some combination of a Sufjan Stevens and David Bowie&#39;s style, with the sad aspect he was moving towards. Rest easy Malcom.
I miss the homie mac, most dope forever
I miss Mac :(
Seemingly unpopular opinion after reading the top comments on this video, but Swimming is way better than Circles and I feel like Anthony Fantano gave it such a high score because he died.
I don‚Äôt know he didn‚Äôt talk about Once a Day. That the best track he‚Äôs ever made.
uhh just because of that score.. youre now irrelevant. 3/10 for swimming?! what?<br> theyre both 10/10 are you even listening to the music?!!?!?!
this still makes me so fucken sad
Wow. You give Mac Miller a 8 cuz he died, but only gave My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy a 6?
this got recommended to me after the grammys proved once again why they are becoming less and lass credible each year
The fact this didn‚Äôt get a Grammy nod makes me wanna cry harder than Melon in the Good News track review.
fuck ubmelon
Kkr
Its probably on my Top 3 Albums of all time.
Woah he talked about M.Wardüò≥
Trip on acid and just listen to both swimming and circles and it makes the most sense and it‚Äôs beautiful
I‚Äôm not a huge Mac Miller fan, but this album has really gotten me into him, I LOVE the song ‚ÄúBlue World‚Äù it‚Äôs so upbeat and fun!
daym this makes me miss mac such a good album
everyone is saying melon so.......melon
I‚Äôll never get why so many people care about this guys opinion...
Can‚Äôt believe he thinks surf is one of the worst ones
he likes Mac, he&#39;s just trying to be a fair critic
Woods reminds me of Seigfried by Frank Ocean... which is my favorite song of all time.<br><br><br><br><br>I like woods
All of fantano&#39;s reviews on Mac Miller all have a dark/depressing scent to it now
The opening line to circles is so fucking powerful and depressing ‚Äúwell this is what it looks like, right before you fall‚Äù
there literally isn‚Äôt a single day that goes by where I don‚Äôt listen to and think ab Mac Miller
You‚Äôre saying the exact same things about this album as about Swimming. Only this time, you praise them.
I can‚Äôt listen to circles. I heard the first song and I had a heart sunken fealing that it was gonna be very hard to listen to. I like his old stuff like ‚Äúanother night‚Äù reminds of them old lonely teenage nights
2 year ago üò≠
<b>everyone liked that</b>
I get the impression that Melon found in Circles the stuff that we other Mac Miller fans found in Swimming but he didn&#39;t
Why you describe swimming just like that? Swimming is a masterpiece!
This is a 10/10 album for me. Its an album i enjoyed from start to finish, never felt a need to skip any tracks and it hit personally to me. <br><br>I didnt really listen to mac&#39;s music much prior to his death. But hearing about his death and then listening to Good News still made me cry. He seemed like a great man. May he rest easy.
mac when alive 3/10 mac when dead 8/10... what a chode
HOW is this 8 and swimming one of my favorite and enjoying album is like decent 3 ):
rarely do I hear an album so good that it made me want to listen to every single album and singer melon used as a comparative
Coming back to this just because im sad.  Great album, great review.  Mac was a huge loss
It‚Äôs still fuck you Bc of swimming but thanks
happy birthday swimming
Most talented rapper/singer/songwriter/record producer. Happy 2 years Swimming! Rip to the üêêüëë most dope forever ‚ù§Ô∏è
Happy birthday swimming.
Now that he‚Äôs dead fantano is a fan. Swimming and circles are in the same style and connected but swimming is a 3/10 and circles is a 8/10? Phony
I think swimming was supposed to feel everywhere. Representing a chaotic and erratic feeling to lead into Circles gathered together completed or wholesome style. Or as you said accepted his fate.
This is literally my fav album of all time not even joking
How the fuck does swimming get a 3??
Every artist becomes profound when they die ü§î
In my eyes this albums a 10/10 but thats just me
this album sounds like it comes straight from mac in heaven. like he&#39;s made the music up there
Could you do an extra video about the bonus tracks Floating and Right? Haven&#39;t seen anyone react to those :(
I didn&#39;t listen to Mac til after he passed and the album is incredible but also really hard to listen to cus it just makes me too sad
Respect the opinion but this was a nine
THIS is how you handle a posthumous album.
still stands as his best review ever.
Wow Jon Brion the Jellyfish guitarist produced this, did not know that, that&#39;s awesome!
Swimming was a good album.
Swimming is an extremely musically intelligent/ genius album I don‚Äôt give a fuck what you have to say
Rest Easy to the iller Mac Miller
My favourite album of the year hands down
this man needs to smoke pot and just listen...
key and peele
This is the most somber review I&#39;ve seen on this channel. I respect how tactful and respectful this review was while still being entertaining. Fantastic
I&#39;ve never seen so many positive comments break the 1K mark in any comment section. Even breaking 5K for that matter. I&#39;m just speaking for myself. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s many. Otherwise, such a great album. Such a great legacy. R.I.P. Mac...
9/10 easy
So all of sudden fantano likes Macs singing even though it&#39;s literally the same as swimming but on every track this time
you liked 8/12 tracks which makes it more like a 7/10
I still get emotional man! He was one of my favorite people
your  smash cuts are too much....‚úå
Swimming gets a 3 But circles which pretty much acts as a B side to swimming gets an 8.....<br><br>I agree with a lot of the melons takes but this one doesn‚Äôt quite add up
‚ù§Ô∏è
.
:(
As someone that has listened to Mac Miller since High school and being the same age as this incredibly gifted soul, I find myself agreeing with a lot of your critiques, comments, and break downs, with the one major exception coming at Surf. Maybe its just personal preference but I think Surf is one of my favorite on the album. The juxtaposition of a love poem-esque approach and then the loneliness segment vibes to me gives it more than a 1 dimensional feel. The slow progression to the song makes the length feel very fitting and appropriate, with the last 1-2 minutes providing a much appreciative wind down to either breathe, take it all in, just purely vibe, or just finish collecting ones thoughts.<br>The line : &quot;Yeah, well, sometimes I get lonely, not when I&#39;m alone but it&#39;s more when I&#39;m standin&#39; in crowds that I&#39;m feelin&#39; the most on my own&quot; --- hits like a damn freight train.That one passage in itself makes me take a step back and appreciate it more. To each their own though.
I&#39;m just mad he doesn&#39;t like the Devine feminine
swimming is good k its good but i understand your complaints
I cant watch this full video. Swimming is a classic album. This guy is a clown.
Rest In Peace MAC ü§òüèº
No negativity in this comment intended: but do you have any education in music?
Finally, a civil review.
How tf did you not like I can see its so beautiful.
&quot;I Can See&quot; a least favorite for Melon? I respectfully disagree.
Blue World while high might just be the best experience of my life.
Woods is insane.
üñ§üñ§üñ§
sWiMiNg Is a ThrEe OuT Of TEn<br>CirCleS iS a EigHt oUT Of a TeN<br>They are the same project. Congrats man. You&#39;re a dumbass
This album made me cry like I just witnessed a horrible tragedy. By the end of good news I was emotionally drained
Bruh surf is amazing
Personally, surf is one of my favorite from the album
this album and Swimming have saved my life, for me it is infinite
I loved the divine feminine ... fuck you
Now give us the K.I.D.S Classic review
You gave this an 8 but swimming a 3. Fuck outta here. I swear they don‚Äôt love you until you‚Äôre gone. Rip Mac
You know it‚Äôs serious when the comment section isn‚Äôt full of jokes.
Why is everybody sleeping on once a day tho
He died why does everybody fucking say he passed away jesus fucking christ
Don&#39;t know why but i loved surf and i can see. Litteraly hit me in the right moment in life and this album will stay in my life forever
Favorite album of 2020 so far
&quot;Haven&#39;t seen the sun in a while but heard the sky&#39;s still blue&quot;<br><br>That bar was the hardest shit ever. Condensed the whole album to a single line. Posthumous masterpiece. Be safe Mac. Thanks for the yellow flannel Melon, very nice.
F
I would love to get your opinion about R A The Rugged Man new release All My Hero‚Äôs are Dead. What I find interesting on the parallel his project and Eminem‚Äôs last project. There are many similarities in regards to some of the songs presented, besides the obvious that they‚Äôre both white rappers. I would not have believed this, but I actually believe Rugged Man‚Äôs project is better.
Melon swimming was fking good
Fuck you man swimming is hard
mac really became the most introspective rapper ever imo. i honestly felt like i could understand him and his mental state from his music in ways that only kid cudi had done for me prior. Even when the subject material wasn&#39;t relatable, i felt as if i understood him. he just conveyed so many emotions and feelings so well: pain, happiness, intimacy, ecstacy, the list goes on. and no matter what, he put on a smile and gave us his art all the way up until his passing. that&#39;s inspiring as hell. always loved his music so maybe im biased as fuck, but you have to recognize how remarkable he truly was as an artist and as a person. RIP Mac Miller
I can‚Äôt believe melon gave a 0 to mac just because he is dead üò®
NGL This shoulda been a 9 üò≥
Always thought surf was most unique on this album
Swimming is a classic, you are brain dead dude.
Watching movies with the sound off is my favorite album but circles is a very close number 2 and I think why is because it‚Äôs just really sad to listen to.
Swimming is 10/10 if you don‚Äôt like that Album you know nothing about Music üé∫
It‚Äôs like Black Star all over again üò¢, rest in peace Mac
This is his best project (by far) and the fact that it&#39;s posthumous is heartbreaking
After absolutely burying almost every mac album fantano hits a 180 when he dies
Every single song on Circles is perfect, don&#39;t @ me melon man
Anthony at the ending: please leave a like, please don&#39;t cry<br><br>Me: starts crying
You should do a review on his album delusional thomas
You didn&#39;t give it a 10 because de title is a diss to the shape of your head
Any recommendations for anyone who fucking loves this album?
This is a very close favorite album of all time, with swimming being my second favorite, very closely followed by The Wall-pink Floyd.  I guess music quality just isn&#39;t objective
Solid review
Thoughts on the full collection? New deluxe version out. What legacy will Mac Miller leave in the music industry?
youre trippin.<br>swimming is macs best album.
Swimming was well produced idk what he talking about
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ndtSyn6dVg&amp;t=472">7:52</a> nothing to see here, just two bald guys sleeping
R.I.P Mac. I hope you&#39;re kickin incredibly dope shit in heaven.
Dis album sucked
This review should age better than the last album review.
Melon, Melon, Melon.
I‚Äôve listened to this album everyday on the way to work since it came out.
He‚Äôs still posting tho
Aaron Ramsey killed Mac Miller
Hey, my needledroppers. Yo what‚Äôs the first album in the background ?
Love seeing that George clanton album on your wall!!
should be a 10/10 ur opinion is invalid idk why anyone listens to you
Swimming&#39;s most certainly a masterpiece. Been playing Circles on a steady clip since it&#39;s release. Anthony I don&#39;t get you on most of this. Salutes for the ending though üíØüíØüôèüèΩüôèüèΩ
what?? surf is amazing &lt;3
someone tell Fantano to review Drippin So Pretty‚Äôs Die For You
Take some lsd and nitrous and listen to the album and then talk to me about this album
This guy really talks shit huh
Melon is the only American I have ever heard pronounce the word Melbourne correctly
Anthony redeemed himself after giving a 3/10 for Swimming.
Im shocked that you gave swimming a 3/10 but you know people have different tastes in music.
2 above faces LOOOOL yeah right fantaner
What are the requirements to decide if a rap album is good or not ?
I think he should do another review of swimming knowing abt the drugs
Came here thinking you would trash this album, but seeing your delivery of your review for each song and how much it pains you to talk about it after his passing and the emotions of the song made me realize you really do truly care about the artists.  I suppose this was mostly ignorance on my part, I always see clips of you bashing my favorite albums but I think most of the time I get annoyed because you have so much detail and data and information as well as a background in this stuff so most of the time your reviews are very coherent and can&#39;t really be disputed.  Regardless, you&#39;ve earned a subscriber, I really appreciate everything you do and I sincerely loved this video and your review.  Thank you.
Tbh I was a little bored by it. Which is a shame, cuz I think mac def had some better vocal performances in circles than swimming. I just felt like a lot of songs went nowhere and I found myself staring at the time code.
Why is it included in pop reviews?
You looking limp my man you need to go out and get some fresh air and speak with your chest.
OMG ITS LOGIC!!!!!!!!!!!!
Mac Miller Is soy boy music
Still not forgetting the fact you gave Swimming a fucking 3 you piece of shit
You‚Äôre such a snob. Acting like your taste is superior. That you didn‚Äôt like swimming says enough of your taste in music, it‚Äôs shit.
YO WTF HE DIDNT OVERDOSE. GET YOUR FACTS STRAIGHT.
Why is this not on ur loved list?
On second thought, I&#39;m lowering my score to a 7/10, because Mac&#39;s voice started grating on me after half a dozen listens. I still like everything else about it, though.
Album wasn&#39;t good
Hi melon üçâ
man, you&#39;re full of shit<br>you didn&#39;t appreciate his songs
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ndtSyn6dVg&amp;t=508">8:28</a>
The songs i&#39;ve had on replay ever since the album came out: Circles, Complicated, Blue World, Good News, Everybody, Hand Me Downs and surf. <br>Overall really enjoyed the whole album.<br><br>R.I.P
Oh wow, finally giving Mac a fair score!
great review
Faces re review!!
I‚Äôm genuinely trying to understand this review. I honestly believe swimming and circles are very nearly on par. Even though others might disagree, I still can‚Äôt see Swimming being a 3 and Circles being nearly THREE times better?
‚ÄúI can see‚Äù is my favorite track :/
jabroni review, why cant u review for what it is without just comparing to other pieces of work. anyone who views art like this i feel bad for
This album is beautiful. It‚Äôs a great ending to an amazing story. Rip Mac. The first hip hop song I ever listened to was Koolaid and frozen pizza.. thank you bro.
aprishiate
Big Bright Eyes fan, and I heard a lot of similar themes in Mac&#39;s music, as I seen in Conor&#39;s Music, at least with this album. Just felt like that was validated when you drew comparisons to M. Ward and Elliott Smith.
i appreciate your review but did you really expect mac to make a song about camping in the woods having a bonding experience with his uncle?
That‚Äôs just one person hating on macs album check the billboards he‚Äôs killing it
slatthony slattano
Review loving- if I am only my thoughts
Said perfectly Anthony
@theneedledrop this is the biggest comment of your life. Enjoy
the album is pretty dead
I think Fantano finally &quot;gets&quot; Mac.
WOAH FR????
Has it ever crossed your mind that he may have called this Circles because he saw your review of Macadelic, where you describe him as &#39;going around in circles&#39;?
I gladly agree that the aspect of Mac Miller&#39;s voice in the foreground was a great idea and makes the LP intimate. But it simply can&#39;t be compared to Swimming. Swimming is coherent, full of details / ornaments, yes, also groovy, diverse, surprising.. It sounds full and is resonant, it surrounds, embeds you. <br><br>A lot of Circles is (well, conveniently) repetetive, sometimes the leftover elements are primitively thrown together and complemented only artificially. As far as one could know, he was quite perfectionist and I&#39;m not able to imagine that he wouldn&#39;t have changed so so much about this record still - lyrics, PERCUSSION ELEMENTS, voice layers.. <br>Complicated and I Can See are strictly bad songs to me, lost pieces not well tied together, not flattering his voice.. <br><br>I&#39;ve grown to like Hands, Woods (except those drums..) and Hand Me Downs and liked Good News from the beginning. Everyone is an awesome cover. But that&#39;s it. <br><br>I am relieved you acknowledged his singing more in this review even if it&#39;s ironic, because on swimming it was much more elaborated. Seems to me you should listen to it again and recognize the completeness of it.<br><br>My humble, but certain opinion. Maybe it&#39;s the respect towards Mac Miller and that he didn&#39;t have any final says, not even about all the songs being chosen for this album. Maybe I&#39;m just still very sad!
I&#39;ve been on this planet for thirty-something shit years and Swimming is fast becoming one of my most listened to albums.
anthony you didn&#39;t have to say Circles was a Miller li- nah, this is too much. That unrecorded final third of the trilogy will always be one of the great what-could-of-been albums in history. It&#39;s in the Dream Library of could have been now. What a suitably sick album to finish on. Bittersweet, but so sweet
I think my favorites off of the album were Blue World and Good News. Blue World&#39;s production is gorgeous and Good News lyricism is almost haunting.
Huge Mac fan.. this album is not good
re-review swimming, u know u fucked up on that one
Ok calvo
That‚Äôs On Me reminded me of an Elliot Smith song.
Please review alessia cara the pains of glowing üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª
I‚Äôll never understand why you rated swimming so poorly.
Hand me downs is fucking fire
Bro, I can see is literally the best song
Wow so interesting to watch him over-analyze and mistakenly categorize shit and then applaud the most simplistic thing he ever put out I wish people who are music critics actually had to have some Talent so we could rely on The credibility
No one likes the things that come out of your mouth.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>Or the place your mouth is on.
Honestly fuck anyone‚Äôs ‚Äúreview‚Äù on macs music. He is one of the greatest of all time. Have your opinion but a whole ass YouTube video review of the album is a waste of time. Why can‚Äôt people have their opinions without broadcasting them. Listen to the album, analyze it, be inspired and stfu.
beautiful
I&#39;ve watched a lot of music reviews from you over the times but I just had to leave a comment for this one thank you for this.
When are you doing Manic? All of the critics seem to love it, so I was hoping maybe you would give it a review.
Swimming, in my opinion, was at least a 7/10. Sometimes I&#39;d rate it a 9/10. Both albums are solid 8/10, leaning to 8.5/10. RIP Mac, at least he&#39;s resonating peacefully with the cosmos rn, a solid legacy left behind, and Circles, as in the song not the album, felt like his last goodbye. The rest of the album was a last hurrah, wishing us happy lives and hoping that everyone he touched could one day share that love to those they knew. Rest in Peace, my Prince.
I‚Äôve listened to this album 30x... hits so fucking hard. Deserves every recording award. MAC was on his way, way way up.
This guy gave Mac millers album a higher score than Eminem&#39;s new album.  Omfg music nerd my ass.
How is faces better than divine feminine?????
is this the first good rating you&#39;ve given mac?
i hadnt watched an Anthony video for who knows how long and i didnt expect to finish watching one again with tears in my eyes. i didnt feel any sense of nostalgia until he concluded the review where i realized this would be the last mac album he‚Äôll ever review again. i remember listening to albums whenever i can just to refer to what anthony had to say and mac‚Äôs album reviews were what id always anticipated for.  i still listen to alot of music but in a different scape and watching this really took me back. <br><br>love u melonhead üíô
The beat on blue world is absolutely astonishing
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ndtSyn6dVg&amp;t=517">8:37</a> ‚Äú Please don‚Äôt cry‚Äù <br>Well it‚Äôs a little late for that Fantano üò≠üò≠üò≠
this means that mac miller‚Äôs first posthumous album ever is best than every posthumous x album combined
Haha, now he just scared to roast a dead guy üòÖ
I miss when the comment section was like this years ago. When people actually talked about the music and not full of Jack asses repeating the same meme over and over again
I dunno, I think without the context behind it, less people are going to enjoy the album. To my ears, excluding the context, it sounds like another chill sad boy soul record.
I hated this album lol. I generally agree with your opinions but I couldn&#39;t even finish this album.
Got it right this time. Thank you Anthony üòå
Why the fuck does everyone not care about swimming?
It always amazes me the inner workings of an addicts mind.<br> Despite what teachers and society will tell you - they are almost always the most intelligent among us.<br> Seriously. I&#39;ve never met a drug addict who was a simple minded person. And for what they know - they suffer. <br><br>  <br>&quot;For with much wisdom comes much sorrow.&quot; Ecclesiastes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ndtSyn6dVg&amp;t=78">1:18</a><br><br><br>Because someone of high intelligence realizes they are alone in this world.<br> They question everything down to their purpose, and if they influence the world around them in a positive way. <br><br> <br>They realize we are nothing but a domesticated species, like dogs,<br> serving corporate masters who rule the world and that we are so far from our roots that our lives as individuals could hardly ever mean something.<br> And if there is a God, it likely hates us for everything we do. <br><br><br>To an intelligent mind, material and money mean very little.<br> Achieving it only to realize it does not change the hollowness inside or the sense of wanting to belong.<br> Then feeling worse for having achieved wealth others only dream about to not know how to use it in a &quot;normal&quot; way. <br><br> <br>To them, success is something ethereal, something that cannot be measured or packaged in a middle class neighborhood and sold as a dream.<br> It&#39;s to find a purpose in a world that tries to strip you of every piece of your individuality,<br> while still submitting to it&#39;s norms enough to get by monetarily and be a presentable person. <br><br> <br>But they never feel they can belong, for even in times of bonding with friends, they find their minds elsewhere - in ideas and possibilities,<br> things that do not yet exist.<br> To talk about the newest TV show, or what Janet did at work yesterday is an insult to them, a waste of their short time here.<br> But all they want like anyone else is to feel loved,<br> so they subject their soul to the torture of a normal life in order to maintain bonds with those close to them. <br><br> <br> <br>&quot;All my homies philosophers&quot; Mac says in &quot;Inside Outside&quot;. And he&#39;s right. All his homies are philosophers.<br> Q, Ab Soul, Earl Sweatshirt. Listen to their lyrics. They are all depressed, because they all see the world for what it is - not rainbows and sunshine. <br><br> <br>The common misconception is that drugs are the cause of this depression.<br> I disagree. They may fuel it, and create a feedback loop that is easy to get trapped in, but the real cause of any depression is intelligence. <br><br> <br>Furthermore, I think it is the modern man&#39;s struggle.<br> <br> Sure, we no longer have to hunt food, or worry about diseases.<br> <br> But we now have the free time to question our very purpose here - a painful exercise that could not have been possible<br> thousands of years ago because we were too busy farming or hunting.<br> <br> As a result, we find people who are born into Maslow&#39;s Heirarchy of Needs with everything they could ask for from a physiological side,<br> but no guidance mentally or spiritually whatsoever.<br> <br> It sounds stupid, but our free time and our awareness are simultaneously our greatest assets and our largest enemies.
Fucc u bro ur corny stfu
Melon, those glasses are complete garbage
It‚Äôs a 10
I hate when YouTubers don&#39;t show the amount of money they are making on Patreon. What are you hiding, homie? Would people stop donating if they knew how much you are taking in on Patreon?
I like you, but it&#39;s very clear you only did a good rating based on the previous ratings.
so when he‚Äôs alive u wanna give him shitty reviews, but when he‚Äôs gone u wanna give him an 8/10???????
That flower boy comparison was 50/50 bro, tyler had a lot of strings on that more than synths. Fw this review though melon ily
this is the only album besides motm1 &amp; 2 that i‚Äôve ever really cried to. mac just has a way of getting u in ur feelings cause the things he talks about are so relatable
Complicated has too much of a slow tempo to match the vibe of Flower Boy in my opinion
may he rest in peace üòå
mac milar
So today it was my first time getting High and I was listening to blue world , it was a real trip.
I was skeptical about this video but this was a good review
This album really blew me away. So intimist, so mature. It‚Äôs so sad that we‚Äôll don‚Äôt have the chance to see more of such an excellent work by Mac. And he achieved this at such a young age. Amazing artist, simply. <br>RIP
Gotta love these dead musician cash grabs
FREEk rome fortune
Did you catch the first few words of surf, they&#39;re his last words on his song funeral.
Oh God it&#39;s v-sauce in costume
You didn‚Äôt like Devine feminine üò≥ your music taste is üëé
Ow, god damnit I saw comments about his ‚Äúrip mac miller... forever‚Äù comment at the end of the video, and even when I knew it was coming up I got the hardest chills. Rip mac
Pretty sure this is the best posthumous  record ever released
Modus Vivendi
Some reason i feel that this album had a Mac Demarco influence. Just a wee little. Can anyone agree?.. or is it just me.
Things like this dont seem to last, i might just seem like those before me.
I thought this was logic reviewing the album before I clicked it
Everyone knows if he was still alive this would be a different story
this was a great album , and i believe that it‚Äôs a very good farewell album for mac miller , as its the second part for swimming . much better than artists say xxxtentacion , where he‚Äôs being milked out for his content while mac has his farewell , his farewell , and i love it
This guys a idiot. Swimming was macs Masterpiece.
Dog... How the hell you don‚Äôt like Divine Feminine or Swimming
I‚Äôve seen this in a lot of other Mac Miller review videos and reaction videos, but damn are the comment sections some of the best in YouTube right now.  It‚Äôs sad, but he seriously had so many people that loved his music and felt his passing personally.  Thanks Mac, for making music to help as many people as you have
Rest easy Mac, thank you for this beautiful album üòîüò¢
this is your most calm comment section. that‚Äôs how you know this is very important to everyone
I genuinely don&#39;t like this guys reviews. He&#39;s so critical on everything it feels unpleasant and negative. Other than his dissection of music, otherwise I don&#39;t hate him
This just shows he&#39;s biased to xxx cuz he&#39;s ripped apart both of his posthumous albums and skins was way more complete than circles
Also, loved the description ‚Äúpillowy mist of sound‚Äù üî•
Rest in Paradise Mac üôèüèø I instantly thought of a Tyler feature on the track Hands too! Im going to miss Mac‚Äôs artistry so much. I always looked forward to his music. Been rockin with Mac since K.I.D.S. üò¢
that album had me crying so much
ANTHONY!!! Please review Modus Vivendi by 070 Shake!!! You will not regret listening to that album. It‚Äôs so incredible and I‚Äôd love to hear your take on it!
When I listened to this I thought Fantano was gonna hate it so this is a pleasant surprise
When I listened to this I thought Fantano was gonna hate it so this is a pleasant surprise
When I listened to this I thought Fantano was gonna hate it so this is a pleasant surprise
When I listened to this I thought Fantano was gonna hate it so this is a pleasant surprise
you‚Äôre not even gonna address the 3/10 you gave swimming? smh <br>you‚Äôre just tryna hop on the bandwagon now that he‚Äôs passed
i fell asleep listening to this album
and its time for City Morgue&#39;s vol. 2 maybe?
Melon should review The Chats
he got the same head shape as mac
Is that a 47 on Mac&#39;s album cover? Big S/O to the Pro&#39;s
Fantano, I love  you.... but I think you need to listen to I Can See again
9/10
REVIEW PIGEONS PLAYING PING PONG‚Äôs  üèì üèìüèì NEW ALBUM
Im new here, why are people calling Anthony melon? Just curious
9.3/10 for me
I have no idea how fantano rated circles higher than swimming and faces. <br><br>Truly shocked; I whole heartedly expected a 3-4 fantano rating.
Can someone explain the thing about the yellow flannel?
I listened to this album for the first time when I did molly for the first time. It brought full on tears of melancholic joy to my face and I had the thought ‚Äúthis is the last first time I will listen to a Mac Miller album.‚Äù I was so happy to hear his voice again and so sad that he‚Äôs gone. This album will forever hold a special place in my heart. Most people might not agree but this is the first album since Pink Floyd‚Äôs Dark Side of the Moon where there wasn‚Äôt a single track that I disliked. Hold on to the little stuff everyone because we‚Äôre in the good old days right now.
Rank Macs albums and Mixtapes from worst to best please, I wanna know your opinion
macs music always seemed to correlate with my life. he was around making those giddy tracks from bde when i was in high school. and his music slowly changed into something different as i too was slowly changing and to have lyrics that progressed with my own life, up until this point, has truly been a blessing. i can always go back and listen to his music and know exactly where i was in life at the time those tracks had a profound influence on me. rip mac. no other artist‚Äôs passing will hurt as much as this.
Was expecting a 5 or below. This is a nice surprise!!!!!
still mad that melon gave swimming a 3
You know I‚Äôve been disappointed with almost every other Mac review you‚Äôve done melon, but at least you figured it out this time
Keep it real this album sucks. Sounds like music for heroin users.
Very respectful and very compassionate. Thank you for being so empathetic about mental illness and addiction and death and art
Before circles came out, i was totally hooked on swimming, and then circles happened.<br>Now I am swimming in circles.
Am I the only one that thought swimming was amazing?
I fucking hate this guy, not Mac btw. Music is subjective what the fucks a point in an album review.
You were crying throughout this whole review.
Thanks for the mention of Faces, that was a really great mixtape.
8!? <b>loads up Apple Music</b>
Everybody sound very Beatles inspired the way he delivers it
It&#39;s funny that my least favourite album from Mac is the one he enjoyed the most. But the album may grow on me idk.
bad album, over produced tripe only used to capitalize on a persons death. just my opinion though.
Man... from KIDS to Circles. Almost like god used Mac for a much higher purpose. His music followed me throughout my life and matured the way I did. Just thinking about his talent and how far he came musically just makes me want to tear up and reminisce. Time flies, and people like Mac really make you appreciate life and the twists and turns it throws you. His death is truly heartbreaking, he died way too young. Makes me cherish my loved ones that much more. RIP to a TRUE legend....
Could you review the album &quot;27 Miles Underwater&quot; by a band called Higher Power please? It&#39;s a new melodic hardcore album that came out today (Friday Jan. 24th). I&#39;m curious to hear your thoughts on it. It&#39;s got some uniqueness to it, yet I feel like you may have some deeper analysis on its style in terms of music in the melodic hardcore scene today. Thanks in advance!
Already knew he would be praising the album in a lot of ways for one reason....hmmmm you didn&#39;t like the last 2, which were great asf, but have a good appreciation and love for this album.....hmmmm...I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s bc of a certain thing that happened to Mac.........ü§îü§îü§î
Wish it woulda been the Maclib album hip hop needs that... but rip legend album was great
Who the fuck is this guy üëé
Woods is most definitely a sister song to Wings.  Ahhhhhh ... The symphony of sounds. I&#39;m in love. <br><br>As for this review, ironically, I love Divine Feminine and Swimming ... they&#39;re my top favorite albums. Super sexy. And, Swimming is fluid from beginning to end. Sorry, I disagree. I even swam to the album all summer because it&#39;s that fluid to me. It&#39;s pretty cool to blast the album on the bluetooth speaker in the sunshine while swimming in the pool. I can&#39;t wait to swim to swimming again this summer. üåûüåä<br><br>I love Circles, too. Ughhh. I miss you Mac. Misunderstood genius. You got your wings now. üòá
I‚Äôm just so thankful that this was done so tastefully. I have so much respect for you. I‚Äôm just happy people are listening to Mac üíõ
U suck.
This guy is just throwing shade at Mac like crazy in the beginning. What a douche
Woods is truly something else
Lets goooooooooo I‚Äôve been waiting for this
I thought you were an Ed bassmaster character
Mac Millers &quot;Circles&quot; was the musical equivalent of the ending to a fantastic book. No one is happy it ended, but we are all happy we got closure.
I‚Äôm gonna be honest, this album had me crying tears. I listened to this album  while I was at work I‚Äôm glad no one was around to see me. Fucking the song Good News hits me like a truck for some reason. It‚Äôs an amazing album for the end of his music career and his life.
It is such a shame man, the good die too young. Grew up with Mac Miller and his music and the only true artist that I‚Äôve mourned over. This album gave me closure and light in the darkness, couldn‚Äôt have asked for anything more or less. RIP Mac. Forever
I disagree with this man on many, many things. But since he&#39;s the only person I&#39;ve heard give a shout-out to Mac&#39;s rap verse on Hand Me Downs, all is forgiven
Fantano I‚Äôve been watching you for 9 years! Great review, I been loving this album! 9/10
you guys notice that tracks on the album spell out<br><br>Good News <br>I can see <br>Everybody <br>üßê he‚Äôs watching over the true fans
I haven‚Äôt been 5 secs through this and I know it will get a good score <br>1. Cause it‚Äôs Mac he‚Äôs a legend and because I know he‚Äôs scared to give mac a bad review note that he‚Äôs passed
Great review.gotta disagree on surf though. It‚Äôs too beautiful.
If you told me melon was gonna give a post mortem mac album an 8/10 6 months ago i would‚Äôve called you a crackhead
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ndtSyn6dVg&amp;t=11">0:11</a> &quot;posthumous&quot;<br>Ahhh that&#39;s how u pronounce it
Traps lookin big, bro!
Shit was boring AFü§£
Man this guy is still making music?
Check out the band low roar on the  same type of music as fleet foxes
What ? No music üßê
wowww an 8
Circles &gt; Music to get murdered by
Perfect review.
Don‚Äôt cry, loser.
Macs transition was very smooth i think. he was only 26, and from someone who started rapping at 16, that‚Äôs awesome. You can only put out so much music in 26 years
Never seen this guy chop down a tree
And you, despite being an only child, say you need more of a family &#39;round, <br>Lets turn these genes into hand me downs
Hand me downs is the best song I&#39;ve heard so far this year tbh
My opinion: The Needle Dropped when Mac died. Fuck.
This album is beautifully produced.  10/10
rip malcolm
I knew macthony milltano had a good review for the whole album coming. And he&#39;s right, its devastating that we wont get to hear where Mac&#39;s sound would go from here. I also wonder if the album would&#39;ve got as much recognition as it deserves, <br>had he not passed away. I can only hope Mac is in some other dimension of sorts; capable of seeing the positive reception of this project.
Review The Life of Pierre by Pierre Bourne
I‚Äôm still waiting on Jack Boys Melon!
Hessssss deaddddddddd
He deletes comments.
He said beautiful so many times I love it
This looks like mac was put in an Americas Most Wanted generator for 20 years later.
Man such a solid album glad you liked it Tony.. what a tearjerker tho RIP Mac
Do mura Masa&#39;s new album &#39;R.Y.C&#39;
Rest easy forever Mac. You changed countless lives.
rip mac i love you
Modus Vivendi review pleeeease!
Blue world and good newsü•∫
He fuckin did it
It finally hit me that this is the last time Fantano will review  something Mac made
We all miss him Anthony, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you can kiss your Mac Miller body pillow while crying for 10 minutes and call it a review
Sounded soulful like he knew something some songs very deep Rio Mack Miller
living album: <b>RED FLANNEL</b><br><br>dead album: <b>YELLOW FLANNEL</b>
Garbage that this album better than Ems
I like when Fantano reviews albums he likes more than albums he doesn‚Äôt like.
R.I.P Larry üôåüèº Circles is definitely the best album they could‚Äôve given us to send him off.
Daamn boe he thic
Look like whit juice wrld
This guy seems like he&#39;d be insufferable in real life, the kinda guy who&#39;d put a lot of effort into pretending to be cool
Saw the birthday party for mac at stage ae in Pittsburgh which was the album release as well. It was simply awe inspiring
How can you like this album but not swimming... you took such a huge shit on swimming And after he‚Äôs dead you say his new album is good.. nah puts a bad taste in my mouth
I‚Äôve got a soft spot for somber songs...I can easily say that ‚ÄúHand me down‚Äù is one of the most beautiful songs I‚Äôve ever heard considering the evolution of Mac‚Äôs discography. Well done üëçüèº
Mac Miller, forever. <br><br><br>P.S. digging the George Clanton r√©cord this time around
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ndtSyn6dVg&amp;t=167">2:47</a> thank you for this! I was feeling the album was telling the story of his ‚Äòself-acceptance‚Äô, but I couldn‚Äôt really figure out why, I felt that.
Woods and Hand Me Downs are my favorites
Blue World was produced by one of the members of Disclosure! no wonder it sounds so good ‚ù§Ô∏è
Why is Anthony Fantano reviewing Anthony Fantano&#39;s album
Is it too soon to say this will be the review of the decade, it just had to be perfectly done and Mr fantano did it, or is that melons dad?üòÇ
Man... Sometimes Anthony confuses the absolute Hell outta me. <br>I love Mac&#39;s earlier stuff, don&#39;t get me wrong. But from &#39;GO:OD AM&#39; thenceforth, his sound was f***ing FIRE! You could hear the maturity settling in quite comfortably in songs like &#39;Favorite Part&#39;, and &#39;Small Worlds&#39;. The absolute poeticism and R&amp;B production - for someone like Anthony, I woulda thought... What&#39;s not to like?<br>I&#39;m beyond ecstatic that he loves the album, yes. But hell... It&#39;s miraculous compared to what you thought about the rest of his layer stuff.
Overrated album, just because Mac is dead unfortunately
The album is trash eminem is better
this was pretty beautiful.<br><br>10/10: 0<br>9/10: 0<br>8/10: 1 (Mac Miller)<br>7/10: 0<br>6/10: 0<br>5/10: 2 (Eminem, JACKBOYS)<br>4/10: 0<br>3/10: 0<br>2/10: 0<br>1/10: 0<br>0/10: 0<br>NOT GOOD: 0
Man I almost wish I wasn‚Äôt a fan since 2010 only because I want to have that feeling of listening to everything for the first time. All you new fans are in for a real treat.
In all honesty, as I was listening it just didn‚Äôt sound finished. I know that‚Äôs why but it‚Äôs almost as if he hadn‚Äôt past id be able to tell too. It‚Äôs not that I really love or don‚Äôt care from the album, it just wasn‚Äôt done. I look at it as his gift for us.
Woods is amazing
Unpopular opinion: Melon doesn‚Äôt know   rap
This album was mac‚Äôs final message to the world. Already one of my favorite albums of all time, i‚Äôve been listening on repeat since it dropped
I‚Äôm so broken about this one, rest in peace Mac Miller I absolutely adore this album and I‚Äôm sure he would of loved this review too. Thanks Anthony
If they really wanted to remember Mac, this should have been a free sendoff
Swimming was his musical sendoff.  Now that he has passed, someone is trying to use his name as an &quot;homage&quot; and bring in money.  That sticks in my craw
&quot;I&#39;m not real, I think I never was.&quot;
Dang the respect in this video
Bro didn‚Äôt even start the review and I‚Äôm crying
Posthumous albums always make me feel weird inside
Damn Anthony you said <br>&quot;mac miller is dead and trying to bore us to death with this album... &quot;<br>2020 anthony &quot;table cloth wearing&quot; fantano<br>The picnics busiest napkin thief.
Can someone explain why this guy is famous?
Excellent review Mr.Melon. God bless
Faces is my favorite Mac Miller project
Do Good Luck Everybody
this album came out the day before my grandfather passed away. Glad this album was so good and it also being so touching to me. couldnt have came out at a better time.
Who the hell cut onions?
070 SHAKE ALBUM REVIEW PLEASEEE
Yeah I think everybody is my favorite track on this album
A possitive review... I&#39;m going to cry üò¢ every album got better and better. Wish we got more from my favorite artist üíî
I thought surf was one of the strongest tracks! ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs water in the flowers les grow‚Äù I‚Äôve had that and circles on repeat for the last few days man.. rip to the young king, rest easy Mac, with those cheesy raps !!!
I get that you want to be a respectful Melon, but giving the album a 10/10 just because he died is a little much.
Am i the only one who liked swimming more than circles? Both were good tho
YELLOW FLANNEL YELLOW FLANNEL YELLOW FLANNEL
STOP RELEASING DEAD RAPPERS&#39; MUSIC FOR THE OBVIOUS SOLE PURPOSE OF MAKING MONEY
As soon as I saw Fantano crying after he heard good news, I knew he would give this album a yellow flannel
woods &gt; i &lt; hand me downs
Thank u melon
I gave it a 9
Go on the Eric Andre show
I‚Äôm glad you enjoyed Melon<br>Rip Mac 92tilInfinity
why dont u lame asses  come to my channel...feel free to get some hate and frustration out.  I do Vlogz, Reactions, True crime and conspiracies and many more videos ranting about celebs that i dont like ...see ya when u get to my channel f*ckers - Justin Ray
This album is so beautifully heartbreaking. I can&#39;t get enough of it. What a loss.
We all knew that Melon really wanted to enjoy this album after he heard ‚ÄúGood News‚Äù as a single. It was a beautiful moment.
Yeah unfortunately what he changed to is not the kind of music I enjoy.
Love this
Our melon is trending bois
Im glad this album came out RIP MAC MILLER
Hold up this man gave Swimming a 3/10? Oh hell nah wtf melon head
RIP Mac üñ§ thank you for all the great times
The album looks continually transitioning to the next one on the green sheet

You&#39;re review was perfect I&#39;m sad you weren&#39;t a fan of swimming becusse it&#39;s the first body of work I listen to before he passed away went back to the old stuff and I&#39;ve been a fan ever since his death hit me way harder than it should have considering his fans knew him for over 10 years
I just know this guy because of a <b>thicc-ass boy</b>
Losing mac miller was like losing a good friend
Checkout his last picture taken..<br>His last video ‚Äúself care‚Äù ft. Him in a casket..<br>The last words on this album...<br>Swimming Was premeditated to tie this project back to this project.<br>All that and throughout swimming, Cirlces.. shit even GO:OD had the song Perfect Circle!<br>Crazy. Poetic.. Tragic... RIP brother. Wanted to keep growing up w/ ya
ü§îI‚Äôm watching you üëâüëÄ
Mac was so talented.
Anthony you didn‚Äôt take me to my band concert and now I‚Äôm going to get in trouble tomorrow üò°. I hope you‚Äôre happy
It‚Äôs hard to find this review genuine when he gave swimming such a low rating and this album in my opinion is very very similar to swimming, I would even say swimming was better. I feel like maybe his rating is bias now that he died, idk something tells me if he was still alive the rating would of been a 4 instead of an 8. But still glad to see a positive review. I loved circles.
It‚Äôs great.
Lies this was not better than swimming u just feel bad
The R.I.P. Mac Miller at the very end tugged at my heart a bit :(
Wrote off Mac for years as just some rapper. Melon drops a review so I listen to the album and I was impressed. Sad to think what could&#39;ve been.
Love you, Mac. Ended on a high note.
That reference to FACES was on point. FACES was likely his best album.

That‚Äôs a really fair rating. I agree with your qualms about Surf, but I can‚Äôt say your take on That‚Äôs On Me convinced me! To me that track tacks on some much needed brightness to the rest of the album, even if the tone still trends to melancholic. It‚Äôs like a salt and vinegar chip that cuts through the richness of a fatty sandwich. It reminds me of some of the soft brightness that makes some Beatles albums really glow with hope. Still, fantastic review!
That‚Äôs good

Nice intro üî•üî•üî•üî•
I‚Äôve never been so happy to see the yellow flannel
Fuck you, don&#39;t be fake, you gave swimming a 3.
WHO THE FUCK IS CUTTING UP ONIONS?!
Rest well mac üíô
YES blue world was fucking amazing
I really love the melody &amp; sound of the track ‚ÄòWoods‚Äô  it‚Äôs so good along with the entire album ü§ß
the beat on blue world literally made me cry because i can imagine mac freestyling to that while he was alive.
This album made me genuinely cry, and so did what you had to say about it. It&#39;s disheartening to know that there won&#39;t be anymore projects from Mac, but I wasn&#39;t expecting this either. A great final project. ‚ù§
I wanna cry
Rip
Thanks buddy. But idk what velvet underground is. Are u talking about velvet revival
are you gonna talk about King Krule&#39;s new song &quot;(Dont let the dragon) Draag on&quot;
I know it&#39;s old but, can you review Champion Sound by JAYLIB? Consider it homage to Dilla.  I think the album is amazing.
No memes just a guy appreciating music.
We miss you Mac.
I love you Malcolm.... Mac‚Äôs face is on my arm forever....  Hand Me Downs is the best song on the album outside of the single Good News.... it‚Äôs just so sad, man.... not my favorite Mac album, but a great LEGACY piece,,.,..,. Love you Mac.,.... ‚ÄúTO ALL MY BROTHERS, MOST DOPE, THATS FOREVER‚Äù.....
Wow we can actually be civil?
Post Malone song is named circles meanwhile Mac Miller‚Äôs album is named circles ü§î strangee
so far this is Anthony&#39;s album of the decade
Anyone know any good mac Miller songs? I wanna get into his music but I don&#39;t know where to start
I know at surface-level this sounds very cringy, but knowing how hard the melon is to please and knowing his previous thoughts on swimming this review makes me enjoy the album even more and makes it that much more emotional.
That Slide Album is a VIBE
Fantano. I created this account just to comment on this video. You should listen to this album with the tracklist order reversed. Completely changed the feeling of the album and brought a different meaning to the title.
Biased 8
Oh so that‚Äôs how you pronounce ‚Äúposthumous‚Äù
seeing fantano in that shirt made me so happy :)
didnt touch on blue world
Why does this guy look like Mac Miller and Logic had a kid?
IT&#39;S STILL INSANE THAT HE GAVE SWIMMING A THREE
Have you noticed what seems like to be Ariana&#39;s secret feature on &quot;I can see&quot;?
Whack Miller was shit and I&#39;m glad he&#39;s dead.
Album of the year?
rip macü¶ã
Oh man, after the swimming review.... I&#39;m curious
Manic by Halsey?
:no complains about the album through the whole video, nothing but praise for a posthumous album<br>: a light 8/10
I Can See is my fav track....
We will never see Fantano&#39;s comment section this serious ever again, will we
I‚Äôll never forget that bullshit review you did of ‚ÄúSwimming‚Äù. Just tryna save face. Get lost fake
Ah... so <i>now</i> he‚Äôs chillin on the smart remarks.
Review the search  album for real this time
It was a phenomenal album. I cried several times listening to it, felt so many emotions, and had a lot of deep thoughts about life and death. We will be bumping you down here on earth forever Mac, RIP.
i struggle to critique this one. its flawed perfection in a sense, i really couldn&#39;t ask for anything more.
You knew it was going to be serious when he started with &quot;Anthony Fantano here&quot;. Instead of a different variable.
in an
Hi logic
Melon finally gave Mac the review he deserved
Never liked sad mac music but I still love listening to his early work like kids and best day ever.  Piffsburg favorite mac song!
I agree i dont really like i can see my favorite is thats on me
Apparently dying doubles ur score?
Mac &quot;dead bitch boy&quot; Miller
I can guarantee this album is only for the hardcore fans, which I am not. IMHO rappers should just stay rappers.
Solid 9 for me. I thought it was a great project,  almost felt like he came back and did this on some tracks.
10/10 RIP Mac Miller Forever
Did he even mention Once a Day?
anthony fantano, thank you.
I appreciate leaving out the silly intro. It&#39;s a small thing but it feels more respectful like this
great album. Surprised he didn‚Äôt mention Disclosure‚Äôs production on Blue World. a standout in my opinion but wonderful album nonetheless
<b>Starts off review completely normal</b><br><br>Oh shit, this boutta hit deep
Just imagine if he had given a not good to this album, the amount of dislike would have literally broken YouTubes algo
Would love to hear you review El Dorado by Marcus King
But ems album was a 5. I dont listen to mac but I thought I would with the album and it was pretty good. 7.5/10 for me ems album for me was 7.9/10 my opinion I suppose
Did u just hate on swimming? Tf
I thought this nigga was dead how he dropping tapes
ok but are you going to review the #1 album Rare?......
Damn I really thought he was gonna get a ten
I love this album but it sounds a bit empty bc Mac isn‚Äôt here with us üò≠üò¢
If Mac could see that your favorite one if his best pieces of work is after he died
When you come back again, we could convene and make it forever
The more I look at you the more you remind me of my transgender friend
Fuck you pin head fucking dickhead
Yea you better give this an 8 out of ten 10 Anthony
Melon, Im glad you liked Mac&#39;s new record but did you really have to......<br><br><br><br><br><br>Nah not today üò™ R.I.P Mac Miller
Please review ‚ÄúGood Luck Everybody‚Äù, I honestly want your opinion on this amazing, new AJJ album.
I love how this is just a solo album, no forced features to intervene with Mac&#39;s intentions... (looking at you, Cleo)
react to &#39;Please Excuse me for being antisocial&#39;
I Can See is definitely my favorite off of Circles. It‚Äôs a beautiful, magical song. I think it‚Äôs his best one of the album.<br>‚ÄúAnd now I know that life is but a dream then so are we‚Äù - I love the chorus, dig the layered sound too.
Anybody calling him a ‚Äújunkie‚Äù or blaming him for his addiction/death have gained absolutely nothing of substance from listening to this album (and even Swimming). Mac does a beautiful job of illustrating his mental state and crafted an extremely relatable and introspective album. If you can‚Äôt imagine his thoughts and pain, you‚Äôre just not listening. I‚Äôm so proud of you, Mac. Thank you and Rest In Peace.
beautiful
WHERE IS JACKBOYS?!
I can&#39;t listen to &quot;That&#39;s on Me&quot; and not imagine the amount of guilt and self-doubt Mac must have felt throughout the development of his career. Since falling into his work later than most people, I dove into interviews and stories about Mac - his depression, his self-depreciating critical eye - and this song really exemplifies these feelings. I keep wishing Mac had truer friendships, better connections with people who really connected with his heart, which seemed to be deeply broken.
I think u should incorporate decimal points to ur scores. Because just like finger skating rules if u give a 10,that would mean nothing is better then that. 10 being a perfect score. Just a suggestion. Big fan love what ur doing.
These comments are so peaceful i‚Äôm not even mad at the 400 ‚Äúpeople‚Äù who disliked the video
I CAN SEE IS A BANGER
Swimming grew on me and is one of the best albums that came out the year it was released and circles is firee you love it really dont lie fantano
I think it‚Äôs a good album and all. But, I have a feeling because of the situation this album will become a classic.
thanks for the birthday present melon üòä
I appreciate this review in many respects. Honestly though, it is quite a shame it takes Macs passing for him so say mostly positive things about his music in recent years...
‚ÄúRIP Mac Miller forever‚Äù - Needle Drop Boy <br><br>If he doesn‚Äôt want him to come back to life, what an asshole
Not Good
After listening to circles after about 5 times I realized that the album didn‚Äôt have any shameless features unlike bad vibes forever. Makes me appreciate it more that it was handled so well
Melon wearing his classic flannel is the finest way to send off a review on Circles.
So glad you finally gave mac the recognition he deservedüôèüôèüôè
R.I.P Mac Millerüòî
I thought that was a Faces vinyl I was like YO THEY PRESSED THAT???
Wow an 8, never thought I&#39;d see the day
This is how you correctly drop a posthumous album, take note
I love the album and I love this review
I stayed here for the mac Miller forever at the end.
üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè  havent watched yet but still üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè
I rated it an 8 too in my video lol clearly we are both MELONBRAINS
Good review melon
Surf is one of the best tracks on the album imo. Hits me really hard everytime
Mac was genius
I agree with your discredit towards Divine Feminine and also You. But there is no imbalance in the album Swimming. From the structure, tracklist, to the lyrics themselves. Wings, Hurt Feelings, So it goes. There is no inconsistent or failure to deliver from the album Swimming. Maybe Whats the use? Possibly could have been dropped from the tracklist but then again. &quot;I set the bar so far&quot; Knowing damn well what Mac meant with this verse/bar. Mac changed the whole game as an evolving artist. I appreciate your review! I agree with most of your statements. Maybe<br>take another dive into the piece of art which is Swimming bro.
Where tf is the roddy Ricch review?????
we were all waiting for this &lt;3 thanks &lt;3
Review city morgue vol 2
Damn melon only giving a shit artist 8 after he died, this album is doooodoooooo
Just because an artist dies from a drug problem doesn‚Äôt automatically make their music good ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
i can see worst track??? bs
I mean no offence to mac miller of course but how can he release a album when he‚Äôs dead is it pre recorded music
Feel like Mac on this LP had come to terms with his life and knew the direction which he was going to go sonically, i&#39;m gutted that it was all cut short for him, rip Mac. Nice review anthony, as always.
I&#39;m not sure why I&#39;m watching this, knowing that I&#39;m just not yet ready for the listening of this album. I absolutely will, but maybe I&#39;ll go back to Mac&#39;s older stuff to prepare me.<br><br>Rest in paradise, Mac Miller
Anthony, I understand that you love Mac&#39;s album Swimming but I came here to hear you talk about Circles. Not to hear you apologize about your previous rating.
Finally a half way valid review of an album. Most people think they can review an album in 2days. Even 1 week is still early
8 is a fair rating but let‚Äôs be honest in some sorts it‚Äôs 10 worthy.
woods made me break down, thank you for looking at this piece in a different light. it truly breaks my soul we won&#39;t get another fresh record from mr. fisherman.
‚ÄúAnthony Fantano, Rest In Peace Mac Miller, Forever.‚Äù im crying yo
Stream music to be murdered by tho
Mm.. this album doesn&#39;t deserve an 8. Let&#39;s be honest if Mac were alive this album wouldn&#39;t have good reviews. The best of this album is the production of Jon Brion. It&#39;s more like 6/10
Plucky muted guitar in Good News? I thought it was pizzicato from a violin
Review some music from That Handsome Devil!!!!
Made me sad to remember how youth passes away so quickly
That opening track tho...<br><br><br>cried my eyes out with it. Had to pause it and wait a good 20 minutes to continue with the rest of the album.
Melon feels obligated to wear a yellow flannel
The flannel yellow, the album excellent, me and the boys crying.
Reviews pending: <br>Algiers?<br>AJJ?
You should review khruangbin, dewolffs new alblum, mild high club, post animal and homeshake
This review got me. Now go back and give swimming a 10 pls
Beautiful album, and the best of the year so far. Way better than Eminem‚Äôs in every way.
this gave me more closure than the album itself. the yellow on a mac review? you‚Äôre about 6 years late melon.
Bro you don&#39;t need to call it trash.
made me interested. a worthy send off as it seems. First on my playlist: Nero di Marte - Immoto, second Mac M. - Circles.
Manic - Halsey next ?üëÄ
You should review the upcoming Drive-By Truckers album.
I love how this shit-eater finally caved in and kindly gave more attention then he did over Mac&#39;s earlier and recent albums  (Swimming), and likes Circles out of a string of low-brow reviews he&#39;d write off for Mac, SINCE he died of course.<br><br><br><br><br>I&#39;m starting to see a lot of bias shift in Anthony&#39;s reviews but you know, HIS OPINION
If anyone digs the production on Blue World, check out Disclosure‚Äôs 2018 EP Moonlight. Very similar with its use of samples such as on Where Angels Fear to Tread.
This warms my heart
Mac Miller no Filler
Love you Anthony.
This is an album I wanted more than any other of mac&#39;s albums to hear live. It&#39;s so upsetting that we&#39;ll never get those live band renditions of album that sounds like it was made for that.
What more can you say about this album. It‚Äôs a beautiful piece of work from a very special individual, that is more special because Mac is no longer with us, yet through the magic of music, it feels like he still is. As a fan of course I would like to hear more music from Mac, but if this is the last album we ever get from him, I am beyond happy. Woods is my favorite song. I can go on forever about how much Mac is one of the persons that has inspired me to pursue music and has given me so many great memories. Objects in the mirror, will forever be my favorite song of his. If there is any album that deserves the yellow flannel, it‚Äôs this one. I hope wherever Mac is, he is happy and at peace, and proud at what he managed to accomplish while he was here.
Melon broke out the yellow flannel for our boy Mac. I was so happy when you said how his vocals sound so upfront, it‚Äôs like whoever mixed and mastered this album made it sound like Mac is rapping/singing every lyric right next to us, right into our ears. The album is beautiful.
what the flannel?!
This is a make-up review for him shitting on swimming?
Just stop, he was terrible.
Would be cool if you could review Modus Vivendi by 070 Shake
i find &#39;surf&#39; so amazing
&quot;don&#39;t cry&quot; <br>been crying since it was announced, no stopping now
Hey Anthony, my older brother said the Yu-Gi-Oh cards you traded me aren&#39;t worth nearly as much as my PSA 10 shadow-less Charizard. Please trade the charizard back to me, or my brother is going to keep beating me up for giving it up so easily.
I really aprecciate it the respect that Anthony take to phostumous albums
R.I.P.
I thought I was insane thinking that it had influence of Tyler, thanks for that brother.
Re-review Swimming
It sucks to know that this will probaly be his last album üòîü§ß
Great review
If Kanye dies, Melon‚Äôll re-review MBDTF and still give it a 6.
So in other words, by reading the comments on this video, every song on the album supposedly made someone cry. Now why would i want to listen to an entire album full of cry-worthy songs? I def dont want to listen to an album where every song triggers a self loathing &#39;poor me&#39; mentality. Guess its a hipster thing or something.
We need album reviews on Rare by Selena Gomez, Manic by Halsey, and I Disagree by Poppy
I feel weird about this review as usual. I can not see how someone would like this album but not enjoy swimming.
I only came here to see Fantano cry again &lt;3
Its a good video, but that 4 minute racist outburst was not necessary
I&#39;ve watched you review the homie (give him 6/10s) for half a decade now, and it&#39;s come to an end. Thank you for all of it. I definitely want a worst to best for Mac, or at least Faces Redux, but the fact that you&#39;ve reviewed all of his projects since I&#39;ve watched you is a testament to a lot of good things. RIP Mac.
Long time Mac fan here. I enjoyed this album a ton. I liked it so much. However this isn‚Äôt nearly his best. I‚Äôd rank it at maybe 4th in his discography. Fantano has taken a complete shit on Mac Miller for his entire career and now that he‚Äôs dead he decides to love this album. Giving it an 8 compared to his other works is criminal. I get that it‚Äôs an amazing send off for Mac and it‚Äôs extremely heartfelt and bittersweet listening to this piece, but it just feels like a PR stunt to adore this album so much after not recognizing the brilliance of Swimming or even Faces. This album was everything fantano hated about Mac in his previous works. How can you give swimming a 3 and this an 8. Do you guys really think those albums were that different from each other? They were companion albums for fucks sake. Fantano makes solid points about why he likes this album, But he should have treated all macs previous works like he did with this one. This just seems really fake if I‚Äôm being honest, given how he‚Äôs treated Mac in the past
Lmao gives this shit an 8 cuz mac is dead yet gives Em a 5.<br><br>Laughable.
I love mac but this album is not great I&#39;m thankful for it dont get me wrong but there his B songs also he didn&#39;t  have much to do with the album other then singing in it,  I dont like how your all on his dick now hes dead but the last album you were slaging him off??? when clearly swimming is his best album not to say his other albums are bad he was amazing artist
You guys with your &quot;circles&quot; comparisons to the number 8 are such dorks, I freaking love It.
C&#39;mon, Antny. Just give it a 10.
1/5 theres no BARS.
8/10 my ass, this guy is just nostalgic for Mac Miller, this album literally has 2 good songs and the rest are so mediocre it&#39;s painful.
My roommate was playing this album in the car and It was my first time listening to Mac Miller, TBH I wasn&#39;t a fan of any of the songs. Anything from his older stuff people could recommend?
Its to late Melon, no amount of good reviews and yellow flannels will bring mac back you monster
I think you should review Marcus King on his record ‚ÄúEl Dorado‚Äù sounds so free and nostalgic, just a good album
If he was alive this album would have been a 6.
Swimming is dope what‚Äôs your opinion guys is circles better imo swimming is wayyy better but it seems circles is preferred by some.
Who else dropped tears hearing the first song  <br>(Circles)
This shit was garbage.  Wanna be Lil Peep. Mac was trying to be Emo.
Anthony gives Mac Miller the yellow flannel<br>[Everyone liked that]
What do you guys think he woulda gave it if Mac was still alive?
This is the best example on how to treat a dead artist not mooch off the death and fanbase with shit like what x has
Should have been a 9 . How do you not hear the Beatles influence on ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs On Me‚Äù my favorite song on the record.
Jon Brion is a hero, what a beautiful piece. I love this album so much more than I could have ever imagined.
Good review melonia
Circles<br>Blue world<br>Hand me downs<br>Complicated<br>Woods<br>The best ones i think
Rest in peace Mac. It&#39;s a shame you couldn&#39;t be here to witness your rise to legendhood. Miss you
i just finished listening to this album and was wondering when youll upload this review. great stuff man
Fuck u fantano bitch,great review
Theres not much more I could have asked for than for people to recognize the brilliance of the artist we know as Mac Miller. Fantano is exactly right in saying this album is the best musical send off we could have asked for. Most Dope, thats forever RIP Mac Miller
DO A UPCHURCH ALBUM!!!!! ‚ÄúSUPERNATURAL‚Äù
Love Mac but this tape sucked
wow can you imagine if every comment section was actually talking about the video? that&#39;d be cool
I love this album from beginning to end. i rate this project a 9/10. R.I.P. Mac Miller.
Can&#39;t believe you would talk this much sh*t about a dead person&#39;s album. Unsubscribing and never watching your content again
Wish you‚Äôd given faces a higher rating
Melon you can&#39;t give him a 9 just because he didn&#39;t deny being a nazi
Good shit fantano, good shit
YESSS
10 from me. Rest In Peace
You said please don‚Äôt cry but I gotta tell you Melon, we‚Äôre crying. RIP Mac Miller.
As much as I appreciate that we received this amazing album, I still can‚Äôt get over the fact that we will never see Mac perform these gems with that warm smile on his face.ü•∫
Thank you Jon Brion for putting together this incredible record the way it should have been. Mac Miller forever.
When this review blows up a little bit more (Which it definitely should!) I hope the comment section remains this serious and wholesome. It makes me almost as hapoy as the review does.
I feel like every album we got was a look into his life, his mind and his demons and how he conquered them. Circles feels like we&#39;re seeing the credits at the end of the movie. Rest in peace Mac
I couldn&#39;t care less about this album
Fantano. I created this account just to comment on this video. You should listen to this album with the tracklist order reversed. Completely changed the feeling of the album and brought a different meaning to the title.
watching Antony cry his eyes out was awkward but watching him being serious and respectful and talking in a monotone was even worst
Yo, on mobile I can rap your profile to SEE your comment history... Watch out üëÄ
Youre still cancelled for giving swimming a 3
Feels more Mac Demarco than Mac Miller, and I‚Äôm here for it.
Had this album in my head all week. Glad you liked it too.
Swimming: 3/10<br>Circles: 8/10<br>so Swimming in Circles: 11/10; I knew you&#39;d come around, melonhead
Rest in power Mac Miller, forever.
Wonder how many times Jon Brian watched melons last Mac review before releasing this
Never an 8 had so much emotional weight, fuck
Melons literally shit on macs attempt with more soulful music his whole career, but now he appreciates it...
I ............ agree
It was actually supposed to be a trilogy with the first swimming a mix between hip hop and song based. Circles more song based and the third which was yet to be made was supposed to be a full hip hop album to show he still does and loves that. Very sad that we are not able to hear itüò•
Review th professionals from madlib and oh no pls
your greatest review melon
That melody in Good News is easily the best I&#39;ve heard in well over a year.<br> I&#39;m a metal head who&#39;s working on my first EP and it&#39;s inspired me to ad something a little softer to it.<br> (Streaming whole album for first time nowüé∂)
I&#39;m glad this got an 8. Very deserved
Review BEBEY by THEOPHILUS LONDON and MODUS VIVENDI by 070 SHAKE
You didnt like swimming but you like this one?? Makes no sense.
‚ù§Ô∏è
I‚Äôm so glad we got a true finale for Mac‚Äôs music... Feels like closure to me,<br>unlike xxxtentacion who‚Äôs music is being milked dry
This album was more trash then my friends mixtape.... rip Mac Miller though
Now would this album be rated as such if mac hadn&#39;t passed awayü§î
Feels like you can hear the drugs in Macs voice all through this whole album. üôÑ Smh. Moderation keeps ya breathing.
Loved this album.
Antonio el Fantas
Anthony: &quot;Please don&#39;t cry&quot;<br><br>Me: too late
I definitely agree with you. I knew after hearing Good News that this project would easily be his best project in the like. It‚Äôs not hard to see that he‚Äôs done what a lot of artists struggle to do - which is to evolve. It‚Äôs a damn shame that he was taken too early from us and that we‚Äôll never be able to see just how much his sound evolves. RIP Mac. This was a beautiful way to truly send him off.
Who else stayed until the end to see what Anthony‚Äôs ‚Äúforever‚Äù line would be? üò¢
I actually liked swimming a lot more than this project.
This is what X and Peeps labels should‚Äôve done. Not just throw on some shitty instrumentals and features and call it a day
This guy is lame. For awhile he was on YouTube making fun of political correctness etc until he got accused of being alt right in a Fader article, after which he pretended to be a Bernie Bro because he was afraid of losing his shekels. I get that nobody cares and they just want music reviews, but it&#39;s hard to watch any of these now without recognizing that this guy is basically a disingenuous coward who has so little integrity that at this point he&#39;s probably convinced himself of his own bullshit. If you aren&#39;t going to judge people for something like that, then what do you judge them for? It&#39;s a shame that this guy has 2 million subs when people who had far more integrity, talent, and honesty than him lost their channels because of the censorship that he&#39;s too afraid to ever seriously address. People like this are the reason our country is a dumpster fire with no future. You&#39;re a pussy, Melon. Get fucked.
Mac Miller Forever &lt;3
Anthony gave Circles circles.
First posthumous album to get 8?
I love(d) this Album, a true piece of art and a warm love letter to the fans.  The production is crazy well done, props to Jon and Karen and the whole team. I‚Äôt feels like a true goodbye and mac reassuring us he‚Äôs fine and we should be too!
8/10 oml melon im so happy
Rest in peace
Been listening to the album on repeat. Sad that, this is all we will get from Mac ever again. Rest In Peace Eazy Mac
for some reason woods makes me the saddest...just the beat and the chorus...once that song came on it hit me
We won‚Äôt forget you dissing swimming and all his past albums and dissing how he‚Äôs being too soft, not giving any insight on who his is etc and how much his voice sucks. This is the same Mac we all love and you are just now enjoying his shit after he passed
wanna poppy?
I never really listened to Mac Miller very much. A few songs here and there Red Dot Music being my favorite but I don‚Äôt know this album to me is amazing. I have listened to it four times in a row which I never do and I still want to go back again. Rest easy Mac and thank you for the amazing work.
Please do 070‚Äôs debut album next! Completely next level stuff
I agree with the review, gave it an 8.5, however for me I can see was one of my favorites so now I shall trash in you in the comments
Fuck. I got sad again for the first time since I listened to the album at the end there.
The Game‚ÄîBorn 2 Rap
How do you make money from doing this?
I think the timing was perfect. It&#39;s a lovely, calming, nostalgic record. It really closes the book in a peaceful way. Saying he&#39;ll always be there for us.
Finaly a yellow flannel for my boy Mac ‚ù§Ô∏è
Ok so he gave swimming a 3 and circles an 8 and i can&#39;t understand what he is doing
Damn, Earl sweatshirt and Mac would‚Äôve made some great music together..
I can sleep easier now knowing that Mac finally got his props
Been eagerly anticipating this review. Thanks Anthony. Rest peacefully Mac.
...8/10 but not on the Loved list????
Stats of 2020:<br><br>8/10: 1<br>5/10: 1
My head cannon is you wanted to give Circles a 10 but gave it an 8 since that&#39;s the only number with 2 circles in it
Surf my favorite song üòÇ
Just realised how much Fantano looks like Mac Miller
ALBUM OF THE FUCKING DECADE.
Jon&#39;s work in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is dream-blowing and forever will be one of my favorite soundtracks in film. &#39;Phone Call&#39; just puts me to tears.
<b>did he just said</b> that i can see is the <b>WORST</b> song on the album
I‚Äôm glad instead of ruining this posthumous album, they really kept his style. It doesn‚Äôt feel like a cash grab, it feels like a continuation of his legacy
Mac Miller FOREVER üó£üó£üó£
An actual non cash grab postumous release wow very impressed
Great review . I really hope in the future his family will put some unreleased tracks out. This man lived in the studio theres gotta be some worthy gems
one of your best reviews melon, congrats
I‚Äôve been waiting a decade to see you wear a yellow flannel on a Mac Miller project. This honestly put me at ease
I&#39;ll see you one day Mac, RIP. Loved this album.
Anthonus Fantanus it is really in poor taste to deduct points for the artist, and I quote, &quot;being too cowardly to live to hear reviews&quot;.
<b>Eminem coming back from the dead</b>   Anthony: 5<br><b>Mac Miller coming back from the dead</b><br>Anthony: 8<br><b>What the hell Melon Boy</b>
Do 070 Shake
Mac went from getting the red flannel to the yellow from one companion album to the next, THAT is saying something. RIP Mac
id say surf is the only thing keeping this at a 9 for me
Tears in my eyes. yellow flannel Mac we made it bruh RIP
Mac Miller always sounds like he‚Äôs got hard candy in his mouth. But this album is pretty decent
üëçüëçüëç
Poppy?
He gave an 8 cause it‚Äôs made of circles
You give him an 8 because this is a posthumous album
You went a bit high on this i would probably give it a 7
He made a legit classic. RIP Mac, you‚Äôll live forever in your art.
Re-review Swimming, I feel like you will find a lot more within it compared to when you first reviewed it
HE‚ÄôS WEARING THE FLANNEL HE‚ÄôS WEARING THE FLANNEL GUYS
Ever since he died I‚Äôve always been kicking myself because I only listen to Mac Millers first beginning stages and mixtape which I believed was called ‚ÄúK.I.D.S.‚Äù &amp; his very first album ‚ÄúBlue Side Park‚Äù. That was the last I ever heard of his music and since I was younger then I stopped listening after that due to just forgetting &amp; having more music I religiously followed other than his. Now that he‚Äôs gone I wish I kept on listening after his first album back in 2011. I just didn‚Äôt know he was ever going to die and my preteen childhood is now ruined I wish I had more time <br><br>Rest Easy King.. I‚Äôm sorry üòî
Thank you. My mind is at ease.
You would‚Äôve given this album a red flannel if he were still alive smh
Good album
How tf did you give Swimming a 2, which is extremely similar musically and lyrically to this record.
This album by Mac Miller and Christ. The combination of all sounds and expressions in tone are meant to make you think, question, reminisce on your life to find out what has made you who you are today. Every day to live is a blessing, and life is only going to get better from here, cause Christ is walking, waiting for his Queen. üòáüôèüèªüòâ - JC<br><br>P.S. I‚Äôm not asking, I‚Äôm telling.
The &quot;Please don&#39;t cry&quot; in the outro hit different this time...
bald man makes ppl cry on the internet with a redemption story
Amazing review
Sees yellow flannel, <b>everyone liked that</b>
Can we get this comment section on every video? Those jokes are stale, boring, unoriginal and stop a good discussion from happening.
If anyone is wondering about Blue World&#39;s sound, it was produced by Guy Lawrence of Disclosure which is why it sounds a bit like a Disclosure track with the jazz chords, stuttering beat, etc.
They did him right
You know it‚Äôs gonna be a serious review when he doesn‚Äôt meme the intro. Thank you, that was the appropriate way to do it.
Do Kim Petras&#39; &quot;Turn Off The Light Vol. 2&quot;!!!
Ok, I get it‚Äôs a bad album but you didn‚Äôt have to say that ‚ÄúHe should‚Äôve died sooner‚Äù
How is I can see your least favorite song?
Sadly he&#39;s dead he can&#39;t see your review
Abouthany Timetano
Summed it up perfectly. Thank you.
You&#39;ve redeemed yourself after all, Melon
Saw the yellow flannel in the thumbnail and smiled. This album was a great final gift to honor Mac‚Äôs memory.
fucking surprised my dawg gave some respect but hey ig this that shit you like . i love you for putting faces as one of the best 200 projects of the 2010s. didnt deserve no damn 6 but you still know how that shit go mane
I remember finding out about Mac miller from mw2 montages back in the day
Mac doesn&#39;t have to tune Andre 3000, he is Mac Miller a talented rapper he tunes himself
I want you to know Melon, that this review made me cry, knowing that you recognized Mac‚Äôs potential- and he came through with this album, and he will never know that he executed this project this immaculately.
My favorite memory of Mac was when he was talking about Larry Lovestein and he said Larry was Jewish and the crowd started laughing and Mac&#39;s reaction was so hilarious. R.I.P.
God I&#39;m so glad you didn&#39;t shit on this project
Why did I get goosebumps when he said ‚ÄúRIP Mac Miller forever‚Äù :(
Still waiting for a review of manic by halsey
Finally some Justice for swimming, too bad Mac isn&#39;t here to see this :&#39;(
Ok but this album is just like a slightly slower swimming with less hip hop like idk why you didn‚Äôt like that album
He wears a Red Flannel in Swimming Review  and Mac passed away and now he wears Yellow Flannel to revive Mac back thank you Melon
I still wish swimming would&#39;ve gotten more love from melon
luv u anthony
I‚Äôll keep it a 100. It was pretty disappointing, its sounded like a watered down swimming with beats constantly sounding like previous beats. I did enjoy circles, good news, and one day at a time though. But all these albums recently have been overproduced. They did it to this, they did it to X, and it also happened to cowys2 for peep.
I&#39;m crying again...
Wow mellon. The yellow flannel doesn&#39;t mean you can do 8 mins of mac miller died jokes
:(
Pls review the new Anti-flag album pls.
review i disagree album by poppy rn!!!!!!!
It was a strong 10, instant classic
His feeling were way too pure and powerful for this world. If angels exists Mac is one of them and I really hope he is at peace now.
Anyone else already able to consistently predict melon&#39;s rating before being halfway through the video
Probably the best album i&#39;ve listened to in 2 years. So so fucking good.
This is amazing Anthony, I love you, we love you
REVIEW I DISAGREE AS PROMISED IDIOT
Listening to this album was an emotional expedience. Felt like speaking to an old friend one more time. So good.
How dare you say anything negative about Surf
Him and the producer were amazing on this one. I wish they could have made more music. Heaven is getting one hell of a concert RIP Mac.
I give this album a hard eight
I didn&#39;t like track 2. The mixing was just annoying to listen to.
theneedledrop flannel shirts when?
Where&#39;s Poppy?
such a fantastic album, i 100% agree with you that it was as amazing as a send off from mac could&#39;ve been for mac fans, long live Mac Miller!
I‚Äôll never understand why y‚Äôall feel the need to repeat the rating in the comments.
My boy Anthony is sad
Great review, but really surprised you didn&#39;t mention &#39;once a day&#39; at all, that was a great closer for the album and really tied in the record
Re-review Swimming! It‚Äôs better then you remember Melon
thanks for the kind words Anthony, good review
Won‚Äôt ever get to see him preform his new album :,(
:)
Just a fun fact: in Blue World it really sounds like the stutters is singing its a blue world, if you listen carefully :) Its such a sick little detail from the producers
it&#39;s nice to see an artist thats passed away getting a posthumous album that actually has soul and love rather than empty money grabs
Review Manic by Halsey
anthony gave mac an 8 for his posthumous album, yet he&#39;s literally thrashed artists like X and lil peep, lmao
to me, this album is a strong, strong 9. I love every single song so much
Finally
Blue world&#39;s gave me dilla vibes.
I clicked on this to see how he walks on eggshells
Boring album
Oh my, this record sucks but for sure is not 1/10
You got me really meloncholic, melon
You&#39;re lucky melon. Hadn&#39;t you respect this piece of art id never forgive you

Been listening to mac since the Jukebox mixtape and it&#39;s been such a pleasure watching his career blossom. RIP Mac Forever
ü§ß
Meeeeeehhhhhh just gave it a high score bc he dead
Let&#39;s agree: The album Circles is very good and  &quot;meloncholic&quot;
Rip Mac! You are missed. You made good music,your personality was solid. Thank you for your music.
There&#39;s no fooling around with your name, when RESPECT is to be shown.
yes
Though in complete agreement as a posthumous album this deserved a 9
Everybody gangster till Melon starts the video with his real name
Anthony, you shouldn&#39;t give the album a 0/10 just because you like squares more!
Mac melon ‚ù§Ô∏è
Mac Miller out here dropping better albums from the grave than Eminem can while hes still alive.
he&#39;s pandering, this was like a strong 5
Respect melon. It‚Äôs the best send off I could have imagined. My heart is full and I can tell yours is too. The yellow flannel was out so I knew we was getting something serious. All love
Juice WRLD&#39;s estate please take notes. And as for Jahseh&#39;s mom, stop profiting of your deceased son.
Seeing that yellow flannel is enough to make me tear up. Thank you
I miss this guy so much :/
The third album in this trilogy was meant to be a straight up rap album. Would have been sweet to hear that.
TDF and Swimming are class. Dunno how anyone could not like them.
Review the new pearl jam track melon
God damn this album was so good though.
No chance this record was better than Swimming. Death sympathy points I guess ü§∑
RIP MAC MILLER <br>A MODERN GOAT
Really disagree with your reviews on Mac.<br><br>His later stuff was alot better. <br><br>Swimming was a underated classic
Bro how did you not notice that Swimming was also this good
This album was ok to me but hey I like  mac he was a great dude
I liked swimming more but this is pretty good too
Who else got irritated that melon was sideways in the end screen
Mac, Melon got the yellow flannel for you, you made it man!<br><br>Swimming was at least an 8 tho.
Somehow I felt such joy seeing this being a yellow flannel review even tho it doesn‚Äôt really matter in the end. It‚Äôs just nice that this album gets the appreciation it deserves
Whole video i was good, then he said 8 and i was so happy for him. I started crying.  He was always one of my favorite artists that i preached for. Miss you forever mac.
Hey Melon, what‚Äôs the weather like?
Thanks for such a great review melon
All it took for Mac to get a yellow flannel was to die smh
fuck a grammy I want a yellow shirt
I&#39;m still hurt because that 3 Anthony
you know shits serious when tony fantano doesn&#39;t do a nickthony nametano
are you gonna review poppy
9/10 just because of some of the same things you said but all of that might have been fixed had he not passed. Nevertheless a beautiful album that will live on with me.
Am i the only one that loves i can see. Its one of my favorites
I use this album to fall asleep in a good way
&quot;Mac Miller forever&quot; üñ§
A mensch reviews a mensch
I‚Äôm scared of listening to this album.
Surf was actually my favourite track
The fact that he covered Arthur Lee has sold me
I can die happy
I still can&#39;t believe melon doesn&#39;t like divine feminine or swimming. Both albums are amazing
Amazing melon
Helped me get through a rainy sf day full of tears n misguided wants today
Justin Bieber: <b>begs fans to stream his song in their sleep and cheat the system to get it to top 1</b><br>Mac Miller: <b>literally dead, songs go into the top right away</b><br>ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Larry Lovestein is probably my favorite version of Mac. This album is amazing as fuck.
YESSS I NEVER THOUGHT ID SEE MELON GIVE MAC MILLER THE YELLOW FLANNEL THIS IS SO BITTER SWEET :,-)
I didn&#39;t love it as a Mac miller album I don&#39;t really know it&#39;s like something is missing. but a few moments were just really beautiful. I just hope we are only releasing things that he truly wanted to release.
You&#39;re right, we couldn&#39;t have asked for a better musical send off... it&#39;s such a shame he couldn&#39;t finish it... rest easy Easy Mac ‚ù§Ô∏è
Loved the introduction, ‚úä.
The song woods is my favorite
A comment section without memes??
&quot;Mac Miller, rest in peace, forever&quot; üò•
If you look closely you can see antuny look to the left while reading his script
Mac Miller forever really hurts man, tysm for ur video, loved it
Yall know it‚Äôs a serious review when he says his real name
Really great review
You only gave Mac a yellow flannel because you‚Äôre glad he‚Äôs gone
Does anyone know what albums are on the shelf? Thanks!
Mac Miller, <br><br>Forever
Why does the tone of an album have to be consistent? I mean, why is it frowned upon by melon when an artist doesn‚Äôt stick to an anchored base of familiar tone from one track to another?
HELL FUCKING YES
You should take a look at Lyrics to Go, Vol 1 by Kota the friend
I absolutely loved this album. I think it‚Äôs beautiful and sounds incredible. It‚Äôs just fantastic
Hands is crazy, its a metaphor for hands on the clock
This album was amazing
Fine i will put my pitchfork down i guess
it&#39;s interesting, Fantano&#39;s least favorite tracks like I Can See and That&#39;s On Me were my absolute favorite tracks on the album, whereas some of his favorites like Blue World were my least favorites (i can&#39;t stand the beat on Blue World, it sounds like one of those YouTube ads trying to get me to apply to college), maybe it&#39;s because i actually really like that Swimming sound, more melancholy, subdued deliveries and beats, whereas Fantano&#39;s into more in-your-face types of music.<br><br><br>like people have different tastes or something lol
I&#39;ve loved and listened to all of mac&#39;s project&#39;s. I&#39;m an addict that exhibits self destructive tendencies. When this man died it truly affected me. This album was to provide all of us closure. And It really makes you feel while listening to it. But looking at it I just cant help but think I really wish he was able to finish it. They are a lot of potential in some of these tracks. But I think we all know deep down half of these would not have made and album unless it was a bloated 18 tracks or something. It&#39;s almost fitting that this mans final project would make feel all the wasted potential over everything. Mac was an amazingly talented artist. He could rap,produce, sing etc. I can only hope people continue to appreciate what he added to the world. It&#39;s really strange how as his music changed. It&#39;s as if when he was rapping about kool aide and pizza. I was smoking pot having a good time. And then as his later stuff was coming(wmwtso) I had been turning to harder drugs. I hope his family knows his death isnt in vain. I know many people that his music made them feel as if they weren&#39;t alone.
do modus vivendi - 070 shake
Mac&#39;s family did him well üñ§ much respect the way this was handled
I cracked the code! These are the steps to make a 10/10 album:<br><br><br>1. Make an album with only two songs.<br>2. name them &#39;&#39;All of them&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;None of them&#39;&#39;<br>3. Fantano will hate &#39;&#39;None of them&#39;&#39; and love &#39;&#39;All of them&#39;&#39;<br><br><br>so....Technically there is nothing wrong with the album,  EZ 10/10
Rich youngin review!!
Review NF - The Search
He looks so cold throughout the video
:&#39;)
Notice how there‚Äôs no dumbass, stale memes posted in the popular section? Shows the love and respect Malcolm earned during his lifetime. Love you brother. Rest easy.üíï
You love blue worlds beat because it was produced by disclosure
First love of the decade
this album made me sad<br>plain and simple
Interesting how he panned most of his albums but gave his posthumous album an 8
Best album of the year so far
I can see is my favorite song on the album...
I  <b>Hope</b> that the comment section on this video stays like this forever. <br>No memes and edgy humor. <br>Just a bunch of people appreciating good music from a beautiful artist. <br><b>RIP Mac</b>
Thank you Melon
You should really review Eminem instead of doing whatever this is
Disclosure produced blue world
Thank You Fantano
Mac Miller forever ))))))) :
God bless Jon Brion for curating the album! He really did brought out the best out of Mac&#39;s artistic side. R.I.P. Mac Miller
Album has been on repeat ever since release.
All I ever hear from this guy is ‚ÄúI miss this sound‚Äù this man is joke
you need to do a review of halseys new album
Thank u , Jon Brion üíôüôèüèº
BRUHHHHH It literally never fails. Every single damn time an album like this drops and I‚Äôm excited for the review his least fav track is ALWAYS my fav track. üòëüòëüòë i love u melon but I Can See is so beautiful bro come on ‚òπÔ∏è
Good News made me laugh
So glad that Mac went out on his best album. He has this great review and legacy to follow it up with as well.
&quot;I can see&quot; in the worst has me howling, what the FUCK, Melon.<br><br>Good review though xo
This is actually a fucking treat thank you for this man
at least this album wasnt full of loops of a dead rappers voice, (xxx, lil peep, ...) cashgrab albums
Had the pleasure of watching him live in 2015. He was not only a great artist, but also a talented and energetic live performer.
Am I the only one who enjoyed swimming more
This album is amazing...and it being posthumous makes it so much more poignant...love it.
thank you melon. thank you.
fun fact: disclosure helped make blue world<br>you should AR mura masa&#39;s new album RYC please
Yeah, Anthony. Singer-Songwriter is a genre
I miss mac so much.
Review the Pearl Jam you coward
Mac n cheese
I totally agree with what he said about surf.  Love I can see though.
Mac Miller Alive: Bad Reviews<br>Mac Miller Dead: Good Review<br>Hmmmm
Always tear up listening to it
So happy Mac‚Äôs final project was handled with dignity and care. The way the whole project was promoted felt very genuine.
Who&#39;s also always eager to see if Melon will  use one of his Namethony Namethano intros? üòÇ
If Mac passed away before Swimming was released I know for a fact you would have rated the album higher
I know you said please don&#39;t cry, but like... damn man.
Melon&#39;s only giving Circles an 8/10 because he felt badly about joking about Mac Miller&#39;s death.
the track ‚Äòsurf‚Äô made me tear up
Good review
Thank you for reviewing this Anthony. Mac would have been so happy.
8/10 <br><br><b>Most Dope</b>
I loved I can see
Hey Anthony, please review Valasse Eruva&#39;s album Ascending Phoenix!
Ngl everytime I listen to Circles I see your pretty face in tear and this make me so sad

I‚Äôm not crying, we‚Äôre crying
Thank you for this yellow flannel Anthony üòå
love u melon
Love ya melon
what does &quot;washed out production on swimming&quot; mean? i thought the production on that album was phenomenal...
Anthony better review The Chats debut album when it comes out
Love the review melon! Just FYI the singer on Hand me Downs is named Baro (pronounced like &quot;Barrow&quot;) before Mac passed away Mac was flying Baro out to LA to record an album together but unfortunately the day baro would get to the USA was just after Mac had passed, in some tweets from baro he has spoken about his experience with Mac and talked much about their plans to sign him and working on hand me downs the weekend that they had met! His project Just problems you need to know is amazing and defiantly worth a listen if you like baro&#39;s singing and cadence on this song, he&#39;s only 22 and is a multi instrumentalist and a very capable singer/songwriter/rapper/director  with a bright future ahead of him!
Review JACKBOYS
You lost the necessary integrity to review this with that review of swimming where you mentally disconnected from reality.
RESPECT, Melon!
Listen to Oli XL - Rouge Intruder Soul Enhancer
....yella√†aaaaaaaw
I don‚Äôt think Complicated gets enough love. The ‚Äúinside my head is getting pretty cluttered. I‚Äôve tried but can‚Äôt clean up this mess I‚Äôve made‚Äù line is amazing to me
It makes me happy that you can see the quality in this album. Thanks Mayn
You didn‚Äôt fuck this up. I fucking love you Melon. Mac Miller forever.
The most beautiful fact about this review, it&#39;s not only the first review in the love list of the year, but it&#39;s also too the first review in the love list of the decade, so we can remember Mac even more (in this year and decade). <br>Rest in peace Mac
Great review melon. This album was a perfect send off, I just wish Mac was here to see you break out the yellow flannel
Review Tradition by Monsune
An 8!!!!! Respect!!!! It‚Äôs an amazing album üòä
Man it‚Äôs just so fuckin sad.
The title track breaks my fuckin‚Äô heart ü•∫<br><br>It‚Äôs one of the most relatable songs I‚Äôve ever heard, as I‚Äôve felt the same way for a long time now.<br><br>Makes me miss him even more than I already did üòû
We really got lucky with Mac Miller and Gangstarr getting <b>PROPER</b> posthumous releases, proper sendoffs for two phenomenal acts<br><br>And as corny as it sounds, maybe the finale to this trilogy is the music made in his legacy (whether it be artists who watched him or knew him personally)<br><br>We lost a great one, but at least we got a lot of beautiful work to remember him by, <b>Swimming In Circles forever</b> üíô
8/10 only because Mac is death
This is how you do a posthumous album
Woo
The instrumentals on this album were the best I&#39;ve heard on a hip hop/R&amp;B album in a LONG time, almost Pet Sounds inspired. Not sure what miller originally intended for the instrumentals but I&#39;m so happy they went in a relatively ambitious direction on here. I&#39;ve always respected all of mac millers music even if I dont like it all, because he never seemed to do what everyone else was doing.
I‚Äôm glad that melon gave this an honest review, because I have watched so many people give meaningless reviews about this album for the ‚Äúfame‚Äù in views that I so stupidly gave them. Thank you for the honest, and amazing review.
I cried.
You only gave it a good review because he died
I spy a George Clanton album üëÄ
Mac ....a real LEGEND. RIP king
I love him so much. rip man fuck
it was so great but really hard to listen to. :(
LOVE YOU  MELON
An 8 is really just two circles tbh, I think the rating is fitting (also because i figured the album would be an 8 or 9)
It&#39;s sad to know that he wont review anymore of Macs work. Glad to see that he did enjoy this album though. RIP Mac
First yellow flannel of the decade
ThAnks for reviewing this melon, and thanks for the great job with the review and the video. Appreciate you.
Rest easy Mac
I forgive you for the MBDTF review. Thank you melon I needed this.
This was what i wanted to see
What does the yellow flannel mean
This, is a perfect ending.
8/10 is an important review. Thanks brother.
After Mac‚Äôs passing, I simply couldn‚Äôt listen to him anymore. He was my top artist of all time, he‚Äôs the reason I got into hip hop. He was pretty much all I listened to. But once I heard the news... listening was just too painful. I‚Äôve never been so affected by death, and listening to this album was brutal. So emotional and heart wrenching. However... I‚Äôm thankful the album is getting a good response and especially one from Fantano. Thank you for being respectful to him in this video
The first 10 of the decade !
‚ÄúMy god, it go on and on, it‚Äôs like a circle I go back where I‚Äôm fromm‚Äù - last line on swimming..
Your mind says Decent 8, but your heart says Strong 10
üòûü§òüèª
So idc what he says swimming is amazing
Jon Brion has composed some amazing films<br>(You gotta watch Synecdoche, New York, Lady Bird, and Especially Eternal Sunshine oh my God)<br>So imagine my surprise when I hear Mac Miller was recruiting him for an album<br><br>Jon really helps enhance the emotions that Mac is trying to portray<br><br>It&#39;s an incredibly hard hitting album<br>Really groovy at times and at others absolutely crushing with sadness and regret from a life cut short<br>Especially tracks like Good News and Circles are just fucking heartbreaking because of the production,<br>Some minimalist and some maximalist<br>Other songs are grounded and others are ethereal<br><br>To have a composer that passionately composes to push the emotions of the films he works on, really improved the project from something like Swimming or The Devine Feminine, in my opinion<br>I&#39;m also downright thankful there are no features on this project because it&#39;s Mac Miller&#39;s final artistic statement<br>Features might have lost the focus<br>(although I wouldn&#39;t have minded an Anderson .Paak line or two)<br><br>Mac Miller wasn&#39;t always one of my favorite musicians of the 2010s<br>But I could always see his artistic merit through his experiments with genre and production choices on his albums, and his features around the middle 2010s especially<br>His production as Larry Fisherman also has an abstract style I haven&#39;t heard replicated since he stopped using the name<br><br>Mac Miller was a true talent who tried to push himself to expand his music&#39;s genres each time he made an album<br>He really grew up from the man who was making College Kid Weed Raps in &#39;09<br>and he REALLY grew up from being Easy Mac<br>and I&#39;m really proud of his progression musically<br>He will be missed.<br>Rest in peace, Mac Miller.
Helicoptering your junk in ‚Äúcircles‚Äù for 9 minutes wasn‚Äôt very respectful melon
Don&#39;t cry because it&#39;s over. Smile because it happened
mac miller redemption arc
I agree with all the criticisms! Well said
City morgue vol 2: as good as dead plsssss
Especially glad they didn‚Äôt plaster this with features and try to monetize his death
Got choked up with what you said at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ndtSyn6dVg&amp;t=468">7:48</a>. I think one of the worst things about mac‚Äôs passing is that he really could‚Äôve become one of the greatest artists of our generation and it sucks that one of the biggest examples of that has to be a really really solid posthumous album that he‚Äôll never be able to follow up on.
I&#39;m sad he&#39;s gone too, but your foray into necromancy to create a Mac gollum that cannot rest until he finishes a 10/10 album is not the way to grieve
&quot;Everybody lives a little, everybody dies, but that&#39;s life, what you&#39;re gonna do?&quot;
Please do a redux for faces ! I don‚Äôt think you did it justice imo
Glad they released this knowing it was what the artist wanted instead of an unfinished demo tape
I appreciate the flannel, but issa 9
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
I wish I could give this a million likes
I feel like this album is only gonna get better with age. An amazing final album R.I.P Mac Miller
Blue World is just amazing, the beat and sampling is so refreshing.<br><br>Rest in Peace Mac.
big ups to Baro burn city
Three best tracks are Circles, That‚Äôs on me, and Good News. Loved the album
<b>*everyone liked that*</b>
extremely excited when i saw that sweet sweet yellow flannel
Anthony, I‚Äôm appalled. You can‚Äôt just sit there for 9 minutes talking about the album and scoring it at the end and call that a review. Seems like clickbait
No Memes, just genuine love and respect thrown around in this comment section. Thanks Melon for actually coming through with a solid take.
Melon: Please review an album called ‚ÄúBlack Aura My Sun‚Äù by a new project called Deserta.
This album is so chill. Smoked a blunt to it.
Love Fantano forever.
Goddamn Hand Me Downs had be balling first listen
Here comes the 8s!!!!!
This is exactly how labels should be taking care of posthumous music. This album is is no way watered down &amp; is curated to what Mac would‚Äôve liked us to have listened to. Great work, RIP Mac
Started listening to Mac after I saw him on wild n out years ago the song he performed at the end of the show is what got me hooked
This man doesn&#39;t know Mac...
What more can you say about this album. It‚Äôs a beautiful piece of work from a very special individual, that is more special because Mac is no longer with us, yet through the magic of music, it feels like he still is. As a fan of course I would like to hear more music from Mac, but if this is the last album we ever get from him, I am beyond happy. Woods is my favorite song. I can go on forever about how much Mac is one of the persons that has inspired me to pursue music and has given me so many great memories. Objects in the mirror, will forever be my favorite song of his. If there is any album that deserves the yellow flannel, it‚Äôs this one. I hope wherever Mac is, he is happy and at peace, and proud at what he managed to accomplish while he was here.
I was just thinking, i wonder what that music nerd thinks about macs album. After typing ‚Äúmusic nerd‚Äù in my search bar I arrived. Decided i gotta sub after that lol
I forgive Anthony now for the score he gave Swimming
Everybody is the best song
beautiful music, truly.
Thats on me was snubbed
He... actually said his name
I was chanting give him a 10. Then you smacked my soul with an 8. I&#39;m not mad. Just
Would you consider reduxing Swimming after how much you liked this album since they&#39;re considered companion albums?
Anthony, you did not need to say that good news ‚Äúsounded like an n-word song‚Äù
blue world üåé is so good
RIP one of my favorite artists ever, miss you forever Mac
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ndtSyn6dVg&amp;t=517">8:37</a> Too late, Melon, I did cry
wtf melon, giving it a NOT GOOD just because Mac is black. smh ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Love the George Clanton album in the back
üëèüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩ‚ù§Ô∏èwell done Melon, well done
Lovely review
Have you done anything on JACOB COLLIER???
I been waiting for this .
I still heavily disagree with your rating of Swimming, but I respect your opinion. Circles was the perfect send-off to Mac&#39;s legacy and I&#39;d be completely happy and satisfied if this was the last music we got from him. I&#39;m glad that you got more out of this record, and I think the 8/10 is a perfect rating here.
Haven‚Äôt checked it out yet since almost every artist that has passed get exploited and labels destroy the artists vision for an upcoming album. Might check it out now seeing the responses.
I never had the chance to listen to Mac before Circles but i wish i did, this shit is fucking beautiful and already a favourite of mine for this year!
I think this is fantanos highest mac rating ever ooo shooot lets goo mac stansss
Oh my god yes Melon!!
This album was awful. Cock jockeys everywhere. Gotta love listening to a drunk man‚Äôs slurred speech for an hour.
hearing you make a brief andre 3000 comparison made me so happy<br><br>rip mac
Thanks, now review swimming and give it a 8 aswell
I SAW THE YELLOW FLANNEL AND CLICKED SO FAST
Rip mac
YES
rip mac
Antonee loves posthumous albums i guess
I had low expectations for this after seeing XXX&#39;s labels blatant cash grab albums but it was incredibly well done.
This album was heartbreaking. Good News is the first song I‚Äôve heard in a long time that made me cry. I not only related to it, but it contextualized Mac‚Äôs entire situation before his passing. We have a tendency as a society to not take depression and self-medication seriously. I hope this serves as some sort of wake up call.
hate to admit it but i was not gonna listen to this album for a number of reasons(one being that im not a huge mac miller fan) but when i saw fantano in the yellow flannel in the thumbnail i figured i might as well and for what its worth i dont regret it, this album feels like a ghost saying fairwell, a soul at peace.
Thankyou Anthony and thankyou Mac Miller ‚ù§Ô∏è
Gr8
Anthony,<br>     With all due respect I believe you should listen to swimming all the way through one more time. Please just once
Mac milar
left off on a good note :,)
YouTube unsubscribed me wtffffff
Seeing that yellow flannel made me tear like melon boy on that good news reaction
BEST ALBUM OF THE 2020s SO FAR
Death has Finally become The Savior with the Flannel
It‚Äôs yellow. My god it‚Äôs yellow. And for once I don‚Äôt disagree. I can find either minor or major critiques with the other Mac reviews but for once we‚Äôre on the same page here melon
He should have given that a 9. But I agree wholeheartedly with the review. Good job melon.
I Can See was my favorite song on the album by far
Okay he gives this an 8 but swimming a 3...I bet if Mac died before swimming he would have given it a 9
8/10<br>Ok I&#39;m in heaven now
<b>Yawn</b>
Forever!
review poppy i disagree NOW !!!
widepeepoSad
Hand me Downs is easily my favorite off the album, probably through out his whole discography. Its perfect
My favorite song&#39;s of Circles are Surf and I Can SeeüòíüòÇ
Surf and hand me downs were my favourite
now that was a startling intro
Gives it positive review just cause he‚Äôs dead ok melon
Great review anthony but u did not have to introduce yourself as &quot;Deadthony Mactano&quot;üòê
I wonder how he would‚Äôve rated it if Mac was still alive....
Fantano gave album an 8 because it&#39;s 2 circles
I am so fucking happy to see this
Yellow flannel!!!!
this better be in the top 200 albums of the decade when you make that vid in 2030
I wonder if Ariana will be able to listen to this... that poor girl can‚Äôt get a break
Bruuhh, Swimming was arguably better or equally as good as Circles &amp; gave it a bad review ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Review poppy&#39;s i disagree you melon
This album makes me happy and sad, and sad happy and I&#39;m glad it has the yellow flannel stamp of approval now so a few more people can be persuaded to feel its sad happiness along with me
Anyone else really like the song That‚Äôs On Me?
I heard that Swimming and Circles were supposed to be part of a trilogy and the 3rd record was supposed to be a straight hip hop album and that makes me sad cuz we don‚Äôt get to hear one last rap album from Mac
I would say the majority of this Album is about Ariana Grande just though the references he makes. I&#39;ve only listen to it fully once I couldn&#39;t get though it I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve cried that much since I watched Cory Monteith last episode on Glee when I was 15. I can&#39;t imagine how Ariana could possibly get though the whole thing and ops I&#39;m tearing up again. A true send off from an icon of my teens.
He&#39;s just saying all this cause he died he&#39;s been ragging on mac for a decade
Swimming was better than circles
<b>sees yellow shirt</b><br><b>goes to desiption</b>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ndtSyn6dVg&amp;t=256">4:16</a> he says mellon
As hard as John Brion killed the production/composition on this album, kind of surprised no one is mentioning the Guy Lawrence (of Disclosure) production on &#39;Blue World&#39;. Easily one of the better songs on the album.
Anthony is such a Mac kiss-ass now üòë
woooooooooOOOOOOOOOOOooooo he got an 8/10! yes man, I knew this concept alone, might be an album of the decade
So best posthumous album ever
You‚Äôre so full of shit üòÇ
Beautiful
The one album where we all mutually agree to not just spam memes
I really enjoyed the album. RIP Mac!
So happy when I first heard this album, and instantly thought &quot;yes, that&#39;s amazing that he&#39;s gonna go out on top&quot;
Rest in Peace, Mac.<br><br>You gave us an amazing send off.
Every album by Mac is amazing, this one isnt even the best. You lost your mind
Finally it‚Äôs here
I‚Äôm still not sure how you give Swimming a 3
Dear Music Industry:<br>This is the correct way to do posthumous music
No way did you just compare it to TVU, one of my favorite records. To even have Mac‚Äôs name in the same sentence as Lou Reed‚Äôs shows just how good this project is.<br><br>Also let‚Äôs get a Velvet Underground classic review please.
Tofu Tony, you are forgiven for the swimming review. God it sucks knowing this is the last thing he&#39;ll share with the world but at least it ends on a high note
Fantanoooooo please review the Poppy album I Disagree
I bet he actually doesn‚Äôt like it but knows you pussies would bash him for not liking his last album.:
that&#39;s on me and surf are great I do not care to debate
Of course now that he&#39;s dead you finally give an album of his a high score
If Mac hadn&#39;t died and this came out he would have given it a NOT GOOD/ or below 4
The flannel made me so happy ‚ò∫Ô∏èüôèüèª
Allota the same shit that&#39;s in swimming smh
This album was amazing, it really saddens me that he‚Äôs gone forreal! Rip Mac Miller, until we meet again
Hey anthony just wondering if you&#39;ll ever do aussia rap, dont see it much but ur doing great
If I squint my eyes enough yall look like the same person lol
See Mac Miller isn‚Äôt dead... he just released an album
Flowers
Mac can finally rest in peace üôè
I didn&#39;t like this album that much. Honestly.
Redo the Swimming review, thanks
&quot;he&#39;s white&quot; is not a good reason to say you loved the album melon
if mac was alive circles would‚Äôve gotten a 4
Would the album still gets 8/10 if Mac was still alive? It is really hard to look at some artist&#39;s work after their death subjectively. I am not saying the record is bad, but it is not at 8 really. It is more or less as good as faces.
I dont understand how you can give this an 8 but Swimming a 3. I dont get the math there
Okayyyy I&#39;ll listen to it if you INSIST melon
review manic pls
Wow Anthony you didn‚Äôt have to make fun of the guys drug addiction for half the video and then give it a pity 8 just cus he overdosed and died.
yellow flannel for the last of mac :&#39;)
tripped me out when he said ‚ÄúAnthony Fantano‚Äù
Don‚Äôt get how this is an 8 but Swimming was a Not Good.
rip mac. love you bud
So handsome for what melon
Very nice
You know people respected Mac Miller when even melon‚Äôs comment section stops cracking jokes
When th is the Stormzy review coming????
fantano really got hurt on the criticism of his last mac Miller review üòî
8 is fair but damn dude good news is a solid 10.  Felt that. RIP Mac.
My eyes shouldn&#39;t water like this. <br>My eye balls are t he circles that are swimming
Please review Junk Food by Easy Life
YELLOW FLANNEL!!!!!
Overrated
Please review Junk Food by Easy Life
Yellow flannel for Macs grand finale you absolutely love to see it... Mac Miller Foreverüíõü§çüñ§
Drinking game: Watch 10 of Anthony‚Äôs reviews randomly and take a shot every time he says ‚Äúwashed out‚Äù.
First yellow flannel of the decade and its dedicated to mac miller&#39;s last record
Please review Junk Food by Easy Life
This was a better send off than xxxtentactions albums
Rest Easy, Mac.
Ok so you gave his wonderful, introspective posthumous record an 8, but did you have to kill him in the first place Melon?
Thanks for keeping it real one last time for the Macheads. Respectful intro and tone throughout, and the yellow flannel was a nice touch. <br><br><br><br><br>RIP MAC we love and miss you forever
so at this moment, its the highest rated album of the decade
It was clear he was going to inflate this rating a bit based on him giving a total shit show of a review on Swimming
circles doesnt even feel posthumous, it jus feels like Macs back
This makes me happy.<br><br>Surf is soooooo good though, and Once A Day needed to be mentioned.<br><br>Still, this review makes me happy
RIP.
review selena gomez new album!
TBMB&gt;Circles
never been this excited to see a yellow flannel
Sooo no jackboys?
Once a day was so good
r.i.p Mac
Fair review much love Melon
Once a day is one of the best songs I‚Äôve ever heard
wow <br>-owen wilson
really expected you to shit on this due to your stance on macs singing ability over the years, but im really glad you liked it anthony, just wish he was alive to hear all the praise and hear his completed album man, most dope, forever.
I&#39;m pretty out of touch with a lot of modern artists and this album is my introduction to Mac Miller (I&#39;ve heard of him, just not his music) and I love this album more and more each time I listen to it. Anthony was able to articulate far greater than I ever could and I agree with his opinion here. I think most artists could only dream that their last project would be so good.
Anthony Fantano redemption arc
The production on this album was stellar
WHERE IS THE POPPY REVIEWüò≠üò≠
Hey, have you forgotten to review Poppy I Disagree???
I just listened to the album, it was a beautiful ending. RIP to an incredible artist
speaking of elliott smith.... review some of his work for classics week. one of the greatest to ever do it. regardless, great video. very emotional ending.
Jon Brion is a fucking legend. Late Registration is an absolute classic. one of my favorite albums. definitely gonna have to listen to this one. Fantano you da man.
THIS IS WHAT I WANTED YESSSSSSSS
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ndtSyn6dVg&amp;t=517">8:37</a> this album made Anthony could&#39;t follow his own advice
good review melon head
Ya gonna cry again? Maybe piss &amp; shit your pants a little?
Your swimming album review is probably your worst one. Still respect.
I always knew Mac was so much more than people thought he was. But this album showed that he was so much more than what I thought he was. His music always made me feel good but this album gave me goosebumps. I won&#39;t get the same feeling I got listening to this project from anything else for a long time.
would be a 7 if he was alive
Wherever Mac is, I hope he&#39;s smiling.
Melon sucking up to Mac a lil too late dont ya think?
No joke at the beginning, serious video
Cleo should take some notes
Thank you melon, I came here expecting you to shit on this album but thank you for the respect sir. We love you Macüñ§
Seeing all the positivity from Circles makes me so happy to know that even though Mac isn‚Äôt here anymore, his legacy has not suffered the same fate as many others unfortunately. I just can‚Äôt imagine how happy he would‚Äôve been hearing this news during his tough times. We Love You Mac.‚ù§Ô∏è
I would say 6/10
Loved this album so much, and personally I liked Swimming a lot too even though his vocals were very reverbed and mixed with the instrumentals. Honestly I kinda liked that part of it personally, very chill, so was this album. RIP Mac Miller
YELLOW
Nothony Jokestano in the open. Thanks for doing what you do, Anthony.
Watched the whole video waiting for fantano to say &quot;Rest in Peace. Mac Miller forever&quot;. Such a good album, it really is sad to think that we won&#39;t see him progressing past this point. But I do love all the work and art Mac has done, and I love him by the true artist he was. Indeed, Mac Miller forever.
REVIEW POPPY
Blue World is for sure my favorite song of the year so far
Mel√≥n: descent 8 <br><br>Everybody: 10 for ever in our hearths.
its insane man, I&#39;ve been watching your reviews since like 2012
My favorite album since movies with the sound off. This album made me cry while playing it.
Jon brion is a legend
A good rating for someone who‚Äôs dead??? Never heard of THAT combo before.
I thought the album was great as well!!! So many emotions for me!!<br><br>Also Fantano need that Poppy album review!!!
I imagine Fantano letting out a breathy sigh of warmth and closure as he picked out the yellow flannel for this one
Don‚Äôt like Mac Miller at all but this shit is amazing
Rest in peace<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Fantano
On the first night this album dropped listening through it and getting to Surf as the second to last track, skimming through everyones comments as if it was a live chat.....it felt like we were all in the same room together chillin‚Äô with Mac as he song and played the guitar to us. I‚Äôve never felt a feeling like I did that moment in my life. <br><br>Because of that Surf will hold a SUPER special place in my heart, and Fantano missed out it seems. <br>An infinite amount of tears will never express how much I cherish Mac‚Äôs music, and to get something like this was LITERALLY a God‚Äôs send. <br><br>almost like....A Scoop on Heaven
A posthumous album getting an 8 not only shows how great he was but how great the team he had around him was. They cared more about a send off rather than money
thank you Anthony. you didn‚Äôt have to sugarcoat your feelings about this record and it‚Äôs easy to see you genuinely loved this album.
I didn&#39;t really like this but I&#39;m sure it&#39;s partially due to the fact I hadn&#39;t listened to one of his albums beforehand for context
you know what<br><br>i‚Äôm glad he finally got it and i‚Äôm glad melon realized it
I saw the yellow flannel and almost cried
let&#39;s hope they don&#39;t give mac the xxxtentacion treatment and try to release more posthumous albums out of random left overs from his other stuff, if this is the final send off for mac i&#39;m perfectly happy with that, nobody wants greedy executives trying to make money off macs passing
I loved swimming and was surprised about your take on it, so it‚Äôs really awesome to see you genuinely enjoyed this album. RIP Mac, a yellow flannel send off is what you deserve
Bittersweet
Daddy
I&#39;ve listened to Mac since about 2009 and the way he&#39;s transitioned musically is truly amazing. I love the direction he was heading and I almost felt like I was growing up with how his music grew. Thank you for getting me through the tough times Mac. You&#39;ll always be my favorite artist.
<b>Yo, Mel√≥n, review 070 Shake ‚ÄòModus Vivend‚Äô</b>
:))))))
love the George Clanton Slide album in the background
I give this a light 7, let‚Äôs see what melon thinks.<br><br>Edit: I was wrong? My opinion was wrong.
it could sound crazy but I was having a shitty day and this cheered me up thank u melon<br> R.I.P Mac ‚ù§
I thought it was in poor taste when you said &quot;Mac Miller is the reason rap is dead.&quot; 200 times.
8 = 2 circles.<br><br>Man.
Melon puts on yellow flannel<br>Everyone liked that
Why do I feel like it‚Äôs a 8 only because he died? But if he was alive it would‚Äôve been a 4/5
Be real dweeb this album is no better than a 5/10
melon draws a circle for 8 minutes and 49 seconds
You should do a re-review of Faces, Macs best work IMO.
Had a smile on my face during this entire interview. Very bittersweet<br><br><br>Fair review Anthony, and R.I.P Mac Miller
Opens with his real name AND the yellow flannel.  Knew this was going to be special.
I swear, Blue World is one of the best songs I&#39;ve ever heard
‚ù§Ô∏è
I think this is my favorite album as a whole from Mac. As an artist, I&#39;ve experienced the opposite effect of most, I hated his early projects but as he grew and his style changed and progressed, I started to like his work and him more and more. Sad to see that he won&#39;t continue to progress as I&#39;ve grown to love his newer, darker, jazzier albums.
Mac was evolving and it showed with his music
I love the album Salad Days from Mac Miller, R.I.P
Melon if you don‚Äôt review PEMFBA by Roddy Ricch we riot
You know this is a very serious review when not even the comments are making jokes. RIP Mac
Guilty Conscience eating you up, melon.<br>Should‚Äôve gave the man his flowers.
Blue World was one of my favorite songs from this album I loved the production.
woods is the best song
They&#39;re is no consistency in a Fantano review. One artist will get lauded for switching between genres in an album and Fantano drags Mac for doing that. I have a confusion
Greatest posthumous album of all time?
<b>THE FLANNEL IS  B A C K .</b>
Who knew a day would come where I&#39;m more excited for Mac&#39;s new album then Eminem&#39;s. To be clear I like Mac&#39;s music I even think Melon was being harsh on his last few albums just never put them on the same excitement level.
This hurts. The amount of potential in one man. Lost, what hurts more is how much he expected it. This mans music convinced me to go to rehab with the album Good:AM. &quot;I hope I wake up before one morning I don&#39;t wake up&quot;, it hurts till this day and even more now. R.I.P.
I haven&#39;t listened to it yet and I don&#39;t think I can. I just liked his music too much and it makes it really hard to enjoy it now because I just feel so bad about him passing. It&#39;s not like I miss him so much it hurts, but I felt he was getting to a good place in life and I was happy for him. And next thing I knew he was gone. It&#39;s just really sad.
I guess Anthony cant see
final review from mac miller is a 8 im cry
&#39;Blue World&#39; and &#39;Hand Me Downs&#39; are easily my favorite songs on this.
I makes me want to cry that this is the last Mac album that Anthony will reviewüò¢
i guess im allowed to like mac miller now
melon : please don‚Äôt cry<br><br>sorry bro
Thought you were gona open with &#39;sadthony sadthano here&#39;   great album
I have been waiting for this all week.
I want to see other people‚Äôs opinions on this. My first Mac Miller album was Swimming. I liked it a lot and was surprised to see  Fantano didn‚Äôt  like it at all. I also listened to circles and it was good but not as good as swimming to me. But fantano gives it a yellow flannel???
Saw the yellow flannel and shed a few :( RIP Mac
This album is trash dude
How people feel about this is exactly how I felt with Swimming, weird how someone could love this but not that but I guess they have their differences
Are you gonna review the Poppy album????
i‚Äôm so glad this wasn‚Äôt like that x album. i thought it was really good and i haven‚Äôt stopped listening since it released
i get disappointed every time i see an upload by melon and it‚Äôs not an i disagree by poppy reviewü•∫ü•∫
I wonder what he would‚Äôve gave it if it was released before he died.
How does eating Mac and cheese and chugging miller lite while walking in circles for 8 minutes make you the ‚Äúinternets busiest music nerd‚Äù
Ooo yellow flannel on a dead artist againnnnnn
This album nursed my ears to health completely after listening to the last em album<br><br>The best compliment I can give it
Logic is that you?
BRO AS SOON AS I SAW THE YELLOW FLANNEL I GOT SO FUCKING HAPPY BRO
That‚Äôs what the fuck I‚Äôm talking about Melon.
does anyone know if anthony will review those new dreamville releases?
Is this a dream?
Now I believe in miracles.
What makes me sad is I feel Mac still had so much potential. Rip
slide vinyl üëÄ
First Yellow Flannel of the year/decade goes to Mac! Love u Mac. Love u Melon. This will be a good decade!
If I die will you give me an 8
This is the only melon video I‚Äôve seen where the top comments aren‚Äôt memes
you know a 8 is two circles right???üòè
‚ÄúAnthony Fantano, Rest In Peace Mac Miller, forever‚Äù<br><br>This made me bawl like a baby
rest in peace mac miller. his death effected me the most
a tnd vid where the comment section isn&#39;t just the least funny self described memelords alive spouting the same tired shit over &amp; over, nice<br><br><br>good review as always anthony (except Red Light. draaain)
top 3 in order without questions: SWIMMING,DF,CIRCLES. ALL BEING 9/10 AND ABOVE RATING. DONT GET HOW YOU DONT LIKE THOSE OTHERS.
Rest in fuckin peace &lt;/3
You made it Mac, top of the world...üò¢üò¢üò≠
thank god this bald man gave the album i enjoy an 8 so i can affirm that i enjoy it
Reading the comments I need to know what&#39;s the history with the yellow flannel?
Only showing him love because he‚Äôs dead, I love circles but no way you give this an 8 after giving Swimming a 3, dickhead
It&#39;s really weird to have songs that make you so sad stuck in your head all day.  A different piece of Good News gets stuck in my head every day.
This album made me feel feelings. I liked it.
You put ‚ÄúI Can See‚Äù in your least fav tracks?!<br><br>What kind of tomfoolery is this!?
Man, the yellow flannel, a score of 8, using Millers actual name, melon using HIS real name, all on the final album...<br><br>I&#39;m not crying you&#39;re crying
Glad he didn‚Äôt just straight trash it
U know it‚Äôs serious when melon doesn‚Äôt put a pun in his name in the beginning of the vid
Seeing him break down during the Good News track review made me want to listen to this album even more. It was an amazing finale for an amazing artist.
mastapiece
Not gonna lie, I was hoping for a 9. Absolutely beautiful send off for an incredible artist.
This album is at most a 4/10 mac doesnt have a great voice for rapping and his voice is even worse for singing. The only good part about this album is the production. Lyrics are average at best. Simple rhymes, simple topics. I cannot praise the production enough. Unfortunately its not enough to make it a good project when the other aspects of it are nothing but letdowns

If the video was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ndtSyn6dVg&amp;t=70">1:10</a> longer, it would&#39;ve been a 10
I was hoping, after a good amount of listens, that Anthony would give this album the credit it needs. I&#39;m so glad Mac got a good send off. This album was fantastic, and I&#39;m glad Anthony feels the same. R.I.P Mac. üíú
When Anthony is old and retired that shirt will be legendary.
Sucks we&#39;ll never hear the entire trilogy
anthony: ...and please don‚Äôt cry<br>me: <b>cries</b>
Only an 8 because it‚Äôs a circle on top of itself.
Ngl I expected this kind of review for swimming when it came out. Still disagree with you about the rating for that album but circles is definitely better to me. Great album.
Rest easy
YES AN 8!!!!!
ngl that &quot;rest in peace... forever&quot; at the end hit hard.
Melon.
YELLOW FLANNEL, I CLICK
This album hits so deep. I love it, rip Mac
Overrated Rapper. Ayo trend chasers, jus cause he used to bang meily dont mean  yall gotta hang from his damn sac. Sheeeeesh.
The R.I.P Mac Miller really hit me at the end for some reason, like damn
Can‚Äôt wait that poppy review!!!!!!!!<br><br><br>Definitely her best album yet!!
Happy to see Fantano satisfied
I come to this comment section to read  fake quotes you degenerates ascribe to mr fantano. But instead you are all trying to make me cry. Knock it off please
Thank you deeply for pronouncing &#39;Melbourne&#39; correctly.
First time I listened to it all the way through I was like oh fuck this is good<br>Glad to see Anthony thought so as well
Careful Melon, we still need u
I havent even gotten around to listening to godzilla because ive been listening to this album balling my eyes out all week
swimming redux?
Mac Miller and a flannel. That is, <b>Good News.</b>
That&#39;s a boring album, I mean , the guitar is good, that&#39;s it, is some words I said everything that&#39;s good in that long album . Light 6/10 for me
Watching Movies is his best album and best day ever is his best mix tape
i literally jumped when he gave it an 8
so we can scale this down to anthony&#39;s opinion being a 6? theres no way he doesn&#39;t bump up his true score.
Love
I have had this album on repeat since it released. A real piece of art.
This album is incredible, I&#39;d give it a strong 9
i can see is a grower ü•∫‚ù§Ô∏è
i‚Äôm so proud of the fact that mac called pittsburgh home<br><br><b>i love my city :)</b>
‚ÄúBlue World‚Äù is such a great song, the beat reminds me of FlyLo‚Äôs ‚ÄúMassage Situation‚Äù
I know that Mac Miller is gone Melon but........it&#39;s ok. He has left behind a wonderful legacy. (Expecting a joke, are Ya?)
I enjoyed I can see üò™
If Mac was alive you would give this a 5/10
Finally a yellow flannel, Malcolm McCormick can now rest in peace.
I actually teared at the end of this. This is the last needle drop for Mac Miller ever.
I can‚Äôt believe you gave this an 8/10 and Eminem‚Äôs album a 10/10 just because Eminem can rap faster.
Who the heck is Anthony Fantano?
I felt him peering into my soul during that intro
Heartfelt review, but you didn‚Äôt have to lower the score because you wanted the album to be called ‚ÄúMelons‚Äù
Am I the only one who&#39;s been waiting for this upload?
SCARUFFI IS BETTER THAN YOU<br>FAT ASS
Love it 8.5 for me
I think subtracting 2 points because he hasn&#39;t been on tour in nearly 2 years isn&#39;t a fair reason Melon.
MELON WOULD NOT GIVE THIS AN 8 IF MAC WAS ALIVE!
Turn that 8 sideways because Mac Miller will live forever...
Didn&#39;t fantano give faces a 6?
I think Jon Brion did a great job with nearly everything on this album. My only complaint is Woods, I thought telescope sounded a lot better.
Decent 8 is essentially a strong 9 and a 9 is basically a 10. You did it Mac you got a 10.
Now you have to re review Swimming
Also Swimming was a great album
Poppy reviewer
Yesssssss I‚Äôve been waiting for this one
Inb4 some bonehead says he wouldn&#39;t have given the album an 8 if Mac didn&#39;t pass
8/10: LETS GOOOOOOO!!!!!<br><br><br>DIDN&#39;T CARE FOR &quot;SURF&quot;: BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!
very classy approach and execution on this review. much respect to you melon.
When ever the melon gives anything an 8 you know it‚Äôs really good
I can‚Äôt articulate how much of a blessing this album is
This happens when you put love and effort into a posthumous release. Compared to some other releases that were made and rushed to make money.
Home grown Mac Miller album I would‚Äôve loved to hear the full trilogy but I‚Äôm just glad we have a pure album and not a cash grab mess. <br><br>Rest easy Mac
Could ya do a worst to best of his stuff? Pleaaaase
Being from Pittsburgh, this album meant a lot to me. I‚Äôve been listening to Mac for years. I‚Äôll never forget the day I heard my friends come into school and tell me about this dope album called Blue Slide Park from a Pittsburgh rapper. I listened and was hooked on him from then on. The day he passed was also the day I moved out of Pittsburgh when I got a big boy job elsewhere. Was tough. Im just glad his last album was a good one.
I almost cried during this review <br>Rest in peace Mac Miller <br><br>Forever
thanks anthony for the first time we agree
You already killed him Anthony, you can‚Äôt revive him with a yellow flannel. It‚Äôs done.
I find it interesting that he likes this but HATED Swimming...........
he is dick right?
I remember watching him on some youtube video where he got to craft his own beer. He seemed like just the sweetest guy
thanks anthony for the first time we agree
Man, here I was thinking you were gonna give it a 0, cause you know, 0 a Circles.
‚ÄúAnthony Fantano here‚Äù yeah, shits about to go down...
As someone who didn‚Äôt get into Mac till after he passed, I gotta say this album still hits hard. This and Swimming are easily some of my favourite albums of all time. Rip the legend ‚ù§Ô∏è
The only reason you gave it an 8 is because you thought it was an 8.
Thanks Melon
You only gave this a good review because he died. You&#39;ve done this with past artists too. Facts
Melon just because he&#39;s white doesn&#39;t mean you have to give him an 8 and above
Ah I always prefer the intro when it‚Äôs just his regular name
Turn that 8 on its side it&#39;s infinite. <br>RIP Mac Miller, Forever.
∆ê + 3 = 8
Anthony you will never have a comment section this at ease ever again, this is the apex of seriousness and no memes.
Good review, but i&#39;m disappointed there wasn&#39;t a &quot;times i cried&quot; counter
He only gave it an 8 cuz an 8 is just two circles
i was getting, and i can understand a bit of reach here, but i was getting louis armstrong vibes on this one. fucking beautiful and sonic album. fav tracks,  circles, blue skies, everybody, that&#39;s on me. this album i think really staples his immortality post-humous status.
M A C M I L L E R F O R E V E R
where is poppy...
It ain‚Äôt perfect but I don‚Äôt mind, because it‚Äôs worth it üëåüèæüëåüèæ.
Is Em the devil that Mac was saying is being shady? Feeling a strong 5/10 on this joke hbu melon
I honestly cried like a baby after Once A Day. It all hit me at once. It still seems surreal.
8!? I mean I love it bro and u know its amazing that mac gave us that treat from the heavens but swimming is a lot better BECAUSE IS WELL FINISHED. This one is mostly bad mixed chorus but well great. U should review faces
Im genuinely glad you like this. Heres to a good new year, melon. Hope its good to you
i love you anthony, thank you
Finally melon back with a good opinion and by good opinion I mean one that I agree with.
I got midterms tomorrow you fuck
The fact we will never know what mac would be doing after this record is probably the saddest thought. :(
You did it Mac, you got an 8. Rest easy buddy.
i know he&#39;s being objective reviewing this album, but i just can&#39;t bear listening to anything negative about it
Decent 8? Lol. This album was boring. The only good song on the album was &quot;Hands.&quot; Anthony is just being generous because Mac passed away. No way this project is a better sounding album than Eminem&#39;s version of &quot;Music to be Murdered by.&quot; Hell, &quot;Circles&quot; it&#39;s not even a better album than &quot;Music to be Murdered by&quot; by Alfred Hitchcock.<br><br>P.S. &quot;Watching movies with the Sound Off&quot; is still Mac&#39;s best project to date. IMO
8 On Its Side Is Infinity. Mac Miller Forever. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Melon Forever Also.
My cock got so hard when this vid dropped
YELLOW FLANNEL
BRB crying
Mac was one of the most talented artist was all time
Mac Miller inspired every song i&#39;ve made in the past year. still can&#39;t believe he&#39;s gone
I‚Äôm just here to see if Melon admits he was wrong about Swimming
Here we go....
Wow! See this is what I like about melon! I can agree and disagree with  him. And that‚Äôs the beauty of his reviews. And I know I am I the minority but I didn‚Äôt like this album. It felt incomplete, and a bit of a cash grab. I think it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs a ‚Äúsinger songwriter record‚Äù and less hip hop. But Overall I‚Äôm glad Anthony liked it.
Thank you i was going to beat your ass if you didmt give it a high rating
Mac Miller forever
I love you melon thank you thank you
I&#39;m glad that Mac revived himself in order to get an 8/10 from the melon.
Great review also just started listing to slide last week great album!
Mac Miller died for this
An 8 is a perfect score for this album because it‚Äôs two circles. Full circle.
not seeing his style progress any further past Circles is one of the hardest parts
so damn close
So happy to see the yellow flannel on this one üò¢
How often does a posthumous album receive such critical praise? Not posthumous in the sense that the artist completed the work and it was released after his death, but posthumous in that they died DURING production and it had to be finished by others
you only gave him an 8 because he died!!1!1!1!1!1!!1!1!1
Li ont lsiet to mac mirlr but imm dkr hink anyoeb derec to. Die that young üò¢
was worried we would see a stone cold fantano 2/10
Going through a few of the meme comments and for once I feel like all meme awareness for once has fallen out the window and I‚Äôm kind of impressed

thanks melon :‚Äô)
Probably the most anticipated review in my opinion I just wanted another meme template
even if he didn&#39;t know it, this album feels like Mac was saying goodbye...and it hurts.
review manic by halsey, melon
I have a feeling this record will be on melons next albums of the decade list
This. This was what I call a well-made posthumous album. Not just assembling some random songs together like X&#39;s posthumous albums just to take the money.<br>It seemed to me that Mac finally reached his best, with his unique  style. I feel like I&#39;m in a cloud when I listen to Circles. Such a great piece of music.
Thank you Melon this made my day!
You know it‚Äôs real when the top comments aren‚Äôt memes
Crying for almost 9 minutes straight doesn‚Äôt count as a review melon
Fantano, seriously...why the hell is your skin so gray??? It&#39;s a real problem and it&#39;s gross.
Look Melon, you think I‚Äôm going to be rude as fuck in your comments again even though this is a posthumous album?? Wrong, you just assume like you do
It‚Äôs currently 5am where I‚Äôm at....worth it
*sees yellow flannel<br><br>*sheds a tear ü•∫ <br><br>Ya did good kid, ya did good
&quot;This was so good, and it&#39;s very sad to know that Mac will not be progressing past this point.&quot; That broke my heart :(
Deadass means a lot mac got a yellow flannel send off
Thank you melon
This is one of the best executed posthumous albums I ever heard
Bubba - Kaytanada
Swimming and circles were actually supposed to be part of a trilogy, sad we won&#39;t be able to hear what mac had planned for his next album
Not emotionally ready to listen to this album yet. I‚Äôm glad Melon liked it, though
You sleeping on I CAN SEE
Cool now that this is out of the way I can‚Äôt wait for the poppy review
The best post death album from a musician ever, rip Mac ‚ô•Ô∏è
yum
Damn melon a 4 just becuase hes not alive to be upset it about?  Kinda cringe
Damn Mac&#39;s best album was really by his parents smh
RIP Mac Miller. You will be missed‚ù§Ô∏è.
RIP Mac we miss you bruh
I&#39;m not sure why you kept bringing up that a noose is also a circle, but I&#39;m very uncomfortable Melon.
8/10!!!
Melon because watermelon
Everyone joking that Fantano killed Mac with a review are a bunch of tasteless fucks.
As someone who doesn&#39;t have a connection to Mac at all, his music is ass. But hey that&#39;s just my opinion.
Melon I think YOU are an 8/10 ;)
Melon really trying to bring Mac back to life with the yellow flannel.
very surprised you didnt mention the song &quot;once a day&quot; in this video. i feel like thats one of the most emotional and heartfelt songs ive ever heard.
Peep drops an album : red flannel <br>Peep dies drops album: yellow flannel <br><br>Mac drops swimming: red flannel <br>Mac dies drops circles : yellow flannel <br><br>It all makes sense now ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
&lt;3
We can finally be in peace.
Once I saw the yellow flannel my heart was filled with joy.
Really sad
When he said rip mac and then the forever it made me tear up ngl
Ariana gets an 8 for her latest album, Mac gets an 8 for his last album.<br>Like pottery, it rhymes.
No bad songs
thanks
hey melon, review tha carter 4
My brother died of a drug overdose just a few days later :( and the last thing he posted about was Mac Miller
How I‚Äôd know melon was ganna give em an 8 .
redemption
I LOVE YOU FOR THIS, THANK YOU
i thought surf was the second best song on the album
Hey, you didn‚Äôt kill him twice
I feel like you should re-review swimming now that theres more context behind the album
W
Hope this album debut atop billboard 200.
every song is legendary
Circles make your yellow flannel look so square
GOAT posthumous album?
When he said September of 2018 I had to do a double take, time goes by so fast
Review Poppy&#39;s new album
this is what X could‚Äôve done, instead of ruining his legacy üòî
a W goes to Mac&#39;s family
a 10?!
This is a pleasant surprise
Now this is how to handle an artist&#39;s posthumous work. Take notes, Juice WRLD&#39;s label.
I broke down listening to this album. Too fucken good and beautiful in it&#39;s own special way.
hate to break it to ya melon, but even dead, mac still rocks that bald head better than u
It took him passing away to make melon realise his genius. Swimming should have been at least a 6/10
I...AGREE
<b>This album had me cry for the first time since the death of Stephan Karl.</b>
Albums with a white color scheme (generally) are better in quality
This was a beautiful album. It is literally a movie. Jon Brion did his thing.
not even the best album released by a white rapper that night
artist: <b>dies</b><br>fantano: <b>puts on yellow flannel</b>
LETS GET A MAC WORST TO BEST !!!!
If he was alive you‚Äôd give this a 6
I&#39;m glad you didn&#39;t killed him twice melon
I don&#39;t wanna joke, Mac was gone too soon and he will be missed, great review Anthony
I was hoping there wouldnt be a situation of <b>cries from the music</b> &quot;yeah it&#39;s a solid 3 didn&#39;t change much from swimming&quot;
He probably wanted to rip him apart as always but that would make internet mad
Dis is hip hop&#39;s answer to David Bowie&#39;s blackstar
jokes aside... this makes me happy af<br>haven&#39;t heard it yet, but i&#39;ll give it a try
11 k views 7 minutes after it was posted? geez
mac milar
Rest In Peace, Mac
Dude saying &quot;the album sucks but he white so imma give my bruda a 10&quot;  is kinda racist
This is a posthumous album done right
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ndtSyn6dVg&amp;t=414">6:54</a> you&#39;re welcome
8 ‚ôæ eternal
Macs team sent him away nicely.
First yellow flannel of the decade.
Great review Anthony! I will say,making fun of his death wasn&#39;t cool though.
Thought he was gonna give it a 10
rip Mac he was my shit back in middle school and forever will be one my favorite artists.
RIP MAC
I‚Äôm ok with it. Thanks melon
This album is such a beautiful and pretty record I love it from front to back
This doesn&#39;t make up for the Swimming review, melon.
I can&#39;t disconnect this album from his death. Every part of it feels like a farewell from Mac. I got the chance to meet both Mac Miller and Tyler the Creator at Dirty O&#39;s in Pittsburgh (if you are from Pittsburgh you&#39;ll know where that is). I didn&#39;t know him but the team I was with was freaking out. He talked to us and me for a while and even said: &quot;You&#39;re the calmest one here so I bet you&#39;re the leader.&quot;<br><br>He shook my hand and was very nice. Funnily enough, I was the captain of the team at that time. I wish I was a fan of him at that time. I wish I could meet him again. There&#39;s no point to this story, Mac was just really important to the City of Pittsburgh and a real talent. I&#39;m glad he got a good send-off. RIP Mac
YELLOW FLANNEL I WAS SO WORRIED MY GOD THANK GOD AGHHH
Cant wait to see the rest of the video.<br><br>Wait it&#39;s only been five minutes why dislikea
Last time I was this early, X&#39;s NOT GOODs weren&#39;t posthumous
My man melon.  So happy to see the yellow flannel.
RIP Mac, glad his stylistic transition could be realized in Melon‚Äôs eyes
Didm&#39;t think it was appropriated to hula hoop during the entire review just becuase it&#39;s called circles
Finally, a posthumous release that seems to have had love &amp; care behind it. With all these unbelievably cynical and disrespectful releases by deceased artists the last year, it‚Äôs legitimately heartwarming to see one done right. Much respect to those who helped make this come together.
Easy Mac... Forever
Do the new Halsey album!
Mac Miller was also of the melon species...and god damn what an amazing melon Mac was.
Anthony, giving a dead artist the yellow flannel doesn&#39;t magically &quot;unkill them&quot; as you put it in your review
Well damn, I really wanted to give this album at least a 9/10...
I can see is one of my favorites you trippin
I suppose we cant talk about how this was done unless we bring up x‚Äôs situation for some reason
I had never heard much of mac before this record, but some of his lines really hit me. It hurts to see someone with so much potential get cut off. I just hope he can see now the legacy he&#39;s left behind.
If Mac released this alive, would he have still given it a high grade? Who knows <br>I‚Äôd like to think so but I really don‚Äôt know <br>Did Mac‚Äôs death make him like the almost more? Idk
love the record, love mac.<br>magnificent album, magnificent melon
We love and miss you Mack üèäüñ§
Anthony you are on crack giving this a higher rating than Eminem album.  Em&#39;s album was a 9/10, Mac&#39;s was a 3/10.
I make original 90‚Äôs inspired songs on my channel that are just me singing and playing guitar. If anyone checked that out, I‚Äôd love the support!
Rest in peace, Mac
He had die to get an 8 lol
You are only giving it an 8/10 because it made you cry Melon but to be fair it made me cry too
This is so bittersweet, but I‚Äôm glad Mac ended his career on a high note, instead of his label spewing out half baked tracks just for money (*cough cough* xxxtentacion)
YELLOW FLANNEL FOR MAC IM SO HORNY RIGHT NOW
I‚Äôm glad to see that you enjoyed the album, man. Keep up the reviews!
I love Mac, but even I didn‚Äôt expect ya to give it a yellow flannel, what an amazing send off, good news everybody
thank u fantano
This might be the best posthumous album ever, all the love and blessings to his family!
I...agree
Day 6 of asking Anthony Fantano to do a Re-redux review of MBDTF
I was hoping Melon pulled out the yellow flannel for Mac and he pulled through
I hate to say it but his singing distracts me, it&#39;s not very good
Giving it a not good because you prefer squares is not a valid argument Melon!
&quot;That&#39;s on me&quot; is such a beautiful song. Love this album so much and as a make mac Miller fan such a great send off even though I really wanted one more release like Faces.
8 is made up of two circles, thank you melon.
John Brion is one of the people everyone should be thanking, without him we wouldnt have gotten this album most likely
You know it‚Äôs gonna be a serious review when Anthony introduces himself as ‚ÄúAnthony Fantano‚Äù
was just listening to it..never listened to his stuff but this album is nice
Mac miller (alive): 3/10<br>Mac miller (dead): 8/10<br><br>hmm melon, so you show remorse for killing the man?
Me: please be high rated please be high rated please be a high number<br><br>Fantano: gives it and 8<br><br>my entire day has been made and i am now satisfied with me life
An 8.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Wow. Holy shit.
Melon, I haven‚Äôt been this early since...<br><br>Well, actually, I‚Äôm just glad to see Mac get a yellow flannel in one of his reviews. Thanks, Fantano.
LETS GOOOOO
Melon, talking about how the album title copied Post Malone doesn‚Äôt count as a review
Best Album this Decade so far :)
‚ÄúEveryone liked this‚Äù
bruh
a artists death? with people who respect the death?? and they don‚Äôt destroy his career??? AND NOT EXPLOITED WITH AN LAST ALBUM MADE WITH HEART???? IS THIS HEAVEN????
Great way to end off his legacy. Rest in peace king üëë
That flannel is Good News
Oooh. Nice score, new glasses. What a good day
Rest In Peace mac
This could‚Äôve been like XXXtentacion‚Äôs posthumous albums, but his mom wanted to fuck it all up
Wow Fantano, I get that this album was good, but you didn‚Äôt have to tell xxxtentacion to take notes
Thank God for this album, Rip Mac Miller
Posthumous release done right
Not his best album imo, but definitely a moving one, rip mac
The album is so fucking good I didn&#39;t even have to wait for you to form my opinion for me
RIP Mac
Wow melon nice I&#39;m crying naked
Who‚Äôs that dude reviewing melon
Best anime ending
Anthony you can‚Äôt just eat Mac &amp; Cheese and call it a review
now this puts a smile on my face
[funny Anthony fantano comment]
He gave it an 8 in order to maximize the number of circles in the score
seeing the yellow flannel warmed my heart right away
First positive review of the decade
Best posthumous album I‚Äôve ever listened to. An actual work of art meant to respect the artist and fulfill what they wanted to do rather than a cash grab.
very satisfied with this rating
Am i trippin or is he wearing the yellow flannel?
I hope he revive because You Killed him with the swimming review
Me: <b>sees an 8/10</b><br>Also me: <b>cries</b>
I really can‚Äôt get behind this. Swimming was definitely superior in my opinion.
rest in fucking peace mac miller, man is and was the soundtrack to my teens, ill never forget ripping zip files of faces, macadellic, and kids off of datpiff
You know its real when the Melon opens with his actual name.
Ok but just because it&#39;s called circles doesn&#39;t mean you have to give it an 8
So glad this wasn‚Äôt a cash grab posthumous release like so many others
Lol
2 10/10&#39;s for 2 white rappers this year. This Melon is on a roll.
Thanks for giving me this opinion fantano
This might be one of the few posthumous albums that Fantano has ever given a yellow flannel to. Rest easy Mac, you‚Äôve done well.
This is melons form of an apology for the swimming review
Ayyye! Yellow flannel for Mac
YES
I‚Äôve never waiting for a review so long from you üòÇ
3/10 never forget
I&#39;ve been swimming in circles waiting for you to review, melon
(*Happy Mac Miller fan noises*)
R.I.P. Mac
Rip crack filler
This album was garbage.  Mac&#39;s worst yet.  He tried going emo and failed.  Fuckin dope fiend.
The album review equivalent of a recovering addict talking about heroin.
THANK YOU
Thank you

YELLLLLLLLOW FLANELLLLLLL <br><br>rest easy king.

good album
Last time I checked I was the man in these streets
This makes up for Swimming
A respectful and welcome positive review. Unsubscribed.
the closure we finally got to get, thanks melon
you didnt have to poop on camera melon
Melon, I don&#39;t think this was the right time to address your hatred of those in poverty. I Especially don&#39;t think you should have suggested we &quot;gun them down in the streets like dogs&quot;. Very tasteless
Ik that the album is called circles, but you can&#39;t give it a 0 just because of it.
Dead Sara - Pleasure To Meet You 8.3 BNM
It&#39;s nice to know that instead of murdering people, Anthony is now trying to raise people from the dead. Quite the redemption arc if you ask me.
if only mac were alive to see the yellow flannel, rest in peace
wowee please be nice to him
Here we go....
W
Now this is the good news we wanted to hear
Anthony is giving it a yellow flannel to try and revive Mac after killing him
AYYYY AN 8
An 8/8
masterpiece of a posthumous album
This is how to address the legacy of a rapper
YESSIR!
<b>Because Swimming and Circles are meant to connected I&#39;m going to take this as a 3+8 - so we have our first 11/10.</b>
YELLOW FLANNEL
So glad the melon enjoys this album as much as I do. ‚ù§Ô∏èüçà
Yes
RIP Mac
Never clicked on a notif so fast
:)
Yes! I‚Äôve been waiting for your input on this.
I really enjoyed I can see :(
YELLOW FLANNEL<br>YELLOW FLANNEL<br>YESSSSSS
YELLOW FLANNEL?!?
I nutted
An 8/10...as he should
I‚Äôm predicting a 9
Press f
Yes fucking sir
Ty my king
Thank you Melon, this is all I wanted
Holy shit the madman actually listened to me
yellow flannel
Good review but I think a light to decent 1 because he‚Äôs white isn‚Äôt cool. Damnit melon.
Glad you liked the album, but you didn&#39;t need to say &quot;ŸÖÿßŸÉ ŸÖŸäŸÑÿ± ŸÑŸäÿ≥ÿ™ ÿ¨ŸäÿØÿ©&quot; every 30 seconds. C&#39;mon melon.
I liked it too
RIP MAC MILLER THE LEGEND üòî
hey
WOW he actually put on the yellow flannel for Mac Miller?!?!
The madman actually did it
melon you idiot his name is mac miller not Macklemore.
Looks like he gave circles... Two circles üòé
before I watch this I better get my tissues
Last time I was this early, I wasn‚Äôt dead inside
yes
THIS IS IT CHIEF
I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t buy it. No way this gets an 8 if he&#39;s alive.
Mac‚Äôs parents handled this so well and did everything right with this unlike X‚Äôs parents
üòîüíï
Wow!
You didn‚Äôt have to call him racist, he‚Äôs dead Melon, that‚Äôs not cool
good review but you didn&#39;t have to take a shit on the album cover
Very impressive review
Has anyone ever told you, your head looks like a melon.
melon gay
We miss you Mac!!!
From a 3 to an 8<br><br>Wow this Mac guy is really growing on u eh?
How did you not like ‚ÄúI Can See‚Äù?????????. Production on that is phenomenal
The fact that That‚Äôs on Me isn‚Äôt one of your favorite songs on here is just crazy. But whatever, thanks for the positive review. I personally think this album is a 9.
73rd
Macaroni Miller

Yellow Flannel = Sigh of relief
Melon cry, so Melon rank high
rip mac
Maybe it‚Äôs time I got into Mac Miller
how many souls does your flannel need to claim before it is sated, foul melon?
bruh u better wash that flannel for the next King Krule album
incredibly pleased and happy the way this album turned out. it was done tastefully and thats what mattered the most to me R.I.P Mac...
üò≠
Great Review!
This was a good review. There‚Äôs no joke here. Good job Anthony.
Only bc he died, you literally bashed every single Mac album and this was nowhere near his best album...
