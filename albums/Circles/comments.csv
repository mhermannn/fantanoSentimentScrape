It has genuine critique and it sat very differently with people then it does now that Mac miller has passed. I will always understand that and it‚Äôs crazy how people will go so much hate to what was just an opinion. Because even despite all that melon still was more than willing to give circles an 8. Which just shows as long as artistic development continues and that produced a good record. Melon will approve. To be frank I‚Äôve always agreed with this for most artists.

@DDub04,2022-07-21T21:19:42Z,2022-07-21T21:19:42Z,2,"Circles is my album of the decade so far. We‚Äôve had great releases thus far. Gorillaz, Tyler the Creator, and Kendrick have all came with some of my most listened to albums with some of their best work. Not only that, but artists I have just started to listen to like Little Simz or Denzel Curry, or even Spellling (an album this channel introduced me to) all having great records. But this album, which came out right at the turn of the decade, has managed to deliver such a powerful statement, which is oddly strengthened by Mac Miller‚Äôs unfortunate passing. This album is fairly minimal in a lot of ways, but at the same time lush and intimate. It‚Äôs near perfect. I can only dream of what he could‚Äôve done musically after Swimming and Circles, but what a note to leave on.<br><br>Rest In Peace."
@joenovotny5441,2022-07-18T23:18:22Z,2022-07-18T23:18:22Z,0,You are so wrong about divine feminism and swimming both albums where amazing he took a leap of faith with the divine feminism and his fans liked and gained alot more fans because of it Kendrick even told Mac while making the divine feminism ‚Äúthis is what you should be doing‚Äù and it just was so different idk if you have experienced changed like that I mean mac even said an album is like a life time it start with life and ends in death he always tide that in either with words or melodies from a instrument

@arvind7522,2021-11-09T23:11:49Z,2021-11-09T23:14:32Z,0,"IMO I CAN SEE is a phenomenal track because it vividly depicts Mac&#39;s struggle to find balance in his life when it was being pulled down by addiction. I love the oscillating synths that act as a bridge between sections, and I think the rest of the production is very dreamy and cloudlike. It kind of makes me feel like I&#39;m floating through the sky with Mac and he&#39;s sharing his sagely wisdom with me."

Eventually his life comes full circle with him losing his fight, and it‚Äôs so sad because I know how hard he tried to put himself on the right track.
