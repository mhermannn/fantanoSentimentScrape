hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Mac Miller album circles this is a posthumous album from the rapper singer-songwriter and producer Malcom James McCormick aka Mac Miller in September of 2018 Mac tragically passed away of a drug overdose after having undergone one of the most unlikely transitions in rap over the past decade going from a very lovable and commercially appealing pop rap scamp to one of the more celebrated voices in the field of abstract hip hop and then transitioning even further into jazz tinged neo soul and R&B now it's no secret that Mac's past couple of Records had been my least favorite in his discography so far I much prefer the sound and style of tone of faces or good am but I don't have to enjoy a record like Divine Feminine to at least appreciate where Mac was trying to take his music and given Mac's many talents sticking strictly to rap was most likely not going to happen across his career for sure he had already shown a desire to take his sound in other places like on his Larry Love Stein stuff Mac's transition though into the loves teen stuff into Divine Feminine and even swimming in my opinion wasn't exactly smooth despite the music sounding so smooth the somewhat awkward attempts at flirtiness and sensuality on feminine the kind of washed out production on swimming plus the somewhat inconsistent flow of the record switching from subdued funk too woozy pop rap to comatose R&B but circles is actually Mac's most fully realized record in this vein it was originally meant to be a companion record to swimming swimming in circles you get it but it was left incomplete the day that Mac had passed away so then we had multi-instrumentalist and producer John Bryan connecting the dots that were left over on the record and even though John and Mac Miller are not the only producers credited on the record they do make up a bulk of the production on the album which leads to a very consistent sonic vision one that's a lot more intimate and stark than anything off of Mac's two previous records actually this record is the closest Mac has come to completely deviating from his pop - just make a singer-songwriter record and bringing someone like John Bryan so closely into the fold is pretty much a forecast of that change you were talking about someone who has produced music with Aimee Mann Fiona Apple has close ties to Elliott Smith has done a ton of soundtrack work - I sort of got the sense that would be the direction of this album when I heard the teaser cut good news the plucky and muted guitar lines on this track the chord progression the tune sounds more like in my song than anything Mac Miller has done in the past not to mention the tracks intensely sad emotions which play out beautifully in the lyrics exploring themes of abandonment loneliness dejection isolation with Mac Miller performing on the instrumental in a semi wrapped matter-of-factly vocal style that feels like he's just accepting his fate it's a track that is absolutely devastating to listen to after his passing and there are plenty of other cuts here in the tracklist in a somewhat similar vein like the opening track circles whose smooth and serene bass the faint guitars as well as the very subtle embellishments around all of that sounds like something from The Velvet Underground self-titled I like that the instrumental direction of this record generally is very bare very naked it gives Mac's understated voice a lot more power with this intense focus there's not a whole lot between you and the voice it's just right there in your face not in an aggressive way but again in an intimate way later in the tracklist we have the song everybody which on a record like this you kind of expect at one point you are going to get a somewhat sad piano ballad this song is that cut and it's fitted with a spotlit theatrical intro the style of the song from the tune to the mention of a Blues player who's blind sounds decades old it just so turns out this track is actually a cover of Arthur Lee's everybody's got to live Arthur's work I was familiar with from his time in the band love but I was actually not hip to his solo stuff pre this project and I think Mac's rendition here is pretty good considering how lush smooth and melancholic this version turned out in comparison with the original one more tune full stunner on this LP is the track hand-me-downs which is aided by an appearance from Melbourne borrow and it's a beautiful song Mack sounds like a dejected lounge singer who is just too weary to sing above a raspy whisper meanwhile the rap verse he works in on the bridge of the song is like 10 lyrical cuts above anything on Divine Feminine on this moment Mac like really channels his inner andre 3000 from the flow to the delivery to the word choice to even that little um pause that he does in the middle of a line to finish the rhyme off it's just so Andre plus the sentiment of the track generally is very heartfelt with Mack expressing a desire to pass his jeans on like hand-me-downs jeans that you're wearing jeans like you know make making a baby your genetic genes it's a very pretty moment on the record and also tough to listen to given his passing not every song on this record that is in this vein though in my opinion is amazing you do have the song surf which does have its moments but is a little one-dimensional runs a bit long the song I can see features some kind of thin drums ethereal synthesizers Mac's voice is a little buried in the mix it sounds like a lot of stuff I didn't care for it too much off swimming it just feels like vocally he's riffing away in this very pillowy mist of sound I do enjoy some of the sinister harmonies in the chord progression though as well as the surreal themes and the lyrics talking about dreaming and reality and questioning whether or not things are real or wanting to be shown something that's real something I can see and there's also the mid-paced waltz on that's on me which I think the instrumental here is kind of quaint it's cute but I'm not super crazy about the direction especially since vocally and instrumentally the whole thing is performed in such a straight and passive way all of this just makes up one side of the record though because on swimming I did enjoy the occasional funky groove or heavy dose of sub bass and that happens every once in a while on circles as well like uncomplicated who's easygoing combo of smooth bass and fat kicks and zingy synth chords sounds like something from Tyler the creators flower boy I get a similar vibe off of the track hands as well and even though I'm not crazy about how subdued the vocals are on this track I do think they reflect the weary tone of the lyrics being very worn down with life's many complications also the bridge on this track is very heavenly I kind of enjoy the squeaky falsetto vocals that Mack pulls off at this point of the song - I absolutely love the beat on the track blue world I think the stuttering vocal samples are great a little disorienting but fun they pair very well with the head bobbing kick and clap pattern meanwhile Mack wraps with this really cool charisma that he pulled off so well on records like good AM plus you have the slick blissful choruses the track transitions into so nicely good contrasts easily one of my favorites here then with the track woods you have a pretty good combination of groove and gloom with a story of what sounds like a dissipating relationship Mack from his standpoint it sounds like he doesn't want it to be over solid rapping solid singing once again I enjoy how upfront his voices in these mixes it gives his singing so much power despite the fact that he's not like this monumental vocalist no matter what your abilities are artistically a lot of the appeal of what you do is going to come down to how you present it and I think this record is a key example of that this was so good and it's very sad to know that Mack will not be progressing past this point but I'm not sure if fans could have asked for a better musical send-off I suppose even though every track on this LP didn't exactly blow me away this is easily the best album Mac Miller has done in this vein and one of his more solid projects as well from the production to the melodies to the songwriting and the performances the way they're presented and the lyrical focus as well there are a lot of things to love about this LP I'm feeling a light too decent eight on this one transition have you've given this one a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana rest in peace Mac Miller forever
