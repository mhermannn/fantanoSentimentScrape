‚ÄúShut your normie ass up‚Äù was not something I was expecting to hear on a rap album like this but here we are
nemo is sonically harsh? havnt disagreed w melon review this hard in a minute<br><br>plain 6, imo
If it was called &quot;The LP! Store&quot; you would have given it a 10
melonhead uve made me so happy
JPEGMafia is the best producer in hiphop. I&#39;ve never heard a rap song as good as What Kind of Rappin&#39; Is This.
I love how genuine this comment section is, I&#39;ve just been getting into Peggy and the love is so deserved
Obra de arte
please god review hello nasty for classics week
That Arn Anderson sample on End Credits is incredible
this gonna be a 10 in the future
Peggy might be one of the most consistent artists ever hes fucking crazy
The 1 true Internet&#39;s Artist
Why end credits! Isn‚Äôt in your fav tracks üòøüòøüòø

This was my first interaction with Peggy and was amazing. I like LP! offline more but still one of the best albums I ever heard in 2021.
please review this album <br><br>artist: zootey<br>album title: pop star<br><br>release date: a few dayz ago<br><br>all songz on this album are produced, written and perfomed by &quot;zootey&quot;<br><br><br>IT IZ A GR8 ALBUM<br><br>BUT YOU B DA JUDGE
Drake era
Money imma make you look dirty
OG! is so insane man this dudes production is out of this world
LP a ten
Whatever about how good his music is (and it‚Äôs fucking good), who else sounds like this?? It‚Äôs so unique
I came mostly to hear what he had to say about Rebound. That shit was unbelievably hard. Whole album went crazy. I loved End credits too. Don&#39;t see a prob there.
ghost pop tape and LP! are completely different and somehow are both perfect despite how far apart they were made.
Peggy just doesn&#39;t miss man, I hope he doesn&#39;t stop his hot streak üôå
shit straight up fire yo
i love reading these comments and seeing a ‚Äúthis track is my fav‚Äù for ever single track. just a testament to how good this record is
He looks like Death Grips<br>Edit: thanks for the second one <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbsD3mRmQn4&amp;t=84">1:24</a>
What should I listen to if I don‚Äôt listen to JPEG?
i fucking hated this album 3/10
Peggy&#39;s gonna get a 10 one day
alot of the the lyrics were bland and boring and the same shit he&#39;s always been saying, and that nice! beat was useless like why is it there
How is kissy face emoji getting no love ???? Song is beautiful
Jpegs whole album was skip-able and not playlist worthy.
Searched for LP the artist .
no this album it&#39;s just overrated boring nothing special about this shit
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbsD3mRmQn4&amp;t=450">7:30</a> Anthony&#39;s brain transcended his own body
i would love a full video breakdown on the beef between Armand Hammer &amp; Peggy
Lets hope his next album gets a 10
Listened to this whole album on shrooms and i was so into it i was fucking drooling lmao
Is it possible whenever you are commenting on a song, show the name of it on the screen for our references?
this album is from 2500 bro its really that good
i am saying it this is a 10/10 and will be considered a fucking classic. peggy has so much technical ability to craft the sounds in this album, its unreal. there is literally no one at his level production wise.
i am headbanging to bmt that shit grew on me
I have literally memorized the lyrics to bald!
I bet he&#39;s working with Kanye really soon.
10 days into 2022 and we already got a 9 ! This might be a great year for music !
s√• sant anthony! bra √•sikt!
there&#39;s a cool thing about the &quot;are you happy&quot; track. in the beggining you can hear a sample of &quot;transition&quot; from galaxy 2 galaxy, a detroit techno album from some ofthe members of underground resistance
Always get the offline version of Peggy&#39;s albums, it&#39;s a moral obligation
the most overrated album of 2020. its the hard truth
I‚Äôm still trying enjoy this album, it‚Äôs a bit weird, even as a huge death grips fan
so is this his classic since he rated verteran an 8??
Great vid
Great review but you misspelled 10/10
Tony saying ‚Äúhit that up OR the link‚Äù as clear as possible feels strange
I thought END CREDITS! was great, the sample from a wrestling promo at the beginning was fire
I just realized that each Peggy album cover has a mouse pointer somewhere. Get this man a Grammy!
How much does this man have to do to get a 10 from you?
ARN FUCKING ANDERSON
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbsD3mRmQn4&amp;t=222">3:42</a> are you talking about aNTOJE for some reason? that beat reminds me a lot to his style
LUV PEGGY‚ú®üíñ‚ú®
Honestly AOTY, 10/10
LP! Roadrunner, and Injury Reserver really stole my heart this year. Only album that got me good was Lord Hurons new Album.
Amazing album
I personally prefer the streaming version. Hazard duty pay + god dont like ugly are fantastic but I think the structure of the online version is superior, DamDamDam is such a highlight I think it serves it better to be sort of a bridge to the second act of the album.
He&#39;s wildly creative and I just love to listen to his music and zone out to the beats. The guy is a genius
AOTY AOTY AOTY
Tyler has been giving evil and judgmental looks to Melon for a while now.
&quot;It&#39;s so bald&quot;
Ngl i only liked 1539 N. Calvert Ave. the first time i listened through Veteran but slowly as my music taste has expanded, all of Veteran has really amazed me. For this album to come out right around the time that i really started appreciating Veteran was perfect timing. Don&#39;t think it would&#39;ve hit as hard without appreciating Veteran/Peggy&#39;s sound, this album is fire
Youthinkyouknowthony Metano
Jpegmafias discography is gonna be a blast to get through
The singing scene from Tired Nervous and Broke is ‚Äòyour favorite sad Radiohead song‚Äô godlike metaphor game
This is for sure my favorite JPEGMAFIA album so far!
it&#39;s so good
You pull up to a red light
This is my personal favourite singer songwriter album
Never listened to jpegmafias own work before, heard him first time on Denzels taboo album and he was great. Got too say that this album was very very good.
OG and DIRTY are insane
NAH BUT THE ARMAND HAMMER DISS IN GHOST OF RANKING HE KILLED BILLY WOODS WHOLE CAREER
loved the album! only sore spot is end credits.
perfect rating on this one
Peggy destroyed the production as he always doesüî•
Hello Nasty is really underrated.
End credits is a banger wtf
I fucking LOVE this album
that&#39;s what I&#39;m sayin. I love this alby out loud
END CREDITS! should indeed be longer
W
Not a bad score for MC Ride&#39;s side project.
AOTY imo
How dare you not talk about END CREDITS! It‚Äôs the best song on the album
13 days ago wtf?
9/10! Well done Janthony Pegtano!
Tell jpeg to listen to my album full circle by lil clover
Such great work from Peggy. He‚Äôs 3 for 3! I still think Cornballs stands as my fav
Aoty
9 holy shit
DAM!DAM!DAM! best track imo
LP! (Online Version) 10/10<br><br>Fav Tracks: TRUST!, DIRTY!, NEMO!, END CREDITS!, WHAT KINDA RAPPIN IS THIS?, THOT&#39;S PRAYER!, ARE U HAPPY?, REBOUND!, OG!, DAM! DAM! DAM!, TIRED, NERVOUS, AND BROKE!, üî•, NICE!, BMT!, THE GHOST OF RANKING DREAD!, CUTIE PIE!, BALD/REMIX!
Hell yes üî•
Nice how Anthony‚Äôs most famous nine is in the background for the video that has the first nine in so long. Nice touch.
Peggy built differentlyüí™üí™üî•üî•üî•
Dam dam dam!
&quot;it kinda sounds like a beat you&#39;d find on some obscure soundcloud producer&#39;s page that&#39;s packed with anime images&quot; melon out here in the deepest of depths
AOTY!!!!!!
I saw peggy live in austin 3 weeks ago and in the middle of the set he sang call me maybe a capela. yeah he&#39;s no stranger to 2000&#39;s pop references
This comment section got no love for <i>DIKEMBE!</i> üòî
Do not like this album
I get why üíØ may be your least favorite, but it&#39;s a fire remix of young dolf
Is it just me or melon lighting/filter seems different
I cant help myself when listening to Sick, Nervous, and Broke <br><br>I just cant think about how genius the man is
You would have given it a 10 if you liked it more smh
I am SO excited to see him live tomorrow. It&#39;ll be my first time seeing him live and it will be my first concert since the start of the pandemic.
I absolutely love the song ‚ÄòREBOUND!‚Äô It‚Äôs great! And I don‚Äôt know why?
Peggy goated
Perfect review fantano, perfect review.
Are we not gonna talk about the fact that end credits is literally just the newest animals as leader single??? Like the one that was released this past summer??? Like at all??? Lol
I love the way this album is so chaotic in a good way that you can basically listen to it at every mood
Bro review the Area 21 Album when it comes out
Damn Peggy!!
Seems like 2021 is a good year for both Anthony and his fans. So far, he has given 2 albums a 10, 4 albums a 9, over 32 albums an 8 and over 45 albums a 7. Over the years Antony has put me on to some good shit and believe he has done the same for a lot of you guys out there too, I think music is a way of life and helps billions get through utter fuckery, shit, sour times, hard times, dark times, whatever the fuck you wanna call it, music can help get you through all that shit. So, for all the music Anthony has given me (directly or indirectly) and all the music he&#39;ll give in years to come, I sincerely, fucking thank you.
Not as good as Bleed The Future by Archspire <br><br>3/5 it&#39;s decent
WHERES THE FINNEAS REVIEW?!?!?!?
would like to see a review of Kowloon Walled City-  Piecework üôèüèª
10/10
The full version of WHAT KIND OF RAPPING IS THIS? just makes the song even more amazing. I love the way the beat slowly evolves in the added section until the part where the online version begins
it was an ok album but largely forgettable n weak, i expected more especially considering it&#39;s jpeg. <br><br>but tbh, peggy&#39;s previous albums were all better than this, especially amhac. that one still remains his best and blows his new album...COMPLETELY OUTTA THE WATER.
Take a shot every time you hear ‚ÄúPeggy‚Äù during this review. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
TRUST! is one of my favorites in the album
Anthony I don‚Äôt think giving Mr. JPEGMAFIA a 9 simply because he too is bald is fair to other artists. Unsubscribing because of this behaviorüòï
Bro are your glasses broke?
I was eating. It was good. The light to decent 9 is what made me say mmmm
Honestly dont get the appeal to this dude. how tf can anyone just bump this in any situation.
Do porches
Hey thank you for introducing me to this artist and this amazing albume
LETS GO BRANDON
Upworthy
I find it annoying. Liked amhac better than anything else by them.
Peggy got a catalogue of communist classics
Once fantano interviews someone...he wont give them a bad review
Please review SahBabii - Do It For Demon. That‚Äôd be much appreciated Melon. Keep doing your thing dude üñ§
All this time, I though Anthony was telling me to hit that up-worthy link

Definitely a contender for album of the year, great album and nice review Melon
communists stay winning
End Credits is one of the more underrated tracks from this LP!, so fucking raw man
peggy
This is definitely his best work and deserving of the 9. No one else sounds like this. It‚Äôs incredible.
Lmaoo, the way he stresses saying &quot;HIT THAT UP OR THE LINK&quot; due to the whole reddit argument thing and laughing at the end, is so funny
jpegmafia is like the new MF DOOM
We finally greatly agree on an LP!
Day 46 of commenting until Dothony Ittano reviews Carriage House by Woodward and Parker
Does he call himself the left wing hades or did fantano come up with that cuz I don‚Äôt get it
My first time listening to jpeg with this album. <br><br>Holy shit I‚Äôm addicted now. Great stuff.
Quinton Crawford is signing to PGLANG you heard it here first. Unknown future goat check it bitches
Don&#39;t be talking shit about END CREDITS unless you wanna neetup with Arn&#39;s glock.
Dissing on End Credits? Time to get the Glock!
Downfall of the neon youth, by Paranoul
Yo review Parnanoul already!
Me waiting for an Optimist review üßç
Where&#39;s The War On Drugs album review?
Ah so we liked this album, hmmmm. I just didn‚Äôt love it as much as Cornballs, imo that album goes harder than this.
Dave dropped album of the year for sure
It‚Äôs not funny how good HAZARD DUTY PAY! is
I&#39;m calling it. Peggy is gonna release a 10 at some point.
I gotta admit that He hyped this up for me so much, I just quit watching midway thru to go give it a listen. Excellent LP!
Peggy will be like ye in 5-10 years. Dude is always just himself when it comes to his music n projects
yo man. checkout drive-by lullabies by p4rkr. issa classic
nah 10
End credits gets me pumped
ZAMN! üòç
38 spesh on the trust remix??
I know there&#39;re a lot of releases coming out lately and hip-hop is a bit more your forte, but I&#39;d appreciate a review for the new Mastodon album, as it sounds much fresher than their last LP Emperor of Sand.<br><br>There&#39;s also new Vildhjarta for the first time in 10 years, new Every Time I Die, and new Trivium, all of which could easily be considered these band&#39;s best albums. - I&#39;m not specifically a huge fan of these bands, but these albums definitely hit very hard compared to each band&#39;s previous works.<br><br><br>Plus there&#39;s new Dream Theater (better than the last few, but still has all the band&#39;s same flaws so I can see you passing on that one), and I haven&#39;t heard the new Cradle of Filth or Archspire, but they&#39;re getting a bit of buzz, too.<br><br>Plus, you could always just review the new Limp Bizkit.
HES WEARING THE SHIRT!
crazy how no one is talking about kissy, face emoji! . Definitely one of my most favorite songs in the album
Cool
You gotta review that new Limp Bizzzz
Review Screaming Forest by semetary.
MELLEN!
can&#39;t wait for anthony to shit on ed sheeran&#39;s new album
cornballs was better
Toughest decision of your life, Coldplay‚Äôs new album or this.
Peggy tha goat
Ahhh! Off to hate on every song from them &#39;cause Anthony Fantano gave them a good review.
I think this is actually on par with Veteran to be honest.  With time I might even prefer it but we&#39;ll see
Came here to say I saw him and met him he signed my black Ben Carson vinyl and for that he should get a 10/10 Anthony cmon now
Was not expecting a 9! But hell, I love JPEG and always will.
&quot;Is that MJF?&quot;
Review candy racer you hack
Nice! Now go back and give Veteran the 10 it deserves !
damn peggy...
holy shit you put this at a 9?!?!?!
please please review finneas‚Äôs new album Optimist!
The best song is DAM ! DAM ! DAM ! It‚Äôs just too short . This guy is overeating it it‚Äôs ok
Fascinating. I&#39;m a huge fan of Veteran but this release feels like his rhymes were trying to escape the beat to the point that it was an excruciating listen. In glad he&#39;s going with more strange beats again, but I&#39;d be lying if I said I&#39;m not totally grasping how people are considering this an AOTY, especially when  Celestial Blues, Dekadrone, BN9Drone, Satanic Planet, Flare Blues, Triwave Pagoda, Comfort In Misery,  Feary Tails For Strange Lullabies: The Dome, Wallflower, or Black Crows Cyborg exist<br><br>Which, yes, are completely different but I don&#39;t want to sit here and bitch without giving some FAR better options for albums to listen to.
I noticed that u put another 9/10 album in the background, IGOR, to hint at the score. Nice touch!
I actually like üíØ
this is the closest animals as leaders will get to a positive score on theneedledrop
What an upworthy album
this album was ass idc <br>peggys first L
I fucking love how much the fan base, including myself, thinking he says ‚Äúupworthy‚Äù has now made him question the existence of it and articulate it a lot more
W video W album W channel W person W hair
R u happy makes me bump to a Walmart checkout sound and OG is just so good I cant describe it
yes
END CREDITS is great u weirdo
So you‚Äôre tellin me there‚Äôs another version of this album I haven‚Äôt heard yet? SHUT UP TAKE MY MONEY $$$
i love that people don‚Äôt get peggy until you GET peggy. that shits dope. filters out surface levels mfs
zack fox stfuttm review?
Can you do a King Crimson tier list next pls
Quite good, better than Cornballs. Definitely not as good as the Injury Reserve record or Sameways though.
üíØ was one of my favorites. odd
DAMN
REBOUND! is the craziest song i&#39;ve heard in so longggggg
YESSIER PEGGY WINS AGAIN!! 9/10 BABY!
W review
What&#39;s up with that Zack Fox Album review?
This album tops Veteran, which was hard to pull off. Super slick album. His worst one yet! Peggy should quit music.
my favorite lp of the year ü§ùü§ùü§ù
9/10?? ok.. didn&#39;t expect that at all, but I&#39;m not against it
Misted a button there Mr.Fantano
dog end credits was inspiring, i literally could see that sound becoming a whole movement and genre wtf antkneee
Damn I would‚Äôve given this an 8 but holy shit
Been listening to this for several weeks before this video released?!?!??!?!?!?!?!?!?! Stop copying me
Mastodon please please please please please please please please please please please please
i am a huge jpeg fan , funny i think this is not a scratch on ‚Äòall my heroes‚Äô , suppose i like the more melodic driven but this one didn‚Äôt itch my scratch
AOTY. <br>1- AMHAC<br>2- LP! <br>3- Veteran<br>4- Ghost pop<br>5- BBC
bah oui bah oui c&#39;√©tait surrrrrr
The worst part is that this dropped entirely by surprise and still hit as hard
My personal favorite moment was the deep-fried production on BMT!
Give Bin Reaper 2 an album review pls
mediocre
This album is pretty good like his past projects but again his lyrics are pretty recycled. A lot of &quot;I&#39;m like...&quot;, insert wrestling references. Some of the songs on this album use the same lines as other songs on the same album too lol. 9 is really charitable. But the production is stellar.
Thanks for introducing me to Peggy. He&#39;s been my favourite since 2017 thanks to you Melon.  REBOUND is unreal good.
dayyyyum peggy
peggy&#39;s style is just so original, man is so cold blooded he can&#39;t miss right now
do a hail the sun review
why are there so many views on this but not the songs come on nah my niggas
DAM DAM DAM is good where its at in my opinion. I see what you mean but I also think it sounds like an ender.
anthony fantano W
Wack album
Personally nothing beats angry peggy like he was on Communist Slow Jams, but this is one his best albums thus far.
Happy man on preview 9/10
jpeg is gonna be a force to be reckoned with without a label, he is on to great things!
aoty
Me and my Costco pizza rn
happy 600 üéâ ü•≥
really had to stretch this to 10 minutes huh Anthony?
I love me some A&amp;H but gooooood damn if REBOUND! ain&#39;t one of the hardest beef tracks laid to tape since Hail Mary days.
Peggy this, Peggy that, Peggy is all that! Injury reserve and Peggy rap album of this year üöí
This album is fucking AMAZING
W
screwing with the cops, im lana
Did Peggy bitch melon?
EP2! changed me man, this was such a sweet followup, really incomplete without Hazard Duty Pay
Let‚Äôs goooo love this rating
‚ÄúOffline‚Äù version is on SoundCloud tooüëç
The album, excuse me LP is farking dope. Thank you Peggy. You think you know me
Where‚Äôs the city morgue review?

REVIEW  GEESE - PROJECTER
I don&#39;t know why you had to keep saying &quot;peg me&quot; during the whole review but ok
truly upworthy album
another bias review by anthony. Just because he gave you the time of day doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s a good musician
I literally can‚Äôt stop listening to this album
correct thanks
He put IGOR in the back cause its also a 9!!! Nice touch melon
Literally insane year for music
This was one of the only albums that I listened to this year that was objectively good. I digress<br>(edit: typo)
peggy never misses
I could never be a music reviewer, to me it sounds like a chaotic mess
the most accessible non-accessible album
baldy
baldy
AOTY imo
How many people are here to hear melon not say upworthy?
We need a lucky charms album review
Nice video Anthony, but subtracting a point simply because the artist is black isn‚Äôt cool
Reviews luke hemmings solo album
I defo heard the death grips influence. Also peggy looks so much like mc ride lol
PLEASEEEE review Yebba&#39;s Dawn!!
ok but where‚Äôs the optimist review
Good job peggy. you&#39;re a legend.
got some changing white balance on this video melon
DAAAAAAAMN &#39;NTHONY!!!
Sorry to go against the grain but I think it&#39;s not as progressive as his previous album.
Upvoted the link
The ideas in this album in my humble opinion are more interesting, diverse and fun than his other projects. The only problem for me is the complete shift in mixing aehstetic between his old project and this. In some tracks his voice is too buried and sometimes you can hear resonant frequencies in the track Dirty! Also in the first part of Tired, Nervous and broke. Some parts are a bit too raw, in Veteran it was contextualized but here it looses its meaning because some parts are heavenly mixed while other parts are not.
jpeg is a clown for dissing armandhammer on the ghost of dread
Hell yea Kimbra is underrated af in the states
You should do ‚Äòout of the blue‚Äô by sainte like 20 mins just listen to it at least great new uk hip hop album
LETS FO SOMEONE AGREES
ONE OF THE BEST
MY FAVOURTE TOO
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbsD3mRmQn4&amp;t=598">9:58</a>
I just don&#39;t understand how Peg just hits so many homers. This album is AMAZING. Every Peggy album is just top-tier.
BALD! is just so damn addictive
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbsD3mRmQn4&amp;t=598">9:58</a> thats not how you pronounce Upworthy melon man
gaddamn he gave it a 9 !!! wouuhh
Bin Reaper 2 Review please
I can‚Äôt believe when a man jerks your door open and says ‚Äúout of the car, I‚Äôm taking your car‚Äù that you say, ‚Äútake it, just don‚Äôt hurt me‚Äù.<br> <br>You know what I do? I pull out the Glock, put it to his forehead and spill his brains all over the concrete.
Wow ! A 9 ! Let‚Äôs go !!
As someone who hasn‚Äôt listened to this album, I agree with Melon.
I don&#39;t know how good of a decision it is for an artist as talented as Peggy is to transition to being a Let&#39;s Player. But his debut onto that scene seems to be well received, so heck what do I know.
JMIDMAFIA
Melon just tearing up a picture of the Pope and saying ‚Äúfight the real enemy‚Äù isn‚Äôt a proper album review
The bell is no longer upworthy. This is truly a sad day
Could we get a track review of Amin√© charmander?
i‚Äôm a peggy listener who‚Äôs heard much of his old music like the ghost~pop tape and communist slow jams and wow he‚Äôs really came full circle. he‚Äôs by far the most interesting and complex rap artist of today‚Äôs music imo.
YES fantano. light 9 is exactly what i would rate this one, and I&#39;m glad you agree
REBOUND! is absolutely the best song of the year
anything beneath a nine would have made melon look like a fool
i want to see a &quot;strong 10 to a light 11&quot;
Jpeg has not made a single bad project
Peggy never misses
This project is insane but imo AMHAC is still his best one, i just find it so pleasing to listen to
BASED
END CREDITS! is transcendent no slander please
Woo woo
peggy needs a 10 one day
What an upworthy link, Melon. Don‚Äôt regret hitting that shit at all
What a year for music
YESS YESS THATS WHAT I THINK !!! ITS A NINE ITS A TEN THANK U JPEG I LUV U BB ‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®üåàüí´‚ù§Ô∏èüíïüå∏ü¶ã‚ú®üíóüíñüê¨‚ù§Ô∏èüåôüê¨üñ§üç°üç©üåºüå∏üíïüí´üåà‚ù§Ô∏èüê¨üíñüíó‚ú®
Review Everytime I Die&#39;s Radical!
Agreed
LFGGGGGGGGGG
YEAAAAAA
Hell yeah!
i wonder how many times he re did the laugh in the beginning while recording
Boi that hurt me that was a 10
Pink pantheress
Peggy is dad
Why don&#39;t you review the Track that&#39;s number 1 on Apple music for your second channel? Would it hurt your feelings if you listen to it?
new camera? u looking crispy boy
this album is amazing because even when he flip samples and barely even has vocal performances on songs, it still sounds like a jpegmafia song.
Great! Glad to see Jpeg doin well. Review City Morgue Vol.3
SAW PEGGY LIVE IN MIAMI. HE WAS FUCKED UP LMAO GREAT SHOW
LEsssgooooo
melon screaming forest is out. I want you to listen, take time understanding the lyrics, and rate this shit 10/10
NICE!
Animals as leaders sample in the End Credits fantastic
Mick jenkins elephant in the room plz review
Gripsmafia still at it
aka DJ Half Court Violation
Turn the 9 upside down, fanta boy gave it a 6. You suck melonhead disliked and reported
Peggy goat
<b>PEGGY ‚ÄºÔ∏è</b>
L review, it&#39;s a strong 6 to a light 7, weekest release yet<br><br>edit: changed my mind, 8
Review Wale Folorin 2.
I don‚Äôt understand what anyone sees in this shit?? Boring raps and boring beats. Like where is this even playable
I‚Äôve never listened to jpegmafia only because I think his name is dumb.
Rebound is the fucking best
I did not know the Bandcamp version was this good<br>I liked the record before, but now I &#39;like&#39; like it :)
maaan fuck jpeg, this is way too good.
Eu gosto de Imagens Jpeg
AGORA EU GOSTEI
Meh, it&#39;s not that good
why‚Äôd he include Hazard Duty Pay and üíØ??
Gonna see him perform at Outside Lands tonight ü•≥
Peggy is making the best hip hop today, full stop
JPEGMafia, Little Simz, Injury Reserve, Tyler, Kanye‚Ä¶ this years been great
BMT easily one of the tracks of the year
Deserves a 10/10 just for sampling Animals as Leaders on a hip hop song.
You know the album is good when the comments actually talk about the album
LP! taught me that even when I think Peggy has peaked early, he can come out of left field and prove me COMPLETELY wrong<br>fuckin one man band
I love hello nasty.
Glad mr peggy got a 9 but where is zack fox!!!
Since when could u have emojis as track titles?
Where&#39;s the Zack Fox&#39;s album review??
Hazard duty pay is my favorite song on the not album
end credits blew my tiny mind
My review of this review:<br><br>Ive never seen fantano this happy and truthful, therefore I give it a light 10
This album was phenomenal I don&#39;t have any personal criticisms for it.
NEARLY A 10!!
Igor is happy that jpeg got a 9 üôÇ
END CREDITS! was great as fuck cause of the Animals As Leaders/ Arn Anderson sample
Of course üíØ is your least fav.
End credits not a favorite howww.
Hell yeah, but where is the new Grouper album review?
Peggy is legit
a 9!!?, goddamn peggy don&#39;t miss
Fuckin hell man idk what‚Äôs better this or CMIYGL
That&#39;s annoying I have to download the proper version hope that&#39;s on streaming services after not too long I&#39;m not going to bother otherwise. You think you&#39;d put the good version online and make the other the extra for the hardcore fan to go and download
W
Imma hit that upworthy link
Might be his best. Just so catchy
IMO best peggy drop to date. Big fan of veteran and cornballs but theres a few tracks on both of those that i sort of had to learn to love, not the case here. Zero misses. Not one instrumental that was just mid.
I want to see if kendrick came even stand in the same circle as Peggy this time around
At this point I believe if Jpegmafia released an empty album, Melon would still rate it 8 or 9
Ok Anthony but what&#39;s the name of the LP tho
Peggy is the embodiment of chaotic neutral
finally a fair grade, was tired of seeing the melon give a shitty or middle grade
Holy shit I never knew he was saying &quot;hit that up or the link&quot; I always thought it was &quot;upworthy link&quot; or some shit thank u antney very cool üòé
Hey Anthony your second button is unbuttoned
Can we talk about how insane the production was on DIKEMBE??
how the hell do you like NEMO! but not 100 EMOJI!
PEGGY
I‚Äôve been LOVING this project. I need more time to decide if I like it more than Veteran, cause I have listened to that so many times lol, just sad Hazard Duty Pay couldn‚Äôt make it on streaming
So happy you loved it antonius
amazing
Pls review Maxo Kream in a blue flannel next melon man
Damn Peggy, I thought I knew you
Hey Anthony- you forgot a button on your shirt, just a heads up
How can you like so many songs
I need to listen to more music from this year, but this is definitely one of my favorites from this year. I even convinced some people to listen to it!
I loved this album so much I bought the bought the offline version
END CREDITS! not in fav tracks?!
Why have I been hitting the upworthy link this whole time...
This was the most 10 sounding 9 ever next to igor
That song OG! Is the hardest Peggy song I‚Äôve heard in a while
LETS GOOOOOOOOOO üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
mi vieja me dio la vida JPEGMAFIA LAS GANAS DE VIVIRLA
Why does he say ‚Äúhit that upworthy link‚Äù at the end of the video?
Rap album of the year no doubt. Maybe even album of the year. Even though melon loves turning wheel and sgr I don‚Äôt think they should be aoty. Just my opinion
Now do Archspire&#39;s Bleed the Future!
I&#39;m not feeling this one to be honest. Too many songs. Most of them are too short and seem undercooked. Not many really memorable moments. Not even close to Veteran.
amhac deserves a 10
Only review I will watch be4 listening cause I know its Finna be üî•
Im new to your channel and ive been wondering if u have ever reviewed a spanish album? If u havent i recommend u muerte - by canserbero
2021 could&#39;ve been shit so far... but the music, <b>THE MUSIC</b>
10/10 DISAPPOINTED
I&#39;m really excited to see where Peggy goes next. As he said in a statement after LP! released, this is his last record under his label contract. His statement seems to allude to a possibility that the lable was oppressing his full creative vision to some extent, so if this is tame Peggy, who knows what he&#39;ll do with full creative freedom.
I only have heard two songs from jpegmafia up to now. Still haven&#39;t finished Amhac, but I like what I&#39;m hearing so far.
Waiting for the Ed Sheeran Review
lp
just saw his show in Brooklyn!!  he did not disappoint.  PEGGYYYY
Jpegmafia got a nine, now it&#39;s time for Denzel to get a nine too.
I had a feeling you love this project. When I listen to it, I get such a great feeling in my bones.
bro went the whole video without talking about üî•/ KISSY FACE EMOJI!
So how do I listen to the offline version üßçüèº
I never really liked him but this album was great
Why didnt you give it a 10
You don&#39;t know how long I was waiting for this review
I will be hitting that upworthy link
I honestly think its Peggy v IR for aoty
Wtf Fantano this deserved a Light 9.
This is probably my favorite Peggy so far, I&#39;ve liked the previous albums but it felt like something was missing and that&#39;s present all here
Peggy is cool and ik this is just mans opinion but no. 9/10 is a fan boy being a fan boy.
New FINNEAS?
Just give my man a 10 already
I laughed at the end hearing him now trying to overpronounce ‚Äúhit that up OR THE LINK to subscribe‚Äù
i see yellow flannel, i click.
Why did you laugh during the outro? All you did was say every word correctly as usual.
THIS ALBUM MADE ME SQUELCHY
Anyone else notice that Melon missed a button? Literally unwatchable 0/10 review.
Black Ben Carson&gt;
thank you for having the correct opinion fantano
Nobody could replicate peggy&#39;s music if they tried, one of the most unique artists in the world. Man&#39;s so innovative.
Melon, you can&#39;t just give him a 10 because he spat in your mouth..
Jump roping to OG is gonna make me lean as hell
Hes actually annunciating his outro now lmfao
review sematarys new mixtape
end credits! fucking destroyed me, the arn anderson sample followed by those decending guitar riffs got me hype as hell
IM SO MAD I WAS SUPPOSED TO SEE HIM NEXT WEEK IN TORONTO BUT IT GOT CANCELED.
His most consistent album front to back for me. Can‚Äôt wait to see it live
what does upworthy link mean?
For 8 minutes straight I thought this would be a 10, but still, love the review!
Bruh y&#39;all only dickriding this one cause Fantano said it&#39;s a 9...like there&#39;s no way this many people genuinely like listening to a bunch of weird sounds and songs without a structure or a replay value. Same thing as that Injury Reserve record, one of the most unlistenable things I&#39;ve ever heard in my life and people saying it&#39;s somehow the best rap album of the year. Nas, Ye, Griselda and Tyler wipe these
Veteran still the fave
This album is exactly why Peggy is my favorite
End credits is so great
i literally cannot stop bumping this album since the release, the offline version is so fucking dope. 10/10
Damn.
what does he exactly mean when he says an album is concise?
A 9??? Damn... I was really not feeling it, specially that first half but good that you enjoy it that much
The beat on what kind of rappin is this is just extra terrestrial
Solid album and has some moments but i feel Peggys masterpiece is quite not there yet.
Writing biting
üî•üî•üî•
Such a slow, careful reciting of the transition part... almost like you are trying to cover something up, Fantano. üëÇ
It got a 9 let&#39;s go, well deserved
Vildhjarta - M√•sstaden Under Vatten review when ;) &lt;3
REBOUND! is so üî•üî•üî•
I&#39;m still disappointed
Massive W for rap fans<br>Independent Music fans<br>Music NERDS everywhere<br>Bandcamp Staff, I guess<br><br>Just a massive W for everyone
LETS GOOOOOO DUDEEEE
Fantano, curling into a ball on the floor and crying ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt hurt me Peggy‚Äù and then giving the album a 9 does not count as a review
Ok, but where‚Äôs the Maxo review?
How could you miss commenting on the Animals As Leaders sample and the Britney Spears lyrics?
Not another 10/10 album from Peggy, I need to find new artists üò©üò©üò©
Thanks for the enunciation at the end there Melon, really helped stick the landing.
Finally, a correct fantano review.
I had a nightmare that mr.fantano was wearing blue shirt on a JPEGMAFIA album review
I love you but i have to disagree with this. I love peggy but this album felt very mediocre and sped through without having many replayabe tracks. It felt like it was doing something new and interesting but he did not quite finish fully diving into this sound that he is experimenting with. 6/10 for me
El-P next album gonna be called jpgmafia
Easily one of the dopest albums I‚Äôve ever heardüíØ
I totally fucking agree shit is amazing
No one‚Äôs talking about the cardigans sample on are u happy :(
PEGGY IS JJUST A DIFFERENT BREED
I‚Äôm so horny for the Trumpets on REBOUND!
A truly upworthy album
Album of the year
&quot;Hit that up or the link&quot; was hilarious this time
What Lana Del Ray fans felt on that last reverse - I feel the same with this review, or any other Peggy Review for that matter. Only in reverse.<br>The Melon keeps praising Peggy&#39;s music and I keep... not liking any of it.<br> I came in being very intrigued by a song of JPEG that sampled ODB. But the more I listened to it the more and more I realized - I have oddly strong negative feelings about his music. Just skipping through &#39;LP!&#39; makes want to gag.<br>x/10 <br>Can&#39;t rate it if you can&#39;t make it all the way through
End credits is orgasmic
Damn Peggy
I really don&#39;t get the appeal in a balding stoner but hey!
The amount you‚Äôre praising every song, if this isn‚Äôt a 10 I‚Äôm gonna go crazy
Hazardous duty pay is like an extra 70 bucks per month in the navy
You&#39;re damn right
I fucking called that this would be a 9+
I knew it was either a 7 or a 9. Favorite of his 3 you‚Äôve reviewed or slightly disappointing.
thank you white man, thank you
review city morgue vol 3
Peggy got musical aimbot the way this nigga doesn‚Äôt miss
This man deserves nothing less. This album is so goddam good!
I‚Äôd love to hear Tyler Fleetwood the Creator Mac mash
Peggy needs a vocal engineer immediately
Review new BONES and Mick Jenkins üëÄ
Oh shit it got the 9 I knew he would love it
isn&#39;t the chick featured at the end of SICK, NERVOUS AND BROKE Tkay Maidza? I&#39;m almost certain it is
Jpegmafia is a fucking pro
let me mull it over
Review yeek
This was so good that I don&#39;t think we&#39;re ready for his next, independent work
as a new peggy fan i thought y&#39;all are talking about peggy gou
Don‚Äôt hate on me, but I just don‚Äôt see what‚Äôs so good about this album, these songs do nothing to me, but I guess JPEG‚Äôs music is not for me. Veteran has some songs I like.
YEAAAAAAH
Yellow flannel is getting badly hit by inflation
Stop calling him Peggy!!!
My favorite release this year.
for a moment, i really thought melon was giving a 10
Couldn&#39;t agree more! My favorite one yet!
Fantano you can‚Äôt give it a 10 because he made a song and remix with denzel curry about you
The way Fantano made sure to annunciate ‚Äúhit that up or the link‚Äù at the end was amazing.
AOTY.
YESSIR
Nice pronunciation of &quot;Upworthy&quot; lol
It&#39;s weird to think you&#39;re standing while talking.
YESSSS
W
You don&#39;t need to call it an LP Album Review, LP Review or Album Review are both fine you don&#39;t need both :)
Love this album so much, yeah I agree, really weird, but also super easy to listen to! Next album, please review ‚Äòthe new world‚Äô by swindle, get your Brit on!
Ok, this time I will click on the upworthy link
&quot;Peggy is the Drake of our Generation&quot;....What does that even mean Fantano?
You would have given this a 10 if it was by PNGMAFIA
You think you know me
This album is mixture of bib-bob and blip-pop. Total shit.
Wow
The best artist with the worst artist name ever?
I never would have expected melon to like an experimental hip hop album
9/10...are you serious?! album is weak as fuck
peggy really doesn&#39;t miss. this album has to be my favourite yet with him going in a more alt-r&amp;b direction which is beautifully weaved with his left field experimental hip hop style. also having bops like rebound and end credits on this lp makes LP! such an intriguing listen.
This LP and GUMBO are my 2 favorites this year so far!
ZAAAAAAMN PEGGY
SHIIIIIIIIIT
Well deserved 9.
Album of the year
HE DOESNT MISS
You only like the album because jpeg is pushing the bald agenda, Anthony.
Never listened to JPEG, u just made me change my mind
A NINE!? Me and melon are more alike than I wanna admit
I knew this album was gonna suck
YOU PULL UP TO A RED LIGHT
Buttermilk Jesus do not miss
The creativity coming out of this could only come from one culture.
Mad that each project is missing such strong tracks. I absolutely LOVE the syncopated beat switch in Kissy Face Emoji! that&#39;s on the streaming version of the record but doesn&#39;t make the offline version. What an incredible record
HE DOESN‚ÄôT MISS
END CREDITS! was my favourite song üòî
Easiest 9 of the year
I don&#39;t wanna get political but wtf does upworthy mean melon
We want to hear your thoughts on BALD REMIX!
Peggy &gt; Kanye
Damn that is one upworthy link
why did you say upworthy? ü§®
Just saw (got press clearance) Peggy at his show last week. <br><br>It was awesome, he&#39;s truly a character and has such high energy. The crowd was also fantastic, a great show all around. <br><br>I was very satisfied that I got to cover it.
Yo I really thought he was saying ‚Äúhit that upworthy link‚Äù fully knowing that it didn‚Äôt make any sense. I accepted long ago that melon sees through the veil and assumed that this was just some eldritch terminology that he was imparting on us.
Wow this year has been really great for music. I have so much that i can listen to now! Just got to remember to listen most to the tens, then the nines and least to the eights.
YO... TOO MANY 9&#39;S AND 10&#39;S THIS YEAR<br>Edit: Ok wow, this is definitely peak peggy.
NOOOO WHY&#39;D YOU GIVE IT A 9 I DIDN&#39;T WANNA LISTEN TO IT AAAAAH
MELON!
Damn Peggy!
Peggy is one of the best artist today
&quot;Water don&#39;t get wet like this/ The sky can&#39;t get dark like this&quot;
He just don‚Äôt miss
I need all my bitches same color as melon
you can&#39;t just give it a 10 because you&#39;re bald, anthony
review the new Maxo Kream pls ‚ù§
Woah new death grips album? Let‚Äôs gooooo!
That&#39;s an upworthy review Anthony.
Melon. I dont expect 9.
He. Doesn&#39;t. Miss!!!
Would love another Peggy interview
9/10 got me unsubbing
you can‚Äôt just give him a light 1 because his name is not pngmafia
there it is guys!! now you can like the album cause he does!!!!
NICE! and BMT! combine so amazingly...
Let‚Äôs fucking goooooooooooooo wooooooooooooooooooop
thought i was bouta see a 10 honestly
Honestly disagree. This album feels messy. Although all songs actually feel Finished (unlike some of the songs on past albums) his flows feel a little boring and overdone at this point. It‚Äôs good but nothing better than a 7-8/10
Peggy&#39;s music manages to sound like an alien from the future has made it but at the same time also manages to sound very lovely and endearing, I honestly don&#39;t know how he does it
Hit that upworthy link
When you reviewing the new City Morgue?
Where the fuck is DAM! DAM! DAM! One of the best tracks imo
The outro speech is messing with him now after that &quot;upworthy&quot; video üòÇ
Deducting a point because he&#39;s not Peggy Hill is unacceptable Melon.
Rare W
Evil Peggy be like: why would I pray for myself, baby I&#39;m praying for your health.
Am I the only one who thinks end credits goes hard
Bro just give it the 10 ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
9/10!!!!
NICE! gets me riled up everytime I listen to it I love it . Peggy&#39;s amazing
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbsD3mRmQn4&amp;t=180">3:00</a> what‚Äôd he say?
it‚Äôs been a very good year for music. cant help but think lockdown has something to do with it
you think you know me
You didn‚Äôt even mention Kissy face emoji which I liked the best but I guess I‚Äôm too basic.
I love how he slowly and robotically said the whole &quot;hit that up or the link&quot; part because of the whole &quot;upworthy link&quot; discrepancy lmao
DAMN PEGGY
AOTY.
I loved LP but honestly i think cornballs is my favorite peggy album
My boy
9/10 I am fulfilled for life
This is an upworthy review...10/10
HIT THAT UPWORTHY LINK
I thought the EPs were a little plain, but fuckin hell this album is not plain at all. He killed it.
Thank you for the upworthy emphasis, it&#39;s clear now
And you gave my moms head game a 4?
PEGGY DONT MISS
To me Peggy is the Frank Zappa of hip-hop. Knows all the clich√©s of the genre and turns them into experimental dope
Dikembe with that sample in Portuguese lives in my heart
best project all year
Peggy was already a GOAT, my he officially cemented himself with this one. Only person that can compare with him ironical,y is Zelooperz, who he‚Äôs touring with. So go support em and see them on tour if you can.
this album was honestly amazing
Little shocked about the nine on this one
no homo, but i really want to undo this shirt top button.
9/10 LETSGOOOO
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve developed the palette for jpegmafia‚Äôs music yet. I really want to but a lot of it is just too much. I like bald remix tho. Idk
I watch your review with the sound off
FINAAALLYYYYYYY
BRUH A 9
Indeed
Melon is the master of suspense. Thought this would be Peggy&#39;s first 10.
First time listening to j peg this man‚Äôs music is straight up inspiring. Thanks for putting me on
YES
Peggy album gets a 9 LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I was really scared because the singles he released before this were so whatever and mid that I thought this album would suck. But DIRTY and WHAT KINDA RAPPIN IS THIS was really good. His lyrics felt a little more dumbed down than in Cornballs but I think he really focused on his best attributes which is curating an aesthetic with his production. There really is no one in hip hop right now that has this kinda energy, not even adjacent acts like clipping or Death Grips.
Rare W
The fucking 10 melon wtf
Melon, you mispelled 10. Super close though! Almost had it.
&quot;Two cornballs, Igor and Peggy.&quot;
A 9 DAMNNNNN, YA KNOW MELON BUMPED HIS HEAD HARD ON THIS ONE
I think I still prefer veteran, but this project comes close. Both the online and offline versions are great, and honestly it just keeps growing on me
the best songs are the online exclusive ones‚Ä¶ dikembe is my new favorite song. this shit is gas
I knew this would have been a 9
so yall saying this is in the same level of gkmc?
Ugh so close to a 10
I so wish I had hazard duty pay on spotify
Dude, I&#39;m so happy about this
Peggy is so consistently amazing, it&#39;s incredible. Every project I&#39;ve enjoyed, I really want to see him live someday üî•üî•ü•Ä
I find the moment that sticks out to me the most and one of the best moments is on END CREDITS! With that legendary Arn Anderson ‚ÄòGlock‚Äô promo, but then again I‚Äôm a wrestling mark and love all of Peggy‚Äôs wrestling references.
EVERYTHING ABOUT JPEGS I LIKE
I liked cornballs better than veteran. More accessible than veteran
9/10 DAMNNNNN
Love how he pronounced every word at the end so people can tell wtf he&#39;s saying üòÇ y&#39;all leave Anthony alone nowüòÇ
Ok but üíØ is great as an ambient sample flip dawg
How do you not like &quot;END CREDITS&quot;?! Arn Anderson spits some bars in the intro!
Clearly said upworthy link
i thought fantano would give this another 8/10 im suprised
I&#39;ve already hit that upworthy link Anthony, don&#39;t worry üôÇ
never felt this satisfied yet. production, pace, structure, all felt great, loved the samples, the quality, the mixing and mastering, the diversity, everything <br><br>just wished that the representation of the art to the public wasn‚Äôt disrupted due to sample clearance issues<br><br>otherwise, if it‚Äôs peggy‚Äôs last album for now, then just hoping for the best, he‚Äôs been giving his core fan base a lot of material that they can appreciate over the years, glad he can finally have his own sense of freedom
I‚ÄôM ARN ANDERSON
PEGGY&#39;S FIRST 9!
AYAYAYAYAYAYYAYAYAYA LETSSS GOOO
Peggy don‚Äôt miss
bro end credits is my fav
Ah yes, a 9. i can sleep in peace now
Fucking FINALLY
seeing the 9/10 for peggy has absolutely made my day
Hazard duty pay is the best Peggy song and the best song of 2021
YELLOW FLANNEL YELLOW FLANNEL COME ON PEGGY
incoming coincidentally almost everyone PRAISES this album as well. mark my wordsü•±
The fact that he&#39;s produced, mixed, and mastered all of his projects just show you how much of a beast Peggy truly is
Finally I can be sure I enjoy this record
no ones talking about that amazing verse from denzel curry on bald! üò©
How is BALD! not in the fav tracks, it‚Äôs literally abt you Melon ü§®
Antonio el Fantas
Tyler in the back looking at Melon like: &quot;wheres my 10 fantano?&quot;
Would‚Äôve got a 10 if his name was PDFMAFIA
YES ANOTHER PEGGY REVIEW !!
His Canadian shows got cancelled today and I&#39;m so distraught
Peggy done it again
Does anyone else have the experience of being put on to Jpegmafia by melon prior to Veteran, expecting Veteran to be more like 2nd Amendment, and just not getting the new stuff?
Thas a high score mang.
Damn, he didn&#39;t mention &quot;Nice!.&quot;  I love that song, it&#39;s probably my fave on the track.
Very enigmatic. However. Look what happens üî•
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
holy fuck this dude never misses
Why THE FUCK isn‚Äôt it a 10
Peggy, the second best rapper of all time!
Anything experimental automatically gets a 8-10 no matter how good it is lmao
EVERYTHING&#39;SGREAT<br>EVERYTHING&#39;SCOOL<br>EVERYTHING&#39;SPERFECT<br>EVERYTHING&#39;SGOOD<br>EVERYTHING&#39;SKOSHER
‚Äúuntitled‚Äù slaps so fucking hard. tied for my favorite track with..... well, most of the album lol. peggy killed it
Some of my favorite songs are on the offline version but I think the sequencing is much better on the streaming version
epic
Kissy face emoji is one of the best tracks of the year
This album made me re-enter Peggy&#39;s catalog, dude&#39;s just too good, fr<br>The Ghost Pop Tape is fireeeeeee
this album is absolutely incredible, can‚Äôt stop listening
YEAAAAAAA
peggy my favourite songer
thot&#39;s prayers is getting overplayed its so fucking GOOD
hey melon this is not related to Peggy at all, but where can I get Otoboke beaver&#39;s lyrics translation, I&#39;m from South Africa people be looking at me funny for  listening to these weird artistsü§£ü§£
When most people are described as a jack of all traits that mostly means that they are decent at everything, but Peggy excels in everything he does
Bro I find jpegmafia music to be unlistenable and insufferable but the only thing I hate more are the edgy people that listen to him and hype him up like Melon :) How can yall like this NOISE
I like he emphasized the ‚Äúhit that up‚Äù at the end
you think you‚Äôll blow me
PEGGY HAS NO EQUALS
I will hit that up worthy link
Saw him a few weeks ago, he sucked live. And it was the first show of his tour.
GOD DAMN
Your shirt button is unbuttoned, Anthony.
Yellow flannel = happy melon
i think REBOUND! is an instant peggy classic. the beat switches and his unrelentingly bars after bars is absolutely insane to listen to
So glad he listened to the offline true version
Peggy never miss, always on his game. Definitely deserve a listen
Who was the beef he squashed with?
dam..Damn ButTeRmIlK JeSuS he done did it again
deerhoof review when
I liked the album, but he should have dropped it in between Donda and CLB so for that reason 4/10 tran.... <br><br><br>sgender.
So glad I was able to catch the very first show of his tour supporting LP! The set list was off the charts, he even played HAZARD DUTY PAY! Full sample included of course
9/10, now I‚Äôm allowed to like this album. Thanks Fantano!
We‚Äôve been eating good lately üôè was hoping this would be a ten, but a 9 is still amazing. This is definitely the best jpeg album in my opinion
The production on this album is insanely captivating. Such a talented artist!
what? im a pretty big peggy fan but i found it kinda underwhelming tf a 9?
If he keeps going he&#39;s going to for sure become of the most highly consistent artists of our generation.
This gives me the same inspiration for rap as to what Danny Brown‚Äôs XXX album did for me. It gave me so much hope for rap, and for that we truly blessed to have him
AOTY 2
he somehow released two of the worst tracks on the album as singles and i liked those songs
Yo am I tripping or is the camera quality incredible
We get it, you liked this new LP from JPEGMAFIA. You really didn&#39;t have to make a whole video going on and on about it.
YOU PULL UP TO A RED LIGHT
DAMN MELON !!
W
Where maxo bro
One of the songs features Kimbra? That&#39;s an artist that I used to know.
Friendly suggestion, you may want to check out the new &quot;Whitechapel&quot; record, you just might have a lot to say about it...who knows?
like this review especially the part about the lathe im feeling a strong seven to a light eight Rating: 8.2/10
Finally. My opinion is now set. This is a good album
Using the same mentality as the mob you subscribe to. Your stance on Dave Chappelle just lost you a subscriber.
Grouper‚Äôs album please
That Britney speaks cover was cool
9/10? Terrible take
Is george bush the right wing hades if peggy is the left wing one
Ghost-Pop Tape classic review? Or maybe a worst to best from Devon Hendryx to Jpegmafia... Please
So happy to see everybody enjoying this album as much as I did THIS SHIT IS DIFFERENT
Time to hit that upworthy link
This album was needlessly good. It&#39;s a 10 for me.
What‚Äôs your updated opinion on the rerelease of A$AP Rockys Live.Love.A$AP?
Cool a 9/10. Donda is still the AOTY.
So I guess emojis as song titles are gonna be a thing now
Fearless prediction.  PEGGY interview coming soon. Bet on it.
The beat on Are U Happy makes me insecure as a producer
Dikembe is the most beautiful and alluring track on LP! I can&#39;t stop repeating it.
peggy no falla
now I dont regret buying 2 tickets to his concert
I literally can‚Äôt stop listening to this album. Like nothing sounds as interesting and bold as this imo.
First time listening: Ight that was cool<br>The next morning: I&#39;M LOOKING GOOD, I&#39;M LOOKING NICE!
Anthony review the new Lone album, it&#39;s very sensual
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
We all know that if they were called pngmafia you would have given it a 10
&#39;21 started slow and is going amazing. now we need the kenny drop. possibly the frank aswell.
Album deserves a 10/10 just for the Arn Anderson sample alone.
Mastodon. Hushed and Grin.<br>10/10
Album called LP with no El-P
Is Anthony not a vegan anymore? That part where he unhinged his jaw and swallowed an live hen whole was kinda weird considering his background.
Peggy dropped three 9/10s in a row imo. I think it&#39;s safe to say he&#39;s top 50 OAT at least.
I&#39;ve been waiting all year to get pegged
Review Kimbra&#39;s &quot;The Golden Echo&quot; plssss
Fantano hating on young Dolph smh
Loved this one front to back. ‚ÄúAre U Happy?‚Äù with the Gangsta Boo sample has been on repeat.
I&#39;m so glad you loved this as much as I did, it&#39;s so replayable
REBOUND! is such a banger
Love screwing with the cops I‚Äôm Lana had we wheezing
peggy&#39;s production it&#39;s untouchable at this point
I just listened to veteran this week, I had no idea he was realizing new music
I think you would have given it a 10 if it was called GIF MAFIA instead of JPEG MAFIA
I thought AMHAC flowed a lot better and just felt more like an album to me. But hoping LP will grow on me as i listen more
D A M N  P E G G Y
wow! wow!
I can tell he&#39;s gonna have one hell of a time picking the 50 best albums of 2021.
literally stared at igor the entire time
I see two 9/10s in one video!
Woah
NEMO! goes so hard for no reason, makes anything 2000% more hype in 0.31 milliseconds
A 9 really this like a 4
Listened to this album earlier today for the first time. Found it really enjoyable an-<br><br><br><br><br>ok it&#39;s just really good.
You would&#39;ve gave the album a 10 if it was called &quot;Killer Mike&quot;
amazing album
You know it&#39;s good when the comments aren&#39;t joking<br><br>Edit: just listened to the original and offline. Holy shit, this is some of the most beautiful music I&#39;ve ever heard
Why did I only notice now that mans has a Vinyl of IGOR in the background<br>Respext
AOTY!
Man, it&#39;s great to see that despite the absolute murder that Viper wrought upon him, Peggy is still making absolutely killer music
He dont miss...
That animals as leaders sample tho
I clicked the upworthy link at the end, thanks Tony
Peggy killed it, totally deserved, never miss ‚ù§Ô∏è
Peggy doesn&#39;t miss.
Peggy at his best
fucke yes
Does that means LP! Offline is a 10/10?!
Still waiting for the day that Peggy finally gets a 10
CTA COMETHAZINE THE ALBUM REVIEW NOW MELON
React to Dijon!!! Specially his albums &quot;Sci-Fi 1&quot; and &quot;How Do You Feel About Getting Married&quot;. He&#39;s so fuckin fire and underrated...
great review
W
i agreed with literally everything until you said you didn‚Äôt like end credits‚Ä¶ best track on the album imo. the energy is un matched and hearing him over that rock instrumental makes it one of the most unique moments in his career. also the offline version is mixed better so maybe you didn‚Äôt hear the offline version of that particular song? idk either way i agree with everything else but man end credits is my shit.
this video is definitely upworthy
peggy the goat
i got to see peggy last night in brooklyn and it was extreme, people had to bail out of the front half of the crowd entirely because the mosh pit got so aggressive, and there was a guy filming with a ds 10/10 show
Peggy goes 4/4
Melon once again surprising by excluding END CREDITS! from his favourite tracks... massive bruh moment
I&#39;ve been waiting for this.<br><br>Edit: I didn&#39;t realize how much I loved this album until I was disappointed with that score lmao
I WAS WAITING FOR THIS ü•µ
peggy is such a beast, the quantity (and quality) of music he put out is unmatched. not to mention this guy produces, mixes, and writes all of his songs.
Bro review Par√≠s Texas already
the praise he deserves. so well earned
when he sampled the glock anderson promo I knew the album was goated
I became a JPEGMAFIA fan since Fantano reviewed Veteran.
Mastodon album review pls
i prefer &quot;upworthy link&quot; hahaha
Anyone else think Denzel Curry either helped with or inspired some of the flows on this album? Peggy been insane with the lyricism and production, but now he making songs I can legit bop my head to the whole time
Yo I‚Äôve had this on repeat since it dropped
LETSGOOOOOO
convinced this would be a 10 if he renamed the songs and album /j
peggy gon see this and still call u a white weirdo on twitter LOL
We won
lessss gooooooooooooo
I love how he annunciated the outro after people kept messing it up
wish u had mentioned üî• (KISSY FACE EMOJI!). one of the best on the albums dude those SYNTHS bro?
Peggy stays winning. Thanks for introducing him to me a couple years ago Anthony
so true cantaloupe guy!
you only gave it a 9 because the mafia&#39;s threatening your family
hit that UP OR THE LINK
I actually just got done with the album, and I think it‚Äôs his best work and I‚Äôm really looking forward to the next album
Lowkey a ten
Even after releasing Veteran and AMHAC... He can still release his magnum opus üëèüò∂
Just because you like pngs more than jpegs better doesn&#39;t allow you to remove a point
nah this albm is mid ngl
My day went from boring to exciting after this review came out
holy fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucc
Always found it hard to get into this dude&#39;s music, is he like a solo Death Grips?
Rap album of the year!!
peggy the goat
While AMHAC was an album that I loved the more I listened to it (And became one of my favorite albums). This album was an instant slap. Peggy outdid himself, and I didn&#39;t think that was possible.
I think if he had cut 100 and end credits he wud totally have given it a 10. KSG has shown less is more if theres no critiques for melon
Do I listen to the streaming one or the bandcamp one
LETS GO
Ohhh shit <br><br>I‚Äôm drunk and haven‚Äôt heard the album yet( because I was waiting to get drunk, and I‚Äôm 20)<br><br>Wel I‚Äôm literally getting drunk rn and about to listen to the album and I got high expectations now that I‚Äôve seen this review <br><br>I‚Äôll be back after I listen to this album
Did he say upworthy link?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbsD3mRmQn4&amp;t=599">9:59</a> we all appreciate your enunciation, Antknee
Woohoo 9/10 baby, you deserve it Peggy and more!
i fuckin love this album
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbsD3mRmQn4&amp;t=598">9:58</a> thats a weird way to pronounce &quot;UPWORTHY&#39;
And thus the race of Denzel Curry/JPEGMAFIA/RTJ getting higher than an 8 comes to an end
Me hearing melon tell me that there‚Äôs a whole second version of the album I‚Äôve been listening to all week: üëÅüëÑüëÅ
Thots prayer is officially my favorite song he has ever made
But what is an upworthy link?
pnggang will never measure up to this
TRUST PEGGY! BEST PROJECT TO DATE! AOTY MATERIAL!
YES
No way he gave this a 10 üíÄ
lol he would&#39;ve given it a 10 if he liked  üíØ
You&#39;re telling me he hasn&#39;t been saying &quot;Hit that unworthy link&quot; the whole time?
Might go down as the most disappointing 9/10 in history.
Definitely Peggy‚Äôs most upworthy record to date.
babe wake up fantano dropped his jpegmafia review
YAY!!!!!!
Yup yellow flannel as he deserves üíõüíõüíõ
Peggy fans rejoice
This is an upworthy review of an upworthy album
mr tony you have to listen to devon hendryx
What kind of rapping is this is INSANE
the &quot;beef&quot; mentioned on rebound is actually beef w/ armand hammer and specifically elucid (you can look this up, it&#39;s a bit too complicated for me to sum up here), it&#39;s also elaborated on ghost of ranking dread
The Ghost of Ranking Dread is definitely the best outro he&#39;s done. that song is pure art.
So, this record is upworthy?
Daaaaaannnnnnng he said the words hard to pin down
Hazard duty pay is the best song of the year
Arn Anderson is gonna pull up with the glock for not putting END CREDITS in  fav tracks
come to brazil
Favorite album of the year right when I heard it, I knew it would be a 9 and I&#39;m hyped that it is
peggy can‚Äôt fucking miss, it‚Äôs insane. bro will go down as one of the greatest to ever do it
kinda wish he gave it a ten ngl
Loved Peggy ever since you had Baby I‚Äôm Bleeding on weekly track roundup. Bro is insane
This is prolly my fave Jpeg album. Dude only gets better with time. Also stop being racist Anthony. Taking off one point because he‚Äôs black isn‚Äôt cool.
I love end credits! Shits hard
JPEG shill lol
guys can anyone name a good jpeg song? üò¢üò•
I love that Anthony loves death grips but I hate that he rides JPEG
AOTY contender. <br><br>Disappointed. Unsubribed. Cancelled.
It‚Äôs trash but if course white hipster Mellon is all over it ü§°
Peggy and Injury Reserve both getting 9s in the same year in the span of a month is some beautiful divine justice
This album is sick I knew you‚Äôd like it
Dirty! Is one of his hardest and grimiest songs to date
Peggy is the self-made musician&#39;s musician. He writes, raps, sings, produces, mixes and masters all of his material, which is insane. Even after releasing four albums, he still continues to self-make everything which is something I absolutely admire about him. As someone that finds it difficult to find other musicians to work with, Peggy is inspirational.
This my personal favorite Peggy project tbh, well deserved yellow flannel
Peggy really don‚Äôt be missing! This is really an amazing project. Especially HAZARD DUTY PAY, DAM! SICK, NERVOUS, &amp; BROKE! Peggy stepped out of his box and made a new one. Peggy needs to be in the goat discussions from here on out.
probably my fav of this year, also SEXIII 9 :) LOVE U PEEGGY
I‚Äôm so glad you remind us about the upworthy link melon, I hit it everytime :)

im scared of peggy man. he just doesnt miss
loved the spacing on &quot;hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel&quot;
i never thought another album would compete with injury reserve‚Äôs for my AOTY, but here we are. 2021 has been quite the year for music.
It really is crazy how Peggy just keeps expanding on his sound
definitely felt like this is the perfect middle finger peggy sends off as he distances himself from the industry. Too many hits that these dumbass record execs don&#39;t wanna hear. nasty!
peggy has not missed once since 2017
DIDNT PUT BALD! IN FAV TRACKS WTF MELON
Nice! I can finally like the album now
Experimental Hip Hop &gt;&gt;&gt;
W score W review W reviewer W video üòπüòπüôèüèª
yes
Love the album more than I love my father.
You‚Äôre only mid on End Credits ! cuz Peggy put a scene on your life, Melon
You didn&#39;t have to give him a 0/10 because he PEGged you
Woooh, Lathe reference!
Will you review the new Sematary Mixtape?
üíØ is probably my favorite track. The beat with the cold synths are just too good in my opinion. End Credits tho is my favorite in terms of bars and raw energy tho. Overall definitely a phat 9
YOU PULL UP TO A RED LIGHT
<b>Sees the yellow flannel</b> Damn right
REVIEW!
Still waiting for Hazard Duty Pay! and Dikembe! to be on Spotify so that I can play them on repeat
For this album it really does feel like he has perfected his craft
Just cuz it‚Äôs Peggy doesn‚Äôt make it a 9 lmao
REBOUND is insane
One of the best Albums of the year easily
we stay winning
No love for End Credits!????
THOT&#39;S PRAYER does things to my body I didn&#39;t think were possible.<br><br>This LP definitely harkens back to Peggy&#39;s pre Veteran work in anlot of ways especially with experimentation which I was always a fan of. That stuff is still some of the rawest shit I&#39;ve ever heard (2nd Amendment, Communist Slow Jams, and Black Ben Carson).
peggy just don&#39;t miss
Can‚Äôt just give Peggy a 9/10 because of his appearance on AEW.
Fantano still acting like music is real I see. Cope harder bro üôÑ
As someone who hadn&#39;t really listened to JPEGMAFIA, this album is excellent.
This is correct, having not even watched yet
Jpegmafia makes music for people who snipe fits on Grailed
I‚Äôm so glad I got to see Peggy live last week, he‚Äôs a great performer. Seeing him do HAZARD DUTY PAY! was legendary
Where&#39;stbe Macklemore single review
Peggy the Goat
Why weren&#39;t you there last night?
NEMO is goated
Damn peggyyyyyyy
DAM! DAM! DAM! is one of his best songs ever in terms of construction and Peggy-ness, surprised it wasn‚Äôt on your favorite tracks list but what a masterpiece from Buttermilk Jesus!
DAMN PEGGY
You would have given this album a 10 if every track was BALD!
No lie it was a 10 for me but I can‚Äôt get mad for your choice of a 9. Loved this album front and back. I wish the album didn‚Äôt have two versions.
This is one the only albums that I genuinely got happy for a positive review of
Didn‚Äôt think you‚Äôd give MC Ride‚Äôs solo project a 9.
LETS GOOOO PEGGY UNDEFEATED
Happy birthday
WELL DESERVED 9
It&#39;s actually insane how much of a beast Peggy is. Nothing even compares.
Rambling about pegging for 10 minutes doesn‚Äôt constitute a review, melon.
JPEGMAFIA is like Death Grips Lite
Stunning album. peggy recent run has been nothing short of sensational
All my heroes are LP!
I would also love to see a review on Asap Rocky‚Äôs 10 year anniversary of Love Live Asap! I‚Äôm wondering if you hear any differences in the mixing and mastering of the album.
Seeing LP live is so freaking incredible, peggy is the best performer!!
Loved Cornballs but this one has yet to grow on me.
yessss, truly my favorite peggy album to date. maintains experimental nature of his music while being consistently more accessible than his previous stuff. absolutely fantastic
Bmt masterpiece
This LP! is soooo amazing. Man, this guy is Veteran.
Cool
i&#39;m expecting a jpegmafia interview will happen soon
DAM! DAM! DAM!
Happy slightly belated birthday Anthony!
Fantano only gave it a 9/10 because hes scared Peggy will beat the shit out of him
Along with By The Time I Get To Pheonix this is album of the year
Can&#39;t believe you don&#39;t have BALD! and BALD! REMIX on your fav tracks. Those were easily some of my favorite tracks of 2020.
the OFFLINE version is superior imo, great review so far ü§ù
love peggy üî•üî• very well deserved 9
Damn Melon! The third 10 of the year.
WE BROKE GODS LAW.   2000 YEARS AGO, GOD PROVIDED A SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST  WHO SUFFERED AND TOOK OUR PUNISHMENT ON THE CROSS. THE BIBLE SAYS IF WE DECLARE WITH OUT MOUTH JESUS IS LORD AND BELIEVE IN OUR HEART GOD RAISED HIM FROM THE DEAD YOU SHALL BE SAVED. Romans 10-9.  GOD WILL FORGIVE YOUR SINS AND GRANT YOU  EVERLASTING LIFE ALL BECAUSE OF WHAT JESUS DID ON THE CROSS
eh more of a PNGYAKUZA fan myself
Anthony you can‚Äôt just give this album a 9/10 because you respect veterans
9!!!!!
YOU ARE<br>THE HIP-HOP <br>GANGSTA
Amazing record, loved it
Hell yea bald brother
I&#39;m glad you finally reviewed it, I can finally give it a score out of 10
HAZARD DUTY PAY! is one of the best songs of the year
You can&#39;t be sexist just because &quot;Peggy&quot; sounds &quot;like a girl&#39;s name&quot;, Melonio, get your shit together
Fetty waps back
So its basically Exmilitary 2??
Buttermilk Jesus
This is more than likely my personal fave Peggy album thus far. It‚Äôs the most cohesive and best showcase of all of his skills thus farüî•üî•üî•AMHAC is a classic imo but this is just as great and amazing
A 9!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You didn‚Äôt have to say ‚ÄúLP‚Äù and ‚ÄúAlbum‚Äù just to prove your musical vocabulary, melon
10/10 review it again 10/10 review it again
I dont get the hype on this one I just kinda listened to this unphased and I skipped one.
I like this album
W
I like your vids but why do you have to screech slurs backwards all of the time??
The veteran&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
üëçüëç
this is honestly such a great year for music, jpeg dropped probably his best project yet
hypeee
Melon, you cannot remove a star because you prefer PNG
Imagine Giving mbdtf 6 and this boring album 9
didn&#39;t have to use all those slurs just because Peggy &quot;gave you the pass&quot;, melon
Let&#39;s go fucking champion this album melon
Aw yisssss
Screaming LP! for ten minutes straight doesn‚Äôt count as a review Anthony
I REALLY wish I listened to the offline version for my first listen
daaaaamn antnee
melon, we get that it‚Äôs not death grips. that doesn‚Äôt mean you can call him the N word and give it a 0.
tired nervous &amp; broke is amazing
When he doesn‚Äôt do DAM DAM DAM in his favorites üò¢
Do a Ghost Pop Tape classic review
Hey Anthony what are your thoughts on the new Lightyear trailer?
all I needed to know melon
SO FUKIN CLOSEüò≠
WE GOT ANOTHER 9 LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!!!
LETS GOOO

when are you going to classic review geogaddi by boards of canada
100 is equivalent if not better than JPEGMAFIA TYPE BEAT but ok
He dropped the AOTY and the second AOTY on the same day, wow
Melon you cant take one point away just because Peggy rocks the bald look better than you
2021 has been an amazing year for music üî•
Dirty is one of the best songs he‚Äôs made. The beat and production is insane! Also, the horns that kick in on The Ghost of Ranking Dread is one of the best things I‚Äôve heard this year so far.
YES! THANK YOU! FUCK!
Real Fantano fans check to see if the album is a 10 and then dip when its not
