i love this album the best way i can describe it is a squeegee just dragging it up and down on a car window just dry it&#39;s that sound that would make lmfao
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG_0Exs9jTQ&amp;t=79">1:19</a> GALAXIE 500 MENTIONED!!!!!!!
I still don&#39;t get the hype for this album. I can hardly tell one song from the next because it&#39;s so sonically one-note. <br><br>I hear it everywhere in music afterwards and definitely hear the influence it had because of that, but it&#39;s just not a great listen as an album. <br><br>I feel like this album deserves its own place in a list of &quot;Great 90&#39;s Albums That Were Influential But Kind of Bad in a Vacuum.&quot;
I‚Äôll say it: you NEED to be in love with this staggering work of genius.
Lmao the drummer &quot;column&quot;
haha! seminal!!
Soon is the best track ever!
I mean it&#39;s a near masterpiece but Oasis - Definitely Maybe is better
Fine ill listen again
Are you a Millenial
Hate it cuz it just sounds like something stoners would listen to and has almost no melodies
I only said üî•üî•üî•üî•
You know, it took me 3 full listens to like this album and think it&#39;s good, still not my fav Shoegaze album (i much prefer Eureka, Hades and To See The Next Part of The Dream to it), but it&#39;d fit neatly in the 5th spot on my &quot;top 5 fav Shoegaze albums&quot; list
10 out of 10 album. A true masterpiece of the genre
This is one of the most polarizing albums ever, I fucking hate this album, there&#39;s not a song on it that I would want to listen to again, it&#39;s irritating and grating. But A LOT of people like this album
haiiii
They named themselves after a movie that none of them had ever seen, only because it sounded overtly sexual, but tense and extreme, like they wanted their wanted to be.
Hell, they double bill toured with Dinosaur Jr. for this album.
lmao
It is great to sleep to
Great review. Loveless is a masterpiece!
Cornerstone of rock. A true classic
I have that same &quot;Raw Power&quot; CD in my collection with the very same &quot;Best Value&quot; sticker on it üòÅüòÅ<br>Oh man, I can&#39;t tell you how much Raw Power and Fun House were on rotation in my headphones when I was in the 10th grade, which is funny considering I graduated in 2011
You go through stages like grief with this album. At first everything is intriguing and you can‚Äôt get a grip on it and you say I need to listen to this more. Then you listen and like it more but say why are the vocals so low and why did they do that. Then you either accept it as it is as perfect or discard it and you may have discarded it in any of the previous stages.
I love loveless and hate fantano
i love bilinda butcher
Don‚Äôt need ketamine or mdma. This album itself is drug.
I was rly hoping to see a bunch of gamer people comment about apples and gifts this December in this comment section
The best album ever made is Youth of Today‚Äôs Break Down the Walls. It‚Äôs like it shoegaze itself had shoes and gazed at them.
watching this is 2022 feels like melon is wearing one of those instagram face filters that makes you look like a baby
The weird thing about MBV is that when you see them live they really do rock, the rhythm section is really driving and much more up front than on the record.

This album redefined music. You are an idiot.
My experience with my bloody valentine is similar to how people describe captain beefheart. The first time I heard ‚Äúonly shallow‚Äù, it was kind of weird and I didn‚Äôt know what to make of it‚Ä¶then I found myself wanting to hear the ‚Äúweeeeee, weeeeeeee‚Äù song with relaxing vocals again‚Ä¶then I checked out loveless and by the second or third spin, it was one of my favorite alt rock records. Returning to the opening analogy, the big difference is that captain beefheart never really <b>moved</b> me in the way that mbv ultimately did.
It is truly a mark of genius when a band can put together an album that still surprises you after countless listens. It&#39;s addictive ! ‚ô•
Perfect shoegaze record
_           mbv<br>            /       \<br>smashing    boards of<br>pumpkins     canada
to me this is the most underrated album of alltime and in my opinion its up there with dark side of the moon and ok computer but tbh better than both
Sometimes is my fav song ever
put the glasses back on
I love this album more than i love myself
Bruh I wish needledrop was this in depth nowadays
strong 3 to a light 4
Are you okay, man?
I had to keep telling myself he‚Äôs not being sarcastically ironic or ironically sarcastic.<br>Shoegaze is to music what abstract expressionism was to painting.<br>It‚Äôs the conceptualization of actions becoming feelings.<br>MBV is the Jackson Pollack of the genre.
U just saying go it‚Äôs a classic cuz u hear it‚Äôs a classic , u have no ear no taste ‚Ä¶
What planet are you from? You don&#39;t look quite human.
@theneedledrop Only after I fell in love with this album I was able to finally unlock my understanding of Your perspective on You Won&#39;t Get What You Want by Daughters.
antonio fantano ft. wood chipper
Top 10 album of all time. Not even in my top 10 but still a top 10 album of all time
the album feels like taking acid in hot tub full of molly
It&#39;s more the actual sound of Comfortably Numb, though the noise is so sheer that it&#39;s slightly pinching the dream state numbness. The performances feels so empty and apathetic that it&#39;s depressing to a horrific degree, yet there is still that magenta coloured major harmony that is touching bliss. I can&#39;t get my mind off it, really, and I think I like that.
rare melons
although the wall art behind you is a green screen, I&#39;m going to print the loveless cover art on a real painting

Airnthony Fairntairno.
guyys how does antony know about mbv
Quite simply one of the best albums ever
I admire much about the album, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s much fun.
loveless is the only album to master controlled chaos. the level of skill it took to manipulate sounds just blows my mind every single listen. i hate that at some point i will become tired of it. why can&#39;t good things lastüíîüíî
wth is 9mm?
I always preferred early RIDE. But do love this record
Close my eye feel me now I don‚Äôt know how you could not love me now
greatest album of all time
Any thoughts on Ride&#39;s Going Blank Again??
i first heard this album a few months ago, and for some reason i was expecting Bullet For My Valentine, which was not what i got. i absolutely despised this record, mainly from that expectation. im trying this one again, and its actually quite nice
If u go into this blind u surely will be shocked but in a extemely great  way
Bro this is like kid a, the album cover completely encapsulates the feel of the music
celebrated noise
It‚Äôs a heavy 11 light 12. Nobody had or has done it like MBV on Loveless. It‚Äôs perfect.
NANTHONY BANTANO HERE!!!!!!!!
This is the album we must turn to when it‚Äôs time to communicate with aliens. Otherworldly beautiful soundscapes. 11/10.
When I first listened to this album, I was underwhelmed. On my second listen, it ‚Äúclicked.‚Äù I immediately went to Best Buy and bought it on CD.
30 years old!
admit it anthony. wlr is growing on you
Wooo go ireland!!
my bloody valentine* üôÑ‚úã
For sure a album you would listen to when you are alone. Cant share this with anybody
Favorite album of all time
I can barely hear what is being said on the album
damn why he leave off his thoughts on &quot;come in alone&quot; :(
I just feel grateful for Sofia Coppola to introduce Shoegaze to me in Lost in Translation. &quot;Loveless&quot; is noisy and vulnerable and a perfect album to listen alone in a room with headphones on at 3 am in the morning.
and it all started here...
This album transcends time. It&#39;s my favourite album for a reason
I don&#39;t wanna watch the video did he like it?
Wow u used to have hair
That thumbnail is too sensual
&#39;What You Want&#39; is extremely underrated imo; it&#39;s probably the happiest song on the album and just personally reminds me of those euphoric summer days in New Zealand as a kid. It might be one of my favourite songs of all time.
You don&#39;t find this album, this album finds you
People who dislike this album, what are you listening to? I don&#39;t get how can you like music and dislike this album?
YouTube LOVES this guy. No matter how many times I tell YouTube I have absolutely no interest in watching some random turdburglar review old music, they still insist on recommending this clown and his dumb videos. Go away dude!
bro this album just ain&#39;t it..
I&#39;ve listened to the album about 10+ times now just trying to &quot;get it&quot; but it never clicked with me i&#39;ve always think most of the mixes in this album feel just off with the vocals in songs like only shallow having an awkward placement and generally just feel off also the riffs on that song is particular is just a bit too long and repetitive for my liking although there are some really good songs where the idea and execution of being a shoegaze album is done flawlessly here but most of the time the album just feels kind of annoying and boring in terms of the instrumentations or how the vocals just doesnt really add much substance or even just straight up comes off annoying. For me its like a 6/10.<br>Fav tracks: when you sleep, come in alone, blown a wish<br>Least fav tracks: only shallow, soon
to recapitulate it&#39;s vacuum music but good regardless :DD
Only shallow is the only song that i could get yet
i hate to admit that I don&#39;t get the love for that album
no
If you want to break in your new headphones, listen to this album on repeat.
This record balances the line between the worst thing you&#39;ve ever heard and the best sound ever recorded.

Can‚Äôt believe you didn‚Äôt mention ‚ÄúBlown A Wish‚Äù. Belinda‚Äôs vocal melody is absolutely heavenly
In no way is Loveless a seminal album in the genre‚Ä¶ Their album isn&#39;t anything would have that mantle. Loveless is a pinnacle of the genre but other bands such as ride chapterhouse and slowdive all had albums out before Loveless was released.
This album always makes me fall asleep.
üëçüá©üá™vielen Dank
Melon looking dapper in this video
No.
You just wake up Antknee?
2021 gang
Wth how is this a classic. There are way better shoegazs albums that deserve a classic review, for example velocity. I dont understand why people like loveless, it&#39;s really boring.
Slowdive is better
Am I the only one who can hear the Minecraft soundtrack in the video?
Just listened to the album fucking amazing a masterpiece
<b>BACK ON SPOTIFY AT LAST</b>
Having finally listened to this record, it&#39;s a weird one. I liked most the record&#39;s ideas, and was kind of wowed by how intricate a lot of the music was, but it wasn&#39;t very pleasant to listen through. It was more thought-provoking than it was enjoyable, like Earl Sweatshirt&#39;s newer stuff or Pink Floyd. I was fascinated by it from a musical perspective, and it&#39;s something that I think is 100% worth listening to because of its influence, but it wasn&#39;t something I&#39;ll listen to again for quite some time, if at all.
The first song reminds me of &quot;The Ocean&quot; by  the Velvet Underground
Late to the party. Listened to it for the first time today. Fucking amazing. I knew I was sleeping on it, and today I found out what I was missing.<br>That was a whole immersive, washed-out vibe of cool
I saw MBV around the time this album was released,the loudest gig I have ever attended...it took my ears 3 days to recover...and someone who works at the venue told me later that they had spent four hours doing a soundcheck.Really? Surely they just turned everything up to a Spinal Tap Number 11.Awesome stufff...I also recommend Isn&#39;t Everything and the compilation of their E.P.&#39;s.
This lp is so annoying to me because I can&#39;t get it anywhere. And on ebay, what&#39;s realt and what&#39;s fake is very hard to tell.

I love this album! When you sleep is the best song in my opinion
Stick to rap son. Its more your speed. Ur definitely out of ur element here.
My Bloody Valentine: Loveless<br>Fantano: Glassless
The print on the Melon&#39;s T-Shirt is the opposite of what his reviews are now
Very good.  Very good.
If you shot something on a 9mm it would probably be your last video
Amazing interpretation, thank you.
Anthony was off the Molly
There&#39;s a bit of a difference between shooting 9mm and 8mm.
WEEEEEEOOOOOOOO WEEEEEOOOO EEEEOOOO WEEEEEEEEEEEEE OOOOOOOOOOO
There is no such thing as &quot;shoegaze&quot;. It&#39;s not a real genre, just an eclectic bunch of various influences. There is also no such thing as &quot;noise pop&quot;. It&#39;s just noise rock that happens to be melodic. Another fictional genres are &quot;indie&quot; and &quot;alternative rock&quot;. Indie is not a musical style and alternative is a category so broad that it&#39;s basically meaningless. Musical journos who invent these terms are just lazy idiots.
10/10

Why he look like he bout to sneeze in the thumbnail
DUTT DUTT DUTT DUTT VREEEEOW VREEEEOW
If you listen closely enough on this album, you can hear the 80s turning into the 90s
it&#39;s the fucking best.
BEST REVIEW  EVER !!!üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü
seeing him without glasses actually activated my fight or flight response and i&#39;m not kidding
DUT DUT DUT DUT<br>VREEEEEEEEEW<br>VROOOOOOOW
i cant believe i only just found this album. I feel like a heart eye emoji
My Beautiful Bloody Dark Twisted Valentine- Love Westless
It&#39;s seriously one of my favorite albums of all time. This thing is it&#39;s own world, a drug and it can take you places on headphones in the dark.
When I first became aware of this album, it reminded me of Cocteau Twins. But funny enough, because of the &quot;dreaminess/ heavenly&quot; sound of this album there was a point were I was using this album as my go to to fall asleep to
Hello internet is it &quot;close my eyes, FEEL me now,&quot; or &quot;close my eyes, HEAR me now&quot;?
Melon&#39;s face looked like he had just listened to this album
Serious Happiness
I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve listened to Loveless dozens of times and never realized Loomer has no drums
Then you‚Äôre doing it wrong üò†
best opener ever. DA DA DA DA VREEEE VROOOO
Wow you&#39;ve never reviewed isn&#39;t anything booooooooooo!
You forget they started as a jangly indie band after being dreadful goth (I like goth it&#39;s just they was dreadful)...strawberry wine was my beginning
and you make me realise ep is even better
Isn&#39;t anything is better much much much better
You missed the one time opportunity to start with: &quot;Shoethony Gazetano&quot;. My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.
This album is a rare 11/10
10/10.
Fuck chord progression, all my homies use reverb üò§
Ceres and Calypso is clearly the superior Dream Pop/Shoegaze album
You know this album is truly good when people in the comments are fucking talking about it, incredible
i absolutely love this album
When You Sleep was a sonic baptism for me... I never saw or heard music the same again after heat that for the first time. I still remember the moment my friend Troy played that for me in his apartment in 98.
I remember &#39;Sometimes&#39; became one of my favourite songs after I watched Lost In Translation, very thankful for watching that movie as a young boy and finding out about this band
Anthony Fantano looks less like Anthony Fantano here. He looks like Post Malone&#39;&#39;s second cousin twice removed.
Anyone else here due to the influence this album had on Final Fantasy 7? Great album and review.
CURSED THUMBNAIL, CURSED LIGHTING, CURSED VIDEO
Since this album is no longer on Spotify, I cannot say that this is a seminal album.
Loveless should be a doctor prescribed anti depressant
pls don&#39;t link Amazon, jeff bezos is evil
anthony why are you reviewing the new supreme merchline ¬ø
hypebeasts and skaters are now gonna be bumping this shit :D can finally play them with my friends maybe
Whoo damnn Sometimes is my favorite too yaya
Alcest is the only non boring shoegaze band ever
its like the kid a of rock,. Can¬¥t belibe its 1991.
why does melon look so strange in this video?
Ahh, I love movies shot on 9mm, especially if they feature an 8mm handgun in them.
I do love it, it&#39;s definitely different and it does talk a few listens I will admit
feeling like a sexdriven teenager on drugs/10 = loveless
Try Bowery Electric‚Äôs self-titled debut album.
Only Shallow sounds like a rhino stampede
Eargasm
The lacking of melon memes in place of discussion is refreshing.
I remember buying Loveless on Valentine&#39;s day in 1991 after hearing Only shallow on 120 Minutes.  There were bands with similar sounds doing similar sounds with guitar like Lush and Curve.  Still there are so many differences mainly with how bands like Lush layered the guitar on their recordings.  Shields has said in interviews he didn&#39;t layer and doesn&#39;t use much guitar effects.  I seem to recall he said he gets a lot of the sound with heavy volume and reverb.  The album from one perspective is a mess but it&#39;s beautiful mess.  The production was never my favorite part but it&#39;s such a seminal record and I hear different sounds 29 years after I bought it.  I rank this and Pale Saints - In Ribbons as the best shoegaze records.  You hit the points on the sonic qualities.   Hopefully we get a few more releases by Shields.
i just discovered this album and blew away by it.its so bizarre.its almost relaxing at times.
The images in my mind that I get from this album are friggin weird. This is the best way I can describe it.<br><br>You‚Äôre driving on an empty road with a love interest of yours in New Jersey. However, you‚Äôre nowhere near NYC. It‚Äôs more or less a lot of grass, little trees, and a lot of electrical poles. Everyone once in a while you‚Äôll come across one of those giant electrical wire tower thingies that go perpendicular to the road that seem to stretch for miles. The sky is mixed with purple and blue.<br>Sounds normal right? This is where it gets weird.<br>You then see a rare intersection. But strangely enough you see an IKEA at the other side of the intersection. However this is no average IKEA. It‚Äôs only 1 floor, but it‚Äôs still huge looking. It stretches for a solid half mile. Also there‚Äôs no signs. There isn‚Äôt even a parking lot. It‚Äôs just a really long blue building with a yellow stripe and seemingly now doors or windows in a patch of grass. But rest assured what you see is definitely an IKEA. The IKEA is so surreal looking that you eventually start crying tears of joy (I need counseling). Then your love interest wraps their arms around you. Suddenly you lose focus and everything looks blurry. Then for you find yourself in the IKEA by yourself. It‚Äôs still definitely an IKEA but it‚Äôs more of an abandoned mall. The year is 2006 by the way. It has the aesthetic of the play area in an IKEA but also the aesthetic  of the Heathcliffe theme song ( What‚Äôs wrong with me) mixed with the aesthetic of a McDonalds from the 80s. It‚Äôs pitch black in there, but you can still see everything (somehow), with the air conditioning making a loud but soothing white noise. After 20 and a half seconds of being in there, you go blurry again and you find yourself with that same love interest in the patch of grass in front of the IKEA watching the stars begin to appear in the purple and black sky. <br><br>I shid you not, this is what I actually think this album feels like and it‚Äôs so weird.
The presence of the woodchipper is perfect, and could only have been made more perfect with the addition of a vacuum cleaner
Loveless is my favourite album of all time along with Pet Sounds from the Beach Boys.
The early EPs were their best output.
it&#39;s the best album of all time
Lo-fi recordings? Do Crackanus knows the label got broke after producing it?
Yoom opinion not valid.
What number did he give it?
There&#39;s a reason it took two years to complete.
What you want is the best track on the album your fucking stupid if you think otherwise
My Bloody Valentine- Loveless BEST ALBUM EVER REVIEW
C L O S E  M Y  E Y E S
Is that a wood chipper? Nah bro it&#39;s shoe gaze.
No other album has had more of impact on me on my first listen.
Loveless is easily one of the best albums of all time IMO. I can&#39;t think of too many albums this good. It&#39;s like a perfectly written book. Front back to front. Every song leads so well into the next. And more than anything makes me feel....so many things. Some good some bad.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG_0Exs9jTQ&amp;t=110">1:50</a> no that‚Äôs not a wood chipper. His neighbor just turned on some Sunn O)))
Plo is the
My #2 favorite album, I literally cannot listen to it anymore because I get so emotional. It&#39;s so fucking amazing. <br><br>My #1 is american football. same applies.
Sleep<br>Like a MELON<br>Down(ward)<br>And<br>(Where)<br>She won&#39;t care<br>Anyway (where)
‚ÄúOnly Shallow‚Äù has a guitar riff? I thought that was the sound of them throwing two detuned electric guitars down a flight of stairs and then looped.
all of my bloody valentine music is good, I love this album but also song &quot;I Believe&quot;, for example
Fantano sounds like he‚Äôs progressively getting higher while talking about the album
loomer, the masterpiece of the album!
I hate it when you try to educate us on different genres. Just shut the fuck up and review the goddamn album.
God your face looks so fucked up without glasses.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG_0Exs9jTQ&amp;t=20">0:20</a>
How could u not mention what you want ü•∫
A classic case of a slowburner, this album keeps on giving however many sittings. Also, I firmly believe you have to sit through its entirety, picking songs apart just takes something away from its collective beauty.
Here bc of Chinese sleep chant
OVER. FUCKING. RATED, just like the Jesus and Mary Chain. F***, what a bunch of bullshit. Bands like Cocteau Twins, and Dif Juz created better shoegaze way before this shit became popular.
Every artist I think I discover. Ya boy been there
Loveless isn&#39;t spacey, it&#39;s endogenous.
I will admit it took me a few listens before I fully realized the greatness of this album. Then one night, as I was listening to it laying on the couch, it hit me. Shields just went beyond everything on this album - a masterpiece for anyone who really knows and appreciates music.
VREEEEEEEEEEE<br>VROOOOOOOOOOOOO
yay, you&#39;ve got unknown pleasures on your shelf.
The guitar sounds like what I‚Äôve always wanted guitars to sound like. <br><br>Thick, ethereal, emotional, and psychedelic.
1979-1991 underground rock was the peak of music; Hardcore punk, grunge, sludge metal, noise pop, dream pop, post punk, thrash metal, alternative rock, shoegaze, screamo and emocore were all birthed from this time era.
When I was a teenager I was pretty withdrawn and lonely, and I used to spend a lot of time just walking around the shitty town where I lived listening to music, especially this album. I listened the absolute shit out of Loveless, and I think it really does resonate with young people who are struggling to cope with intense emotional issues, as I was at the time. It kind of offers this whole other weird sonic world to get lost in and take your mind off things. I don&#39;t really listen to it anymore to be honest, but it holds a very special place in my heart nonetheless
One of my favorite albums all time. Set me on a path of sorts. <br><br>Bjm,swervedriver,I could literally go on for days but I won‚Äôt. <br><br>But it isn‚Äôt a stretch to say this album lies at the core of my obsession with the specific sound that I am obsessed with (to the tune of a thousand albums). <br><br>Amazing review. The nostalgia was overwhelming
An excellent over view of a superb album. As brilliant as loveless is , I prefer isn&#39;t anything , that came before it. Nevertheless loveless is a truly magical album . Please review Cocteau Twins Heaven or Las Vegas , which for me is simply one of thee greatest albums of all time.
Souvlaki is better imo
The lyrics add another dimension to this album
Have you covered psycho candy by the Jesus and Mary chain yet?
You are infuriating me. I will subscribe. Well said young man. Completely disagree with you at every turn.<br><br>I love other people&#39;s opinions and vision. We are all one people and we know who we iz.
It&#39;s me fave
Anto have you heard comforter by compulsion or heartworm by whipping boy ..true Irish classics
One of my favorite records but I will admit, the first time I&#39;d heard it, I thought it was a murky, badly mixed album with incomprehensible lyrics (which they are). MBV was like the  Claude Monet of music, misunderstood by most people and an acquired taste for many of us who they grew upon. I would be suspicious of anyone who was immediately receptive to this record.
I like this album but it‚Äôs not that good
I like that sonic youth edit lol
Who&#39;s this guy to judge a masterpeice?
The great thing about loveless is that unlike most music, you have to look into the music instead of the music coming straight out to you
&quot;just woke up... not too long ago&quot;<br><br>and by that he means he was baked as hell and listening to loveless
This is my favorite My Bloody Valentine recordings. Heard it first in 6th grade. I liked it, but a few tracks stood out more than others and I didn&#39;t fully appreciate the sound of this till years later. But the key here is years later. This LP will be with me till I die, and I cant say that about a lot of music. It is a marvel of sound that should be revered as one of the best experimental LP&#39;s of all time. It also started production in 1989, they scrapped a ton of songs because it was missing the flavor they were looking for. I am glad they took their art seriously with a defined direction that sounds so muddied and chaotic in a melancholy tone that sets the stage for later bands and sounds.
This is the go-to album for people who want to sound like they know their shit but are actually clueless. It&#39;s a great album tho
&quot;Bands shooting their music videos on 9 millimeter&quot;...it&#39;s like 8mm, but more so.
<b>DUT</b> <b>DUT</b> <b>DUT</b> <b>DUT</b> VREEEEEEE VROOOOW VREEEEE VROOOOOW
you&#39;re bleeding, valentine
i remember hearing this song when it came out at the Continental in Buffalo,  it was awesome the first time I heard it I had to have it
In case anyone&#39;s still wondering, Colm&#39;s last name is pronounced Kyuh-sho-ig
Loveless is a singular idea perfected
doesn&#39;t rock? no, it does not. it does crush you like a python though.
Favorite album by far
Okay. Youre officially awesome.
Fantano is one of the only YouTubers whose early content is as good as what he‚Äôs putting out now.
Old video, but I&#39;m glad you pointed out the similarity between Sometimes and what I&#39;m assuming is Mayonaise, mentioned it before to my friends and they don&#39;t seem to hear it. Smashing Pumpkins were my introduction to this album and its been a favourite since
I think you were born way much after the release of this album, not to mention that you needed to live the 80&#39;s to understand a lot of this Album. you have my dislike. poor review.
Heh... seminal
Valentiny Bloodano
ur the seminal bitch of internet critics. fuk u and ur cardigan.
Mac Miller lookin&#39; ass
I just stumbled across &quot;Sometimes&quot; recently and was instantly pulled into the song. Fantano&#39;s Pumpkins connection is spot on, always feels good to hear somebody else speak passionately about something you&#39;re into.
One of the best albums in history
AAH PUT YOUR GLASSES ON FOR THE LOVE OF GOD
I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever heard this record described so well.  Nice work!
I  personally think it&#39;s quite overrated
if loveless is sergeant Pepper, you‚Äôre living all over me is pet sounds
I went to a mbv gig in a festival with my friends and they asked me how the fuck i like this. This is certainly not for everyone
Do motorama&#39;s poverty.
I just love the word &quot;shoegaze&quot;. It&#39;s such a perfectly visual metaphor for what this type of music sounds like. When I see genre names like &quot;black metal&quot; and &quot;death metal&quot;, as a layman I have no idea what the difference is.
I like their cover of ~ We Have All The Time In The World ~ Iggy Pop did a great version too.
I tried this album before and I didn&#39;t like it but I decided to give it another try after seeing this review and really its grown on me.
It&#39;s interesting that you mention Smashing Pumpkins in this review, since in the liner notes of Siamese Dream they specifically point out My Bloody Valentine as one of their influences. Seeing that is what led me to seek out MBV, and buy this album shortly after.
Please review Jane Doe.
Do an album review on john frusciante! Empyrean, curtains, to record only water for ten days! i know you did enclosure but that was such an obscure album and IMO not his best work
IM HER SON I LEGIT AM I PROMISE
yo shut the fuck up Anthony
Melon looking like a fuckin bald Post Malone in that thumbnail
The Standard. Everything else is imitation<br>‚ÄúHallucinogenic drugs you‚Äôve just taken....‚Äù more like the ones THEY‚ÄôVE taken. <br>     Let‚Äôs not forget mixer Alan Moulder who I think Trent Reznor sought out after hearing this
Only know the song when you sleep, love it though. It seems there are a lot of protentious people that are huuuuuge MBV fans but sure each to their own
Classic wow
Of course he loved it
Hi, if you&#39;re still doing these classic reviews, could you review The Cure - Disintegration or Suede - Dog Man Star
Bury me w/ Loveless. That sound is so...
Wow The Black One album he should review that I dont think he has done one on drone metal
Best fucking band ever.
Long live Shoegaze
So now that DEATHCONCIOUSNESS is 10 years old, will you review it in this years Classics Week?
I&#39;ll do it for you <br>10/10
Review Daydream Nation by Sonic Youth.
I&#39;ve always thought of Loveless as a rock album with all the hooks taken away. There&#39;s nothing to cling on to. Your just set sail in a sea of noise.
So interesting!
I know you&#39;re not fantano, now stop bullshitting me cal
bweeeeee bwwwwooooo<br>bweeeeee bwwwwooooo
super review
Easily the best album of all time
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG_0Exs9jTQ&amp;t=108">1:48</a> you sound like Rwwwick
I just realized I&#39;ve never seen him without glasses
This album makes me cry so hard. I love it with all my heart.
Loveless is the best album of the Shoegaze music. Best groups My Bloody Valentine,Ride.
Ride is my favorite shoegazing band
Really solid review, I never tire of this album, bought it on the day of release. Repeated listens (literally hundreds) intensify the hypnotic power it has. I can never get bored with  Loveless because like a tumultuous waterfall or a campfire it appeals directly to my mindful preset and I am forever lost in the beautiful moment of wonky noise.
Loveless is pretentious garbage
Sonic Youth! Daydream Nation!
I don&#39;t get it. The effects don&#39;t do enough to make the songs interesting.
google: signal to noise ratio, great review
Who is this? WHO IS THIS? No glasses? I thought he slept with them on, showered with them on, stabbed Cal with them on...
stop comparing loveless and souvlaki
Adam Neely looks weird
not wearing glasses, sitting at a different angle... anthony are you okay?
Please do a Galaxie 500 - On fire review!
What a load of bollocks! Frikkin jibbering twat!
Souvlaki is better
one of my happiest moments in high school was driving home from seeing a movie with my friends in a snow storm at 10pm and listening to this album. it felt really cozy.
My favorite album ‚ù§
WTF melon Soon is the worst track on the album
Pls pls PPPLLLSSS Do souvlaki by slowdive
Shoegaze band fantano
So mad I lost the vinyl for this album
I have learned to love you Fantano. Best wishes.
Why is all this useless information in your head man??
One of the most underrated albums ever.
Souvlaki is still better

This is one of my favorite all time albums.

My 18yr old son, (a big Kanye fan), texted me earlier today.<br>He said &#39;Dad, I just listened to Loveless for the first time. You were right.&#39;<br>Damn right I was right.<br><br>Best album ever.<br>Best son ever too.
my gosh, this album..
that album is so bad being honest
I actually was looking for some pretty heavenly light rock and pop with some really really detailed and mind altering sonic manipulation.
I heard Only Shallow on the radio when I was little, and it influenced my own creativity massively, though the person on the radio never at the time actually said the song nor the band&#39;s name, so it took randomly seeing it on a TV program decades later to actually discover what the song was called and who did it!  Allowing me to then search for it, and enjoy it over again.  I don&#39;t know how much of that odd happenstance and stretched rediscovery influence how much I love the song now, but it&#39;ll always be a favourite.  The rest of the album didn&#39;t stick with me as much, although likely for the same reason.

If you guys like stuff like this and Slowdive, look up Sleep Party People, if you haven&#39;t yet
yo Pitbull u ok?
I&#39;m going to give this a Loveless/Loveless.
When I bought it in high school I thought it was broken, so I returned it
Question for Anthony, how do you edit audio stutters?
Feeling man,feeling
Slowdive- Souvlaki please
One of the greatest albums of all time.
nice ya sometimes rocks
Put on some MBV and read Berserk at the same time &lt;3
Didn&#39;t read past 3 pages of comments, but the Shirt being worn is especially appropriate on at least 2 levels. 1. No Fun, Not Ever (Enemies List Home Recordings/ Dan &amp;  Tim) might be the mission statement of getting this album recorded 2. HANL Deathconsciousness crosses many genres, but definitely owes a debt to MBV
Hey Antony if u know so much about music where&#39;s your mixtape at?
that&#39;s no wood chipper. It&#39;s SUNN 0)))

wow, 500 years later. gooooooooood  job. i do what wikipedia can do. what google already does. i offer no insight. i need hits. i looked up the creation records discography on google...i am a robot. i offer nothing new. i am a narcissist.  i need hits.
so you&#39;re saying this album wasn&#39;t created in a vacuum?
I fucking love Only Shallow, but I can&#39;t sit through other MBV songs :/
Im sad and I listen to loveless every night
Kerbdog - on the turn
it&#39;s Shields, not Shield
Wowsers....kids who have no idea of history, recalling history. Your generation&#39;s need to feel valid; juxtapose your relating EVERYTHING to hip hop history, is just embarrassing. Your cardigan was a joke amongst us (in our generation, who got jobs selling idiots our 2nd hand style to millenials). Your vinyl collection must be replete with crappy white top 40 artists (John Mayer, you Emmy watching turd).
Anthony has definitely tripped out to this album
Certainly not a light album, especially when performed live is concerned
&quot;Is that a woodchipper?&quot;<br>No it&#39;s Merzbow
Very well said. Shoegaze is probably one of my most favorite genres.
It&#39;s 2017, I just dicovered MBV a couple weeks ago and it&#39;s surprisingly close to the music I wish I would record or ear when I go to a gig... I&#39;m asking myself how could I miss that ?!! I amaze myself sometimes...
sometimes you just get stuff wrong. colm didnt have anything to do with producing this.
Wow, he used to look like a slightly blacker Shaun King.
I fell in love with this album from the first moment, when my friend introduced it to me many many years ago and it&#39;s still one of my favorite albums of all time. The thick, dreamy wall of guitar sound(s) on this album is just pure nectar to ears and soul and the mood of this album is just something special, it&#39;s melancholic but not depressing, rather a bittersweet and soothing mood, the kind that takes you back to the days of your youth, maybe even reminds you of your past loves but in a way that it leaves a mellow feeling.
viscosity.
Godspeed My! Bloody Valentine
damn you make great music sound so dull
I love that album so much.
Funny you keep saying how the album isn&#39;t about the songwriting yet still has super catchy parts and hooks all over it. Lyrics are really strong too. Vocally and instrumentally, although very simplistic compositionally, this still blows a lot of other song focused rock albums out of the water for me.
god damnnnnnnnn!!!!!!!!! finally got around to this and it&#39;s fucking killer. can&#39;t stop listening to Only Shallow
I like a lot of pieces of this album, but for some reason I can&#39;t get the whole as much. The mixing feels unnecessarily messy at times and some of these tracks make my head spin at trying to feel it altogether. I almost would think this album would have sounded better if recorded 10 or 20 years later. It&#39;s weird because the tracks I like, I REALLLLLYYYYY like (&quot;Only Shallow&quot;, &quot;Sometimes&quot; and &quot;Come In Alone&quot; come to mind) and Daydream Nation (Seemingly this album&#39;s uncle) is one of my favorite albums of all time. I might give it more listens, but can some people here give me some modern Shoegaze and Dream Pop acts I can try out? I like this sound and concept, I just am not sure I <b>fully</b> like this album
I&#39;ve never heard an album that feels so fucking long when it&#39;s only around average album length.
Psychocandy was before loveless im triggered
Took me a while to fall in love with this album. Tried it last year. Didn&#39;t dig it. Tried it again and now I&#39;m enlightened
Nice three cd&#39;s up there

&quot;Regular Album Reviews&quot;
I agree with the descriptions about the guitar tone, but totally disagree with the dismissal of the songwriting. The melodies and chord progressions, and rich harmonies, are the best thing about this album. It is the part most shoegaze clones always get wrong. It is where the most unique ideas on the album are hidden, and creates the unique and transcendent mood.
I think in the style of the album you should have layered three reviews for loveless on top of each other.
souvlaki beats it
Such a great review
WHEN I LOOK AT YOU<br><br>OHH I DON&#39;T KNOW WHAT&#39;S REAL
Don&#39;t forget the debut Ride album, Nowhere. That is a shoegaze pioneer.
what is the song at the end??
One of those albums where everyone agrees that this is an absolute 10/10. A Classic.
A masterpiece
was this guy even born when Loveless was released?
Without his glasses, he looks a little like Ca..... no it can&#39;t be true
I have to say that I hated this album. I don&#39;t think that the guitar tone experimentation justified the uninspired part writing. The guitar tones were unique, but not really new. Compounding this problem, the album really didn&#39;t do anything interesting with this tone. For an album that&#39;s supposed to be discovering new avenues for an instrument, it has a profound lack of virtuosic performances.
Indeed , a Classic !
Instead of just raving on for nearly 10 mins, how about playing some of the tracks on Loveless dumbo!
&gt;no glasses
Don&#39;t even fucking think about taking your glasses off ever again Fantano
this is not tge kind of album i see myself listening to again so soon
review  DYNAMO of Soda Stereo
Review Dynamo pls
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG_0Exs9jTQ&amp;t=480">8:00</a>-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG_0Exs9jTQ&amp;t=490">8:10</a> - I&#39;d agree for listening to the entire record, but some of the songs are (more or less) immediately accessible. On Loomer, the melodic ideas are rather nuanced and sort of catchy. When You Sleep is also quite approachable and has both an infectious, beautiful instrumental hook as well as a gorgeous but haunting vocal melody. But on the whole, yeah it&#39;s not exactly the most approachable album (even if it&#39;s amazing).
I still have the same affection for loveless that I did when I first heard it in early 90&#39;s.  Good, honest review here.
There are a couple of beautiful tracks on it but a lot of it sounds disturbingly like when a cassette tape gets chewed up in the machine.  I prefer Slowdive Just for a Day.
I ordered the same shirt years ago and never received it. I am going to blame you for it.
Probably the loudest show I ever attended. Amazing.
Best album of the 90&#39;s, it&#39;s a trip

LOL! Shooting on 9 mm? Really? :)
One of my faves.  Even though it&#39;s been over 20 years.  One of the best things of that era.
Best rock album of all time
I guess Black One is just going to be in that corner every other review and never get reviewed itself
you are like the deepest person ever
This album is like beautiful pink noise to me
You didn&#39;t mention the best track on the album....&quot;What You Want&quot;
Nice - you&#39;ve taken teh time to put into words what everyone knew - like listening to or watching &quot;smells like teen spirit&quot; for teh first time. Notice I typed &#39;teh&#39;. More than once.
Yeah the problem I have with this album is the same thing I have with melvins like you said the dont focus on songwriting on this album just the sound there creating. which is fine but to me it just feels so unbalanced on this record  I mean I&#39;ve seen artist like Jesus Mary chain that give equal attention to both the kickass sound and great tune this album for me at least felt so unbalanced. We&#39;ll my opion doesn&#39;t matter like people say there like assholes everyone has one.
Ahh, I always listen to this album before I go to sleep. Not because it&#39;s boring, but because I want my dreams to be like Loveless.
repping that enemies list shirt
Interesting  a  vhs  and poloraid  how classic.<br>I&#39;m going to say  that this  album  isn&#39;t  Shout at the devil ,  Highway to Hell,  For those about to rock, Hi n dry  but is it as good  as no Prayer for the dying, Fear of the dark, Dr Feel good, the Headless cross?
This album is good but I think Souvlaki by Slowdive is just as good if not better
Wow sorry but this totally misses the point. NO ONE else was anywhere near MBV when Loveless dropped. They weren&#39;t &quot;shoegaze&quot;, that&#39;s a genre name invented for the bands that tried to get the same sounds and failed (often in a beautiful way).This is not lo-if either - Sheilds&#39; production is incredibly detailed and magically captures the &quot;infinite horizon&quot; of wave after wave of guitar and feedback. It is bang on for the style and purpose of the songs.Another point that revisionist recent reviews miss, is that at the time of its release, it felt like a slightly stationary or backwards move, given the incredible sonic leaps they had made on the glider and tremolo eps which preceded Loveless. Personally, their high water mark was the Tremolo ep, opener &quot;to here knows when&quot; is still unsurpassed as the furthest out there pop song I have ever heard. Not a single guitar band has been able to pick up the torch and break new ground, though Seefeel did some interesting stuff that meshed the Shields guitar templates with a more electronic sounding underlay and beats.
This guy better not be wearing a Fun. shirt. he better not.
I prefer Slowdive and Ride myself, but this is a great album too.
Kevin Shields and Colm O ciosoig are the only musicians on the record with most of the latter&#39;s contributions being samples.
i know the bassets. she is called mel.
You gotta review that Black One LP back there for another classics week
you made me realize would be pretty awesome for you to review.
Hold old were you in 1991? HAHAHAHAHAHA ¬† This guy is just nonsense... That photo is just a long exposure during a live show with purple lights! ¬† JUST SHUT UP!!!

OI! it&#39;s Cuh-Lum, not Coh-lum! get it right, for the sake of Colms everywhere, please.

Freaking love this album. Everyone owes it to themself to listen to this.
Doing a review immediately after waking up, just like how Bilinda used to record her vocals :D
Trance Rock
loveless is literally¬†the greatest album ever made
10/10
Totally nailed it with &quot;Soon&quot;, Anthony. Exactly how I feel when I hear it. Dance-able as fuck.
It&#39;s an album where it&#39;s cover art is completely indicative of the music on the record.
This shit is definitely not for everyone. It&#39;s so awkward playing this in my car with someone who obviously doesn&#39;t enjoy it smh.
Great Review! I disagree with you about the songwriting though...just slightly perhaps. I actually think one of the things that makes MBV and loveless great, and not just some other shoegaze band, is the band&#39;s ability to write songs that contain unique, or unexpected chord changes. See If I Am from the new record, Blown A Wish, and the chorus on Lose My Breath, for examples. Also, I&#39;ve always thought the verse melody on the song Swallow from the Tremelo EP was incredibly moving. ¬†This band has brought, and will continue to bring, joy into my life because of these songwriting decisions.
Do you just....you know? Simply enjoy anything for what it is, Anthony?
you should listen to &quot;Dynamo&quot; by Soda Stereo, contemporary of this album, southamerican shoegaze best
what he says about the cover I kind off exactly commented on the album on youtube wtf
I always used to listen to Smashing Pumpkins, and listened to this album for the first time this week. Really easy listening and exciting.
Hate to tell you but you forgot to mention WHY the guitar sound was so droned...Tremolo, nuff said...
your review reminded me those reviews that pink floyd had back in the 70s where all those critics were obsessed for the use of machines and sound effects and they totally forget the amazing music they were hearing...<br>and also reminded me the reaction a friend (fan of REO Speed Wagon) had when he listened Loveless... ¬†

Loveless is simply the best piece of music ever. I never fail to be amazed by the beauty of the music in this fantastic set of songs. I will adore this record until I die and nothing will come close to it. It is simply that good. Modern music perfection, and it is over 20 years old already.
albums u should review:<br><br>slint - spiderland<br>the cure - disintegration
Do a michael mcdonald album
To Here Knows When honestly has to be my favorite song of all time. That&#39;s kind of a bold claim as a music enthusiast, but god damn, listening to the song is like seeing a diamond encrusted tidal wave destroy a neon-drenched hong kong in 100x slow motion, on drugs.
The Smashing Pumpkins is one of my favorite bands ever. Been listening to them since I was in elementary school(ahm 16 now). So, it wasn&#39;t really difficult for me to get into this album and totally dig it. Great band and great album.
All you had to say is &quot;Perfect&quot;.
Turn my Head into Sound
Some really good shoegaze bands you guys should try out are Dive and Blind Mr. Jones! :D¬†
I could&#39;ve sworn it was Cal Chuchesta talking before you put your glasses on
Watching this makes me really want to listen to this album and eat ice cream. 
I really don&#39;t get Loveless.  To me it&#39;s like an odd B-movie or something ....
what are your credentials anthony
you should review some tera melos
Is the that vinyl on the top-left (the only one facing outwards) Sunn O)))&#39;s Black One?
awesome vid awesome album bro
Hey Anthony could you do a review of the new album by Ringo Deathstarr? I feel like they&#39;re always just tossed into the &quot;mbv shoegaze copycats&quot; pile but they have more to offer as a band than most critics are willing to explore. 
I&#39;m going through a second wave of MBV obsession, and I feel like Kevin Shield&#39;s sunny songwriting is too overlooked. They&#39;re simple songs, but after I wrapped my head around the psychedelic tones, I&#39;ve become so attached to the simple chord progressions and shyly sexual themes. The emotions are sedated and confused, but still very intense to me.
ethereal cereal
mbv, an enemieslist shirt, and black one in the background? anthony fantano, the HIPPEST music nerd.
To me loveless sounds like being in a room and having a Trippy expansiveness of a grander reality you could never fully understand. Overlaying realities meshed together...
Spot on. ¬†Great review.
I was fortunate to be in college when &quot;loveless&quot; was released, and college radio was the only place you were likely to hear MBV.
I first heard this album in 1990 and it changed the course of everything I would listen to from that point forward. That was nearly 25 years ago, and I won&#39;t ever forget it. This is perhaps my favorite album...Ever.
will you review Gorillaz- debut or Demon Days por favor
FUN
I think it&#39;s overrated! Extremely unique sound production with a few very well conceived songs, but as an album? Eh. I just never really got it. In a similar vein I think Curve did an excellent job with &quot;Doppelganger&quot;, and of course there&#39;s &quot;Souvlaki&quot;...though look who was in the studio with them. :)<br><br>As far as requests for phenomenally <b>well</b> produced classics, how about one for Skinny Puppy&#39;s VIVISect VI? Or Violator? Mezzanine? :)
Loveless has so many levels, truly one of the greatest albums Ive heard
anthony i love you, and your reviews rule. at first i just watched them occasionally but it&#39;s gotten to the point that i watch everything you do, and just, thank you for putting so much love and effort into this project. also this is the best record of all time.
Loveless is hands down my favorite album of all time, which is why My Bloody Valentine also happens to be my favorite band of all time. I was able to appreciate this album the moment I first listened to it in full, right off the bat. Their music just suits my overall personality and outlook in life. The great thing about Loveless is that it can be appreciated in so many ways imaginable. You can listen to it either while meditating or partying out. Words alone are not enough to describe the overall impact of this album that made MBV peerless and in a league of their very own.
my favorite album of all time.
Great review one of your most intensely on point well done!!!
I like the poetic way in which you describe this album. I don¬¥t like but truely respect it as a seminal work.
since you reviewed this, can you do one on Slowdive&#39;s Souvlaki?
I bought this album on the day it came out, and I love it still. It&#39;s something very special indeed.
this is an album i listen to before bed, and i do mean that in a very good way.
So, i was talking to my buddy about our experience seeing My Bloody Valentine live and i was trying to describe what we witnessed... It was hard to explain, but after much discussion we came to the same exact conclusion as you! Which is really rad to me! I&#39;m glad my curiosity led me to this video. I feel like my thoughts are ¬†definitely confirmed. I&#39;m glad i&#39;m not the only one who thinks this way i mean. You are way more articulate and well read though then we are lol. I got ¬†a new level of respect for you. Anyway you have to see them live. Their sound is quite a spectacle to behold.
¬†It&#39;s strange to have an album like Loveless where you can have fun just sitting back and relaxing while listening to it on your monitor speakers, or trying to dissect them with a good DAC, amp and headphones. It&#39;s really interesting to try and see how all the guitar parts come together in their particular ways, again, especially if you have a good pair of cans on you.<br>¬† On a different note, I think Loveless and Siamese Dream have a lot in common, both tonally and in the way many of the songs are structured. Obviously there&#39;s a lot more rock in Siamese Dream, but it still has that nice shoegazey quality to it which I often associate with songs like &quot;Luna&quot; and &quot;Mayonnaise.&quot; Hell, &quot;Daydream&quot; from Gish sounds like an offshoot of &quot;Lose My Breath.&quot;
&lt;---- Loveless vs. Souvlaki video
SHUT UP! you&#39;re not the &quot;Internets biggest music nerd&quot;¬†
I really like this album. I picked it up on a whim at Barnes &amp; Noble not knowing what it was and was pleased with my discovery.
Could you review &quot;when I was born for the 7th time&quot; by cornershop?
is that &#39;Black One&#39; in the back?
Great album. I&#39;ve had it since the early 90&#39;s and still play it constantly.
wow, that was a great review and accurate description of Loveless¬† :)
i&#39;m not reading reviews about this album cause i love it and it&#39;s pointless to read about someone else&#39;s thoughts about it (it doesn&#39;t matter) i just know that i was waiting for them to come back, and they did! that&#39;s enough for me.
You pretty much hit the nail on the head with your descriptions.¬†
I&#39;m only still a teen but MBV and Shoegaze makes me feel alive and makes me look in a world in a different way. I agree with you that it is not for everyone because it&#39;s a album that makes you think and some ways makes you feel that you&#39;re the only one in this world that&#39;s really seeing the world and everyone outside is just gone. For a human being that feels like they&#39;re worthless and they&#39;re nothing I would definitely recommend this album and genre to them. Shoegaze made me feel important.¬†
i wish i could fight you in real life¬†
shut up to lameo!!!
please review mini mansions lp!
Possibly the most distorted, sad, dreary, depressing album I&#39;ve ever heard yet so beautifully perfect
SHUT UP!!
Why should feel bad for liking something? What an ignorant comment
I got to see them a couple nights ago... such an incredible live band.
Interestingly enough, this album doesn&#39;t contain many guitar overdubs. Shields just got the right tones dialed in. Siamese Dream is a great example of tons of guitar overdubs making a track sound compressed and smaller rather than huge.
review Joy Division Unknown Pleasures

Come on, nobody should feel bad for liking what they do.

Can you review that wood chipper?
Billy never almost gave up music. That&#39;s false. MBV influenced one aspect of the Smashing Pumpkins sound. The moody/atmospheric shoegaze sound on some Pumpkins tracks. 
Can- Tago Mago
that album sucks and you should feel bad for liking it
Seriously took me years to &quot;get&quot; this album but I finally worked my way in over time- it&#39;s now easily one of my top 5 albums of all time and certainly one I can listen to all the way though several times without skipping things (not many albums can do that!)  Classic, but truly not for everyone.
???
bitch fuk off
This album is surreal as fuck.......&amp; it took me a long time to appreciate it, but now I can say I really like it a bunch......
Some ideas for the next classics bunch:
Sister-Sonic Youth
It Takes a Nation of Millions-Public Enemy
Remain In Light-Talking Heads
Rumours-Fleetwood Mac
Automatic for the People-R.E.M.
Maggot Brain-Funkadelic
American Beauty-The Grateful Dead
Giant Steps-John Coltrane
New York Dolls-New York Dolls
There&#39;s a Riot Goin&#39; On-Sly &amp; the Family Stone
how about a review for Eminem&#39;s the slim shady LP ?
WPSITWIN fucked up your list. Take it out and add some Skylarking or Low and  then you got a deal.
You should review Daydream Nation the next time you do classic week :)
This album is actually a classic.
Loveless is one of my all time favorite albums. I would love to see a review of Marquee Moon by Television, another one of my favorites.
Imagine Kevin Shields with Anton Newcombe..I always wondered what they could create together-food for thought
Yup I would say so
Yup I would say so
Sonic Youth is from the same shoegaze genre, right?
where did you hear the thing about billy almost giving up music because he could never achieve what MBV did? (not saying its a lie, im just curious) 
Yes, please review Unknown Pleasures. I love your reviews, I really love Loveless, I agreewith you, it is not for everyone. 
I got this album after I saw them at FYF. I listened to it as I drove home from LA to Montana. Watching the scenery pass by and listening to the hazy, drifting, gorgeous tones had quite an effect on me. It makes the world even more beautiful. 
I&#39;d love to see you review Joy Division&#39;s &#39;Unknown Pleasures&#39;.
Oh lord. Smashing Pumpkins modeled themselves after MBV when Billy Corigan heard this album. In fact he almost gave up music because he knew he could never achieve what they had.  This was in the time of Tape (2in 24 tr.). Who here has ever worked with tape?  

And the &quot;effects&quot; you spoke of are not just effects, he was working with microphone phasing. Genius is an understatement when it comes to this band folks like them or not, rock n roll disagrees with you.
this album is more than 20 years old now.......ahhh
I usually list it as my 7th favorite album.
Loveless is pretty much life in Ireland through the eyes of a teenager
Ugh Fantano is such a stuck up douche sometimes.. :/
aren&#39;t u kinda late on this one..?
just in case u didn&#39;t know (and i don&#39;t think you did because of some things you said..) it took them 2.5 years to produce this album and they bankrupted 2 record labels in the process...knda doubt it was &quot;easy&quot;
sheck out SeeFeel, they do some shoegaze/ambient hybrid and the guitarist did solo work being inspired by aphex twin, who was inspired by drexciya. I had to make that connection cause of your username. 8^]
Review some Parkway Drive.
/mu/core
Boy, you are a bit late to the party, but Shoegaze happened in the late eighties, early nineties, really and MBV were around before ALL those bands came out.
For you boring, fine, but how is it pretentious? What is it pretending to be?
this album gets a 10
Love this album!
This came out in 91 drex
Bit late to the party but this was kinda late in that shoegaze scene that happened in the late 90s, bands like ride, lush &amp; the pale saints to name a few had already released great shoegaze albums before this
Nice Fun. shirt, NERD!
I know, I saw the stompland video. I use a similar setup, actually: a DOD Grunge going into a Behringer VD-1, both at low gain. It sounds like a horrible combo, but it&#39;s a nice, saturated sound.  
 And it&#39;s generally stipulated that if somethings&#39;s collectively acknowledged, even if it&#39;s subjective, it&#39;s considered objective. I&#39;m just a peer, who a lot of people would agree with. I&#39;d actually like to know how &quot;not new&quot; they were, for the sake of finding out about new, awesome bands like SP.
He used distortion as well, and all fuzz is technically a distortion effect. The two pedals Corgan used on Siamese Dream were an IC Big Muff and an MXR Distortion +. Even the Big Muff is often considered a distortion and not a fuzz at all, but there&#39;s a lot of debate around that. 

And new to your ears doesn&#39;t mean new to the genre. 
 If you have a Big Muff, a cheap amp and a guitar with a tremolo unit, that&#39;s pretty much enough. Hell, I use a Chinese 70-dollar Strat clone for their songs.
 Distortion? More like fuzz. Besides, Gish and Siamese Dream were totally new to my ears when I heard them; I can&#39;t really find a band that really comes close to them. Even if I did, the solo on Soma is undeniably, unequivocally, one of the best solos ever, and that&#39;s good enough for me. It&#39;s what got me into playing the guitar in the first place...I still want that Fender Blender after almost a decade. 
I keep trying to play my guitar like My Bloody Valentine. I just don&#39;t have enough anything. 
No response to my other comment @ you? ... I&#39;ve never heard him say that. I&#39;m sure he doesn&#39;t think that, tbh. There are so many classic albums that aren&#39;t 10/10s IN MY OPINION. 
A Classic album to Fantano is a 10/10 album. He discussed this once before somewhere. Classics are albums he thinks are 10s
It&#39;s not &quot;10/10 Perfect Albums Week&quot;... It&#39;s &quot;Classics Week&quot;. 
That&#39;s your opinion, but a lot of people consider it a classic... The Pumpkins had a unique sound, so I don&#39;t know how you could say it didn&#39;t bring anything new to rock... Loveless isn&#39;t a 10/10 album, in my opinion. I don&#39;t think all of the albums TND reviewed for classics week are 10/10 albums. That&#39;ll probably piss a lot of music nazis off, but I don&#39;t give a fuck. Who really cares? They&#39;re both classic albums, regardless of what we think of them. 
Siamese Dream is not a 10/10 album, it&#39;s good, but didn&#39;t really bring anything new to rock or indie rock, just good songwriting with some distortion pedals. I have trouble considering it a classic.

I&#39;d like to see Daydream Nation or something like that
I&#39;m talking about classics week ONLY. Come on, it&#39;s really not that difficult to comprehend. 
He reviewed this and the new MBV album didn&#39;t he?
No specks fantano. No pecks fantano.
Pink flag too!
But that&#39;s part of what makes Fantano Fantano.
Can you just talk about the album without all the obnoxious cuts in editing? SOOO distracting!!!  
you should review Turn On The Bright Lights by Interpol
review for breakffasssstttt!!!
Well, he can&#39;t review 2 albums from the same band/artists... Kind of unfair to the people that want variety. 
Oh my God, that&#39;s an incredible album. Plus, could you ( theneedledrop) review Mellon Collie please?
The internets sleepiest music nerd
Great review, one of my all time favorites. You nailed it with &quot;otherworldly.&quot; I think the first Cocteau Twins album Garlands has a similar kind of sound.
I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve done a Siamese Dream review, but I&#39;m not sure. I&#39;d like to see one either which way.
This album is a classic for sure.
It&#39;s his No Fun. Not Ever. shirt I believe.
@0:22

This is my favorite song on the album, thank you for acknowledging this as EVERYONE seems to overlook the track.
In reply to fraqture: The extraordinary thing is that the band felt so unhappy while they were recording and felt as if they were &quot;losing it&quot;, and yet created music filled with such joy and happiness. Perhaps they were trying to &quot;cheer themselves up&quot; by creating this music.
The album title has no deeper meaning to it, other than express the feeling of the band members during the recording. Quote from an interview with Bilinda: 

&quot;All four of us were losing it in our own ways. God knows why. I think back and wonder if it was accumulated weariness and stress. We had no money. Colm was homeless and Kevin‚Äôs and my relationship was cracking. Quite frankly we were driving each other insane. The reason the album was called Loveless is because it all was when we made it.&quot;
What you want is the most beautiful thing I&#39;ve ever heard
Bit patronising...
Us this is a classic
That&#39;s What I&#39;m Not* sorry about that
MY PICS FOR NEXT CLASSICS WEEK:D : Slint: Spiderland, Radiohead; Kid A, Beastie Boys; Paul&#39;s Boutique, Artic Monkeys; Whatever People Say I Am, I&#39;m Not, then end it with Joy Division; Closer &lt;33
This album made me feel some feels with the sound alone.
REVIEW THE NEW NAILS LP YOU BALD SONUVA BITCH. After that please pan the 20/20 experience.
This is a very intelligent review, but he neglects to mention the deep emotions that the band are expressing in their music. The clues are there in the words &quot;Valentine&quot; and &quot;Loveless&quot;. This album is about the subjective experience of being in love, and the way it makes everything around you feel more alive. This is one of the most moving and uplifting albums I have ever heard, and it continues to inspire me years after I first heard it. It made me realise that love is all that matters!
&#39;not song focused, but sound focused&#39; .. &#39;if this album were acoustic, it would be pretty boring&#39;. interesting, as i&#39;ve always felt the opposite was true.  most of the other artists in the shoegaze &#39;genre&#39; are traditional 1-4-5 verse-chorus-verse pop songwriters through and through.  MBV on loveless is anything but.  compare &#39;only shallow&#39;  &#39;come in alone&#39; &#39;soon&#39; and &#39;sometimes&#39; to slowdive &#39;alison&#39; (for ex) and it becomes clear that MBV were innovators of sound AND song.  new album even moreso!
Review some Boards of Canada
I remember reading a book on dinosaurs from the 90&#39;s and one of the pictures had that same tint of pink as the album cover. So, so awesome...
Next year, could you please review Siamese Dream? 
A mate of mine took me to see this band in a small venue in Sydney in the early 90&#39;s. I&#39;d never heard of them. They blew me away. I still listen to the album now.
This album is in my top 10
Maybe you could review &quot;Isn&#39;t anything&quot; to complete their studio-album discography. One of my favourite albums, if not favourite.
he looks pretty alive to me
But he is still right. 
I think he&#39;s pretty funny sometimes. And cute.
I love this album. I feel special because i love it and like you said its not everyone&#39;s bag.
Well so are U2 but I coulden&#39;t care less when it comes to them.
Half of them are British. 
This guy is not funny
dude your moustache brings me back to 6th grade dude when i was listening to the creed the days of the new and the 311 so review them and bring back the post post post grunge and tell me how you do it piece and keep it reel
Thank you! It does my head in when people call MBV &#39;shoegaze&#39;  Like you say an easy pigeon hole for the A&amp;R people and journalists. Saying that though the best description of their sound did come from a NME journalist who described them as &#39;beauty under siege&#39; 
you have that totally arse about front.. MBV began in the late 80&#39;s  Wavves is influenced (it sounds) by them 
they&#39;re half n half 

Full marks for acknowledgeing MBV as an Irish band.A lot of people make the mistake of thinking they&#39;re British.
The problem with bands like Moose and Chapterhouse and, yes, even Slowdive is that they were bland to the point of muzak (this goes for Love Spirals Downwards, too). Ride and Swervedriver were good to the extent they *weren&#39;t* shoegaze.

Early Pale Saints and Boo Radleys were at least experimental.
it took me about a year to realise it was a guitar

You all should check out the band Loop. I never hear of them when people talk about shoe-gaze.

GUYS HE REVIEWED THEIR NEW ALBUM MY LIFE IS COMPLETE THANK YOU
I just heard from my friend who was next to him and his girlfriend at a Swans concert that he&#39;s already shot the review and just needs to edit it! :) Should be uploaded within a day or two.
And to think when I first saw this review I had absolutely no idea that m b v was gong to come out a mere month later!
Just reviewed m v b. I&#39;d really appreciate you guys checking out my album review. And I totally owe theneedledrop though... :P
&quot;is that a wood chipper&quot; 
I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve thought that while listening to MBV. Great album indeed...
Shoegaze was a derisory term created by the NME for a bunch of middle class kids in bands who&#39;d rather look at their effects pedals than engage with the audience.   
It&#39;s appropriate that you have the Sunn 0))) album behind you. 
Yeah, but its their debut ALBUM, not another ep (as fantastic as those are).
And Ride
dont forget about Ride..
stone roses? eh?
their new album raped my mind and i liked it 
Get some sleep for this new one Anthony..
C&#39;mon Anthony, you gotta review their new album. We&#39;ll love you forever if you do.
REVIEW THEIR NEW ALBUM
ikr! moose! chapterhouse! so much good stuff that isn&#39;t STONE ROSES
YO!
new album jus dropped a few hours ago!
i expect a review TOMORROW son
get on yr game
This album is like jerking off while dropping acid.


fucking youtube error, try again bullshit won&#39;t let me reply to comments.
Turn the volume up.
Did he say that was the case?
My favorite album.. and he kind of nails the reason why I love it, the sheer cacophony of guitar and the lazy attitude to songwriting  
What a fucking amazing analogies. You sir, are a verbal bad ass.
The older I get, the worse my hearing gets -- as I lose frequencies at either end of the spectrum -- so, the less I &#39;hear&#39; of Loveless, and the more I understand it.
2:54 9mm? I think that&#39;d be a little bloody...

I believe 8mm is what you were looking for.
really like n agree with your saying about shoegaze sound texture n Polaroid photo colour. good review!
you nailed it man, again
Uncle Acid and The Deadbeats. Album is Blood lust. check that out. 
&quot;Isn&#39;t Anything&quot; is real good too
and RIDE!
He&#39;s reviewing older stuff that he thinks is a classic. Probably why he said he&#39;s reviewing another classic album. Derp.
brb listening to loveless
I prefer Slowdive over MBV actually :P
if it took you until 2013 to listen to loveless i dont think ill be  trusting you when it comes to music reviews, sorry
Agreed. 
when will you review Slowdive albums?
Maybe Ride&#39;s debut album Nowhere? I feel that this is also a seminal shoegaze album that is slowly being swepped under a pile of forgotten bands.
what is the black and white LP that is in your shelf, in the background?
This album has influenced my music a lot. It, along with Dinosaur Jr.&#39;s You&#39;re Living All Over Me persuaded me to buy a Fender Jazzmaster.
But you should actually review Surfer Rosa by Pixies instead. Next classics week.
You&#39;re a douchebag.
Love both. 
To here knows when still gives me goosebumps man. Ridiculous track.
Good review of one of the greatest albums ever.

vacuumcleaner/10

there, i just saved you 9 minutes
soooo much respect for this guy&#39;s music knowledge. 
Hey, Anthony!  Any chance you could do something by modest mouse...?
Isn&#39;t Anything or Loveless?
Guys reviews are art in itself
i wish in the video you put your glasses on and the whole video got clearer and all hd like
this album could come out a century from now and it would still sound fresh.
first calm de fucke downe...u let look my comment much more aggresive then it is, i was CHILLIN. it bothered me that slowdive wasn&#39;t mentioned in the video, but the bands mentioned were more pre-mbv anyways when i think about it. what i mean is that people just seem to NOT CARE, EVEN when they&#39;re into that genre for a longer time. they rather listen to neo-shoegaze bands which just try to sound like mbv. again u took my comment wrong. i didn&#39;t wrote U FUCKIN ASSHOLES LISTEN TO SLOWDIVE, did i?
guess what. its because they haven&#39;t discovered them -.- stop being so pretentious. you can&#39;t expect people to find ALL the bands in one genre once they start listening to it. You can&#39;t tell me you listen to every band in every genre you enjoy. Just chill. why is it that people always only listen to the *big bands in a genre? its beacuse those bands just happened to be more successful... soooo as a consequence they are more likely to be found than other bands. it is what it is man. 

I&#39;ve just fallen in love with My Bloody Valentine. They are just incredible. 
why do people not care about slowdive....it seems people think there are just mbv and jesus and mary
MODEST MOUSE- THE LONESOME CROWDED WEST please please please please!!!!
Brother you need to listen to a lot of Cocteau Twins before you even begin to talk about Loveless as &quot;laying the groundwork of a musical movement&quot; [shoegaze]. 
my favorite album of all time! can&#39;t believe you&#39;re doing these, now! sweet.
I&#39;m sorry that this video was brought to the attention of the MBV forums with the thread title &quot;this guy needs to be crucified&quot;. We&#39;re not all √ºber-uppity like that guy, though there is the tendency for some fans to treat the band as though they are holy and sacred.
I&#39;m feeling you do the Lonesome Crowded West next.
Troll detected; Taking evasive action...
I think you should review the glow pt. 2 some time

turnip

can tago mago!
Any AFI reviews?

I don&#39;t think you know what I mean by the placebo effect. That&#39;s when someone convinces themselves is having an effect on themselves and the act of convincing themselves is what causes the effect. I think you misunderstand what I said. I&#39;m just saying I think people convince themselves to like this album.
Yeah, people can have different taste. In my opinion, based off my taste, this album sucks. If you want to be categorical, then that&#39;s where you&#39;ve made an issue out of it with me. By your reasoning, since I&#39;m a &#39;brony&#39; I aught to love, tolerate and respect and all that piss n&#39; shit. Wrong. I don&#39;t understand why you felt the need to respond to my comment either. The more this happens, the more confused I&#39;m feeling honestly. Can you tell me specifically what part of my post needed replying to?  
Not sure why you felt the need to tell me that.
haha i was listening to this earlier today...i didn&#39;t expect a review for it to come out! how nice of you! :D
I was about to throw up on my Ipod until I stumbled upon you , just made my life more worth living. Not flattery I genuinely love music but was overwhelmed and didn&#39;t know where to look since the internet is so big. But its all here, thank you, your love for music is super useful to me.
I didn&#39;t enjoy Loveless much on first listen, or second, or third. If I made a list of &quot;my favorite albums&quot; it&#39;d be down there a ways even now.  BUT that&#39;s not to say I don&#39;t love it. Just that MBV&#39;s ruthless sonic approach is the defining feature and very inherently limited.

I recommend listening to it while exhausted (like after a long day at the beach as the sun sets) or drunk as you go to sleep. Those were the first times it &quot;clicked&quot; for me...  *shrug*
I hate this album. I forced myself to listen to the entire thing. It&#39;s so boring and repetitive. It&#39;s also annoying. It&#39;s up beat. Not in a way that makes me actually feel up beat though, in a way that wears on my conscience and makes me feel annoyed. I&#39;d consider the phenomena surrounding this album is the placebo effect. I went to /mu/ (I know, shitty post pit). They said, listen to it repeatedly or you&#39;re a pleb. I think people convince themselves that in the layers of sound is good music.
You should write bios/presskits for bands. Sometimes I like listening to your reviews more than listening to the album you&#39;re reviewing itself.
Spying that Enemies List shirt, fuck yea
0:21 = Oh my god, Gilbert Godfrey took over Anthony&#39;s brain! Lol 
The Orwells - Remember When, you should review that
please review this next classics week watch?v=kYaRV6EwI3U
Great review of a great album...and I really dug the interface between style and cover!

Cocteau Twins - Heaven or Las Vegas
Yes, please do 
reverbnation . com / sunmonks
10/10 considering it&#39;s a classic
He doesn&#39;t rate on a lot of reviews, that&#39;s just asking for a shitfest in the comments with something like classics week.
good idea, yo.
maybe next classics week.
Slowdive is best shoegaze band ever hands down 
HEY. I&#39;m from Dublin and had no idea MBV were from there. Oh god.
but the review itslef is decent. tnd 4 life
feck that movement of making shoegaze popular...
the sp track obviosly is dissarm 
Belive it or not dinosaur jr and husker du were the main two influences on mbv, kevin is part of the reason why sugar released records on creation. 
My favorite album. I found myself in shoegaze
Classic week is awesome !
Do an Illmatic review!
What did he rate the LP?
Group X Arabian Rap Sensations: 40. Oz. Slushie
Fuck. He should&#39;ve done Closer by Joy Division :&#39;(
one of my 10 favorite albums ever its just so interesting and strange yet calming and familiar when you first listen the noise sort of bothers you and hurts your ears but eventually it becomes calming and sort of meditative also if you don&#39;t play loveless at a high volume you don&#39;t get the full effect
he did it last year too... he just doesn&#39;t review them at any other time
Talkie Walkie - Air

Ah, the first shoegaze album that I ever listened to.  Took me over a year to &quot;get it,&quot; but now it&#39;s one of my favorite albums ever.  The only &quot;problem&quot; with this album is that it takes the elements of shoegaze to such an extreme that almost everything else in the genre sounds watered down.  Comparatively, an album like Ride&#39;s &#39;Nowhere&#39; sounds more like the Stone Roses to me.
review The Pod by Ween.... just do it!
No mention of Ride and Slowdive?
What color are your Black One LP&#39;s?
I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts on The Pixies - Doolittle. 
F U N
Lol its an Enemies List t-shirt.
loveless is the goat
@Lietuvaitis2 I think all the classics are easy 10s
Review Bjork - Homogenic. Probably the most important electronic album of the 90s.
Review Souvlaki, please! One of the most classic shoegaze albums that isn&#39;t Loveless. 
Yeah when I listened to it with home theater speakers i heard drums too. They&#39;re of the boom boom boom variety though. 
Simon &amp; Garfunkel, Bridge Over Troubled Water
To my ears, this albums
when hes not wearign his glasses, anthony looks a lot like Cal Chuchesta. weird
Radiohead -Kid A Pleeeaaaassseee
lcd soundsystem-sound of silver
pavement-crooked rain, crooked rain
something by radiohead
Lush&#39;s Spooky.  That album is crack.
try a radiohead album next time for a classics review!
Loomer has drums on it. It&#39;s just like a super buried floor tom behind all the guitar ruckus 
Pinkerton is clearly the superior album ;)
Lovely ELHR shirt.
You are a recurring troll on this channel. But why?
And you should definitely review Blue by Weezer someday
Nowhere &gt; Loveless
I remember when I first bought the album at 15, and I thought it was really strange and was somewhat disappointed at first listen, because I suppose I had had preconceived ideas about what it would sound like, but after a while, it began to grow on me more and more, and now it&#39;s one of my favorite albums ever.
Love, love, love, loveless. Glad you agree. Got this record when I was still a kid.  I think the other bands you mentioned are all relevant connections as well.  I can remember riding my bike (45 mins) into the city to get a galaxie 500 cd before I could drive. 

What about reviewing a MBV like band? Perhaps the best knock off,  Ringo Deathstar? Not a new sound but they do it quite well.  Love to hear what you think.
early dEUS albums please
Luv the Black One in the BG.
It&#39;s not fun. shirt. 
Lets go Shoegazing.
Love it. Cant decide whether the opening track or sometimes is my favorite but i like how it all sortof seems to just mash together as one. :)
Do a review of that black album in the back with the wavy lines while wearing the rare and unique Mickey Mouse shirt of that album cover. :) JOY DIVISION RULES!
I pretty often get surprised by a melody a had not heard before in one of their songs... 
Review No Apology by Losin&#39; It!!!!!!! 
I listened to this album after seeing this review and loved it. I bought a copy of it the next day
FUN. O.o
I know you have already picked the albums for classic week but I hope one of them are any smiths record.
You are the master of sound description sir! Good one buddy
Smiths album pls
you obviously didn&#39;t watch his no guilty pleasures vid.
I love this album so much, I must have listened to it 100&#39;s of times, I know every detail , every noise, every texture on it, yet I don&#39;t the names of the songs apart from the stand outs. The album just melts together into one perfect whole. Although its not my favorite album of all time its the only one I can honestly say is perfect.  
He made a video about this a week ago. NO GUILTY PLEASURES!!!
I think your review of that would be really interesting.
If your doing the classics I put my vote in for Pet Sounds/Smile
&quot;classic&quot;
Awesome. Someone commented to review this album in the King Crimson review and now he&#39;s doing a review.
Review &quot;Fade&quot; by Yo la Tengo.
I hope you&#39;re joking
Good band. almost skipped this band, cause their name made me think they was going to be a crappy emo band.
I think it actually says &quot;No fun.&quot; - he&#39;s worn it in other videos.
Kevin Shields RULES!!!
So whats the rating?
It&#39;s HIS opinion.
lol, I saw him were it in another video. It says &quot;NO FUN.&quot; 
Please put a space after the artist in your video titles.
Shit album.
its a pretty good album
Twee Pop record for the next one?! :-)
yes, along with wire&#39;s pink flag and the stooges&#39; raw power.  All classics
is that joy division&#39;s unknown pleasures in the background?
Review Grief Pedigree by Ka or Reloaded by Roc Marciano
Nowadays shoegaze is the new &quot;cool&quot; and &#39;hype&quot; thing... and MBV&#39;s Loveless is so overrated..knowing these facts you should have reviewed Isn&#39;t Anything : first of all because it&#39;s so much better... and then because you would have been so fuckin FAIR doin&#39; this review.. Anthony think about it
Can you review Arc by Everything Everything?
I disagree, the greatest thing of all time is Russian Fudge

I think the lyrics are strong on the album but you cant make most of them out.That&#39;s one of the many things that makes this thing so intriguing.
the opening riff on only shallow is actually the greatest thing of all time
DUDE! Y U NO REVIEW THIEVES LIKE US :D
strokes..is this it..please
I hope you want to review the album: Kno-Death is Silent
Curious what you think of it! ;)
longliveasap. i thought it kinda sucked, but i would love to see your opinion
After classics week (and the Milo EPs review :P) track review Torres - Honey, its super sweet!
Pause @ 0:23 for an epic mouth bubble
seriously you should be more popular than you are, and I mean &quot;household name&quot;
you&#39;re a rocker all the wayz
review 7mary3 dewd
Their first album was actually really good.
please review igorrr&#39;s new album
Loveless is my favorite rock album.  To me the lack of conventional melodic structure, or focus, is an idea that, while formed in classical, was very lost in modern rock music.  The fact that it made its return in such an exploratory, yet largely conventional way is unparalleled in rock music before and after its release.  So often bands inspired by this album lose their footing on the sonic level and still try to create a regular song, i.e Beach House, M83, Smas Pumkins.  Loveless is its sound 
I&#39;m really hoping you&#39;ll review The Glow Pt 2 for classics week... I&#39;ve been waiting
Is this the second or third classics week? fourth?
Actually yeah, try You Made Me Realise ep
Do you hire Sunn O))) to play in the background sometimes?
Nah, M83 and Galaxie 500 are an acquired taste. Try listening to Tamaryn, The Waves or their second LP, Tender New Signs. Initially, shoegaze isn&#39;t something that&#39;s going to capture everyone&#39;s attention at first. I&#39;d also recommend listening to Ride&#39;s Nowhere, The Horror&#39;s Primary Colors, and LSD and the sound of god.
this album is so damn good cant wait for their new album that was supposedly finished on the 21st
I&#39;d like to see you review &quot;Boards of Canada&quot; some day. 

when the kite string pops?
slowdive
is it me or does Antony look even more cooler than usual?
Try some Galaxie 500 or even M83.
Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain anyone?

I for one can&#39;t get into this album.  Would anybody suggest another MBV album/ep or another band of this genre?
The shirt says NO FUN.  
are you going to compile all the classic week videos into its own playlist?
You&#39;ve absolutely gotta review Milo&#39;s Things That Happen At Day/Night double EP. It&#39;s definitely a step up from Baths.
This album changed my perception of music in the early nineties, and yes i had indeed ingested hallucinogenics. And when i saw them open for Dino Jr. way back then i thought they were having technical difficulties, but it was just their wall of sound. Nobody did that back then.
Come in Alone= sweet sweet release
Review Basic Channel - BCD1
I&#39;ve seen hundreds of bands live and these guys were the loudest - unbelievable in fact.

Will the new (3rd) album ever be released?
And OK Computer, please.
Was it Kevin that said Shoegaze is the sound of god sneezing?
How about a question/comment/thing on the role of drugs in the music industry?
Do Kid A!!!
I heard a couple songs from this album a few years ago. I thot it was fucking amazing. Then i forgot about.. Untell now, Yes.
Hallelujah! I&#39;m a Bum from Local H
NO FUN. NOT EVER
great review, btw.  classic album.
MAXIMILLIAN COLBY!!!!!!!!!!!
Siamese Dream.

Best album of the 90s hands fucking down
Mostly insomnia and a slowly deteriorating romantic relationship...
Most of it is not really relaxing unless you have the volume lower than the proper volume, which is LOUD; it&#39;s an amalgamation of many different emotions. It is meant to be an overwhelming sensory overload, and it&#39;s cathartic. If an alien were to ask me what it is like to be human, I would hand him this album.
You must know nothing about music. They deliberately abandoned traditional songwriting techniques in favor of an approach whose focal point was texture rather than structure.
Yeah, I tried talking about mbv with this 19-year-old who only listens to wussy folk bands, and he was like, &quot;Aren&#39;t they an emo band?&quot;
That would be Bullet for My Valentine. It&#39;s a shame really how a much more recent band overshadows MBV by their stupid screamo. 
review Grace by Jeff Buckley and for sure you&#39;ll be happy
First time in my motherfucking life hearing about this band, I DL the album yesterday being listening to it a lot. I LIKE IT!
Ladies and Gentlemen, We&#39;&#39;re Floating in Space
Isn&#39;t Anything is soooo much better. You Made Me Realize EP, too. They really lost their songwriting strengths come 1990...
The Glow Pt. 2. Please.
yes 
First, I always confused them with Bullet for my Valentine so never gave them a thought. Then, when I discovered these were two different bands, I gave them a try. Only Shallow blasted through my headphones when I was trying it the first time in my local library. I didn&#39;t understand it. &quot;What? What is this?&quot; Only after giving them listens after listens, i began to grasp it. I probably still don&#39;t love it as much as /mu/, you or pitchfork, I really like it :) I really do
@ArchuletaTributes I don&#39;t think it has anything to do with fun the band
@ArchuletaTributes I don&#39;t think
don&#39;t forget Ride - Nowhere
Loveless is by far the best album to put on during sex. 
But are you wearing a FUN. shirt?
If I can submit an album I produced last year for review, please drop me a message sir! Happy to send it over :)
love the long hair :3 
0:22
DAT SPIT BUBBLE
WOLF CITY
Listened to this one some months ago and didn&#39;t like it at all...
But I think I should give it another listen
At first I thought Cal had changed his shirt. 
one of the most important albums of my youth (and life), have the vinyl at home from the day it came out (showing my age!) do you not score the classics? cheers

MINOR THREAT DISCOG
I&#39;m not entirely sure why, but &quot;here we have reviews for breakfast&quot; *really* cracked me up.
Seeing them in March, can&#39;t wait!
probs my favorite classic album you could review :)
review Adorable - Fake
White people need to stop saying the &#39;n&#39; word.
NIGGA YOU LOOK MAYBE STONED.
trout mask replica, cmon. is it 2deep4u anthony????
Fuck yeah

I dig JMC but I dunno man, I don&#39;t know how psychocandy or darklands can match Loveless. 
Were the fuuuuck are your glasses!!!!
I knew it, he&#39;s a druggie
I love this album. It&#39;s one of my favorites. Thanks for the review. I think you should do Portishead&#39;s &quot;Dummy&quot;, next.
New genre: Fantanogaze. Quick! Someone mix a bunch of clips of Anthony singing and set it the sound of a woodchipper! GO!
I know u don&#39;t like pop music but do a review for Bruno Mars new album.
So Omar Rodriguez has droped 3 LPs in 2013.

Can you review Unicorn Skeleton Mask or Equinox?
I second SDRE&#39;s &quot;Diary&quot;. Uh maybe Portishead&#39;s &quot;Dummy&quot;
haha oh wow I didn&#39;t even think of it that way
as much as I love this album, I find Psychocandy to be a much more wholesome, influential, and personally better album. Are you a fan of the JMC?
KiD A?
trout mask replica
I should agree with you about the new album, and I shouldn&#39;t get my hopes up, but I can&#39;t help but hope that the new album is even more groundbreaking. Can&#39;t wait to find out!
Hey Anthony, you&#39;re probably itching to get back to regular reviews after all those vinyl videos, lists and classics, but I had an idea--What about a list of your top ten favorite album covers of all time? Album art can be a mission statement for a band to foreground what they want to accomplish in their music or to express themselves in a non-sonic way. I would love to know what your favorite album covers of all time are!
I like how @ 2:30 that pink smog shines through your glasses.
should&#39;ve mentioned a bit more about the vocals hollowing and confusing effect on the listener, and also how the new album will be nothing close to this good :P
This is easily my favorite album of the ones you&#39;ve chosen for classics week. Thanks for this review!
How about giving it up for some old school emo and review Jimmy Eat World &quot;Clarity&quot;?
BITCHES BREW!
In case you haven&#39;t made all your picks for Classics Week, it would mean the world to me if you reviewed something from Boards of Canada; I&#39;d like to hear your thoughts on Music Has The Right To Children or Geogaddi (or whatever you like.)

Think about it. Thanks for everything.
This is probably my favorite theneedledrop review of ALL TIME!
Sorry, I just figured it out now. It was Bullet For My Valentine. Oh well
In highschool I listened to them, they were a screamo band.
Warning (watching from a distance)


Classic... haven&#39;t played it yet.
this classics week reminds me of lil B&#39;s video game collection video. 
s&#39;a classic! Classic!
Slint-spiderland
Does he really NEED to do this review at this specific time?
Atmosphere- God Loves Ugly!!!!
CLASSIC REVIEW: Beastie Boys-Ill Communication
LOVE you fantano for reviewing this one.. its one of my all time favorites =&#39;)
Awesome Choice Fantano! Great album!

mine too did you know they finished mastering the album it was like the 21/12/12 or something sooo much waiting for them to release it and seeing them live ]:)
you silly bitch

Isn&#39;t that a screamo band??? 
You should actually review The Stone Roses.
GOD DAMN BITCHES BREW IS COMIN UP AWWWWW SHIT
blonde on blonde
Spiritualized - Ladies and Gentlemen We&#39;re Floating in Space
Definitely a classic shoegaze album, although I find myself slightly preferring Slowdive&#39;s Souvlaki, primary because of their softer ethereal melodies in comparison to MBV&#39;s heavy dissonant sounds.
Only ppl who ask that stupid question (No Offense) are the ppl who never listened to a Dream album

Just b/c he&#39;s under rated doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s not talented
the whole youre doing it wrong thing can be used for any band/album ha
I would love Spiderland to be done next. It&#39;s similar to Loveless in the way that it was a very influential release within its own genre. They&#39;re even released in the same year!
its made me cry. 

Tom Waits- Heart Attack and Vine. Finish off the week right!
Review Lil B Tears 4 God 
ok computer/kid a!!!!!
I was thinking of Bullets for my Valentine when i watched this and was thoroughly confused
My God I Love this album!!!
You should do a classic like once a week or something like that. I&#39;m still waiting for Ziggy Stardust
ANTHONY!! VEIL OF MAYA - ECLIPSE
Have you heard much Bardo Pond, Anthony? I think if you like MBV, you&#39;d probably like them too.
I&#39;m sorry, does anyone else think Nirvana is overrated?
shame the week is almost over. wish he did this more often
Yea bro you should review Iller Life by JK the Rapper so underrated you will really love it I KNOW
please review black sabbath&#39;s selftitled debut release or the wall/dark side of the moon by pink floyd.
DAMN that woodchipper!
my fave of all time! 
strokes is this it
If you don&#39;t like Loveless you haven&#39;t listened to it enough
I&#39;m going to try and get into this.  I&#39;m going to try...
Didn&#39;t it take something like four years to make this album.  Part of that sonic denseness comes from that amount of labor.  I always loved the low mix vocals treated like ever other instrument.  After years of listens it never gets old.   Always one I mention as a favorite.
u look so different without glasses
No Way! Go download his free project called &quot;1977&quot; you will love it! Real RnB
How in the world do you handle all these requests? All people do is make requests.
It would be nice if they would re-released this, over $125.00 for a used copy on discogs. :(
I have the remastered CD, with two versions (analogue and digital), I always wondered how it sounded on vinyl. 
Nirvana Nevermind? Could you review it one day? Even if you do it obe year from now. It&#39;s the best album in the history of music, relative to my tastes
I&#39;m glad your doing reviews of older albums.
I hope he didn&#39;t turn all electronic and gay like every other R&amp;B artist.
Sgt pepper lonely hearts club band.....tomorrow
Can&#39;t get into this album at all.
Anthony, you should review Skrillex&#39;s Leaving ep. tell us what you think of his half-decent Burial impression and if you like the new style.
That outro never gets old.
Sounds like beautiful static distortion. I think the opening track isn&#39;t as good of a representation of it as much as What You Want (my favorite track) or When You Sleep. 
Is there any specific reason why you don&#39;t give the albums a number rating during classics week? Is it safe to assume that all of the albums are an 8 or 9?
Review Sunny Day Real Estate&#39;s &quot;Diary.&quot;
Please review Kid A I love you 
You should review Jake Bugg&#39;s debut LP
...
and The Last Shadow Puppets&#39; &quot;The Age of the Understatement&quot;
Favorite album of all time.
My personal favourite album of all time, I&#39;m happy you did a video on it.
I remember the first time I heard this album, I was underwhelmed. I thought it was too ethereal &amp; repetitive, and yet, I kept coming back to it, trying to understand it. And then, it hit me like a brick. I literally got shivers. These aren&#39;t songs. They&#39;re moments, emotions, feelings, dreams &amp; memories. The vocals are so unintelligible &amp; the lyrics are so obscure because MBV wants you to fill in the blanks yourself with your own personal experiences. Well...at least that&#39;s just what I think. 
He was trolling. You&#39;ve ruined everything now...
blown a wish, forever.
Slowdive please! Chances of this may be small, I know, but &quot;Souvlaki&quot; is just as good as &quot;Loveless&quot; in my own opinion.
I watched this video. I learned interesting stuff. I am now happy.
Really?
I think you should review the new Toro Y Moi record and the new FIDLAR record.
Miles Davis Bitches Brew up next! 
I know it&#39;s a bit more modern choice, but why not Dalek&#39;s &quot;Absence&quot;?
Love IV drops March 2013! by The Dream, you have to promise me you do a album review on it! I would love you for that!
You should review Marshall Mathers LP. Total classic.
I bet The Wire&#39;s &quot;Pink Flag&quot; is comming up next, since Anthony menctioned it in several of his reviews and is is also showing on the screen in this one review
Would be pretty cool if you did a &#39;classic album&#39; review for Spacemen 3 :)
YES, the next review&#39;s gonna be miles davis&#39; BITCHES BREW! (I&#39;ve seen it on his last.fm) I love that album equally as much as I love loveless... or in the court of the crimson king... 
I wish you did these as a monthly segment or something, not only &quot;classics&quot; but great albums that we may have never heard of and, in your opinion, need too. 
Also I hope you do Spiderland...
Remain in Light would be awesome.
I really liked this album to be honest, It gives such an overwhelming saturated sound. If you would like to review more shoegazing material I highly suggest The Brian Jonestown Massacre; Methodrone album. Its a dark dichotomy of sounds. The guitars are incredibly anamorphic. and the vocals are faint yet crisp. 
I would be delighted to see you review them.
are you intentionally getting all of /mu/core out of the way for 2013
Radiohead - OK Computer or Kid A
Great record! Hope we&#39;ll see the follow up this year, although I guess it&#39;s probably not very likely.
he didnt even mention vacuums
I think Everything Everything&#39; upcoming album &#39;Arc&#39; would possibly make for an interesting review. It is release on the 14th of Jan in the uk, however I&#39;m not sure when in the US. Could you please consider reviewing this please?
It sucks.

I hope you enjoyed my review
@alexd765 The lonesome crowded west. That&#39;s a great shout
Daft Punk - Discovery
Jurassic 5 - Power In Numbers
Can you review new music please?
NEVER
The Internets Sleepiest Music Nerd.
Soundtracks for the blind would be wonderful to hear.

then there&#39;s BITCHES BREW!
aahh shitt
Loveless sound like neon coloured plastic.
asapppppppppppppppppp
how can something be &quot;really sort of&quot; anything????
Kevin Shields is just plain lazy and the lies that comes out about release dates is unforgivable..however,My Bloody Valentine were my fav band for along while,after Slowdive of course
Anthony, you haven&#39;t commented on a classic metal album yet.  How about Tool&#39;s √Ünima, or Sepultura&#39;s Roots?
Favorite album of all time.
Anthony Fantano Beard Controversy
one of the best albums ever made bruv
review some 90s Seattle stuff
that interpretation of the famous hazy album cover was incredibly on point
Weezer-PInkerton, that album has changed my, and many other lives and i want to hear your take on it

squarepusher - music is rotted one note!!
For me Loveless seems like more of an experiment than an actual album. It&#39;s the musical equivalent of abstract art. I listen to Loveless in a different way than most music, because it&#39;s like I&#39;m listening to an album of ideas rather than songs. Not that that&#39;s a bad thing, though. It had a lot of good ideas, and now other bands have taken those ideas and polished them. I don&#39;t agree with people who say it&#39;s &quot;THE BEST SHOEGAZE ALBUM OF ALL TIME!!!!!!!&quot; but that doesn&#39;t mean it wasn&#39;t important.
only like a couple songs on here, but this thing was revolutionary when it came out ill give it that
You should really grow your mustache out.
another album which makes efficient use of intentional noise is PSYCHOCANDY by Jesus and the Mary Chain
One of my favs!
electric warrior
milo-things that happen at day//things that happen at night EP
turn on the bright lights yo
i ssee tony fanta is afan of fun! the bets band review the band fun
REVIEW A BEATLES ALBUM!
You look sleepy. You should let Cal takeover for a few days. 
Yandere

Just for saying that hallowed LP-you get a free sub!

Pay Attention Anthony!
Didn&#39;t realize that Bullet For My Valentine was such an influential and important band.
you look very nice in this video, &#39;tano!
Personally, I thought Loop was better, more of a Krautrock feel to them than anything released by Spaceman 3 or MBV. I also prefer the darker more electronic sound of later shoegaze acts like Engineers, Lush or even stuff like Ulrich Schnauss or 65daysofstatic.

Still a good LP Anthony!
Today I met another needledrop for the first time ever (It&#39;s pretty rare since I live in Mexico). We talked Cal Chuchesta and our favorite jams. It was good.
Smashing Pumpkins - Siamese Dream
Talking Heads ‚Äì Remain in Light!
Miles Davis - Bitches Brew

After listening to this album for nearly a year, I still don&#39;t get it. Not once have I felt emotionally engaged towards it and find it quite overrated. Will someone please explain what is so great about this? Plus I really hope you review &quot;Funeral&quot; or &quot;Kid A.&quot;
You know I didn&#39;t want to admit it, but he did look good haha.
2 more!
god yes
Anthony looks pretty nice with and without his glasses. 
Kinda jealous. 
Anthony starting off the video without his glasses on, you know it&#39;s about to go down.
Same dude. 
Modest Mouse: Lonesome Crowded West
holy shit he pronunciates so well that youtube cc is actually accurate
HOLY SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT
10 vacuums outta 10
My Bloody Valentine. One of the few reasons I&#39;m proud to be from Ireland.
PSYCHOCANDY!!
I amazed he went the entire review without using the word &#39;texture&#39;
Do a Sunn album do a Sunn album do a Sunn album
How bout reviewing The Moon and antarctic - Modest Mouse
so pumped about this!
Ok Computer - Radiohead
One of my favorite albums of all time. The way that MBV can make every song sound, on the surface level, similar but at the same time, evoking distinctly different feelings from each is a great feat in itself. I could go on and on... 
Not a fan of this album. You&#39;re definitely right that the sounds can be beautiful/abrasive and generally amazing, but the songwriting itself is uninspiring and kinda boring; often I just want a song to end about halfway through so I can get onto the next track.  Those sounds just aren&#39;t enough to keep the album interesting for me, 3/10
not enough Malajube reviews, dog
Loveless? more like Loveful haha, cause I...love this album...huh-huh. I&#39;ll go now
do you have a favorite rolling stones album or are you more of the opinion that theyre a great singles band?  gonna return to loveless.  the beard is working.  congrats on 100k!!
Sunn record hanging out in the background. Just being chill
You can shoot 8mm film, not 9mm film. Shooting a 9mm means something else.

Review Let It Be or Tim by The Replacements

I would like to hear a Radiohead review

YESSS. THANK YOUUU
Burzum - Filosofem
spiderland 
Cool review. Request - The Chameleons - Script of the Bridge 
DAMMIT I WANTED A CALCHUCHESTA SHOEGAZE SONG!!!
I love breakfast reviews :)
oh, come on.. i made this joke last month and everyone called me stupid and you did and it got top comment. hahahahaha
While it isn&#39;t a review, I request you keep your facial hair about the way it was for the Dead Kennedys review. I do after all spend about ten minutes looking at your face every time you release a video.
Anthony, there appears to be some sort of dirt on you face. Strangely it seems to be principally focussed on your chin.
I listened to this earlier in my life and thought it was shit. I re listened to it and I dig it a little more.
Anthony may I ask you a question? WHY THE HELL WOULD YOU EVER WABT TO SKIN A CAT, ALBEIT MULTIPLE WAYS!! Loved the review tho
&quot;Because here, we have REVIEWS FOR BREAKFAST!!&quot;
I nearly died when I saw this video on my feed.
Great review! A lot of people tend to shy away from it because of the songwriting limitations, I know, but that makes the listening experience of music super one dimensional. Looking forward to the rest of classics week! It&#39;s been great so far.
OutKast - Aquemini
If you don&#39;t review &quot;The Soft Bulletin,&quot; I&#39;m gonna drown myself.
Thank You Anthony Fantano for reviewing this lovely classic
The first time I heard this album I thought a heard of elephants from hell was going to trample me into a peaceful death
Swans - Soundtracks For the Blind
why are you so tired i can&#39;t watch this
Way to review a classic! Idt you could have revealed any more of the better qualities of this album.

Pleeeeez review Toro y Moi&#39;s new lp, Jim James new lp, Foxygen&#39;s new lp, and Nosaj Thing&#39;s new lp pleez and thnx Fantanamo
He&#39;s missing the stache of a God
you know needledrop i don&#39;t wanna be a nuisance but please my man, pleaseeeee review Stankonia.
I KNEW IT WAS COMING
AS SOON AS I HEARD CLASSICS WEEK I KNEW IT
I was jus wonderin early this morning while watchin some of your reviews, if you had done a review for  this album and if not, why?
Thanks for reading my mind, we now share a telepathic bond .
I&#39;ll keep sending signals
Good day to you my friend .
My bloody CALentine
Whoa..9mm? I think you meant 8mm. One is for shooting imagery of people and the other is for shooting people, ya crazy person..! For pointing out this error, please do me a favor and review something besides Kid A. Thank you.
Bitches Brew is next, yeah?
&quot;What should I review next?&quot;
-Merriweather Post Pavillion
-Kid A
-Weezer Blue
-Dark Side of the Moon

:3
love it! 
been meaning to check out MBV&#39;s discography.
 White Light/White Heat or Merriweather Post Pavilion!
Husker Du - Zen Arcade!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You can buy me it if you want and give me in person please. better be vinyl though.
I wish the classics he reviewed were stuff I never heard of before. Like last year. I loved discovering GY!BE.
Hey, you&#39;re right! I kinda see it.
Nirvana-Nevermind
anthony looks like cal o.O
nicky menaj - pink friday
you should review Igorrr - Hallelujah
Weezer - Pinkerton 
Nice review, i love to play Come in Alone at max volume on my sound system. Neighbors surely love me.
Truly mind blowing. You remember where you were when you heard the first three seconds of Only Shallow...
dear anthony, can i buy you a copy of loveless and give it to you in person? kthnx
OMG OMG ANTHONY WITHOUT GLASSES

I always think of dinosaurs when I hear that song lol
You may never like it but for me it just clicked one day and then I listened them for about a year straight all the time. 
please let tommorw be Im Wide Awake, Its Morning
My Bloody Valentine is one of my favorite bands and if you like Loveless you need to check out some of their EPs... and their LP. They are amazeballs. 
Yeah, it&#39;s a classic masterpiece.
review a$ap rocky - longlivea$ap
Great stuff!
Astral Weeks!
Excellent Review! speaking of the smashing pumpkins...Mellon Collie~!
Spirit they&#39;re gone, Spirit they&#39;ve vanished.
BITCHES BREW
Do Merzbow - Pulse Demon
don&#39;t
Love this album! Great review!
Magical Mystery Tour?
it&#39;s funny how anthony has done most of basic /mu/core
It&#39;s amazing.
Hell, I would love you to do a &quot;Zen Arcade&quot; or &quot;New Day Rising&quot; review. 
WHAWWOUD YA SCORE IT?
On point with the album choices this week
me too. im from ireland too
If you love this album and want more modern shoegaze, definitely check out Whirr - Distressor. It&#39;s the best shoegaze album to have been released in the past few years that I&#39;ve heard (and I&#39;ve heard plenty, trust me.)
Now i love you.
Best. Album. Ever...David..from Ireland
best album of all time
LOL Raw review.
@Heber Guidi the sundays are amazing!
Great Review...Definetly one of my favorite albums of all time
This is greatest album of all time and that is coming from someone with YouTube name Radiohead Fan.
This album has always bored me.  Maybe it&#39;s 2deep4me, but IDK.  I&#39;ve tried to get into it, I feel like I appreciate what they did to inspire a lot of the bands that I&#39;ve found enjoyment from listening to, but the band and album itself I&#39;ve never been a fan of.
please review THE SUNDAYS!! one of my fav bands ever
I cannot like this video enough! &gt;: D
Great album. Review Deltron 3030 next!
Review every Merzbow album
haha &quot;you&#39;re doing it wrooong&quot;
the first and last songs on this album are simply incredible. 
He already said he&#39;s chosen the albums he is reviewing so no point in asking for him to review a certain album.  For my part Loveless was definitely an epiphany for me in the sense that I had never really heard guitars sound like they do on the album (also because Loveless was my introduction to the band, their debut album I got later). From the opening 3 seconds of Only Shallow I knew that shit was about to go down, and I was only too happy to be in the midst of it all.
As somebody who&#39;s been trying to explain to his friends that he likes Loveless for reasons other than &quot;HURR DURR I LIKE THE SOUNDS VACUUMS MAKE,&quot; Anthony, I just have to say thank you very much for making this video.
Doooolittle
No sir, I don&#39;t like it.
you might be looking for the nostalgia critic? he&#39;s kind of the film equivalent to the needle drop in terms of style
Fantano reviewed Loveless. Finally I can die in peace.
&quot;My Bloody Valentine is a cool band, have you heard of them?&quot;
&quot;Yeah, they&#39;re my favorite metal band!&quot;

Freakin&#39; high school...:(
You look a lot like Cal when you&#39;re not wearing your glasses.
at 1:52 I think it&#39;s just Cal blasting Earth in the other room.
review Interpol - Turn on the Bright Lights
Seeing them in March and it couldn&#39;t come sooner. HA Sooner. 
Great review!!! Love the album! Please review illmatic next! I don&#39;t think it is the best hip-hop album ever but what do you think?
Boris and other japanese artists are making a cover of the entire album. &quot;Yellow loveless&quot;.
postal service, pauls boutique, black sunday, holy wood in the shadow,..., transatlanticism,
That Sunn O))) vinyl in the background is taunting me...
Lone - Emerald Fantasy Tracks.

do eet.
Great review, somehow didn&#39;t expect you to review this for classics week so I&#39;m pleasantly surprised. Hoping you review Joy Division actually. 

First 2013 album you should review is Swallowed by the Ocean&#39;s Tide by Sulphur Aeon.
I must listen to this album, I love the cover, so damn much :&#39;) You should go back in time a bit, do a review of an album that changed everything: Highway 61 Revisited, Pet Sounds; those kinds of albums :)
nnnnnnnnnnnnnoooooooooooo

one of my favs ever &lt;3
Saw them in Seattle on their re-union tour. Probably the loudest and one of the best live shows I have ever seen. Ear plugs most definitely helped.
review igorrr - hallelujah
Its classic review week, he does it very year
&quot;what should I review next&quot;-Anthony Fantano 
Hates the band, but hasn&#39;t listened to their best album?
THe fuck is wrong wit chu son?
0:23 dat spit bubble. 
I would be happy if you would review such albums as: &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;, &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot;, &quot;1. Outside&quot;  or &quot;Intelligence and Sacrifice&quot; (i`m not giving the names of the bands on purpose &quot;P)
It took me a couple listens to love this album. I hear they&#39;re finished mastering their new album.
simply one of the best.
They haven&#39;t released anything since this in 1991.
Do Some Mars Volta.
DELOSUSED IN THE COMATORIUM plz
Do Kid A
One of the all time best albums 
Mars Volta - Frances The Mute
I&#39;m from Dublin woooooo
THANK YOU ANTHONY! NEW MBV 2013
have you ever heard the japancakes (instrumental) version of this entire album?  near your idea of an &quot;acoustic&quot; version of it, there&#39;s a lot of lap steel guitar and a much cleaner &quot;sound&quot; but it also lets a lot of the hidden melody/etc come through - worth checking
Ride&#39;s Nowhere is even better
My second-favorite album ever!!! Thank you!

Slint - Spiderland, what else.
I don&#39;t worship the ground that loveless walks on, but I do like and can see why its held in such high regard. I love the sound of the album, but like you said, the songwriting isn&#39;t the most adventurous and that stops me from loving the album. Glad you mentioned &quot;Sometimes&quot;, that&#39;s my favourite.
I Love it. I won&#39;t even comment on the sounds of the tracks; that&#39;s been done a trillion times over the last 22 years. First of all, It&#39;s an engineering and production marvel born of the late 80&#39;s and early 90&#39;s. Second of all, The chords and progressions are immensely clever and well done. 
/mu/ is creaming right now
Bet you the next will review either be Kid A or OK Computer, given how Anthony&#39;s been talking about /mu/core albums this entire time.
There&#39;s going to be a Japanese tribute to this album that includes Boris covering &quot;Sometimes.&quot; Google Yellow Loveless.
Sonic Youth - Dirty.
My browser defaulted to 240p for some reason, so when I saw Anthony without glasses, I thought it was some elaborate filming technique to mirror his vision &amp; the &quot;blurry&quot; quality of the music. Damn you coincidence, damn you. 
you probably mean bullet for my valentine

and yes, they are terrible
Give it time to sink in.... it needs plenty of time... like cooking duck
Once you&#39;re done with classics week, plz review the new Milo EP&#39;s: Things that happen at day / Things that happen at night
must.go.listen
Wow. This sounds nothing like wat ive heard of their music. So they used to be a good band then? Bc everything i heard of them is 2000- and is terrible
Get some good speakers or headphones
Blood sugar sex magik
My personal favorite album of all time. Never gets old. Can&#39;t wait for the new release 
I hate this band so much, but is this album really that good? I might check it out
TOM VEK - WE HAVE SOUND
eagerly still waiting for the vinyl reprint !
My jaw dropped when I saw this video on my news feed. This band single-handedly altered how I listen to music, and your description was excellent. 
Cheers, Mr. Fantano!
COT DAMN FANTANO GET SOME WATER SON
please do a highly praised album that you dislike.
Talk Talk - Laughing Stock

please!!!!
#classic
Yess! Loveless!
Is that Darkthrone in the background?
Autechre - Confield or Boards of Canada - Geogaddi
What do I think of Loveless?? FUCKING INCREDIBLE!
What a great great album!
Medicine did it just as well!!! If you like this album pick up Medicines first 3 LPs!!!! Brad Laner is a Genius!!
i was really excited about seeing this on my homepage but the &#39;wevyoos 4 bwekfastshsh&#39; face made me want to watch porn instead...
Sees fit to wear Enemies List t-shirt when reviewing shoegaze ;).
Do Soundtracks for the Blind
Dude Stone Roses....... do it...... do it.
whats the album on the right?
REVIEW THE UNSEEN BY QUASIMOTO 
review Faith No More&#39;s Angel Dust, smart guy
I seriously doubt any bands shoot their music videos on 9mm, Anthony...
Your losing weight Anthony. Good Job.
same, when this record clicked it was one of the best feelings I&#39;ve had listening to music.
There is always next year...
I agree. Review something controversial for god sake !
You have had Unknown Pleasures at the top too long. Stop teasing.
1:51
Its a vacuum.
You have to do Trout Mask Replica!
FUCK THIS ALBUM
thank yoooooouuu! ‚ô•
The greatest things in life, from music to movies, books to hobbies, aren&#39;t necessarily meant for EVERYONE. To be special and unique is to stand alone and I find that which tries to make everybody happy tends to make very few impressed. &quot;Loveless&quot; sure as hell isn&#39;t for everyone and I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way. #1 favorite album.
this record opened up a whole new world for me.
CAL MIXTAPE IS READY FOR RELEASE
pinkerton-weezer!
He listen to Cal stuff earlier today. Confirmed as next video.
Movies for the blind , fantastic damage
Any Aphex Twin album, btw. Preferably the two mentioned (SAW 85-92 and Drukqs). Yes, both of them, because they are just that awesome.
I probably wasn&#39;t paying attention when you mentioned this, but...

I&#39;ve noticed that you no longer put the rating in the description 
Thumbs up for sexy stubble!
SO MUCH /MU/CORE!!!
Also, if you are ever so inclined to return the classics of shoegaze again, it&#39;d be great to hear your thoughts on Souvlaki.
Can - Tago Mago do it
good shit
