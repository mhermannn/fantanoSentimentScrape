At first everything is intriguing and you can‚Äôt get a grip on it and you say I need to listen to this more. Then you listen and like it more but say why are the vocals so low and why did they do that. Then you either accept it as it is as perfect or discard it and you may have discarded it in any of the previous stages.,2
