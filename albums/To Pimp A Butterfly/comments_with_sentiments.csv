Like I‚Äôm in some snobby museum and everyone is praising this silly painting with themes that have been done to death and a style that is interesting but not really enjoyable and I‚Äôm by myself confused. People call it the greatest album of all time.  All.  Time. I guess I‚Äôll just need to be a minority. It boggles my mind some people hate the Beatles so I guess I understand those folks a little better now.,2
