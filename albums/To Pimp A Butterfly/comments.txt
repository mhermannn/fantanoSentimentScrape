The only songs i know by Kendrick Lamar are:<br>1.  Bad blood with taylor swift<br>2.  Don&#39;t wanna know with Adam Levine and his band maroon 5
if this album was called &quot;to pimp a butterfly&quot; by denzel curry you wouldve given it a light 8
i wanted to see what the hype was all about for tpab so ill react to it ig
If it was called To Pimp a TPAB you would‚Äôve given it a 10
I tried listening to TPAB for the first time as gentle background music. while doing a postgrad psych essay in 2015. Huge mistake
If it was called ‚ÄúTo Pimp A To Pimp A Butterfly‚Äù you would‚Äôve given it a 10
If this album was called &quot;to pimp a to pimp a butterfly butterfly&quot; you would have given it a 10
Can‚Äôt believe melon sang the beginning to Wesley‚Äôs theory
this album is horrible, overrated is an understatement
brat better
Here after 10/10 BRAT lesgoo
I can hear the Sexyy Red influence in TPAB
It still baffles me how Lil Xan ghostwrote this whole album.
Keem went crazy while writing this
i could not for the life of me tolerate this stupid fucking album for more than 15 minutes
It&#39;s crazy that he called Kendrick&#39;s flow &#39;uppity&#39; on kunta
Love the palpable excitement in this review, encapsulates many of my feelings so well.
I‚Äôm new to this comment section and the trolling is killing me ü§£ü§£ü§£
This album makes me seriously wonder if I‚Äôm of this planet. The praise it gets for being so mediocre amazes me. Like I‚Äôm in some snobby museum and everyone is praising this silly painting with themes that have been done to death and a style that is interesting but not really enjoyable and I‚Äôm by myself confused. People call it the greatest album of all time.  All.  Time. I guess I‚Äôll just need to be a minority. It boggles my mind some people hate the Beatles so I guess I understand those folks a little better now.
just finished listening to this album. <br><br>man, its beautiful. i am glad i did.
I gave this album a try after all the hype. Not for me. 2/10
I can‚Äôt believe baby keen ghost wrote all of his albums as a child
If this album was called &quot;to pimp a TPAB&quot; you would&#39;ve given him a 20/10
Dude, congrats on 7 million views, this number is absolutely insane for a record review (or any review at all)
Nah bro YouTube knew what exactly they are doing. Why are they recommending this nowüíÄ
‚ÄúYou just rapping like an activist its make belief. You don‚Äôt even go back to your hood and plant Money Trees.‚Äù
J Cole is right about this album.
melon looks happy<br>was good day 9 yrs ago
At first listen i gave this a 85 then bumped it to 88 to 93 to 95 to finally 99, i finally understand this magnificent work of art, amazing stuff.
Yes but drake
inspirational how yeat influenced this album and most of kendrick&#39;s sound
If this album was called &quot;Icedancer&quot; you would have given it a 10.
i just finished listening to this album<br>while i may not have a perfect first impression, i liked a number of tracks from this lp<br>it may take a while for me to love this album but i can see why this lp is considered amazing
actually spot-on wit his opinion on what kendrick was feeling when making this masterpiece
Well‚Ä¶.thats like‚Ä¶your‚Ä¶opinion man‚Ä¶<br>DAMN was way better IMO. It felt focused on logging one for real hip hop‚Ä¶.<br><br>TPAB was for black culture, and white hipsters apparently. I give this one like an 8.5.<br><br>DAMN felt like ‚Äúdamn‚Ä¶..Obama didn‚Äôt do shit‚Ä¶now look where we are‚Ä¶wtf else we got‚Ä¶well:..we got hip hop‚Ä¶and who am I? The Best Rapper of all time‚Ä¶bitch‚Äù<br><br>Damn. &amp; GKMC are just about equal IMO<br><br>Both are 9.5, if not  10. <br><br>I just hope he gives us another.üîú <br><br>After Drake,ü•© <br><br>I would love to see him ride this GOAT wave and become 2pac level legendary
Legendary album
Yeah, so I listen to this album and this review at least once a year. In honor of the (at this time, 2024) Drake/Kendrick rap battle, I&#39;m here again. Thank you Anthony, thank you Kendrick, see ya soon.
does fantano rock the same yellow flannel since 2015??? like... the same one.... not one that he bought again and again
If it was called To Pimp a To Pimp a Butterfly you would like it more
We are going to war with AM.
I want this to be my last comment that I leave before my laptop switches over to the new YouTube interface where the shorts replace this comment section and the comment section is relegated to a tiny corner of the screen. Muthaphukkin YouTube policies amiright?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>heh heh &quot;I&#39;m kendrick llama, baaaa&quot;
heard u for the first time at like 4 AM and it was absolutely harrowing. kdot is incredible at selling a performance.
You can really see how lil pump is a big influence for Kendrick on this album
Who&#39;s here after Tpab?
just cause you didn&#39;t like it, fantano, doesnt mean that you should make a 22 minute video just calling him slurs
Good to go back and revisit Kendrick‚Äôs prequel to his new ep ‚ÄúTo Catch a Predator‚Äù
What a masterpiece of a review.
If this album was called &quot;To Pimp Kids&quot; you would&#39;ve given it a 10.<br><br>wait.......
this was 9 years ago bro.. what????!!!!!!!
Now this is a review
Came back to this and 9 years later and just how excited fantano is to review this. Thanks for being you!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=856">14:16</a> woah dude, not cool
baby keem not being credited for writing practically the whole album is a crime, glad bbl drizzy brought light to this
Mr Fantano; do you age? It‚Äôs 2024 and you look the same
Finally a good opinion on an Eminem album
my man didn&#39;t even mention how much a dollar cost?
I bet if Drake made TPAB you would‚Äôve given it a 3
I can&#39;t believe Baby Keem ghostwrote this album
Beef is weird, watching all these old videos SMH
I would LOVE to see the view count on this video during the drake beef
These videos are good! What a great capsule of times past! Such depth, breadth, scope. Though when have you listened to someone, admittedly as prestigious, such as this man, enough?! When have you just learned enough to explore?!
its 4am<br><br>imgointobed
real
Every time I stream Mortal Man, I add John Cage‚Äôs 4‚Äô33‚Äù to the queue right after, to let myself sit in silence and let that third PAC sit. I don‚Äôt want to hear anything after that for sometime. Any album or song that makes you want to do that is a masterpiece.
Drake better
the real big three: Kendrick, Earl, JiD
i&#39;m gonna feel a certain way next year when this album is 10 years old
crazy how baby keem wrote this album at the ripe age of 14
a drake feature did you say?
I wonder if he went to bed at 4 AM
It&#39;s 9 May 2024, and I&#39;m watching this after the big diss weekend, which Kendrick Lamar won and Drake tried, but that&#39;s all he tried.
HykeezyHD wrote this albumüôè
Artists like logic who helped with this album really shaped the way we view rap thank you so much.
I probably come back to this review 2-4 times a year just to experience how amazing this review and the album itself is.
If this album was called ‚ÄúTo Pimp A Butterfly‚Äù you would‚Äôve given it a‚Ä¶ oh wait it is
Boy this is such an amazing album, I‚Äôm sure drake and Kendrick will be friends for the years to come!
&quot;u&quot; second half is gold tbh
Gay woke album
This is my favorite fantano review ever my favorite part was when he got emotional thinking about the album and started singing the intro to wesleys theory
If it was called to pimp a butterfly you would have given it a 10
Also it used to be called &quot;To pimp a catterpillar&quot; which, when you abreviate it, create... TPAC
if it was called ‚ÄúTo Pimp A Butterfly‚Äù he would‚Äôve given it a 10
This is why Yuno Miles is the GOAT...bro never got the recognition for writing the whole album
i love how the one thing that could have brought this album down from a 10 is if kendrick didnt change &quot;i&quot; to a live recording and kept the studio version
if this album was called Hood&#39;s Hottest Butterfly you would&#39;ve given it an 8
Bro what are these comments
You&#39;re so biased Anthony. I bet you would have given this an 8/10 if it was called Mr Butterfly and the Big Pimps
9 years later I&#39;ve finally come to the conclusion that its a 9 or 10. Year after year i would say its good but kind of overrated but for some reason the album sounds near perfect all of a sudden. I&#39;ve been really enjoying it alot recently and more than ever before. Melon was right to give this a perfect score. Its a serious classic.
Hood politics have never been more relevant with everyone wanting blood spilling over a beef with a cornball like drake
This video aged like a fine wine. Cheers
Just finished this album, my lord is it good. I dont think its as replayable as some other albums, but artistically, this might be the best album ive listened to
See, I liked this album review of good kid, m.A.A.d city, but why would you give it a 9? Obviously it deserves a 10.
How much a dollar cost blew me away on first listen. Pure poetry.
W
Great video but you didnt have to call kendrick the N word at the end just because he made a bad album
Just cause fantano wasn&#39;t in the album, giving it a not reviewable is just unjustifiable
i bump this when i have trouble sleeping
When Kendrick said ‚Äúmy coochie pink my bootie hole brown‚Äù I really felt that
&quot;LEAST FAV TRACK: I GUESS YOU AIN&#39;T GOTTA LIE&quot; how is this mf always wrong even when hes right
one of the biggest shockers for me about this album i only found out a whole 9 years later is that centre back virgil van dijk was a huge inspiration for kendrick when making it
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=162">2:42</a> not you calling Rapsody a ‚Äúfemcee‚Äù<br>It‚Äôs like saying femboy. Please don‚Äôt people
Ppl arguing about jake hole and kendick lameare but none of them can make a classic like PlayGOD Carti. Just think about it, Carti invented MUSIC. Without MUSIC there is no hiphop and no kendick or jake hole. Carti made generational masterpieces that saved lives. If you play Carti music anywhere =happy everyone. If you play kendick or jake hole you are turning a party to a funeral. 2024 is not even released yet and it changed lives. Jake Hole hasn&#39;t been relevant since 2014 and Kendrick since 2015.
It‚Äôs insane that Fantano reviewed the album and then went on to spoil Avengers: Endgame at the end for absolutely no reason.
Lmao mad Kendrick fans are hilarious üòÇüòÇüòÇ good lyrics but the songs are so boring. Idc how many angry virgin Kendrick fans wanna talk shit.
If it a was called &quot;to pimp a to pimp a butterfly&quot; you would have given it a 110.
8 mins in, 2nd time watching this video. I have to stop it to go play all of TPAB. The itch is there, I gotta hear every song and interlude. Brb.
If this album was called ‚ÄúTo Pimp A Vulture‚Äù you would‚Äôve said it was unreviewable
@kendricklamar
Best album of all time that j cole fans think is boring‚Ä¶ go listen to every j cole album and find nothing of value üíÄüíÄ
J cole is out of his mindüòπ
The album that put J Cole to sleep<br><br>Edit: he took it back üòá
Boring .
Melon was hating on TPAB before it was popular I see
He said &quot;They gassed it&quot; üòÇ LOL
This album deserves a 10!!!! Y&#39;all are tripping fr...
BENCHMARK. The best way to describe TPAB. Nothing before it or after it has hit those same highs musically or substantively. A dense album packed with so much flare that it feels alive, every listen I find new riffs or notes that I missed on one of my other hundreds of times I‚Äôd listened to the album. A masterclass of music making and a true piece of history that became a form of protest during marches against police brutality. Forever a 10/10
dreamy creamy neo soul
If kendrick got a boner you would&#39;ve given it a 10
If this song where called to pimp a sexyy red you would have given it an 11
I love the Nav feature on this album
ive got a bone to pick
Only Melonoma could give this a 3
i wish the comments weren‚Äôt all trolls i listened to this album fully for the first time and was utterly mesmerised by the scope and execution of it, i used to hear the memes about him giving this album a 10 but after listening i completely understood. well deserved
why did you lie
I hate how short content and shitty music caused Anthony to not go as into depth with his reviews
Just because Kendrick made a album, doesn&#39;t mean you have to rate it Anthony
The devil mad Kendrick speaking the truth. Shalom!
Zip it up when your done please
Repeating ¬´¬†TPAB TPAB TPAB¬†¬ª for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=138">2:18</a> minutes and then edging furiously for 20 minutes isn‚Äôt a proper music review, Melon.
If this album was called To Pimp A Butterfly you would‚Äôve gave it a 10
biejo jijo
Can‚Äôt believe kanye gave kendrick the butterfly to pimp out no wonder he‚Äôs so influential !!
if it was called to pimp a kids see ghosts
this is where the glazing began
the 3 types of comments on fantano videos: <br>1. I agree/disagree with your score. I love music! <br><br>2. don&#39;t forget he gave mbdtf a 6. üò°<br><br>3. you are homophobic sexist and racist
if it was called &quot;to pimp a butterfly 2 (still pimpin)&quot; he would&#39;ve given it a 20
this shit is so beautiful
If it was called To Pimp a Butterfly you would have given it a 10
It&#39;s okay at best. This guy&#39;s biased.
&quot;That track won a few Grammys, which showed Kendrick&#39;s pop appeal&quot; says a lot.
Am I the only person who hates rap music?? Reading these comments really shows how genuinely dumb people are out there... You wonder why you&#39;re poor and your life is a mess but yet you call artists like Kendrick Lamar amazing?!? Maybe it&#39;s time you started to realize rap music for what it is, TRASH!! And to be fair, there is a lot of garbage music of all genres out there. But rap music is especially horrible. There are many people who will grow out of rap music at some point in their lives and there are many who will not. I am especially confused by people like the creator of this video who are white and yet they know everything about rap music even when rap music commonly disrespects white people! There are some very confused white people out there who enjoy music that disrespects their entire ethnicity and culture. So many black people act like Tupac is a God and worship his words like he was the most amazing black person to ever live!! What a joke!! So many black people act like rap music is something to be proud of and something that defines their culture... I saw a police interrogation of a young black man who I think was 18 years old and was being questioned for the murder of a police officer, which he later admitted to. He had 2 parents who were allowed to be in the interrogation room with him and the police. His parents loved him and I got the feeling that they had tried hard to raise him right. The young man apparently was involved with gang activity and his parents probably didn&#39;t even know. The young man made the choice to engage in gang activity all by himself and it took him to prison. People of all races need to understand what kind of impact music can have on us. What possible positive impact could rap music have on us as human beings?? What could rap ever do to make this world a better place?? No one could ever convince me that rap and inner city violence are not related! Rap<br>music glorifies violence in a countless number of ways. There is no other genre of music quite like rap that has the most disgusting and violent lyrics you have ever heard. Yet millions and millions of Americans, white, black, asian, hispanic, etc all listen intently. Most inner city youths couldn&#39;t tell you 5 elements on the periodic table but I guarantee you that they can sing the entire Kendrick Lamar album from start to finish. It simply goes to show you that people who love rap are not necessarily stupid, they choose to engage in certain activities all on their own. Life is SO SHORT!! Don&#39;t waste your time listening to rap music, or any music that is negative!! Be a positive person!! Engage your mind in your school work, learn math and science!! Learn how to dance! Learn how to fish! Ride a dirt bike! Do things that make you uncomfortable. If something makes you uncomfortable, that is a clear sign that you should do it!! Life is too short to waste!!
If this album was called big butterfly it would have gotten a 0
Greatest album<a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/person-turquoise-crowd-surf"></a>
If it was called ‚ÄúBUTTERFLIES 1‚Äù he would‚Äôve given it an unreviewable/10
If his name was Kendrick Carson melon would give it a zero
Come on Anthony, deducting 3 points just because you can‚Äôt sing along with the intro to Wesley‚Äôs Theory was a bit harsh.
so happy macklemore got a grammy for this album
MEN HOE CAN YOU CONSIDER YOU ANIT GOTTA LIE LIKE THE L√âAST FAVORITE, well its your opini√≥n but DAMN
if it were named my beautiful dark twisted butterfly youd give it a 6
You would have given this a 10 if it was called ‚ÄúTo Pimp A Vulture‚Äù
&quot;waaah white people&quot; ahh album
carti&#39;s verse goes hard ngl
It‚Äôs cool to see that lil mabu had such a huge influence on this record
...2024
9.2/10 still absurdly good, but tracks like You Aint Gotta Lie, Momma and For Sale really brought it  down from like a 9.8 - 10/10
insane how this is still one of the best hiphop albums ever if not the best
first of all, jesus fucking shit 8 years ago and also its 3 am hes going to bed
:)
Kendrick doesn&#39;t make trendy music,    trendy music is made from Kendrick
I‚Äôd like to see Ben Shapiro read the lyrics to ‚ÄúThe Blacker the Berry‚Äù
I just realized that the song ‚ÄúComplexion‚Äù isn‚Äôt one of his favs.
this album is a 10/10 i have nothing more to say, masterpiece
id say light 6
thus the meat riding began
It&#39;s crazy how he made this album right after he made graduation. Truly a legend.
Still don‚Äôt understand the praise this album gets. Imo not one of the best albums of the 2010s. Like a 7/10 for me at most
i really hate this album, but its cuzz i dont like funk or jazz or whatever it is
WAP has to be my favorite song off this album
Why u glazin
if the album was called To Pimp A Butterfly, u would&#39;ve given it a 10.
clout
I should give it a 11/10
if it was called ‚Äúto pimp a butterfly‚Äù, you would‚Äôve given it a 10
This review is as good as the album
anthony, i fucking love your videos. you are the reason i leaned into music much more. im stocked to see more legendary reviews! im so fucking sorry for those liars fucking you up. fuck them frfr. love Meni &lt;3
P
I love this review, it must be super validating to get it so right before the album becomes the classic that it is. Almost makes up for MBDTF, almost.
call me to pimp a butterfly and put that big 10 on me bb
‚ú®BAM ‚ú®
can someone timestamp when he gives the rating because i do NOT wanna listen to this egghead yap
Yo bro didn‚Äôt mention how much a dollor cost once?
If this album was called to pimp a butterfly then you would‚Äôve given it a 10
This is by far his most truest hyped up intros
You gave Sexyy red an 8 but THIS a 10?
You can really see how yuno miles influenced a great deal on this project and really helped Kendrick come into his own on this one
Can someone explain me why the album is considered to be one of the greatest of all time. I listened to it and honestly it was good but there are many prjects that i value more. From the production standpoint it was very good but it wasn&#39;t new, there were many jazz influenced albums before TPAB like the low end theory. I think kendricks storytelling on songs like How much a dollar realy cost or the passion in u were great but the level of reflection in this album doesnt qualify it to be considered the best oat. Im sure that if someone like kanye said &quot;Sht dont change untill you get up and wash you ass[...]&quot; Fantano would say its childlish and horrible, but since Kendrick said it he obviously meant the self responsibility. WOW INCREDIBLE. When Kanye said &quot;You left your fridge open somebody just took a sandwich&quot; it was the same level of childliness and same level of reflection. Its realy not genious to say someone that he needs to be self responisble in that kind of bald way. Kanye also meant that if you will play nice somebody will take advantage of it but no one is saying that TLOP is the best album oat. I think TPAB is 8/10 but it shouldnt be in the goat debate with albums like Ilminatic, MBDTF, Misseducation of Lauryn HIll etc.
RODEO clears this trash album
Did y‚Äôall know that Tom McDonald has writing credits on every single track on this masterpiece? Wonderful
If the album was called &quot;To Pimp A Butterfly&quot; you would&#39;ve given it a 10
u know it&#39;s gonna be a classic when even cal is hyping up the review
I very specifically knew where I was when I heard this album for the first time. I had just been shown GKMC and had not heard this album was coming out, but I saw it while I was working at Best Buy so me and the guy who showed me GKMC listened to it during a workshift.<br><br>Everyone that came back in the warehouse was like &#39;Damn, that&#39;s some good music.&quot;
Younger me would say this was a good album but only listen to Alright and King Kunta, listening back now as im older, it really is fantastic and i can appreciate more songs now Like These Walls, TBTB, and How Much A Dollar Cost
This album is overrated
As a metalhead who rarely goes out of his way to listen to other stuff, I decided to finally give Kendrick Lamar a try. I listened to Section.80 and GKMC, and I‚Äôm upset that I‚Äôve been missing out on this art. Kendrick has an amazing ability to write compelling and in depth stories in his lyrics and flows while not giving up awesome instrumentals and just overall catchy music. It‚Äôs artists like this that make me wanna venture off into more hip hop music. I‚Äôm onto TPAB and I‚Äôm so interested in how it‚Äôs supposed to top his previous 2, since I just cannot stop listening to them.<br><br>EDIT: TPAB is one of the best albums ever
Drake ghost wrote half this album smhü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
it sucks
its bad
its ok
i just edged to this!
Jesus Anthony just because Kendrick gave you the n-word pass doesn‚Äôt mean you have to give this a 10
Ok Computer is a 10 as well
I just found this dude and I know his opinions are trash, but wow thinking to pimp a butterfly is good just confirms it.
&quot;Just because you are a diferent gang color than mines, doesn&#39;t mean i can respect you as a black men&quot;<br><br>Fantano
If this album was called To Pimp A Butterfly you wouldve- Oh wait
you can tell how much fun he had making this review.
If this album was called to pimp a butterfly you would have given it a ten
Idk why people love this album so much, I mean it‚Äôs not trash, I actually like some aspects of it, but it‚Äôs mostly just noise and fillers
heavily inspired by slim jesus thats what makes this album so great kendrick took notes from this great artist im still waiting for a feature
This album made me bust out laughing on multiple occasions. 10/10
Can you review brave little abacus
Elite level glazing
This was the first album I ever pre-ordered. It was very worth it.
1/10 i was trolling the first time but i actually dislike most of the songs here
this would&#39;ve been a 6 if it was called my beautiful dark twisted butterfly
crazy how stupid he looks in the thumbnail
if you liked this album, try out Merzbow - Pulse Demon
gkmc is better
why does he do an elmo laugh at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=21">0:21</a>
U could tell this was getting a 10 with just the introüòÇ
If this was called To Pimp A Butterfly it would‚Äôve gotten a 10/10.
cmon fantano you cant just give this album a 10 because its a 10
Am I the only one that didn‚Äôt really like this album???
When Anthony Fantano reviews an album he loves with so much passion, it‚Äôs truly amazing
Bring back goofy mustache guy.
‚ÄúEvery Nigga is a star!‚Äù
This is his favorite album
An actual correct Fabiano review???? üò±üò±üò±
MY FAVORITE ALBUM BY KENDRICK.  ONE OF THE FEW HIP HOP ALBUMS THAT PIERCED MY SPIRIT!!!!
He K(onnects) the Dot(s)
Anthony<br>Fantano
Wesleys theory song of the decade
Peak fantano
wish this guy was my teacher
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1170">19:30</a> &quot;if the music under your music is garbage, your message is garbage&quot; a lesson none of the post modern artists in museums learned.
this review gives me chills
&quot;While this record does have a few bones to pick&quot;<br>&quot;I GOT A BONE TO PICK&quot;
BEST ALBUM EVER üî•üî•üî•üî• ITS SO GOOD
This is Melon at his peak, showing his excitement &amp; love for this album. How he dissects every song is pure greatness.
why did he say all this racist stuff
wonder why complexion isn‚Äôt on the fav tracks list
was really disappointed not to hear a Tom Macdonald feature on that, still a decent album i guess...
It‚Äôs cool to see how lil pump who influenced Kendrick Lamar who went on to make this album
To this day, I still haven&#39;t heard anything quite like this album. This is complete mastery of art with an incredibly compelling message. Blew me away
I bet if Kendrick called this album &quot;To Pimp A Butterfly&quot; you would&#39;ve given it a 10/10!
Can‚Äôt believe you gave MBDTF a 10/10,  but also gave TPAB a light 6?
Friend made me listen to some Kendrick songs, really liked the lyrics but I can&#39;t stand his voice to be honest (Please don&#39;t doxx me ladies and gentlemen)
I can&#39;t describe how much I love this album
4/10
O melhor album da hist√≥ria da humanidade
How did he know I was gonna rewatch this at 4 am??
Unbelievable album and just as good of a review.
Please review &quot;The New World&quot; by Swindle. It has a full album-length music video on YT with a handful of views - THIS ALBUM IS CRIMINALLY UNDER-RATED. Quality, jazzy, UK hip-hop/R&amp;B (the music videos are top-notch also). The producer (Swindle) has worked with tons of British rappers over the years and this is his magnum opus. Think of it like Mark Ronson&#39;s Version performed by Sons of Kemet, except everything is original. Features include Kojey Radical, Loyle Carner, Ghetts, Maverick Sabre, Joel Culpepper and Akala. I absolutely love it and I think Melon would too. Peace ‚úå‚úå
You would of given it a 11/10 if it was made by Kendrick Lamar‚Ä¶ smh
The only problem I‚Äôve had with it is that I can‚Äôt listen to it without listening to the whole thing. It‚Äôs too good.
Someone told me about &quot;blacker the berry&quot; i was impressed, then listened to the album and every song is the same<br> &quot;rAcim üò≠&quot; <br> &quot;whyt ppl ü§¨&quot;<br><br>For 1hr+ üòÇ
Gringo is a little too excited in that thumbnail
And the album is still here, and still very relevant
BLACK
i gave that shit a 6/10
going back to this review just to feel something
If the album was called &quot;To Pimp a Butterfly&quot; you wouldve given it a 10<br><br><br><br>original comment üòµüòµüòµ
Danm Kendrick really stole lil pumps whole style ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I‚Äôm not much of a rap fan, but after listening to this album in it‚Äôs whole, after the ending poem I just had an imense feeling of ‚Äúthat‚Äôs all?‚Äù.<br> I genuinely felt like a 1h14‚Äô album was too short. I remember ripping on f.e. Metallica like living hell itself with their 1h+ long Load/St Anger bloatfests.<br>He really has a way of telling stories or conveying narratives in his music. The Blacker the Berry, How Much a Dollar Cost and Complexion(Zulu Love) were highlights for me in this aspect. <br>But then again I‚Äôm a simpleton who likes catchy simple songs so King Kunta was my favourite overall.
Christ is coming say your prayers and repent or suffer for eternity ! üôè be safe
I feel like there‚Äôs been a recent upsurge of really dumb discourse surrounding this album. I just wanna say lyricism, storytelling, meaning outside this is one of the best sounding albums I‚Äôve ever listened to and I play songs like these walls complexion king kunta and alright all the time. An hour and eighteen minutes of incredible jazz that could stand on its own. The vocals and lyricsm is just a cherry on top that pushes it into legendary status. His most replayable album to me don‚Äôt care what anyone else says
Wow, Anthony. Just wow. If this album was ‚ÄúTo Pimp a Butterfly‚Äù, you would have given it a 10.
this is the worst music reviewer of all time. one time he was asked what he thought of flea when he said flea was a great bassist and one of the best out there. 1 month later when a fan is hating on flea in the comments he completely jumps to his defence and argues that flea is overrated.   His bias towards other bands and artist is just not something you should have as a music reviewer. Have your opinion but be consistent with it!
easily a light 2 what do you mean
Most overrated piece of shit i have ever heard, fake woke midrick
Personally this album was for black people, so I wouldn‚Äôt expect other races to relate nor rate what they think of it.
8 years ago!? I remember this review like it was yesterday.
hard to believe this album is already 17 years old
He gave it a 10, now go back to your homework
BBLLLAAAACCCCKKK hippy label.
the quintessential review
i feel like the people who dislike this album are trying way too hard to be contrarians. even if for some reason you dont like the album that much, you still gotta admit that theres some really good shit on there and that the album in general is great
I think a simple thumbs up or down would have been fine!
8 years later and this album is still the most overrated peice of garbage.
Easiest 0 conceivable and that&#39;s 0 cap. Horrible album, very annoying, pretentious and ultimately shallow lyrics despite their posturing. Lame instrumentals unlike his last album and the delivery here is beyond wack especially when he says KING KUNTA, that song alone earns this a 0, one of the worst songs I&#39;ve EVER had the displeasure of hearing. Really nothing to like here, much less love, that Corey Feldman album is 10x better as a so bad its good album AND as an album straight up.
SHUT UP BLACKIEü§ëüó£Ô∏èüî•

If kendrick was white, fantano would&#39;ve given this record a 20/10.
The playboi Carti influence in this album is crazy this album is great but Kendrick will never top die lit and whole lotta red those two albums are some of the most beautiful and influential records of all time. Carti inspired many artists like Kanye,Kendrick, and even Beethoven and carti has also inspired many other musicians and people to chase their dreams and to never give up. Carti is one of the best musicians of all time he might even be the best he is the most influential artists of our generation even with his style and the creation of the opium record label which is the best record label of all time with members including Ken Carson,Destroy Lonely, andHomixde Gang which are all each really talented. Playboi carti is my idol and my inspiration I will forever love carti he is my king
1989 better
surprised I haven‚Äôt seen a comment about this, so I‚Äôll make one<br><br>Kendrick was stuck between ‚ÄúTPaB‚Äù (To Pimp a Butterfly) &amp; ‚ÄúTuPaC‚Äù (Tu Pimp a Caterpillar) <br>long story, look it up, i dont got all the answers
This album was my first real introduction to rap and hip hop, and it‚Äôs an absolute masterpiece. I wanted to go back and see what people thought about it near release.
Gotta give Nav props for ghost writing this peak work of art. üôè
Albums ight
This album has some good stuff like the impeccable production and Kendrick&#39;s constantly changing flows, but his lyrics are a quite overrated. For all of the self-love and consciousness, there is a lot of cringey shit like Lamar rapping about his dick for a whole song, deluded preaching about sky gods, n-words at nauseam, tired internal conflicts about good and evil, and fucking hoes and bitches (always big with religious folks). Socially conscious music for strip clubs. It ain&#39;t no illmatic, black on both sides, or low end theory.
Just want to say this album isn&#39;t good because of the lyrics or deep meaning. It&#39;s good because it simply is good musically. Production, flow, hooks, verses, jazz inspired instrumentals. Lyrics and topics are just added bonuses that push it beyond the boundary
I still haven‚Äôt listened to this‚Ä¶I‚Äôm 43 and after I heard gkmc I wanted to whit while ahead‚Ä¶
The music on this album is just trash. Don&#39;t deserve this high score at all even with the (actually) good lyricism. <br>Hard to listen (except some songs). Change my mind
Chicken noddle soup

Someone want to send this to the Swiftie who said 1989 was better than TPAB?
Great album, Macklemore deserves another Grammy for this

This album is not enjoyable in any way ü§∑üèªüòÖ if I want to get educated i will read books why i would listen to some boring rap record with black ass bullshit and someone criticize it called racist playing safe and victim that&#39;s what midrick Lamar is üõå<br>I like how much a dollar cost though üòÖ
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1210">20:10</a> he says 2010
Kendrick Lamar&#39;s 2015 album, &quot;To Pimp a Butterfly,&quot; is a powerful and complex work of art that explores themes of racism, oppression, and identity. The album is a reflection of Lamar&#39;s personal experiences growing up in Compton, as well as a commentary on the state of black America.<br><br>One of the most striking aspects of the album is its use of jazz and funk influences. The use of live instrumentation and jazz samples gives the album a raw and organic sound, which is a stark contrast to the polished and synthetic sound of much of mainstream hip-hop. This sound is particularly effective in conveying the emotional weight of the album&#39;s themes, as well as creating a sense of urgency and immediacy.<br><br>The album&#39;s lyrics are also incredibly powerful, with Lamar using vivid and poetic language to explore the complexities of his own identity and the experiences of black Americans. He addresses issues such as police brutality, inequality, and the struggle for self-acceptance and self-love. Lamar&#39;s lyrics are often deeply personal, with many songs drawing on his own experiences growing up in Compton.<br><br>One of the most notable tracks on the album is &quot;Alright,&quot; which has become something of an anthem for the Black Lives Matter movement. The song&#39;s chorus, &quot;We gon&#39; be alright,&quot; has become a rallying cry for those fighting against police brutality and systemic racism. The song is a powerful statement of hope and resilience in the face of oppression, and has become an important symbol of resistance for many.<br><br>Another notable aspect of the album is its use of spoken word poetry and interludes. These interludes serve to break up the album into distinct sections, and provide a commentary on the themes and ideas explored in the songs. They also serve to give the album a sense of narrative coherence, with each song building on the themes and ideas presented in the previous ones.<br><br>Overall, &quot;To Pimp a Butterfly&quot; is a powerful and important work of art that explores the complexities of black identity and the struggle against racism and oppression. The album&#39;s use of jazz influences, powerful lyrics, and spoken word interludes all contribute to its emotional weight and artistic significance. It is a testament to Lamar&#39;s skill as a songwriter and his commitment to using his art to make a positive impact on the world.
Playboi Carti really doesn&#39;t get enough credit for ghostwriting TPAB
This album is so bad and weird. Get over yourself Kendrick. You‚Äôre not Moses
Melon you wouldve given it a 0 if it was The Big pimp a butterfly day
now i know the reason
Lil B ghostwriting this album is actually kinda hard <br><br>TYBG
Lil pump really is that guy
I find it fascinating how criminally underrated To Pimp A Butterfly honestly, it doesnt have enough love
I‚Äôm convinced Fantano fans haven‚Äôt even listened to this but will die on the hill that this is the best rap album of all time
well
well
Why do I like watching this review so much
.
8 years ‚ù§
Happy 8th birthday TPAB
I have never seen a man speak so passionately about a record in my life. And I looked at myself and had a lifetime of words of praise to say about KID A by Radiohead.
After 7 years of listening to this album I can fully say that this is indeed a Kendrick Lamar album
Lil xan ghost writer for this album fr
Due to inflation this score is now a 12.47
I really don&#39;t get the 10 review on this album. I thought it was noisy, all over the place, not catchy. Everything Kendrick said went over my head and if he said anything genius I didn&#39;t catch it. There were too many n bombs for my ears as well. I just don&#39;t get it. I would give it a 3. Feels like an album you have to like because it&#39;s Kendrick Lamar and it&#39;s PC

I litteraly got this album because of this review, crazy because i don&#39;t even know anything about hip hop/ rap, i guess i&#39;m not far off
i just realized fantano signaled 10 with his hand at the beginning of the video

It is an album that has had a profound impact on the Black community, and it is an album that will continue to inspire for many years to come.
This album is so overrated
Had to stop video half way through , had to listen to the album again
I remember when I first listened to this album it was everything to me from 2015 to early 2017 but as time progresses I feel that S.80, GKMC &amp; DAMN just have way more replay value. <br><br>I feel really bad for saying this because TPAB is such a masterpiece but I just don&#39;t enjoy it as much as the rest. Lyrically it&#39;s his best work but musically his 4th best album.
10/10
easily one of my favorite albums of all time, from one of the best to ever do it
im a white 26 year old male (not a good place to be right now) but the only rapper id ever er listened to before this album was Eminem. critic reviews made me listen to this album and honestly I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a batter hip hip album ive heard
Magnolia
you ain‚Äôt gotta lie as least fav
Only 10 given by Fantano?
To pimp a butterfly
Definitely in my top ten albums of all time. Kendrick fucking blew my mind...
After listenning to TPAB for the 3rd time,<br>I declare, Nothing, not one rap album, I listened to can top off TPAB, 20/10<br>Best rap album of all time.
Virgo world and whole lotta red are better than this album
You could see how excited he was to review the album at the beginning üòÇ
play boy carti better
Not a fan of how Kendrick combines jazz on this record. It cancels the other sounds out and it sounds stale
Massive D rider
A reference to his grandmother?! Damn, Jordan Peterson really is the Kendrick of philosophers.
When Anthony listens to this album he comes fast but he never gets embarrassed
im not really understanding how this album is derivative of logic&#39;s supermarket, but whatever, its your opinion.
This is in my opinion the best album I&#39;ve ever heard. I was so deeply moved by this album, and Kendrick does a fantastic job in the song &quot;u&quot;.
This is one of my favourite albums, can‚Äôt wait to listen to it for the first time!
Rate my music
Greatest album of all time.
anthony fantano is such a soyjack
I come back to this review all the time. One of the best reviews ever of one of the best albums ever.
Amazing album, but where are THE TRAP INFLUENCED BANGERS????????<br>0/10 unsubscribed
i keep coming back to this review, it&#39;s so rare to see melon so passionate about a record, his joy is incredibly infectious.<br><br>the comments on this video are hilarious, too.
Half of these songs are some of my favorite Kendrick has done, half are some of my least favorite, but as a whole album it‚Äôs excellent
Glad to see melons opinion on hopsin has changed.
guys kendrick is really skiping the music cuz you cant really enjoy lisenning to some tracks
Kendrick is the prophet of rap. No more questions.
Man half the shit you say here is bullshit
On top of everything else fantastic about this album, this whole thing is a jam. King Kunta is one of my favourite songs of all time
The part where he admits to having the whole ghost album ghost written by lil xan was kinda crazy, but other than that I thought it was a great album.
Onion head
Amazing video Anthony! This really shows your passion and care you put into each video with solid points and critiques. Even when I disagree with some of your opinions, you tell compelling arguments that help me understand why you think that way. But if possible, try limiting the usage of the N-word every minute and I don&#39;t understand why half of the video is zoomed in to my house. Threatening to kidnap my family because I refuse to buy your Ridge wallets is really out of pocket too. And at the end, harassing Kendrick for not making a better project than Lil Xan&#39;s Total Zanarchy when TPAB came out in 2015 and Total Zanarchy in 2018 is both very unnecessary and odd. Overall this review is like MBDTF, a 6, I hope you see my comment and use this to better your contentüê¨

it&#39;s crazy how he was speaking about the album as if he was the first to sing its praises. it&#39;s a pillar of the time. everyone sees it as one of the best albums to ever exist now.
I wonder if Kendrick saw this?
This album proves that XXXTentacion had much more of an influence on the genre that anyone knew at the time.
no one has introduced me to kendrick. i‚Äôve never dove into his music, but hearing about this album has me excited to give it a listen. thank you
The fact that Kendrick rapped an entire album penned by Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young in 1865 and made it a 10/10 is slept on.

You can clearly see the influence carti had on this album
Screw the haters below me. This album remains a classic forever. Fck em haters only listen to mid shit like Drake or Cardi B but this album is up there with Kid A and Sgt. Pepper
U gave MBTDF so i give Tpab and Good Kid Mad City both a 6/10
gave this trash a 10, can‚Äôt take you serious
Kendrick made you
This is a certified hood classic
This album definitely has songs in my opinion
This is an album
bro my English teacher is gonna go over how much a dollar cost in our English class soon that&#39;s crazy that Kendrick&#39;s songs are gonna get taught
It&#39;s crazy how Nav influenced Kendrick on this album
Kendrick is so good at writing pomes. Omg he is so talented and good at everything.
Kendrick has a gun to his head behind the camera
This is the most satisfying review I&#39;ve ever seen you do.
i will comment on this video too now<br><br>ahahahahahahahhaha<br><br>ahaahhahaa<br><br>review the new zootey album its called &quot;pop star&quot;
All produced by the soss boy himself üíúüíúüíúüíú Pierre bourne üèÅüèÅüèÅ
OK FINE ANTHONY I WILL LISTEN TO THE ALBUM TO PIMP A BUTTERFLY ü¶ã
As a foreigner it is really hard to follow/understand so it&#39;s the album which I am the least invested in from his discography. Maybe should take the time to listen through it with lyrics opend
Best album of 2015, and best album of the 2010 decade
It&#39;s a fantastic album but overrated
tbh this album is boring
ALBUM REVIEW OF EXOCIETY DECEPTION FALLS AND KILL BILL SNOWGLOBE THEORY.
Smh you would‚Äôve given it a 10 if he was white.
I like the bit in Institutionalised, where he&#39;s at these BET awards  he&#39;s invited his homies from Compton along but he hears that they are thinking of robbing the execs of their rolexes and jewelry. Hence his grandma&#39;s refrain &quot;shit don&#39;t change until you wipe your ass&quot;, meaning you&#39;ve got to leave some parts of your upbringing behind to make progress. This leads to Kendrick feeling alienated from his home, family and friends.
Worst Kendrick album
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=758">12:38</a> I&#39;m not typing that into my search bar...
Most overrated album oat

sition
If this was DAMN he would have given it a 7/10 smh
I was in the studio with Kendrick when he made this
crazy dat medulla swanky goblin
My favorite Kendrick album easily
Kendrick and jcole both suck lmao
GREAT ALBUM
He seemed so much happier to review music in his old reviews
It&#39;s 4am
For sale is the greatest piece of music Ever written.
Mortal man could‚Äôve been easily  a song on mr morale
When he said anthony fantano in the intro i dont think ive seen him so happy
Love the influences that Chance The Rapper&#39;s The Big Day had on this record
&quot;it would be a 10, but he&#39;s black so it&#39;s a light 6&quot;<br>why are you like this
Idk how i feel about this review now that i know youre sitting
I love how he does his thumbnails üòÇ
When you realize that the &quot;HES BEEN SITTING THIS WHOLE TIME&quot; is just a genius/easy way to get people to rewatch your videos...
First review I&#39;m watching since finding out hes been sitting and I gotta say, that it feels like an hidden easter egg that no one has ever thought to fnd for about 5+ years
This whole review has changed in my eyes now that I know he&#39;s sitting the whole time
Hits different knowing he is sitting
CANT BELIEVE HE HAS BEEN SITTING ALL THIS TIME
This album is so overrated it‚Äôs hilarious. üòÇ
can i get the drake guy to reply to this
This album is the best hip-hop record, and this is the best hip-hop review
Yeah, I think blacker the berry might be the best song of the 2010s
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1160">19:20</a>
The people who were introduced to Anthony through this video were probably really confused by the transition at the end
&quot;u&quot; makes me cry every time I listen
Melon gave TPAB a 10/10, but 10‚ûó10 = 1, so he technically gave it a 1.
What&#39;s the review with no Fantano, just sound effects?
Everyone goes at Drake for using ghostwriters yet each song on this album has at least 5 writers some even 10. So the lyrics you spent hours digesting that you think were about Kendrick were written by someone else lmao. <br><br>Fraud. Nav &gt; Kendrick. Get this goofy out of here and bring real hip-hop back.
He looks so proud
Honestly Nevermind &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
Today i was on standing on the train, listening to this album and i noticed that there was a black guy standing behind me.<br>I wanted to show him that i‚Äôm not racist and am in fact all for black rights, so i opened spotify, put brightness on max and held my phone up (discretely) so he could see me jamming it to the üêê
you&#39;re such a hipster fantano lmao. good review tho.
Hey Fantano, I think you listened to Drake‚Äôs new album on accident when writing this review.
This album changed things forever
It turns out that Kodak Black actually produced and ghost wrote all of this album. It makes more sense now.
It hurts to see 2015 was 7 years ago what the fuck

It‚Äôs culture to come back to this video.
Great to see the influence I had on kendrick when he made that album
I kinda like MM&amp;TBS more than TPAB man.
i disagree
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=734">12:14</a>
Interesting how you brought up how you can&#39;t skimp on the music underneath the message now that MMATBS came out because that seems to be the main difference in how people are looking at that album vs TPAB. TPAB was still more important and better but the critiques are similar. I still like GKMC more but can&#39;t hate at all on a 10 for this album, it&#39;s a legendary work
sorry but i dont understand. how you make the album covers appear on the back. i dont. i mean, green screen? but there is no green spill and the reflection on your glass matches the covers. wtf
I had already heard some songs on this album but I never actually payed any attention to the music or understood any of the concepts, messages that were on it. 3 months ago I spent some days listening to TPAB and after realising what I had missed the first time I listened to it I was shocked.
Man I wish Nipsey woulda be on this album. Just seems like he&#39;d fit on hood politics, but this album is legendary.  Classic
Fantano‚Äôs magnum opus
If fantano didn‚Äôt give this a ten he would‚Äôve lacked credibility for the rest of his career
bro its raining rn and its so cold.<br>also im drinking some juice
With the new most replayed feauture we can see people just go in end to see the score
I feel like this is what I was expecting with Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers. Anyone else?
How‚Äôd you go through this whole review and not mention ‚ÄúHow much a Dollar Cost‚Äù that song is incredible
It‚Äôs commonly known but I don‚Äôt see it commented yet. The original title name was ‚Äúto pimp a caterpillar‚Äù:<br><br>2 (to)<br>P (pimp)<br>A (a)<br>C (caterpillar)
Still my favorite review by Melonio
Giving this album a 10 because he says the n-word a lot isn‚Äôt good reason Anthony :(
At what point in his career or life really will Kendrick realise that this was his true masterpiece as opposed to DAMN, which he listed as his best album.
momma too good
Whose back waiting for the Mr Morale review?
Rumour has it NAV ghostwrote this ish
So melon you heard this album, and thought it only deserved a 10?  In 5 years you&#39;ll give it the 10 it deserves.
this is a certified hood classic
This is the TPAB of album reviews
not carti 2/10
Ugh‚Ä¶ you said ‚Äúfemcee‚Äù.
Who else is waiting for his review on Mr Morale and the Big Steppers to come out?
Here after kendrick need album.
New album deserves 5/10 at most
Just hear before he gives the big steppers another 10
Idk how there&#39;s other comments saying his new album is going to get a 5/10, its on par with tpab with storytelling, it&#39;s going to get at least an 8
Came back to this review after listening to Kendrick&#39;s new album, crazy that these are the same two artists. I&#39;m predicting a 5/10 from fantano.
New album 5/10, calling it now.
Anthony saying &quot;This dick ain&#39;t freeeee&quot; impacted me as much as the album itself.
watching this review before the new 10/10
I heard this guy grew up listening to Yeat, Carti, and Thugger and shaped his music off of them. This is clearly reflected in the lyricism and suburb storytelling in this project, which is supposedly inspired by Whole Lotta Red. Great to see those three inspiring a new wave!
&#39;&#39;its not a story album&#39;&#39; , melon a sentence later &#39;&#39;I feel like I&#39;m watching (blabber) a really elaborate stage show&#39;&#39;
pretty groovy
After a while of this being released I think we can all agree Kendrick is just another carti copycat
Midrick Mumblar
You can tell that Kendrick and MGK were collabing throughout this whole record.
If any artist other than Kendrick talked to a dead dude, Anthony would call him crazyü§£
you know, i think to pimp a butterfly is a pretty good album
MR MORALE NOT GOOD
Mr. Morale gon be the first not good kendrick album
Mr. Morale gon be the next 10
Who‚Äôs here after the Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers‚Äô announcement?
This might be the most 10 ever
MR MORALE 11/10
I love this album and good kid MAAD city. And I do think TPAB is a better album because of its tribute to hip hop and music as a whole and the twist at the end with pac. But I personally prefer MAAD city because it‚Äôs is a beautiful story. When listening to it I feel like I‚Äôm watching a movie. I also felt like it was easier for me to follow. That‚Äôs just why I PERSONALLY thinks it‚Äôs better than TPAB. But from a musical perspective, TPAB has done so much more to music as a whole
Still better than tpab
üëç
You can really see Tom MacDonald‚Äôs influence on the political nature and intricate messages of this album
ANTHONY ASSTANO PLEASE PLEASE PEPLASE
racist
How did he not get the point that the whole point of &quot;lucy&quot; was lucifer trying to deceive him?? one of the biggest points in the album
Drop your predictions on what the score will be for Kendricks upcoming album üëá
what a terrible album
KENDRICK MAY 13TH
This would be recommended to me a half hour after Kendrick announced his next album. Hoping for another journey!
Dj khaled better
This album aged well. It is just as terrible in 2022 as it was in 2015
low rap knowledge
both GKMC and TPAB are light 9s for me
wait what Boris Gardner Song ?
It‚Äôs 4am, I‚Äôm going to bed
It&#39;s 4am, he&#39;s going to bed
ive always liked that when i close my eyes to a kendrick song, especially Good Kid, I can see the music in my mind like a movie
You can see how much Nav has influenced this album its truly remarkable.
Kendrick&#39;s so great that his music and lyrics brought back 2Pac to life
Relistened to this album after rereading the Autobiography of Malcom X, and it opens up so much that evaded me on my first few listens. Seriously, read the book (incredible book on its own) and then listen to the album again, you‚Äôll find that there are way more layers than you might‚Äôve originally thought
mmmmm 2004 called they want their bald loser back btw i can make better review than u
hey fantano the track ‚ÄúUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.‚Ä¶...I GUESS<br>YOU AIN&#39;T GOTTA LIE....IF | HAD TO PICK ONE‚Äùwasn‚Äôt that bad
I still think DAMN is his magnum opus. Tpab grew over time with me. Musically it wasn&#39;t like a hip hop album. And content wise he seemed more spoken word at times than rapping. It doesn&#39;t take away from its artistic message or merit but as far as it being better lyrically than his other albums I don&#39;t see it. I still rank it behind gkmc and damn as a solid 3rd above his mixtapes which are also v good.
Can we agree this is becoming a youtube classic?
Random person: hey what rhymes with damn<br>Melon: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg">00:00</a>
this album sucks
Memes and praise to Kendrick aside, this video is a perfect example of Anthony‚Äôs excellent criticism. The articulation of his points and the way he summarises the album really gives a reason for Anthony‚Äôs success. Still subscribed.
Kendrick Lamar obviously lives rent free in the mind of his haters in these comments. üò≠ <br>10/10 imo
More like the most overrated album of the decade
can anyone explain the structure of this album to me? it feels more like a play / extended skit. there are not very many distinct songs with verses and beats, it‚Äôs more free flowing. <br><br>For example, an Eminem or jay-z album will have like 16 songs with distinct beats and verses; this Kendrick album is completely different <br><br>I don‚Äôt understand the structure. Can anyone shed light?
Logic has a way with words speaking about his inspiration, Kendrick Lamar
Exactly 7 years ago damn
Overrated 10 in my opinion I‚Äôll give it a 7.5
7 years.......
happy 7th birthday to my man ¬®To Pimp A Butterfly¬® u are the best &lt;3
Loudly repeating &quot;this d*ck ain&#39;t free&quot; over and over for 22 minutes isn&#39;t a review, melon.
in my recommended on the 7 year anniversary
I&#39;ve seen this review at least 5 times
This album is cute and all, but I really wish Kendrick would stop biting Nav‚Äôs flow. I mean its ok to be original once in a while
Kendrick Lamar subscription not detected, opinion accepted ‚úÖ
TPAB &gt; DAMN
[lyrics]<br>It&#39;s 4 A.M.<br>I&#39;m going to bed.<br>It&#39;s 4 A.M.<br>I&#39;m going to bed.<br>It&#39;s 4 A.M.<br>I&#39;m going to bed.
Love his view on Kendrick and Kendrick is obviously one of the GOATS but damn he dick rides him to the point where he won‚Äôt even give other artists a chance‚Ä¶that are actually good at rap. No radio shit. Love that he appreciate Kendrick, but damn he can‚Äôt be the standard because that‚Äôs not fair. WhTever, I‚Äôm not even making sense poopoo pee pee
Hot take:<br><br>Sorry For Party Rocking &gt;&gt;&gt;
I listened to this album on shuffle and it sucked
you can really hear the Yeat influence on this album. I love hearing how his art inspires others!
It&#39;s amazing to see Lil Pump&#39;s influence on this album, I mean, he almost got named dropped in the title itself! Beautiful to see their relationship aid in the blooming of such a wonderful flower of an album, lost in a sea of dying weeds.
Kendrick Lamid peaked with gkmc and section.80 two amazing albums that for me encapsulate kendricks best work. This album always felt a bit all over the place and Damn. was just bland for me.
Kendrick Lamar is trash. If this album sounds like sh1t, its because your iq is too high to enjoy this hipster garbage ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
If you are a true hip-hop fan, check out the playlist I made on my channel. Kendrick Lamar more like Kendrick Mumblar cuz he is a mumble rapper. He is no better than Young Thug
he called &quot;i&quot; a trendy instrumental when released as a single then said the album had no trendy instrumentals (&quot;i&quot; is literally included in the album)
wrd
yeat&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;...
I hate the fact that Playboi Carti ghostwrote the whole thing AND NO ONE‚ÄôS TALKING ABOUT IT
This album is legitimately making me question my own tastes in music. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about the album, and it‚Äôs absolutely mind blowing on both a technical and thematic level. It‚Äôs perfect but also has flaws. It‚Äôs too long, but it‚Äôs also feels brief. It‚Äôs too all over the place but tonally consistent and tied up very well. Perhaps im just going insane trying to justify why I think it deserves a 10/10, because I expected it to be a 10/10 and wasn‚Äôt greeted with a definitive one.<br><br>While Good Kid, Maad City is a movie, To Pimp A Butterfly is a poem. A cry for help for guidance from the older rappers. He gets advice from Tupac who can comment on the political issues that haven‚Äôt really changed since the 1990s. In fact, a lot of his words about the attitudes of the public are even more prophetic in light of the last few years. <br><br>But the second poem, where it is very clearly about Kendrick and how he is trying to spread his wings but is being rejected by those who are angry at the world, Kendrick can‚Äôt get help because Kendrick really is on his own, only with the advice from a man who left before his story could play out. The swelling of the instrumental at the end as Kendrick realizes that Tupac is no longer there and it‚Äôs abrupt end feels like waking up from a nightmare. Like Kendrick wakes up from this 80 minute long epiphany knowing exactly what he is, but not what he will be.<br><br>I don‚Äôt know. That‚Äôs my interpretation anyway. This album is a 10/10.
This album was ass and needle drop is bias as shit
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1">0:01</a> Bam Hey Everyone
‚ÄúThese issues aren‚Äôt just black and white‚Äù<br><br>Maybe that‚Äôs the reason for the grey album cover??
Shoutout thundercat
To Pimp A Butterfly is so sick
Kendrick is one of the reasons I started listening to rap music again after fev years of detaching myself from it. And this album helped me in many ways find lacking self confidence and sense of self worth. If so many people can connect with ones music on emotional lvl - it truly speaks for itself
It‚Äôs 4am. I‚Äôm going to bed.
Somewhere in the multiverse he gave it a NOT GOOD
i HATE THIS ALBUM!!!
This was such a nice album loved each song i&#39;ll give it a strong 7 to a light 8
&quot;He knows everything&quot; - Your mom&quot;
You only gave it a strong 10 because it&#39;s a masterpeice
White people love to fake love this album because of their white guilt
If an orgasm was a music review‚Ä¶
These walls ties into sing about me from gkmc. I listened to his album for years before noticing. The I was tripping on a tab one night and for whatever reason I just love listening to that song when on lsd and it finally clicked and now it has become my favorite kendrick song of all time. A masterpiece
At the very end of the record, when Kendrick is asking ‚ÄúPAC? PAC?‚Äù It broke me
Just coming by to pay respects to this masterpiece
0/10.
Just listened to it for the first time. It felt like discovering a new fucking primary color for me.
Well Done, Fantano. Well Done.
Good god I hate your jarring editing
<b>kendrick not releasing in twenty twenty ohnooooes</b>
all that and you didn‚Äôt even mention the best track on the record üòî
For Sale? is SOO good. been my favorite kendrick song since i first learned of it in 2016.
Woah. I mean, I&#39;d heard that Fantano really likes this album, but he begins the review <b>smiling?</b> Insane.
*weezer blue album
overrated album. 7/10 at best
So why was the Boo Boo song so good?  I literally don&#39;t get why that song was fire.
Probably only 10 I agree with Anthony on, along with to be kind
I love this album :)
Still can&#39;t believe this project even happened. How did he do this...
10.
This album is old enough to deserve a classic review. Its just as epic as Songs in the Key of Life
You can really hear the influence of death grips in this album.
It was 4:00 am.<br>He went to bed.
I listened to the album, hes overrated. his lyrics are okay but overall eminems better
It&#39;s so cool to see how Playboi Carti/King vamp inspired this album, if you really listen to the album you can hear the similarities to Whole Lotta Red, this album is lyrically almost as great as WLR! I love this album definately a 4/10
if kendrick was black you would have given this a 10
Funny that at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1090">18:10</a> Fantano says PRIDE, and after that a reverse of self-afrirmation. This review is from 2015, but in 2017 DAMN. dropped and in there&#39;s the song PRIDE. In this also Kendrick uses reverse raps and beats in many songs. So Fantano using a reverse after mentioning PRIDE, and PRIDE being one of the songs on DAMN, the album with a lot of reverse, is quite funny to notice.
nope melon disagreed,its a 10/10
cal chuchesta album review brought me here
Amazing album
Not my personal favourite of all time but without a doubt the best album of all time in my mind
Can&#39;t believe Corey Feldman inspired Kendrick on this one, legend.
finally listened to it carefully
I would give even 20 out of 10 lol to this record . An incredible record , still stream it everyday . Great review by Anthony as well .
Anthony‚Äôs pants were wet when filming.
He gives this a 10 yet mbdtf gets a 6 and revival gets a 2. Let that sink in.
I avoided listening to this album for several years, which probably sounds strange, but it is because everyone who knows music agrees this is one of the greatest records ever recorded, but I don&#39;t have the most educated ear for hiphop -- I didn&#39;t want it to be wasted on me, or be lost on me.  I&#39;m happy to report that on the first listen I recognized it as a work of nearly perfect genius.  Also it feels like so much of it is jazz in the final analysis.  About as good as it gets in music.
I still can&#39;t get over how great this record is.  It was single-handedly responsible for bringing this middle aged white guy back to rap (its a greater feat than you might think...i&#39;d sworn most of it off after lil wayne).  King Kunta still slaps so hard.
L album YB BETTER
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=535">8:55</a> It&#39;s all mathematics <br>Mighty mos def

Anybody else see he put every song in fav song lists in the description
How is this a 10 while Bad Habits is a not good. Should be the other way around imo
I really love how keen he is that Kendrick Lamar was a real talent right from Section. 80. üôåüèªüíì
You earned my respect with this video.
day 1089...<br><br>I can&#39;t stop rewatching this
Should have been a 0, smh
Anthony can u say the name of the boris gardiner song that was sampled for the intro of the album?
You can see the smokepurpp influence on the album
accurate
As an aspiring writer/poet, I kind of hate myself for not thinking to do something like this before Kendrick; but that makes me love this album so much
soy
great vid anthony but the part where you <i>____</i> and then proceeded to <i>_____</i> was a bit <i>____</i>
I&#39;ve watched this video at least 5 times now. I can never get enough of how he praises Kdot. Love it.
3/10 at most
Maad city was 100% his best
Melon, I don&#39;t think repeating the phrase &quot;this dick ain&#39;t free&quot; for 22 minutes straight counts as a good, in depth album review
its sticking out anthony
Such unique use of instrumental samples
Cmon Kendrick. Were waiting for another TPAB. Or at least another journey as such. Like tf. We&#39;ve gotten a few ass songs (great verses but wtf) off keems new album. Where the fuck is an album Kendrick? Could be 5 songs and id be happy tbh
he seems so happy, I love it.
You would‚Äôve given this a 7 if it was DAMN.
Tho, i‚Äôve obviously haven‚Äôt listened to all music ever and i‚Äôm sure there is many musical artists that might have something better than this but i honestly think, to me anyway, this could be one of the best albums ever. Six years later i still feel the same way. The poetry, the fucking message is insanely prominent, and the lyrics, the jazzy funk beats and homage. It‚Äôs really like 2pac had a son that took everything he was a made it better.
how<br>the <br>hell<br>is<br>this <br>a<br>10<br><br>i <br>really <br>did<br>not<br>like <br>it<br><br>2/10
I have never listened to the album, should I?
Dude be looking like Logic fr
what did mr melon toss at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=750">12:30</a>
:)
I had that same shirt in the 80&#39;s. üòä
This album made me realise MBDTF kinda deserved that 6.
Why is this in my recommended it&#39;s a bit old...
This trash a 10<br>But 17 by x is a 2 ‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è
I&#39;m going through all your video to just dislike
Someone‚Äôs in love
U made me have goose bumps and made me cry
Yb better
An album that has a political message that will last forever
And anny bannaney says he doesn&#39;t plan to give a 10
No joke, this album is the equivalent of sitting down and getting wrapped up in a good book. Like the storytelling and narrative is just SO damn good and it finishes with such on a fulfilling note. If this album isn&#39;t on a shitton of Album of the Decade lists, society will just prove how tone deaf they are.
the thing that catches me with this album is not just the music, not just Lamar&#39;s fucking insane vocals and beat but also the story. The story of trying to get away from his past trauma of Compton and the showing of his vulnerable side makes this one of the greatest albums I&#39;ve ever heard.
‚Äòu‚Äô is absolutely terrible. 7/10
Heavy playboi carti influence hereüî•üî•
Hi
Don&#39;t lie Anthony, you gave this album a 10 because that&#39;s your opinion on it.
Lil Pump‚Äôs self titled is better
It‚Äôs an amazing album but what is ‚Äúracial pride‚Äù? What do they call a white person who expresses that? Go ahead and roast me in the replies but I‚Äôm just playing devils advocate.
The Playboi Carti influence is made quite clear on this tape
This album is right up there with TPAB
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=360">6:00</a> you missed the point of the poem. This is another good kid mad city. It&#39;s an introspective version of the events. Remember the ending of Good Kid Mad City featured the track Real/ Now or Never/ Bitch Dont Kill My Vibe (Remix). Where Kendrick describes leaving the westside on each and every track &quot;They love on the east like im chuck dee/Dominicans wish that I was born there&quot;. In King Kunta he says: &quot;24/7 365 days x2/I&#39;ve been contemplating getting on stage/ Just to go back to the hood/ and see my enemies are saved&quot;. On U he describes being on the road with &quot;bottles and bitches&quot; while one his friends died. This accompanies the music videos version which ties in another song at the end called &quot;For Sale&quot;. Which starts with him having a panic attack as the voice of another figure warns him about death and the devil. The events of Good Kid Mad City are described in that song to be the machinations of Lucifer. Which led him on his path to becoming the &quot;God MC&quot; which is in the last song of Good Kid Mad City (Bitch Dont Kill My Vibe(Remix). This is why instead of &quot;Getting the coast involved and letting history repeat&quot; he actually does get on that stage at the end and sings &quot;I&quot;. The studio version was a purposeful calculated release on his narrative in the album, the live version is broken up. Which leads to the pin ultimate track &quot;Mortal Man&quot;. Which is a song about how Black people look to their spearhead figures as symbols of perfection(the friend that died older sibling guilt trips him which sent him into a spiral of fighting vengeance and wanting his dreams) to lead an army of better people. He resolves to keep going forward and gives his people freedom of feeling like what they know is all they ever can be. This is legitimized by him meeting the biggest spearhead figure in the black community Tupac and confessing his guilt first, and then by receiving his blessing by finding in the words of that same aforementioned friend. That he is on a path they can&#39;t even comprehend but that it is his destiny to blossom out of their lifestyle and become something greater. A leader. Essentially the Good Kid in Mad City has become a man. The poem at the end before Pac leaves him to find the answers he seeks, by going threw life. Makes mention of the mad city. The album is the proof he does understand the poem and is looking to Pac for something that&#39;s already been found.  <br><br>Even DAMN. is connected to the events of God Kid Mad City and Kendrick on that album is teetering on that &quot;God MC&quot; trap set by the Lucifer. GOD/ DNA/ ELEMENT/ LOYAL are all seminal parts of that persona starting to take over.
Growing up I always wondered why most of my peers never listened to albums from beginning to end. Most albums at least give you an idea where the artist or band are mentally, emotionally, and sonically‚Ä¶ then there‚Äôs albums like this, Dark Side of the Moon, Deep Blue, Good Kid Mad City, CONCEPTUAL PIECES OF ART that you miss out if all you ever do is pick off the ‚Äútoppings.‚Äù Pun intended. I always tell my friends, family, peers, and lovers that it‚Äôs extremely important to at least give your favorite artists albums a listen all the way through. From start to finish. You won‚Äôt regret it.
Loving melon is complicated
guys i think he likes this album
Wow it&#39;s been 6 years
If 2pac was still alive he would of signed Kendrick Lamar to his label.
Can&#39;t believe Nav ghostwrote this.
To this day Anthony&#39;s most positive review
Legit one of your most well thought out and expansive reviews. Fantastic job.
Is it bad that im only now listening to kendrick cuz im a baby keem fan? haha
Listened to the album for the first time ever today, So i thought it was time I came and watched this video.
Maybe a 7, overrated rapper
Scary to know this would‚Äôve been a nine if the original version of i were on it
this album is only a light 5, LOL.
good kid maad city blows this album outta the water sorry
üôè
King Kunta is soo fire and funky
Six years later and this is still one of the best albums i&#39;ve ever heard, when my grandchildren ask me about the music from my day i&#39;ll show them this.
I made my own album called To Pimp a Beatle.<br>It‚Äôs a concept album about the time Ringo was my main bitch.
David bowie was inspired to write blackstar by tpab
Man, as a producer, I really appreciate how the way the vocals are mixed on the poem segments. They‚Äôre  mixed like an actual interview mic, foreshadowing the twist at the end.
The way buddy reviews this album‚Ä¶boy bussy dripping ü§£<br><br>Just look at the thumbnail he chose ü§£<br><br>This his favorite album ever
This is the ‚ÄúTo Pimp a Butterfly‚Äù of music reviews
Good Melon
bbq hands with franzz
A classic review Anthony 10/10
This album never gets boring, and I‚Äôve heard it about a hundred times
GKMC &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; TPAB ... Top 5 greatest album of all time
T<br>U<br>Pimp<br>A<br>Caterpillar
This review in itself is a 10/10.
this album i think is one of the best forms of art because it really shows how much the music industry matters and how the exploitation of its money making aspects have changed the way thios art form is used,  and the way kendrick uses it as a way to genuinely open peoples eyes up and actually put their shoes inside of someone that deals with the issues on this album, i feel as though it could change anyones mind
W-WHAT A POSITIVE REVIEW ON A RAP ALBUM?? NONONONO YOURE SUPPOSED TO HATE EVERYTHING NOOO NOW I&#39;M FORCED TO FACE THE FACT MY FAVORITE ARTIST PUT OUT A SHTTY ALBUM AND YOU&#39;RE NOT JUST A HATER NOOO
I love Anthony‚Äôs excitement when he talks about this album in this review. It‚Äôs adorable:)
I&#39;ve never seen Anthony so excited
Black man idolizing soy nerd
Isaiah Rashad: &quot;How dare this guy critique my music? He ain&#39;t black. He doesn&#39;t know anything about the black experience&quot;<br><br>Me: Let&#39;s use some common sense, shall we? You don&#39;t have to be black in order to enjoy black music. Just like you don&#39;t have to be white in order to enjoy metal music or classical music. Anthony really liked this album and gave it a 10. Anthony didn&#39;t like &quot;The House is Burning&quot; and gave it a 5. It&#39;s an opinion. It&#39;s not that serious. <br><br>These rappers nowadays are too sensitive. Can you imagine a painter or a sculpture getting angry and quitting his or her job because critics didn&#39;t like their work? Smh<br><br>You can tell these punk ass rappers hold Fantano in high regards. They take his opinion to heart.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=621">10:21</a> is the peak of humanity.
It‚Äôs actually a tough album to get into. I‚Äôve listened to it numerous times and I still find it challenging. I think this is due to his production technique of having these instruments blend together a la Wall of Sound making it difficult to pick out a single instrument and follow its progression thru the track. It makes for quite a chaotic sound. So I continue to listen to it and pull from it as much as I can while also trying to find the pleasure of the album. The album is regarded in such high esteem which is why I‚Äôm giving it so much attention (so much for an album I don‚Äôt love the sound of). I do enjoy it more and more each time I do listen to it. And I did find my way to enjoying GKMC without nearly as much effort. But I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs there. It wouldn‚Äôt be regarded so highly otherwise.
It&#39;s 4 am, I&#39;m going to bed...<br>It&#39;s 4 am, I&#39;m going to bed...<br>It&#39;s 4 am, I&#39;m going to bed...
I love the song &quot;complexion&quot;
I mean, i remember the one time i nitted in a condominium.
Cool cat says this is a certified HOOD CLASSIC
I&#39;ve never seen KING MELON fan boy
how the fuck is complexion not in your fav tracks
Gkmc better lol
nav influenced kendrick on this album, we all know
Lets change the album cover and make every black person white, while the x x white man is black.
you can really see lil pumps influence in this album
Useless illuminati backwards self affirmation
just coming back to make sure that 10 is still there
‚Äúthis album is amazing but 5/10 because he‚Äôs black‚Äù really melon? üòê
it‚Äôs really cool to see how dababy influenced this album and shaped kendrick as an artist
at almost 5.2M
Oh SHIT bro!!!! Bam bam Fantano bwahahaha and nice laugh bro you crack me up and stay legit and I agree with you for the most part...<br>I&#39;m so excited about this album, I got one more song on this album which is good too and then I&#39;m going to listen to it any minute!!!!! I&#39;m so excited... honestly I&#39;m having a few beers and blazing love ya buddy no homo...<br><br>After that I&#39;m going to check out good kid mAAd city I heard one of the most ever music bro but I been out of the loop for a bit you kwim??? I missed out on a lot of the most obvious shit hahaha
When people say ‚Äúwhy do you watch music reviews‚Äù I point them to this video. Your passion and attention to detail to the point of view of the artists is very admirable. I went through a slump where I didn‚Äôt appreciate music as much but as I watched the video on how you review music to see videos like this I started changing the way I listened. This definitely caused me to stop enjoying a lot of artists i use to because I stopped looking for catchy one liners and ‚Äúhard‚Äù beats. But it made me appreciate not only real hip hop artists who put time and thought into their albums, but other genres I may not have cared for. Basically I wrote this to be another to acknowledge your impact on music and it‚Äôs listeners. In case you ever see this never stop being you!
This album is lyrically a masterpiece! But if I were to judge every track as a song, some of them are terrible.
10/10 review it again
if kendrick was white he would&#39;ve given it a 10. smh
Agree with the review though
‚ù§Ô∏èüôè‚úùÔ∏è
King Kunta is one of the best hip hop songs I&#39;ve ever been blessed to hear
&quot;On the track &#39;Alright&#39; Kendrick was blatantly ripping off Taylor swift &quot; üò≥

Look at the excitement in the man when reviewing To Pimp a Butterfly.<br><br>Now look at him reviewing The Big Day.
Too Nice body of work
mid
I was feeling really out of current music and wondering if i could get back into it when i noticed that many of the comments are just a few months old. Glad to know that this album and artist are not dated and can be enjoyed at anytime.
We all sleeping on the fact he basically said to pimp a butterfly is like an onion
I agree, however Kendrick has borrow a lot of sounds from Cardi B through out the albums which sounds very unoriginal
Kendrick Lamar was clearly inspired by Yung Gravy.
I like how he isn‚Äôt even annoyed with Cal because they‚Äôre both so excited about the album.
I miss fat melon‚Ä¶
how dare you say such things about about my favorite artist ever in the world booooooooooo hisss :[üò°
Just remember. Him giving damn a 7 brings TPAB score down to a 2.
This album is fucking spotless up until the very very end &quot;[Michael Jackson] gave us Billie Jean, you say he touched those kids?&quot; Fuck off.
i love how this is the third thing that shows up when you search tpab
TPAB is an example of an album that transcends genres and works better when listened to from start to end in one sitting, like most legendary albums like this and Dark Side.
I love how almost every song is his favourite track in the description.
i always come back here just in case it&#39;s still a 10/10
I watch this review every day.
Great review I just didn‚Äôt really like the part where you did blackface and sang the intro to wesleys theory.
Ok it‚Äôs got a great message and stuff and wesleys tbeary is an absolute masterpiece and alright is really good. But, I think a lot of the music is a little overrated but it‚Äôs still like an 8 not like the best album of all time though
This video got recommended. Again. Almost every month. This video gets recommended to me. And I watch it. And then I spend a day listening to all Lamar&#39;s records. Sometimes I love life. But only sometimes.
There are a couple of things that stand out to me 6 years on. I studied this album as part of my 5k-word Dissertation on Catharsis (the act of processing one&#39;s experience through art) and the &quot;Funky Grooves of Parliament Funkadelic&quot; are actually known as P-Funk, very closely linked to G-Funk, created and made popular by Warren G, and the Likes of Snoop Dogg, Nate Dogg and even though to Tupac. In terms of the structure of the album, it is meant to be a story, but not audible to the naked ear. The Poem that runs throughout builds to the climax and starts unraveling shortly after the track &quot;Institutionalized&quot;. The message of the album isn&#39;t just about self-love. It is also pointing out that Gang Violence is pointless as it was created by the system. <br><br>Therefore having resonated with and studied this as a person of mixed heritage I think you&#39;ve slightly misinterpreted some of the terminologies and meanings behind the album.
i love boys
How is this Album not corny? It talks about real things, like racism and stuff. Isn&#39;t that the definition of corny? (I love the album, but you always say corny to songs that talk about real things and not just fuking hoes)
Mortal man is the unparalleled
Interesting how this turned into a minecraft let&#39;s play not mad tho
Best rap album I‚Äôve ever heard. Head and shoulders above anybody else
What a nice young man. He would never give a Kendrick album a 7 out of 10.
My friend lied to me I feel like crap
New Kendrick lamar album
To mid a butterfly
Can‚Äôt help revisiting this review, this entire video is amazing, seriously.  Greatest review for the greatest album.
I just got finished listening to this album for the first time... this album and Kendrick himself something special. This truly is a very special album; while I didn&#39;t cry, I truly did feel something while listening to the album.... like I was deep into the emotions most tracks portrayed. This is art in its pure form, I hope whatever Kendrick makes in the future will be grand and just as good as this.
Currently watching all 10 reviews after the Spellling review
This was a feast for Anthony&#39;s ears
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=11">0:11</a>
I don&#39;t think that even kendrick can make another album that tops this (in a FULL album way)
He once again today, gave an album a 10.
After 5 years I just noticed that the outro repeats 3 times which signifies that melon&#39;s real score of tpab is 3, and I completely disagree
Surprised there wasn‚Äôt any lil xan features, Would have made the album much better
This is one of the rap albums ever, I do not care that is my opinion
can‚Äôt believe melon gives credit to rappers who use ghost writers, seeing as NAV wrote this whole album for kendrick smh
Almost forgot to watch this today
Legend
The fact that you gave it a &quot;NOT GOOD&quot; just because Kendrick is black makes me think you missed the point of this album entirely
Cmon Melon &quot;UHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.....I GUESS YOU AIN&#39;T GOTTA LIE......IF I HAD TO PICK ONE&quot; is my fav track
fun fact: playboi carti ghost wrote this entire album
Does Kendrick know music theory though? Didn&#39;t think so. Therefor rap is not music. (I&#39;m Ben Shabibo by the way)
His favorite songs are almost all the songs on the album
so many comments are recent. this proves that tpab is timeless
Who‚Äôs here after Kendrick admitted that IceJJfish ghostwrote the whole album
It‚Äôs 4am I‚Äôm going to work
the yellow flannel!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=620">10:20</a>
Never understood the hype around this album. Good Kid Maad City was so much more enjoyable
he gave olivia rodrigos album a 7 and to pimp a butterfly a 7 why do people take him seriously
TPAB definitely has a story upon reflection
Late but<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1320">22:00</a>  is so me
Kendrick is the distant sequel of N. W. A
My introduction to this album was freshman year of college in 2015, when I went to a party thrown by my school&#39;s jazz radio station.<br><br> I will never forget seeing a room full of 30 people turning up to King Kunta like their lives depended on it
MBDTF&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;TPAB
Imma set the record straight bc a lot of y‚Äôall are pretentious bout this album. I don‚Äôt see nobody mentioning or even recognizing what I thought was obvious as shit. It was kendrick recalling his experiences and his growing pains from his deal with the devil and dealing with the devil. In true masterpiece fashion, even the title itself denotes the meaning, in an almost oxymoronic manner. ‚ÄúTo pimp a butterfly‚Äù; to materialize something beautiful and complex...to sell a soul. I would argue the title (and thus the project) ties to simpler, yet masonic values/themes of good and bad. Balance; black and white; as above so below. That‚Äôs why you have an uplifting track like ‚ÄúAlright‚Äù, and the most blatant one no one talks about (where he quite literally DETAILED the deal) ‚ÄúFor Sale?‚Äù. <br><br>‚Äú... I can feel your vibe and recognize that you‚Äôre ashamed of me...yes I hate you too...‚Äù <br>(this line was deep af and always stuck w me ngl)
I love how Anthony reacting to a video of someone cutting pizza has 5x the views of this
You can really see the musical inspiration taken from NAV‚Äôs Good Intentions on TPAB

I have always loved hip hop since I heard &#39;My Adidas&#39; by Run DMC. Kendrick Lamar is great, but I honestly can&#39;t find the infatuation with this album. Am I missing something?
a top 5 album of the last decade. No debate at all ‚ùå
El mejor √°lbum de todos los tiempos üî•üî•
I just want you all to bear in mind that for 20 minutes of this video Cal is just standing there watching Fantano review the album, i dont why its so special on this video specifically
N.E.G.U.S
Man its soo good i am worried even kendrick himself can top this
racism.
Great review but I don‚Äôt think it was right to sing the whole Wesley‚Äôs Theory intro uncensored, kinda inappropriate
5 mil W
So he even gives 10 to album ?<br>I thought he was a stubborn teacher who always tries to find ways of cutting marks xD
5 mil lets go
Lol watching this when I haven‚Äôt even listened to any kendrick
Wow, first time I‚Äôve witnessed Anthony give an album a 10
Youngboy better
Tbh the thumbnail says it all
&quot;Try listen to a hip-hop record before 2010&quot; üî•üî•üî•üòÇ
Lmao first time seeing him giving 10
But still Taylor Swift got album of year<br>Grammy is racist
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1305">21:45</a> I like the way Fantano says these two sentences.
Honestly this album is in my top 3 of all time. I&#39;m not a fan of trendy styles because there messy bland and one note. This album is deep complex and beautiful. It&#39;s up there with madvillainy and ready to die as my favorites of All time.
If this album is called my beautiful dark twisted fantasy he gives it a 6
A solid 7
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=850">14:10</a>
The influences that Kendrick took from Lil Xan on this album are what truly make it timeless
We need Lin-Manuel Miranda to do a theater adaptation of this LP.
TPAB is so very overrated, it‚Äôs good but gkmc is better
U can already tell by how he started the video u know its gonna be 10
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=686">11:26</a> ü§î so basically every liberal I‚Äôve tried having a civilized conversation with
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=752">12:32</a> - lol u can tell how much he loves this album &amp; how intently he&#39;s listened to it when he just throws away the script and starts narrating it to us
I‚Äôm still astounded of why 2.5k people dislike this review. This is the best Melon has reviewed and he‚Äôs absolutely correct about every strand of this album in it‚Äôs entirety. <br><br>But maybe they disliked because of the wallpaper esque backdrop. <br><br>I‚Äôm glad you changed your backdrop Melon man.
I get you really like this album, but I think you took it a little far when you sang the opening to Wesleys Theory.
A beautiful piece of music even for people who&#39;s not into rap.
you can tell off the bat anthony knows he‚Äôs about to review the greatest album ever recorded and he‚Äôs just happy to exist when it came out
I always come back to this vid for the voices at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=723">12:03</a> great observation but wtf haha
There was a time when I had almost lost hope in modern rap music, Kendricks music brought me comfort and peace. Music worth even listening too
Ke is the goat
Children‚Äôs story
light 7
A lot of this guys fans are complete sheep and just form their opinion on his review. (Can‚Äôt form their own)<br><br>I‚Äôd like to see him have like a timer of a few hours before his video comes out. Like when someone premieres a video in a few hours and you can comment before it drops. I‚Äôd like to see people post their thoughts and rating and then just watch most of them completely change their opinion when he gives his verdict. I guarantee if some people gave an album a 9 or a 10, and then Fantano gives it a 1-3 or somethng, watch all the sheeple change their opinions.
Sad he didn&#39;t mention the best part of Kunta, &quot;I was gonna kill a couple rappers but they did it to themselves / Everybody&#39;s suicidal they ain&#39;t even need my help&quot;
‚Äúyou can literally hear the alcohol swishing around, you can literally hear the lips smacking on this record‚Äù
I just felt like it was a bit unprofessional of you to recite the beginning of Wesley‚Äòs theory honestly, and then give Kendrick a 7 because while ‚Äúthe album was good Kendrick is also still a black man‚Äú messed up dude. Also, credit where credit is due Kendrick said that this entire album is ghost written by logic and you didn‚Äôt reference that one‚Äôs just kind of disrespectful to the artistic process.
Just added this video to the bibliography of my finals diss lmaooo Melon gonna be in my dissertation
This is me <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1320">22:00</a>
this guys videos make me wanna take notes and then relisten to the albums
Still worth a 10/10 <br><br>Best song ‚ÄúMortal Man‚Äú
good review, all these years later, but it&#39;s still weird to hear Anthony talk about the &quot;remnants of the &#39;Bling&#39; era falling off&quot; with this album.  like, what?  the &quot;bling&quot; era you&#39;re talking about had been over for half a decade at that point.  idk just feels so strange and out of place, even in 2015.
Youngboy better ü•±
Man, this is a really good album. You can totally see how it was inspired by Kanye West&#39;s famous quote &quot;none of us&#39;d be here without cum&quot; and by Taylor Swift&#39;s cult classic album &quot;1989&quot;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=681">11:21</a> , of course you had to reference your own movie melon
IT IS 4 AM.<br><br>HE IS GOING TO BED.
Honestly I didn‚Äôt like this album that much, I liked damn and GKMC way more
Dababy&gt;Kendrick Lamar
Its 4 am hes going to bed
It&#39;s so cute seeing him smile with joy for this album
Melon&#39;s keenness to review the album and the impulse to burst out in superaltives is so palpable in the into. I just fucking love it.
oh
Life climaxed with this review
I just don‚Äôt get why people hype this album up ngl. Not tryna hate but it‚Äôs nowhere close to a top 10 rap album and it‚Äôs not even better than section 80 or GKMC
Do &quot;As Above So Below&quot; by ANKHLEJOHN
Good review but I thought the part where you speak about how you believe that Kendrick is the hottest nigga in hip hop was really unnecessary
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=642">10:42</a> that‚Äôs a fine line between genius and garbage.
Fantano I don‚Äôt think you can give this album a 0 just cuz he‚Äôs black
I feel like you can‚Äôt just have this song in your playlist besides maybe ‚ÄúAlright‚Äù. It just doesn‚Äôt make that much sense when you haven‚Äôt listened to the one before it.
A classic review of a classic album
You sound so proud to be a music reviewer at the beginning.
what did he give it again?
Why does his voice sound super different here in this video?
It‚Äôs 4 am and he‚Äôs goin to bed
6 years ago, the greatest album of all time was released
kendrick copying WAP was the worst part of this thing tbh
6 year anniversary of the worst review ever!!!!
MBDTF &gt; TPAB
Kendrick copied Eminem smh
Rewatching this review reminded me how much I liked this album<br><br><br><br>Totally not because this review made me like this album in the first place
To Pimp A Butterfly might be a good title but that album cover fucking sucks
I personally disagree with the part where you mentioned how the album got a -1 because Kendrick Lamar had a foot fetish and you were more of a hand guy yourself. Come on man :/
6
This album should have won a publizer not damn change my mind.
This Dick ain‚Äôt FREEEEE
I don&#39;t think he mentioned How Much A Dollar Cost at all haha
just listened to the album for the first time and watching this review now üòé
Should&#39;ve been 11/10 SMHüòû
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=415">6:55</a> is my favorite part of the review
this album makes me cry in so many spots, the end of mortal man is so chilling. a masterpiece
You aint gotta lie was one of the best songs off of that
kendrick should make a broadway show for this album
The review of the album is just as much of a masterpiece as the album itself
Mfs listen to tpab just to come back an still be racistüíÄ
The poem regarding the caterpillar and butterfly on Mortal Man makes me cry every time.
Kendrick would tell you give your 10 to kanye&#39;s album
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg">0:00</a> when the imposter is sus
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=21">0:21</a>
To Pimp a Butterfly is cinematic and scope and scale.<br><br>Lyrically, conceptually, and musically, this album might be modern hip hop&#39;s crowning achievement, and it&#39;s only improved with age.<br><br>It truly is a once in a generation type achievement.
Who‚Äôs here in 2021 where people are considering this the best rap album oat
Melon you gotta lay off the N bombs bro
I remember you was conflicted
My favorite yellow flannel review
Melon has never been this excited since.
Easily one of the best albums of all time. It‚Äôs that simple
Trash album, the fact that people say &quot;album of the decade&quot;, smh. Stop glorifying trash albums, and start glorifying good albums like MMM FOOD by MF DOOM.
Can‚Äôt believe Kendrick copied Whole Lotta Red ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Yeah you‚Äôre not topping this review melonin it‚Äôs been 6 years
No lie, it really was an incredible revelation to know that Kendrick was reciting the poem to Tupac<br><br>This album is nearly 80 minutes long!! In 2015, a timeless, thoughtful, deliberate and neccessary piece of musical art ran for almost 80 minutes! I can&#39;t think of many albums that hit those marks all at once.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=288">4:48</a> &quot;ah shit that&#39;s all i wrote&quot;
if melon only says &quot;anthony fantano&quot; at the beginning of a review then it&#39;s a ten confirmed
I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen Anthony happier to gush over something he loves
No socks and skinny jeans.
This review is so entertaining
TPAB &gt; Madvillainy
kendrick: 10/10<br>uzi: 3/10<br>everyone else: 7/10
A really good review melon. You touched on every part of this album in a very objective way and illustrated your perspective clearly. There are voice(s?) in this video kinda turning me off, but a little bit of work could fix it. Overall, I&#39;m feeling a decent to strong 9 on this video. Tran...
To pimp a butterfly was my most listened to album on Apple Music in 2020. Someone needs to make fun of me
Why not &quot;African American Hippy&quot; member??
10 is that a 5 mics
He‚Äôs giving it a not good ü§£
Is he the 2pac of this generation but with better flows and lyrics, would of loved a pac Kendrick song üò≠
He could be the best rapper of the last decade, even autotune and mumble rap can‚Äôt hold this guy down
Fantano listen,<br>You can not make a video repeating the phrase &quot;black in fact can crack&quot;<br>And saying racial slurs when reviewing an album that goes completely against those ideas.<br>Then you gave it a 1/10<br>Cmon bit harsh melon
To Pimp a Butterfly is arguably the 2010s Illmatic
Let&#39;s be honest if this album didn&#39;t get a 10 than nothing would.
One of the worst albums ever made
yuh
It‚Äôs 4 am...I‚Äôm going to bed (x3)
You only gave it a 10, because you are white.
thanks melon for introducing me to great music, Boy , it&#39;s going to be a sad day when you retire.
What if Kendrick ever saw this and said, &quot;Nah man, I just wrote some shit.&quot; üòÇ
Wait why didn&#39;t you like the song &#39;UHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.....I GUESS YOU AIN&#39;T GOTTA LIE......IF I HAD TO PICK ONE&#39;?
It‚Äôs 4 am I‚Äôm going to bed
i&#39;ve listenened to this album many times and it&#39;s still bad to me idk why
Anthony, you can‚Äôt give this album a 10 just because you want Kendrick to give you the n-word pass
The only reason you like this album is because Kendrick is white.
I come back and watch this video at least once month. He is always so concise with his words but still meets the gravity of the topics he is speaking on. Love this video
Listen to the Dissect Podcast to see how well put together this album really is.
Kendrick Lemar makes terrible music and he likes Kanye West so he‚Äôs a  Taylor Hater<br>Haters gonna hate honey
How&#39;d he not understand the album at all and give it a 10 lol
something satisfying on mobile having the thumbnail be the first frame
How much a dollar cost is a musical masterpiece
My favourite tracks on this album were, Wesleys Theory, Mortal Man and Alright
9/10 imo
Te odio
Melon called kendrik gay at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1339">22:19</a>
Great review, but I&#39;m going to have to leave a dislike since you said &quot;BAM&quot; at the beginning instead of DAMN. You could&#39;ve been a genius and predicted the next Kendrick Lamar album, but instead you thought you were a clown and said BAM. Better luck next time.
one of my favorite albums ever
Commenting just for the culture
its actually 4am when im watching this, crazy.
it&#39;s 4 a.m.. i&#39;m going to bed.<br>it&#39;s 4 a.m.. i&#39;m going to bed.<br>it&#39;s 4 a.m.. i&#39;m going to bed.
This is one of the most overrated albums of all time.
Honestly I‚Äôll give it like a 9-9.5, in my top 3 fav albums
lmaoo i cant believe they choose mocklemore as aoty
I didn‚Äôt like the song hood politics but the rest of the album is perfect I can agree with you on dis
This is the &quot;Tommy&quot; of hip hop. It&#39;s great, it&#39;s a classic, but very little of it has replay value outside of listening to the whole thing all the way through.
Ayo lester? üò≥
üôåüèΩ
That point you were making about him saying one thing and then saying another thing is, in my view, a way to open the mind on positions, not just taking positions but rather understand each opposition you deem fit

Best fantano review ever
I fucking love this album
Anthony: Well thought out review, extremely thorough, glowing and sincere<br>Comments: it&#39;s meme time
He‚Äôs so happy I love this hahahahahaha
I only remember the last number that melon says in his reviews.  I just want to know how it&#39;s rated.  But this one shocked me.  I can&#39;t fucking believe he gave TPAB a four.  And who the hell is AM?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=288">4:48</a> MY MANS THREW A PAPER
BAM!!
how much a 10 cost - melon
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1304">21:44</a> that last part though
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=15">0:15</a> He really put some stank on that B on black
my professor put this album on his powerpoint slides lol
I genuinely believe this album is just that amazing that it even got Fantano to do a whole review excited and uplifted.
Mayne....I just love this revieuw. Pure recognision üëåüèæüíØ
The thumbnail is literally the first frame
can we get Tupac, Dr Dre,Notorious B.I.G or kanye late registration reviews
not enougj detail
Anthony making that face while adjusting his camera, with two amazing hip-hop albums behind him. Talk about an iconic thumbnail.
I heard Anthony Fantano was conflicted. <br>Misusing his influence.
his album was wack
Giving 10 to white artists what a racist. Stop racist
It&#39;s four a.m. and I&#39;m going to bed
This might be Melon&#39;s most iconic review. You can see his passion with every word and he breaks down both the music and the message gracefully and effectively. He structures it well so it&#39;s easy to follow. He also gives a new perspective on the album as a whole and makes sure to persuade people to listen to it.<br><br>Unsubbed
Did this nigga say ‚Äúfem C‚Äù
If kendrick was black you would&#39;ve gave this a 7
My crush loves me as much as Melon loves MBDTF
Fantano didn&#39;t even mention how much a dollar cost which is his best Kendrick Lamar song
MELON MAN
just looking at you pisses me the fuck off
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=11">0:11</a>
Anthony, I was very happy until you ripped your shirt off and proclaimed yourself as the 4th reich and the second coming of hitler and then proceeded to get a tab vinyl and draw a swastika on it.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1">0:01</a>
sorry
Good kid definitely has a more hood-like gangsta, reliving the past atmosphere. This one is more new and refreshing with better and cleaner production. Like a poor farmer in good kid to city boy in Pimp a Butterfly. Both have their appeal for sure.
Dreamy creamy neo soul
I‚Äôm thinking of listening to this album on shrooms should I?
My ranked albums:<br><br>1:tpab <br>2:gkmc <br>3:damn<br>4:section 80
I wrote my extended essay over this album which only increased my appreciation of it.
5 years ago I was wondering through YouTube looking for new music to listen to when I stumbled up on this video, I listened to the video and found my favourite album of all time, ever since my tastes in music have changed so drastically that I feel like it made me a different person and it made me happy to explore music more and more every day. This was my first TND video and definitely not my last thanks Anthony this was an important video in my life, hope you read this.
J Cole doing a beat for a song on an album made by the rapper that made TPAB is the closest he‚Äôs gonna get to a 10
I prefer gKMc but I also found that album at a point in my life where it really hit hard and I don‚Äôt enjoy lyrical activism no matter the cause, it‚Äôs just not what I listen to music for
Why did you give DAMN a 7?
I fucking knew it. You play an instrument so anything without a sort of authentic  live music doesn‚Äôt resonate with you.
Y‚Äôall YouTube comments something elseüòÇ
Some of the Captions on your videos are incorrect. By fixing your captions you can help out your hearing impaired audience members!
A certified hood classic
He was talking to 2Pac???? That is the biggest twist of all time
Amazing Review...... Shout out to Ghost Note&#39;s &quot;Sput&quot; Searight who lent his amazing lush harmonic and rhythmic contributions to this record.
KENDRICK IS GREAT BUT HAVE YOU LISTEN TO?  New York Shitty: The Ballad of Crazy Eddie
I just realized, throughout this ENTIRE review, not one time did he mention the song &quot;How Much a Dollar Cost&quot;.
melon seemed very excited to review this album.
Great review. I agree with almost all your points, except for when you stated that ‚ÄúAbraham ‚ÄòThe Babe‚Äô Lincoln was wrong on all accounts‚Äù. Other than that, keep up the good work!
These walls is actually directed at the man who killed Dave in Good kid, m.A.A.D. city
That ‚ÄúPac?‚Äù on the last seconds of the album give me chills every time.
Just noticed that fantano has worn the same shirt in his 3 most popular videos
Greatest album of our generation. No other rap album is composed and crafted better than TPAB. Masterpiece. If you disagree then listen to the album analysis by Dissect Podcast then you will realize how incredible this masterpiece really is.
It&#39;s interesting how a black bar next to the album cover art on the wall behind his glasses keeps appearing
I saw this of a yt vid and one comment said something like how TPAB is a beautiful work of literature and MBDTF is magnificent painting
The first thing i heard was &quot; this dick ain&#39;t free&quot; lol
I like the point you made about shoving ideologies and all that. I&#39;m a conservative so I obviously had a different point of view but I still love this record. How much a dollar cost, for free, alright, kung kunta, and u are just so great. Any one who somehow still hasn&#39;t listened to this masterpiece for w/e reason, please do! You won&#39;t regret it
Complexion and how much a dolla cost not on ur favourites??<br>K den....
I&#39;ve never seen him this excited for a review
I come back and watch this every christmas idk why lol
To Pimp A Butterfly <br>2PAB <br><br>2PAC ‚û°Ô∏è 2PAB<br><br>C ‚û°Ô∏è B<br><br>Caterpillar ‚û°Ô∏è Butterfly
there is no way to downplay how good this album is. you could hype it up forever and it would still live up to and exceed anyones expectations
Great review but you didn&#39;t have to call the cops on an innocent black guy to prove a point.
Loved the review, melon, but at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=980">16:20</a> did u really have to curb stomp 16 african refugees?
Honestly, at this point, this review has become so iconic and referenced so often that I think it has become synonymous with music critiquing. This video will go down in the books and will be immortalized, as the most famous music reviews of all time.
I rewatched this like 6 times already, and i‚Äôll keep doing it
The interview style makes me think of Robin Williams as Adrian Kronhauer in Good Morning Vietnam. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not original even then, great styling still go this day.
I watched this originally stoned out of my mind and the words just sooth you. Sent me to sleep so quickly.
Classic album. I&#39;m still checking out different types of messages displayed through the tracks I can&#39;t believe I used to think this album was boring. 10/10 album &amp; Kendrick Lamar is a Top tier lyricist.
I‚Äôm not sure i agree with this rating not once in the album did Kendricks dad get his damn dominos
The paper toss at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=288">4:48</a> really did it for me.
This is a piece of history, both the video and the album.
10/10 ? oh yes
This is honestly one of the few albums I can see getting turned into a Broadway play.
We will never have it this good again
gotta hate how melon gave it a zero because hes asian
i love kendrick but i love penis more
22 mins never passed that fast
I give this review a 10/10
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=305">5:05</a> great quote
It‚Äôs fun to return to this review simply to hear a level of enthusiasm reserved only when a blue moon project emerges.  Always inspiring, makes you want to make something special.
I come back to this sometimes to see the child-like excitement Anthony has this whole review. Really feel like he&#39;s never been more excited to review something.
You can really see how much Gunna is an influence on kendrick in this album
damn anthony how do you not like you aint gotta lie and complexion?
Every melon is a star
A music landmark. Literally. An album that college professors are going to teach music majors for many years to come.
This is my favorite album the instrumentals on this album are arguably his best
How could he not talk about ‚ÄúHow Much a Dollar Cost‚Äù and ‚ÄúMomma‚Äù when they are both thee central songs that hold up the whole album together
I can never look at this room the same way after knowing he sits in a chair
Yep, still a 10
Album hasn&#39;t aged well.
lol
Fantano&#39;s acknowlegement&gt; Grammy/Certified Platinum Awards
Gotta love the Anthony fanboy vibe. Ngl, he&#39;s consistent
giving him 10 doesnt make you can say the n-word mr. Anthony.
let&#39;s be honest, this is not the first time we&#39;re here
An album like this comes once in a lifetime. <br>It‚Äôs the most hard beats album. <br>It‚Äôs the most lyrically smart album. <br>And if you don‚Äôt think this is the best album ever made, <br>then you the worst guy ever made.
This album is terrible.
I hear this and I can hear why it&#39;s &#39;good&#39;, the point I want to make is how the type of music you grow up with is ingrained in you and influences the types of stuff you&#39;ll find easier to like when you grow up, that&#39;s unless you constantly make the effort to push yourself out of your comfort zone and make concerted efforts to embrace new and different sounds.<br>It&#39;s the same with sport, you&#39;re likely to have a tendency toward the sports you were exposed to when you&#39;re little. Things that &#39;run in the family&#39; as it were. <br>Yes there are exceptions to this.<br>So I feel I should and I want to expose myself to this &#39;type&#39; of music for my own benefit because I want that enrichment. But at the same time I often find it needs perseverance because my life history of listening to music from day one, and the music my ears and brain therefore receive more readily,  doesn&#39;t generally and naturally encompass styles and cultures like this.
You sound like a wiki page
I literally only came to your channel to find the original damn boy he thick boy video. This ain&#39;t it lmao
That &quot;Bam&quot; in the beginning was so smooth.
Who else wanted to see fantano&#39;s reaction to the interview. Still the best album yet
This is a classic review
This is Fantano&#39;s Magnum Opus.
I can&#39;t believe you forgot to mention the best song in the album. &quot; How much a dollar cost&quot;.
The only problem this album had is that people have been trying to make an album like this but failing because this is one of a fucking kind
I guess how much a dollar cost was on gkmc
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=655">10:55</a> nice one melon
Angelic funkadelic. Angelic rockadekic.
It kinda sucks that melon head didn‚Äôt say anything about How Much a Dollar Cost. I think that track was extremely paradigm shifting.
I revisit TPAB maybe twice a year or so. I think it might genuinely be the best album to come out in the last 20, maybe even 30 years. Every single time I visit it again, I enjoy it just as much as the first time I put it on. Absolutely incredible as a piece of art, and endlessly memorable. It really was an instant classic, and I really hope its legacy shines further into the future. One of my absolute favorite albums of all time, one of the best I&#39;ve ever had the pleasure of listening to. <br><br>If for whatever reason, you haven&#39;t spent time with TPAB, absolutely do it now. The album&#39;s amazing on all sides while maintaining a very diverse and captivating tracklist that all carry extremely strong, relatable lyrics. Check it out if you haven&#39;t, go back to it for a while if you have. It&#39;s worth your time, every time.
‚ÄúI know you want to save the world Huey, but sometimes people need to learn lessons on their own, the hard way.‚Äù -White Shadow from The Boondocks
It&#39;s 4 am, I&#39;m going to bed
I always love just how excited Fantano is at the beginning for this review
Kendrick Lamar  &gt; Eminem. <br>I&#39;m sorry
You instantly realize this is from 2015 because the upload date says so.
Its weird be argentinian, dont understand english and see fantano acting and smreaming ._.
This album is so fucking incredible. the way kendrick can iterate every political/ethical conversation into widely accessible songs to the masses, while giving the album the layers it needs, is beautiful.
This is the TPAB of album reviews
you only gave him a ten cuz he&#39;s white.
:0
A 10 out of 10 score on a Needledrop review is like trying to take the high ground over Obi-Wan.

The album was <b>alright</b>
here before 100k likes
5 years ago
U just lost yourself a sub
I love seeing people happy, this man looks so happy when he reviews this I love that.
giving it a 10 just because kendrick is white is an odd reason
good review, but u forgot the part where he blatantly copied one of the greatest albums of all time good intentions
I listen to all different types of music and have love for a lot of artist but this is my favorite album of all time.
my man really did the intro to These Walls for 8 whole minutes
The song of these walls could talk is actually about Kendrick taking advantage of a girl who‚Äôs boyfriend killed his friend a long time ago but got a light sentence because he snitched on his friend and that‚Äôs even why it says ‚ÄúI remember you was conflicted, misusing  your influence, abusing my power full of resentment.‚Äù He‚Äôs taking advantage of this girl with his power of being a famous rapper to sort of enact revenge against the guy who killed his friend
Who&#39;s here after he gave the new album a 3/10???? yo Fantano stop reviewing!!!
Dude has fourteen out of sixteen songs as his favorite songs üòÇ
Fantastic fucking review. I learned so much about the album I didn‚Äôt know
this man really gave TPAP a -3
I don‚Äôt get this album at all
Wow, it&#39;s me the real Kendrick Lamar. Thanks, Fantano you&#39;re my number 1 favorite person.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1">0:01</a> I love how he pauses for a second to build up tension to announce his name

instead of having a classics week in 2021 you should rank the best albums of a previous decade
Smh he didn&#39;t even mention the heavy influences from Logic&#39;s supermarket album

GOAT review
I love this album so much! 6/10
No one:<br>Melon: Pome
Anthony Fanta
holy shit i was just watching shameless season 10 episode 6 (i think) and Mikey legit stops a girl from stealing some shirt from a store... and its that EXACT PLAD SHIRT. Even told the girl &quot;why the fuck would you steal this piece of garbage.&quot; life is weird
Keep in mind that if cal chuchesta didn‚Äôt hype up Anthony when giving the rating this album might have only gotten a 7/10. Thanks cal!
Glad you gave it the rating it deserved. Amazing album and review. I rate it 0/10
Yep this is definately a 10, got an average of 96 from 101 publications. Shouldve beat 1989 taylor swift for album of the year
You gave it a 10 because the album cover only has white people on it
Dreamy creamy neo-soul needs to be an actual genre name
I remember you was conflicted
I like that you reviewed the album but you didn‚Äôt have to go on a twenty minute rant on how OJ Simpson didn‚Äôt do it and spank yourself whenever Kendrick says the N word
Giving this any less than a 10 would be criminal
Meh
Incredibly sexy
Mad overrated
This legit didn‚Äôt win album of the year, that kills me on the inside
I wonder if kendrick will release a somewhat similair album or even just a track about blm because of everything going on i would love to see it
Section.80 -8<br>GKMC- 10<br>TPAB- 10<br>DAMN- 9
melon? melon? melon?
As a metalhead who rarely goes out of his way to listen to other stuff, I decided to finally give Kendrick Lamar a try. I listened to Section.80 and GKMC, and I‚Äôm upset that I‚Äôve been missing out on this art. Kendrick has an amazing ability to write compelling and in depth stories in his lyrics and flows while not giving up awesome instrumentals and just overall catchy music. It‚Äôs artists like this that make me wanna venture off into more hip hop music. I‚Äôm onto TPAB and I‚Äôm so interested in how it‚Äôs supposed to top his previous 2, since I just cannot stop listening to them.<br><br>EDIT: TPAB is one of the best albums ever
To Pimp A Butterfly, even with no context, is one of the most beautiful album titles I‚Äôve ever heard
The fact you like Kendrick Lamar does not give you the right to say the n-word so many times. Unsubscribed
You gave this album a 10 out of 100!? But why??
Fantano could trash my all time favourite album and I would still lick his boot
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1092">18:12</a> * Predicts DAMN *
i like the pomes on this album
How black people can talk about politics in their album but white man can&#39;t ..
Kendrick Lamar is our Bob Dylan
shoutout to the boys who just got this on homepage this a classic
Watching him fangirl over TPAB is what&#39;s keeping me sane these days. üòÇüôåüèæ
fuck you

review Iann Dior Album plz
Not my proudest fap
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=727">12:07</a><br><br>Not incorrect
Literally his best review
wesley&#39;s theory is my favorite song of this album, my favorite kendrick song, and the best intro track of all time in my opinion
Still think my favourite bit of the entire album is at the end of Mortal man when he‚Äôs finished talking about the caterpillar and the butterfly, and he goes ‚Äú... Pac?...Pac??‚Äù And it cuts off on the last word I just love that so much it made me so sad that 2pac was gone too soon, him and Kendrick would have absolutely killed it on a track together.
I love how expressive he is compared to many other reviews that ive seen. He seems genuinely proud of kendrick for becoming the artist he became back then and still is now :)
I thought it was nice that Anthony laid out a poem of his own between the cuts. Starting at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=366">6:06</a> his poem reads: &quot;And further, poem &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot; interview makes while showing.&quot; I thought this was a cute try to mimic the theme but you really should stick to reviewing. Sort of a pretentious poem and it&#39;s not very good. Still a 10/10 interview.
It&#39;s hard to believe this album actually exists
When I first mindlessly listened to this album I thought Kendrick was just straight up autistic with no taste in music.<br><br>Quickly dismissing it, I returned to my monotonous lifestyle of Drake, pop music and K-pop music. One day I remember simping on some girl as Drake taught me from &quot;Marvins Room&quot; and was browsing Spotify looking at random music in a state of dysphoria. Surprise surprise, To Pimp a Butterfly happened to show. My mind was basically numb at that point, so I just said &#39;Why the hell not?&quot; and began listening to this album from the very first track, without shuffle. <br><br>What happened next, I can&#39;t really describe. All I can say is that this album changed my life, and encouraged me to abandon all that normie bullshit, and embark on the pursuit of finding the the next best album, exposing myself to the artistry of various talented artists buried in the cesspool of pop music, which I may have never had the chance to listen to before.
Oh, so when Kendrick makes an album you give it a 10, but when Kendrick makes an album you give it a 7? Really shows your bias in artists
I would give this a 10 as well
I can&#39;t believe George Clinton was both a president and a singer... Talented dude.
good album
TRAN- its four am
Didn&#39;t like the album
The interview with Tupac is what makes this album extraordinary. Kendrick‚Äôs a genius and we must be really happy to have such an artist in our generation.
This is not only a pinnacle album for rap and Kendrick, this is a pinnacle video for Anthony Fantano
Doesn&#39;t &quot;Institutionalized&quot; sound like something off Quasimoto&#39;s &quot;Unseen&quot; LP like maybe the song &quot;come on feet&quot;
am I the only one who goes back to this video every once in a while
You can tell he really enjoyed the album from the thumbnail
I dont know why have i watched this more than thrice.
You know it‚Äôs a good album when not even Anthony is certain about  what his least favorite track is
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=21">0:21</a> ekh
Jesus Mortal Man is accurate
Great video, Anthony, but did you have to introduce yourself as ‚ÄôNithony Ggatano?
you only give damn a 7 but you give this a 10? i don&#39;t even know who to pimp a butterfly is
4 great albums in 4 tries. Can‚Äôt tell me he isn‚Äôt the best (not my favorite) rapper of the 2010s
Dude, why the zero, thought this album was good. Totally disagree, it is not a 0/10
Definitely one of my favourite albums of all time
W
Can&#39;t wait to see my kids studying TPAB in school
he looks so happy and unbroken here
Bam!
Ten sounds weird from those lips

legendary review
I come back to this video because I love seeing Anthony so happy to review music. We have always been two good friends that both love music.
watching whilst taking a phat shit
Flash forward to 2020, people really have the audacity to question kendricks loyalty to the black community for not tweeting during the George Floyd prostest smh
This review gets me really excited for some reason
Who`s watching this in 2020 during the riots?
it‚Äôs 4 am I‚Äôm going to bed.
It‚Äôs 4 am. I‚Äôm going to bed.
amazing. HOWEVER, for me the most beatiful song in this album is how much a dollar cost, and melon doesn&#39;t even inform us of its existence, which is dissapointing
‚Äúwhy hasnt kendrick talked about blm?‚Äù<br>he did... like 2 albums...
i understand if u didn‚Äôt like the album but you didn‚Äôt have to call him the n word
Shit, it IS 4am, and I just watched this before I go to bed. All the shit happened lately makes me going back to TPAB.
10 !!!!!!!!!! WTF
Lester
it feels good to see rap‚Äôs best album produce anthony‚Äôs best review
youre hot
This album was booooring
The dude literally started to talk Pac in the afterlife god bless his soul
who here after ksi&#39;s new video
Idk I just thought this album was shit
Who came to see what is theneedldrop most rated song form ksi vid
Ur gay
Ur gay
Im glad he recognizes the greatness of this album. Well thought out video.<br><br><br>Unsubscribed üôÑ
Look how happy young melon was back then where did the days go
It‚Äôs only become more relevant.
Never been more relevant than now
Here cuz of recent events
5 years later and this album still breaks ground and takes on new meaning, especially with the uprising in George Floyd&#39;s name.
I wish somebody loved me like Melon loves TPAB
why this is recommended
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1092">18:12</a> thought I was listing to the end of damn their for a sec
wow Anthony, this review was extremely well-done. Not only did you effectively convey all of your main points with reasons for those points, but I agreed with every single one of them. Once again, just a job well done.<br><br>Unsubscribed, blocked, and reported
Who&#39;s watching during the coronavirus &amp; riots of 2020?
i just realized its George Clinton and not bill Clinton. no wonder I never heard him on the album
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=621">10:21</a>
Sorry Anthony, I&#39;m blind. Do you mind reading the title of the Boris Gardiner track?
its 4am, imgointabed
Its rare to see Antho starting off a review with a smile.
Riot time
Went from being possibly the best album of the decade to being THE album of the decade
you only gave it a 10 because you liked it
Kinda weird to think this record came out five years ago. Feels like it hasn‚Äôt aged a day.
The song u changed my life and helped me heal from the trauma of some bad trips
Teethony Pabtano
Say what you want about Fantano, you could tell by this review that he truly is passionate about music. The true bliss on his face is all over this video, while I disagree with some of his review, I will say that he is real, and he does really care about music.
this is not a review, it&#39;s a love letter
I entered the world of rap / hip hop thanks to this album, I have listened to many classic albums of the genre since then but none have listened to it as many times and with as much obsession as TPAB, for me this is one of the best albums of the century.
Antony has such rosy cheeks
When I think about section 80, I remember that Brenda had a baby
reply button <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=621">10:21</a>
I‚Äôd never herd a single song from this album (except ‚ÄòI‚Äô from Forza horizon 3 or 4) and I‚Äôm sad I missed it when it came out. Glad I herd it now though. A+
This is the TPAB of reviews
I don&#39;t liked it.
You don‚Äôt have to like it but you have to respect, so this album should‚Äôve gotten a higher rating
Imagine what the like/dislike ratio would be if he gave this a 0
Your a trash as reviewer
I watch this video at least twice a year
Cheemse
i watch this video too often
<b>bam</b>
TPAB Five Years Later? üòÆ
A Truly Great record...might have to use a new scoring range like 0 ‚Äì11 !!!!! just for this album...I give it an 11
Best album ever made change my mind cunts
He called it all the way back then ‚ÄúBest Album of the Decade‚Äù
I hope whatever happened to Kendrick happens to Denzel Curry‚Ä¶
I dont really the vibe in this album. I think all the other ones are better.
This is Anthony‚Äôs greatest review. Meanwhile the MBDTF review is a dingy piss goblin hybrid dwarf tentacle eldritch monster.
review weezer
Mans always sucks Kendrick off
this lets argue is trash. he dint even show the tweets.
Im annoyed i just listened to this album
Spot on!
The only reason I come back to this video is for cal.
&quot;I cannot thank Viper enough for writing the entirety of &#39;To Pimp A Butterfly&#39; for me&quot; - Kendrick Lamar
He looks so excited to review this album
I hope he caught all the little details that he missed originally like the reference to the killing of his homies brother on these walls, the contrast between kendrick boasting on his Compton enemies on king Kunta while later empowering his community e.g. in I or the meaning of how much a dollar cost as well as the end of the blacker the berry. I&#39;m sure he has tho. The fact that he already had so much praise for this album and still didn&#39;t even mention some of it&#39;s greatest moments just shows how much of a 10 it is
You would have given it a ten if he was white
Let‚Äôs agree: this is the greatest album of all time
This review still gives me goosebumps lol
If you think TPAB is a perfect 10 and you‚Äôre not black then you‚Äôre actually racially insensitive because you‚Äôre claiming to get maximum enjoyment from an art form you‚Äôre not capable of fully understanding and therefore appropriating black culture
remember when he used to consider 5 minutes a long review?
Again there&#39;s a difference between a Black artist and a wack Artist.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=536">8:56</a> we all know what statistic u wanted to say AntkneeüôÑ
How could anyone dislike this review? It‚Äôs the most thoughtful, and well scripted review I‚Äôve ever seen. He explained exactly what kendrick was aiming towards showing with this masterpiece, and I feel bad for the people who disliked this video who will never know just how much this album will impact hip hop throughout history.
I don‚Äôt understand this album.
You know shits real when Melon reads his name right.
I was screaming in the hotel room.
Your Video Sound Quality is shit Bro
it&#39;s 4 million views already!!!
&quot;it&#39;s not a story album.&quot; huh?
This is the best rap album of the decade no question. The second best is Long Live Asap in my eyes
God, Anthony. We get that you don&#39;t like the album but you don&#39;t have to use the n-word so much.
Back for my yearly visit to this video
This d*** ain‚Äôt free
5 years ago now... such a great album and review. Get this comment some attention. LOVE THIS<br><br>edit: 9 years now wow‚Ä¶
Best album of the year: ‚úÖ <br>Best album of the decade: ‚úÖ<br>Best album of the century: we‚Äôll see...
The excitement you see on Melon throughout the length of the video is just his impatient eagerness to finish recording and then pleasure himself to the album.
Who knew this was gonna be no. 1 album of the decade in Anthony&#39;s list
Just making sure the 10/10 is still here
I like how this is one of the most legendary reviews melon has done and it is out of focus
I like how the thumbnail is also the first frame of the video
Holy fuck it is 4 am and I should go to bed
Where&#39;s the blooper clip for this review?
I can&#39;t believe your least favorite song was UHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.....I GUESS YOU AIN&#39;T GOTTA LIE......IF I HAD TO PICK ONE.
He looks super happy n excited to review this one... just look at his face üíôüíôüíô
Kendrick stole this album from X
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=762">12:42</a> Melon what&#39;s the name of the song again?
bam
Great review, Anthony, but don‚Äôt you think it was a little unnecessary reciting the intro from ‚ÄúWesley‚Äôs Theory‚Äù for 22 minutes?
I always come back to this review after he gives a low score on an album I liked cos happy melon is good melon
This fool said &quot;bam&quot;
First
You guys think Kendrick saw this?
This was 5 years ago and nothing has changed
26 March 2020 and we gon be alright
So close to four million. This is easily one of your best, most historically significant, and impactful reviews.
i saw him smile so hard in the thumbnail that i knew he was gonna review it a 10/10
Revisiting this video, but I‚Äôve never seen melon this excited to review an album! He‚Äôs so energetic and passionate about sharing this album with everyone!
I just realized in the description that &quot;You Ain&#39;t Gotta Lie&quot; is your least favorite song... I don&#39;t get it. I enjoy that song tremendously. My least favorite is definitely Wesley&#39;s Theory -- I love this album but I never liked that song as an opener.
I‚Äôm surprised you didn‚Äôt have Hot Shower in your favourite tracks
Damn is way overhated
I just think it‚Äôs amazing how it was originally going to be named ‚ÄúTu Pimp A Caterpillar‚Äù TUPAC
You only gave Kendrick Lamar a 10/10 because he‚Äôs white
I really see the speedin bullet to heaven influence
the POAM
I‚Äôve never seen a melon so full of juice
‚ÄúAnthony hates rap‚Äù
5 year anniversary today. <br>Fav track!??
Wow Anthony I can&#39;t believe you spent the whole review moaning and saying &quot;this dick ain&#39;t free&quot;
This album is 5 years old now damn
When Anthony pointed at me I felt fear
What‚Äôs that Boris gardener song called, Anthony?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=733">12:13</a> i just got called a basic bitch by anthony fantano...
okay guys, correct me if i&#39;m wrong, but if i&#39;m not mistaken, i think i might remember u was conflicted.
This review is a strong 9 I love when he nerds out about how much he likes a record
I‚Äôve never seen Melon so happy about an album
I know you were just saying the name of the Boris Gardiner record, but I think it&#39;s a bit insensitive to smile profusely while saying the n word, Melon. Liked and unsubscribed.
Snoop Dogg can simultaneously be featured on one of the best records of the decade, and the undoubtedly worst one. What an absolute fucking legend.
:)
Hip-hop about the hardships of the African American community...how refreshing.
Tpab = Strong 6<br><br>Damn = Strong 6.5<br><br>I think Tpab is highly overrated, and DAMN might not be as complex but song wise there way more enjoyable
I love this album so much üò≠üò≠ü§©
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1310">21:50</a><br>Cal&#39;s reaction is too good

Never seen anthony so happy
Let&#39;s all take a moment to acknowledge the fact that this influential masterpiece of an album lost album of the year to Taylor Swift&#39;s 1989. They don&#39;t call it the Scammys for nothing ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüåö
Good review as always but you really didnt have to call Kendrick the hard-r N word so many times...
I listened to this album for the very first time about a month ago, I was totally blown away. It was nothing similar to anything I had ever listened to before. The jazz influences, the changing beats, the production on the whole was totally unique and, to me, unorthodox, yet amazing. And the superb skill shown by Kendrick is second to none, the versatility of his flows, his different tones of voice and his personal insights, all accompanied by a lyrically remarkable technique, showed and proved to me that all the hype was fully deserved. And by the end of the record I got the picture of the album being like a description of a black man, but still holding Kendrick&#39;s personal thoughts and insights towards himself and his community. And I caught all of this while being an outsider, as I live in Argentina and have never experienced anything remotely close to what Kendrick, and black people in general, have. A true masterpiece.
IM SO TIRED OF CULTURE VULTURESüôÑüôÑüôÑ
Bam
Oh my. It is Matthew Santoro‚Äòs twin brother ü§Ø
Probs gonna get hate for this but in my eyes TPAB is his weakest 10/10
Album of the decade baby
Ahhhhhhhhhh<br>                            ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Anthony, i need that sloppy
and no we have more mumble rap and flexing than ever
This is still my favorite review because of the detail he goes into on the album and when you listen to it again after it, it opens a whole door of things you didn‚Äôt realize were there
This is anthony&#39;s magnum opus
I‚Äôm sorry guys, I‚Äôm colorblind. Is it a green or yellow shirt? I just know it‚Äôs a good review shirt lol.
Anthon Fantano said dreamy creamy
Honestly I really think this should‚Äôve been a 10
TPAB &gt; MBDTF
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1266">21:06</a> <i>best record of the decade</i><br><b>angry Kanye sounds</b>
you aint gotta lie for least favorite track ?????<br>Really ???????
Lol, to answer the description, it&#39;s  not just maybe, or rap, it is the best album of the decade
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1313">21:53</a> classic
The album is so good, the review itself is a 10/10.
I never thought I&#39;d require a spoiler alert for an album but yeah. What a dick move, ant. Kiss my ass.
I wanna see Ben Shapiro react to the blacker the berry with the lyrics
every now and then i revisit this video because it‚Äôs refreshing to hear him say nothing but positive things about such an amazing album
You know it‚Äôs a good review when only half of the comments are memes
Anthony I understand your appreciation for this album but did you really have to say ‚ÄúGod, I‚Äôd give anything just to have a little bit of that sweet... SWEET black skin...‚Äù?
In my humble opinion, easily the best rap album of all time
It‚Äôs 4am. I‚Äôm going to bed.
I never really listened to or thought much about this album before your review. I knew it was really good and artistic but I just thought it was a slog to get through and is just just too metaphorical. But after your review, I listen to this album all the time and I realize how amazing it is.
I didn‚Äôt think we‚Äôd ever agree on something, glad to hear you thought this album was as overrated as I thought it was.
O god . Someone get him a towel, hes gunna blow everywhere.
Kendrick is the Avatar
&#39;&#39;Today, he&#39;s dropping what&#39;s possibly the best rap album of the decade&#39;&#39;, it turned out to be the best album of the decade as well.
The description was a forshadowing on how this would make the #1 album of the decade . which is facts
‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling a uuuhhhhh.......‚Äù<br>‚ÄúCome on....‚Äù<br>‚Äú10!‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYEAH!‚Äù<br>Everyone: hell yeah<br>Me, an intellectual: I MISS THE OLD MANG0, STRAIGHT FROM THE GO MANGO

How much a dollar cost is one of the best songs on the album
This review really has that ‚Äúbest album of the decade‚Äù energy
Wait does he not mention how much a dollar cost?
This dick ain‚Äôt free
Nicely done antknee
Best rap album of the decade more like<br><br>Best album of the decade
Similar to @L H , I didn‚Äôt agree when he said ‚ÄúI hate all black people‚Äù
Album of the Decade
Rodeo and To Pimp are the best albums of 2015.

This guy would call this ‚Äúthe album of the decade‚Äù in five years
Every song on this album is just iconic by itself
Album of the decade
Here after it was named best album of the decade üòä
Album of the decade confirmed by melon man himself
It&#39;s awesome to see how excited he is in the review. Remind me of myself at the first listening of this album.
IT&#39;S THE GREATEST ALBUMS OF THE DECADE!!! IT&quot;S OFFICIAL
With how long this review is and how excited and in depth he talks about TPAB throughout it, I would have been shocked if Fantano put it anywhere other than number 1 on his decade list.
Who‚Äôs here after melon gave this his number one album of the decade üëå
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1263">21:03</a> <br>Yes he did üî•üî•üî•
Who came back here after seeing that this is THE album of the decade<br><br>Edit: wow this &quot;who is here (insert here) actually gives you likes, no wonder why people do it so much, it&#39;s the easiest way to get likes
Who else is here after Melon ranked this #1 in the decade?
Back here after Fantano named TPAB the best album of the decade, and I have to agree. No album combined topical relevance with musical excellence like To Pimp a Butterfly did. Insanely proud of Fantano&#39;s growth since this review and how much positivity has been generated from here. <br><br><br>I hope to see more and more from both the Melon and the Mortal Man in the 2020s.
who came here after seeing &#39;Best 200 Albums&quot;

Who‚Äôs here from that good old decade video?
I said this when it came out, and I‚Äôll say it AGAIN. <br><br>This is the BEST ALBUM of the decade.
Hey guys 2020 guy here to confirm this album has aged perfectly
I‚Äôm gonna write an album that deserves this type of review.
TRAN-<br><br><br>...It&#39;s 4 AM

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1093">18:13</a> he predicted DAMN.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1144">19:04</a> gives me goosebumps
7 at the most bruh half the songs are wack
Why does this guy sound like Walter white when he gets kinda aggressive
Mbdtf better
I&#39;m sure one of these songs will be in the next GTA
This album made me black
Honestly, J. Cole is the Underdog in Hip Hop
Hard to believe this album is only 4 years old. <br>It‚Äôs such a standby and so widely accepted as one of the best of all time that it feels like it was made 20 years ago
Don‚Äôt you think this is a bit of an overkill for a review? You ranted about how bad this album is for more than 20 minutes and even gave it a 1 AND a 0.
I literally hate this album, I don&#39;t understand why anyone likes rap music in general
Best album of the decade, not even close
Watching or the last time this decade
If Father Kendrick Grips made this youd give it a 10
it&#39;s 4 am, i&#39;m goin&#39; to bed
How much a 10 really cost?
The only rap album this project co-exists with on the same level is infamous by Mobb deep. Those 2 albums in my opinion define rap and prove that it‚Äôs more than a glorification of violence and drugs. They tell a story and give you a glimpse of what it‚Äôs like to be in their shoes.
You know it‚Äôs gonna be a good review when he wears the yellow flannel
Tran...... It&#39;s 4am. I&#39;m going to bed. üòÇ
I wonder if Kendrick eventually watched this. I know he avoids checking criticism, praise and reviews. He wants people to live with the album before making up their mind.
Definitely in the top 10 Hip-Hop albums of all time. Top 5 though? Maybe! The messages spread on this album are just incredible and insightful and there&#39;s a lot of it. Beautiful album from the start to finish. That poems and conversion with Pac gets to me. Even though I don&#39;t come from those types of neighborhoods, I have dealt with a lot of the shit he talks about, especially as a minority, as a Hispanic.<br><br>Racism, poverty, no father growing up, the extra work to prove yourself... It&#39;s been tough. I&#39;ve moved around all my life never growing roots. That&#39;s different for sure. But something I only find people understand when they go through it. I can&#39;t explain it all and won&#39;t but this album, I connect with. I feel his stories and emotions. The history of the city and the history of him and his surroundings.
How the fuck Anthony listens For Free and think for a sec if it was garbage or genius? Btw i love u
Imo Maad City &gt; TPAB
TPAB √°lbum of the decade.

‚ÄúWhite people suck‚Äù -Melon 2015
coming back to this its crazy to me how this album had already been labeled the best album of the decade 6 years before the end of the decade
When you said that many people died,<br>I felt that
i dont think ive ever seen melon this excited about a project before
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg">0:00</a> Intro<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=30">0:30</a> quick review<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=60">1:00</a> endless rant on the kkk
So you&#39;re basically saying that Kendrick is going big and we should suck his dick?
I&#39;m really sorry, but does anyone remember the score scene being different earlier? like he didn&#39;t shout &quot;Ten&quot;, it&#39;d been pronounced quetly and with bit of disbelief...<br>Some Mandela shit for me
after the second verse of U, you can hear Kendrick sobbing.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1326">22:06</a>
To pimp a butterfly isn‚Äôt that good, he gave it a 10 because of the point he‚Äôs trying to send. So what I have to say is that Good kid maad city is best album of all time thank you for listening to the truth.
This album better than anything tupac ever released
Tpab is the best raper
Kendrick Lamar is the greatest rapper of all time
Didn‚Äôt he post a video where the Drake &amp; Josh soundtrack got the 10 instead of TPAB?
My favorite part apart Kendrick is he released two albums back to back, one being very mainstream (in Good Kid, madd City) and using the mainstream attention to bring attention to problems he brings up in the more conceptual way of Too Pimp a Butterfly.
EVERY MELON IS A STAR
it&#39;s 4 am, i&#39;m going to bed
10/10 by melon is like getting a gift from god
This. Melon. Ain&#39;t. Freeeee
not a negative comment in this video
Time for melonmas 2019
Predicting this to be Anthony&#39;s #1 in his top albums of the decade list
Kendrick is the new Andr√©
people always say that fantano is only ever negative but just remember that this is his most popular video.
Existential
I wish I could listen to this album again for the first time
This album the goat
Hey anthony, when is the To Pimp a Butterfly review coming out?
this and Blackstar are the two best albums in years, and 2 of the greatest of all time. Change my mind.

Ain&#39;t gonna lie. I just got back to this album almost end of this year 2019. It&#39;s a masterpiece one of the best concept albums I&#39;ve ever heard. It&#39;s just an amazing srtistic hard working expression. I&#39;m again mind blowed by this. In ten years ima gonna be listening this. A work of art. Every single word and chord of it. No words to describe it.
Definitely my favorite Kendrick album.  So funk and jazz inspired and a homage to hip hops glory days of late 90‚Äôs and early 2000‚Äôs.
I‚Äôve never seen Fantano with more life in his eyes since this review.<br><br>...<br> I think Anthony is dying....
A light 6
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1263">21:03</a> <b>and now he&#39;s made what *is</b> the best rap record of the decade
The poem....and the entire time he is telling the poem to Pac......that was freaking genius.
Do u have cancer?
You fucking suck
Guess who is on my list to get a douchebag mug from urban dictionary!!!<br>This guy has got to be in on the latest<br><br><br> extortion attempt
I still won&#39;t forgive fatano for putting you ain&#39;t gotta lie as his least favorite track
melon emphatically declaring &quot;tHiS dIcK aIn&#39;T fReEeEeEeE&quot; was everything i didn&#39;t know i needed
i think this will be the last truly great album kendrick makes. he&#39;s too huge now. feels bad.
i don‚Äôt understand why this is a meme
Can someone help me get into this album? I seriously want to but just can&#39;t get attracted to it for whatever reason /: I&#39;m a fan of lots of his singles
Be my friend
Can u review the neighborhood‚Äôs first lp
Anthony I understand you liked the album and you&#39;re excited but please stop calling Kendrick the n word
Maaaaaaaaaaan, you didn&#39;t even mention Alright?
this video makes me cry
Its 2019 now and this album sounds dated.
Meh. Shit sucks. Stupid name.
Bro imma be honest if ANY album deserves a 10 its THIS ONE!!!
This was a good review Anthony, i‚Äôm feeling a decent 4 on this one
wtf
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=680">11:20</a> something something ogres something something layers
Rename the review to &quot;Anthony ejaculates for 22 minutes&quot; .
My favorite album by Kdot with Good Mad City
Ok I watched you, now get out of my recommendations

Anybody else here for the flannel?
I think TPAB is the best album in hip hop and one of 20 best albums of all time.
<b>KENDRICK‚ÄôS JUST BITCHING ABOUT BEING BLACK IN AMERICA</b><br><b>KENDRICK THINKS WHITE PEOPLE SUCK</b><br>TPAB= 0/10
One of his best reviews
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1">0:01</a> lol you could legit tell he was about to make a name pun again but he changed his mind
TRAN<br><br><br><br>it‚Äôs 4 am I‚Äôm going to bed
I am shocked that Kendrick Lamar copied The Big Day. smh.
Who know the Psedo, woo!
It&#39;s time to crack this album. <br>Wish me luck!
I&#39;m feeling a light to decent six
Cal‚Äôs reaction the Anthony giving the album a 10
Four years later it&#39;s my favorite rap album and in my Top 10 favorites period, I absolutely love it.
TPAB is one of the greatest albums of the damn decade. I had been a rock snob but this was the album that helped get me into hip hop. That and his TPAB Grammy performance
So it‚Äôs a Me10n?
I didn&#39;t really like where you called Kendrick Lamar the n word with a hard R.
lesson learned. dont listen to the comments.
Section 8.0 - 8.5<br>Good kid mad city - 9.2<br>To pimp a butterfly - 10<br>Damn - 8.8
Yea yea yea yea yea yea
What happened to this happy, positive melon
I remember watching this reveiw for the first time and the thing that hooked me the most was how Kendrick conversation&#39;s with 2pac (R.I.P) and how he managed to did it. It was really mind-blowing and amazing.
Key word pop appeal!! Is where I exit
IF KENDRICKS NEXT STUDIO ALBUM IS A 8 OR HIGHER <br>HE HAS THE BEST CATALOGUE IN HIP HOP @ME
Who has as a good a first 4 albums as Kendrick <br>???
i wasn‚Äôt sure if i should like this album or not until this video came out, thanks melon
I personally like good kid mad city more tbh
kendricks next album: <br>to pimp a melon
This album is a 6/10 on a good day. I don‚Äôt understand the hype even after several listens.
I hate that he overuses red and yellow flannels now for clickbait
I hear people sometimes compare Kendrick to 2pac but I see him as already way ahead of that. No shade on 2pac, he was great and had a great message, but the technical prowess of Kendrick‚Äôs rapping, conscious lyrics, conceptual projects all done in style and still being relatable is unparalleled. He is the greatest the world has ever known in my opinion.
What an amazing review, like fucking hell. Fantano is clearing doing what he&#39;s mean to be doing - reviewing music. What a guy
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=375">6:15</a>
I feel like anyone who gets a 10 from Anthony should get an award
Momma,U,Heart part 2 is the best kendrick songs ever
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1322">22:02</a><br>Those moves are panty soakers.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=422">7:02</a> I swear I didn&#39;t see that coming and had me busting üò≠üò≠üò≠ why he do Kendrick like that
He didn&#39;t talk about all the satanic references in Lucy
I listened to this album for the first time (except for Alright because i heard it before and liked it) in early 2016: a little after i started catching on to Kendrick. The first listen, I absolutely hated it. Sounded like a terrible album. Boy was i wrong. It took a few listens and many visits to Genius to figure out what Kendrick&#39;s ideologies and messages are. I cannot really relate to anything he says in TPAB but the album is shaped in a way that anyone can find enjoyment in it no matter what music you are into: especially hip hop, jazz, and abstract kind of music. Now, after many listens, These Walls, Alright, Wesley&#39;s Theory, and u are some of my favorite Kendrick songs and this album is definitely my favorite of his albums.
volksgeist üòê
Sometimes I just come back to this review to hear my boy Anthony say ‚Äúbam‚Äù at the beginning
B R U H, you ain‚Äôt gotta lie CANT be your least favorite track it CANT oh my G O D
The beauty of this is that Anthony, having listened to an album that he adores, crafts a review where does everything in his power to only  translate the love he has for the album. The sign of not only a great critic but a passionate one too

I had never seen Anthony so happy.
The Blacker the Melon the Better the Juice
This album is a top 3 HipHop album OAT, Kendrick is a top 3 OAT. Don&#39;t @ me.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=683">11:23</a> <b>Clenches fists, desperately trying to avoid obvious Shrek joke</b>
I personally think that tpab is a 10 aswell. It sucks.
No way. This dick head gave a album a 10!
Honestly, I hated the album
4 years later and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1317">21:57</a> still gets me wet
I liked the review but why did you say you follow and like nazis ?
You only gave him a 10 cause he&#39;s white
I love how happy and excited Anthony is while doing the review
Notice how he said BAM and I feel like he knew the next project was DAMN
I come back to this review for the energy
Roses are red<br>Bees live in a Hive<br>You cane here for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1315">21:55</a>

No album can be perfect. But hey, still a good critic, Kenthony Lathano.
Giving this album a 10 just because Kendrick Lamar appeared on it was a bit too extreme don‚Äôt you think
My guy Kung Fu Kenny really just pulled 2Pac from Cuba and asked him questions
Greatest rap album ever.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=681">11:21</a> Melon goes Shreko Mode

Fuckin love how excited melon is in this video. I revisit it often
I can&#39;t believe you would say You Ain&#39;t Gotta Lie is your least favorite track, you crazah?!
First album - 7<br>Second album -8<br>Third album-5<br>Fourth album-8<br>Fifth album-9<br>6th album-7<br>7th album-10<br>8th album-8
This ain‚Äôt this ain‚Äôt spaz rap<br>This that this that jazz rap
Its funny how I listen to this review after I finish the album every time. It became a ritual for me.
Unpopular opinion:<br>GKMC &gt; TPAB
The Greatest Rap Album Of All Time.
Hum, in my pov, it is one of the best albums of the decade, I listened to every genre, as long as the music is good, there are not so many better albums than this one...
Fuck you<br>You Ain&#39;t Gotta Lie is fucking fantastic, one of my favorites
Besides this what else has anthony. Given,a 10
TPAB is so good that I keep coming to this review because even this is amazing.
WE GOTTA 10 EVERYONE<br>RING BELLS<br>BANG THE DRUMS<br>THIS CALLS FOR A CELEBRATION
i just realized that this album (tpab) was originally supposed to be called to pimp a caterpillar: (tpac) t(u)pac. ü§Ø
Idk how to explain this but fantano is funny but I rarely laugh at him. I just sit there and appreciate it
Great video Anthony but did you have to go on a 3 minute rant supporting bus segregation in the middle of the review?
famous
Okay you went a little far when you said, &quot;Every other rapper should just quit bc no one will beat Kendrick.&quot;
2 Pimp.A. Caterpillar = 2Pac   <br>2 Pimp a Butterfly = 2Pac&#39;s ascension, transformation, and influence living on in Kendrick
Its 4am, im going to bed.
Spoilers üò°üò°üò°
bam
To pimp a butterfly means to pimp or take advantage of the butterfly (the butterfly is his opportunity coming out of his good kid maad city album). In wesleys theory it explains how when he gets outta the hood that he is going to get a bunch of luxury items and take his homies with him. In the track king kunta it explains how he is now the king of hip hop and on top of the world. In institutionalized it explains how he is always going back to compton but not doing the things he promised in wesleys theory. In these walls its saying how he is abusing his position as a celebrity to get laid. In u is where Kendrick realizes that he has not been doing the things that he promised and feels that he should be taking blame on how people are still dying in compton and that he is selfish for not trying to fulfill his promise in the second part in track in sing about me im dying of thirst from good kid maad city where he was baptized and was told to help the youth of compton. In alright he explains that whats mine is yours and that now hes back everything will be alright. Now everything is going to tale me a deeper listen but after revisiting this album i am still pulling things outta it.
I bet everyone commenting is white
dude, the things that surprises me the most about this review is how accurate the automatic subtitles are. like, wtf.
tran !<br>its 4am.
Idk why but i love listening to u talk,  if u were my teacher I‚Äôd prob learn some shit
&quot;LOOK BOTH WAYY BEFORE YOU CROSS MY MINDDD!!&quot; ;)
Okay, Anthony. I see what you did there at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=655">10:55</a>
came back way late to leave a thumbs up!
damn, I came
Every other album is trash after  tpab
Kendrick Lamar is the Goat
So what you&#39;re saying is, Taylor Swift had no business winning the Album of the Year Grammy...
I remember first hearing Kendrick on overly dedicated and section.80 and I knew he was the chosen one destined to save humanity
This album is great, but projared cheated on his wife
Review damn chronic
Never seen a melon so horny
Lmao he called for free? For sale
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=193">3:13</a> Dreamy Creamy Keemy
The yellow flannel was made just to give TPAB a 10
It‚Äôs 4am. I‚Äôm going to bed.
10
That chronic in the back though.
I swear &quot;Kendrick&#39;s just bitching about being black in America&quot; and &quot;Kendrick just thinks white people suck&quot; are both things I&#39;ve heard on fox news this year
I‚Äôm back to see the 10 rating
I&#39;m in an argument with a friend which is better Wesley&#39;s Theory or King Kunta?
Melon Lowkey Sounding Like The Movie Trailer Guy Voice
This is the 10iest 10 of all time. Easily the best of all the 10s
anthony really is the greatest reviewer on earth. He said he felt like he was watching an elaborate stage show. Kdot prob did some of the sickest live stage performances with this album.
What was the name of that song sampled in the beginning again?
Listen fantano i dont find you very credible but i love this review good job
Honestly its overrated. (Please don&#39;t hurt me)
I love the line that says, &quot;the next pop you hear blah blah blah&quot; then the last word of Mortal Man is, &quot;POP!&quot;.
I haven&#39;t listened to all of his music, but imo Section 80 has had the most staying power to me.
Review this review
I come back to this review once and a while just to reaffirm my faith in humanity
I come back every 5 or so months just to remind myself how damn good this album was and still is! 10/10
Seeing Anthony this happy and excited gets me happy üòä
love dat thumbnail to video transition
section 80: 8<br>gkmc: 10<br>tpab: 10<br>uu: 8<br>damn: 8<br>black panther: 6
I luv watching melon cum
Absolutely since 10/10 for me. I fucking love his music so much
you should play instrumentals from the album in the background
I would argue this is the most important record in hip hop history.
This video is in my recommended section like twice a week yet somehow I still watch every time I see it
This and Blackstar are probably your two best reviews of all time
Good kid &gt;&gt;&gt; To pimp a butterfly
This dick ain&#39;t FREEEEEEEEEEE
To pimp a butterfly is a load of hype bullshit
Seeing that thumbnail made me hype and still does to this day
MBDTF and TPAB which is better?
Kendrick&#39;s exile on mainstream
These walls could be seen as a &quot;trendy&quot; beat.
i saw some bum make a list with the rankings of kenny albums so i thought i‚Äôd edit it bc he forgot some <br><br>Overly Dedicated- 6<br>Section.80- 8<br>GKMC- 10<br>TPAB- 20000<br>untitled unmastered- 7<br>DAMN- 8
That thumbnail is the face of a man who just finished writing his review for a 10 album right as his yellow flannel is done in the dryer.
4 years today ‚ù§
Happy 10/10 tpab day
Happy To Pimp a Butterfly got a 10 out of 10 day
Happy to pimp a butterfly got a 10 day
Institutionalized is an extremely underrated song
Happy birthday
Happy Birthday to this review
Happy anniversary
This needs to be added to the important videos playlist
One of the first times I agree with this review
I bet that Dr Dre guy who&#39;s picture is in the back is getting so much exposure off of this review.
10 outta 10 review it again
4 years, time fucking flies.
These reviews themselves are like classics to me
Goat fantano review
4 MORE DAYS BOYS
This album reminds me of Pink Floyd the wall a lot!
Why don&#39;t you marry him baldy
still watching this.
Cured my depression and ocd. I guess
10/10
4AM I&#39;m just getting started
this is still the tennest ten that fantano has ever given.

this album is SHIT compared to intellectual masterpiece ‚ÄúHarverd Dropout‚Äù
Overrated imo
I wish I could tag Kendrick to this video
Genuinely an amazing album üëåüçæ
I remember seeing the 10 pop up on screen and my first thought was ‚Äúoh so it‚Äôs purple‚Äù
yeah it was great but its my least heard kendrick album. I guess I just like more hype shit
You would of given it a Death Grips if it was ten.
I originally gave this an 8 but after hearing your deeper analysis I give it a 10, thanks Melon
I&#39;m not entirely sure about this, but I have a theory that he might like this album
To pimp a butterfly es mi √°lbum favorito de todos los tiempos
m
I just heard the first few songs in these albums and dear lord is it bad. I mean lyrically it&#39;s all swears, n words and sex related lyrics. And musically wTf was that. So terrible: As it is an hip hop album, it&#39;s good in rhythm but the melodies that exist are simple and annoying. I dont understand how anyone could possibly enjoy this.
Rap album of the decade? You mean century
Tpab is, I think, the greatest hip hop record ever made. Hell, it may be the best album period.
Came here after I bought and listened to TPAB on vinyl

Just remember this album lost to Taylor Swift at the Grammys!
This album is complete and utter garbage, yet you claim it is literally perfect, because you&#39;re a hack who has no taste
Your greatest thumbnail of all time.
i am not quite sure if 2018 tens can compare to TPAB :/
Honestly, thought it was shit
2019 IVE SEEN THIS REVIEW SO MANY TIMES
2019?
Anyone still watching this in 2019?!?!
Oh, here&#39;s that DAMN BOY HE THICK<br> Guy
I just got this on vinyl for xmas! But when i tried to put it on, the hole is slightly too small and doesn&#39;t fit comfortably on the spindle..anyone else run into this problem?
Lol imagine he gives the album a ten
Happy Melonmas!
But why does it get cold like minnesota?
Your head is extra shiny in this one melon
Merry melonmas!
Happy Melonmas!
I definitely agree this is a 10/10.
Ceh&#39;mon... Ceh&#39;mon... Ceh&#39;mon...

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1310">21:50</a>
This album will be one of the ones we still hear about when we are 50. Absolutely a timeless classic
I swear I thought this video started with BOOM instead of BAM.
I have never seen fantano this horny
TRAN.......... its 4am.
where earl review
I love how theres still 82 years left and people already declaring this the Best album of the century. I mean...i dont disagree.
who else thought he was gonna say the n word at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=762">12:42</a>
Can&#39;t even say nigga and gave it a 10 you a real one melon
Not gonna lie, I didn&#39;t enjoy it that much.
<b>7</b>
&quot;i&quot; studio version sucks ass compared to the live version in this masterpiece. It lacks any emotion.
I never get tired of this review but I watch it on special occasions and it&#39;s always worth it
i didnt really agree at the end when he gave the album a 0 at the end with the sole reason cited being the fact that kendrick is black, but other than that, great video, totally agree
Bro please do an OVERLY DEDICATED REVEW flash back to kendricks amazin mixtape
One thing I love about Kendrick is he&#39;s still down to earth and comes off as an every man. Not some glam show off, not some unstable egotist , not a pot head, a normal, smart guy.<br><br>The ending of the poem to <i>2Pac</i> still leaves me breathless. What&#39;s sad is someone points out that the poem represents not just Kendrick but Pac himself. The sad thing though is that Kendrick became a &quot;butterfly&quot; while Pac died before he had a chance to &quot;become the Butterfly&quot;.
Damn he didn‚Äôt even talk about ‚ÄúHow Much a Dollar Cost?‚Äù
<b>C R E A M Y</b>
How much a dollar cost is easily one of my favourite songs of all time
My fav tracks on this album is actually the first word spoken on the album
We should see Melons reactions to albums
Heloo
Poignance is not a word.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=654">10:54</a> &quot;This record does have a few bones to pick&quot; Nice.
To Pimp A Butterfly is in my opinion, one of the best hip hop album of all time
To Pimp a Butterfly will always be one of my favorite albums. Kendrick is the artist of a lifetime.
<a href="http://google.se/">Google.se</a>
Lovin‚Äô you is complicatED!!<br>LOVIN‚Äô YOU IS COMPLIcated.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=302">5:02</a> no agendas
Who&#39;s here after ksg and daughters 10/10
Kendrick can make a album with him just breathing and fantano would rate it ‚Äú10/10‚Äù
Peom idea reminds me a bit of wynton marsalis he and she
People are gonna talk about this album for far longer than ‚Äú1989‚Äù.
His emotions
for sale? is about the devil
How do we send you music to review?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1160">19:20</a> speak the truth
This boy got MELONoma
why can&#39;t Americans say &#39;poem&#39; ???? they say it like pommeeee lmao
This is the best album of all time. Not just rap or this decade. All time. There is not a dull or bad moment anywhere in the tracklist.
Rather listen to King Kendrick then boring pusha music pusha is no where near king
Who is watching this in 2018
Who cares if he is writing a love letter to tupac if the music doesnt sound good it isnt good
Album got deep ass meaning in it . It‚Äôs a shame not everyone listens to it enough to get it.Even without the meaning it sounds good so yea it‚Äôs a classic
I find Good Kid Maad City more listenable and enjoyable, with a more entertaining concept. All though I respect the album for the political masterpiece it is.
Damn boi! He thicc!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=621">10:21</a>
Almost forgot to watch this today.
It‚Äôs 4 am, I‚Äôm going to bed.
I personally don‚Äôt like rap. I just like hearing Anthony talk about rap.
Don&#39;t know about you but I still want NATION.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=13">0:13</a>
Aye 3 million views y&#39;all.<br>Melon was a man on a mission in this review y&#39;all

Yikes.
DROGAS wave better than this
To pimp a butterfly is a masterpiece
Momma, with knxwledge behind the beats was a beutiful song.
This<br>Dick<br>Aint<br>Freeeeeeee
honestly watching this for the first time. thank god he gave this masterpiece a 10 because it deserves nothing less
T H I S   I S   O V E R R A T E D
Kendrick Lamar<br>Paul McCartney<br>Michael Jackson<br>Elvis Presley<br>Prince<br>The 5 Gods of music
i dont see the hype? am i missing something? am i listening to the right album? it&#39;s decent at best. maybe im just not seeing it
Best rapper of our time
For me my least fav would be Institutionalized, it‚Äôs never quite fit in the album for me
1/10 should have been called 2PAC
Melon was so happy here
Imagine thinking kids see ghost is as good as this lol
His most viewed video
LENME TALK MY STU SCOTT
&quot;Even though this album has A FEW BONES TO PICK&quot;
Might be the best album of my 21 years of life
This many people died<br>feEL SOMETHing
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1314">21:54</a>
‚ÄòU‚Äô is one of the greatest hip hop songs ever.
Nah
3 million views for the greatest review in YouTube history. Long live To Pimp A Butterfly!!!!!!
This album is just so fucking good perfect timing for when it came out so many important topics covered and throughly explored on every song from self love to self hate to America‚Äôs race issues to just learning how to be yourself this album is so good that anyone from any creed or color can listen to this album and genuinely take away a powerful message from it a true modern classic and will almost certainly go down as a highlight in this generations music
3 mill
(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1133">18:53</a>) Best part of the review.
3M views Holy Shit
what a moment
Listening to this album on shuffle should be punishable by death
Everyone just comes here after watching the most recent review
3 million views hype
This album review is a classic
If melon didn‚Äôt give this masterpiece a 10 he would have been killed
You can hear the excitement in his voice
My favorite tracks were all of them but my least favorites were complexion, and institutionalized. They‚Äôre all ways the ones that I skip when I listen to the album.
still not topping the speedin bullet to heaven review üò§
Best review he&#39;s made
It&#39;s funny watching this and the Damn review. Congratulations Kendrick Lamar you might be the only artist to ever get a 10 from this guy
It&#39;s 4AM i&#39;m going to bed
Is this the only 10/10
Still watching in 2018
Out of all your 10/10 albums, this was the one I enjoyed the most.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=621">10:21</a>üòÇ
I mean........he‚Äôs right.
Boy was he excited
I honestly think there‚Äôs only been 3 true classic hip hop albums this decade. This is one of them. Honestly there were years in the 90s that had more classic albums than this decade
Those 1.8k dislikes are vegan haters
Remember when a 10/10 review like this was actually exciting to see? Yeah, Kid See Ghosts its not like that
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=621">10:21</a>
I come back and watch this from time to time... it‚Äôs satisfying
I&#39;m gonna listen to this album again
His face on the thumbnail: &quot;It&#39;s pretty good!&quot;
Why doesn&#39;t he talk about How much a dollar cost? Did i miss something?
This review changed my life
I remember listening to this album for the first time, and not feeling it. I thought it was way out of left field. Now it&#39;s my favorite under only a few classics.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1318">21:58</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=724">12:04</a> had me dyingüòÇ
TERRACE MARTIN!!!
You gave TPAB a 9, BUT GAVE DAMN. A 6!?!!?!?
This album changed my life
If Anthony makes a top decade albums, this‚Äôd be number 1
To pimp a melon
he always look like he smell bad
Sometimes I wonder if Kendrick ever saw this video...
A masterpiece.
I genuinely think this could be one of the greatest rap albums of all time
I wonder if Kdot is watching this
I‚Äôve been trying to access TPAB in the UK on Youtube. Apparently it‚Äôs banned in my country.
I&#39;ve been looking at these lyrics while im at work and its some of the best poetry ever fucking written, and put in a form for the people cause poetry is for the PEOPLE
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=654">10:54</a> Anthony has immersed into Kendrick&#39;s lyricism
Rapsody‚Äôs verse in complexion is the cringiest thing since the Paul brothers
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1315">21:55</a>
&quot;u&quot; is one of the most emotional dramatic visual songs of all time
Every M E L O N is a star
c&#39;man... c&#39;man... YEHH! YEHH!
There is at least one trap beat on this
Just listened to it, it&#39;s my favorite album so far. Tbh if I had to pick a least favorite track it would probably be the second track. Not bad by any means, it was funny and honest, but I thought it was alright. Wouldn&#39;t remove it though because it is a nice interlude lol
You&#39;re being basic lmao
I still cant believe you gave this album a 6... HOW THE FUCK IS DAMN AND LIL PUMP BETTER THAN THIS
C‚Äômon c‚Äômon c‚Äômon 10 on this record YEAH YEH YEAH YEH
Dont let this make you forget he gave Damn. a 7
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg">0:00</a><br>Anthony predicted DAMN. 2 years before it dropped!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1167">19:27</a> &quot;if the music under your message is garbage, the music is garbage&quot;<br><br><b>proceeds to give lil pump mixtape a 7</b>
The alt rights favorite album reviewer.
This and Section 80 are my favorite Kendrick albums. I love ‚ÄúFor Free interlude‚Äù, and institutionalized, ‚ÄúBlacker the Berry was also good for talking about an issue that few rappers talk about.
Had to come here after watching the Scorpion by Drake review bc I was too sad
Masta-PIECE, BABYYYYYY!!!
He said DAMN in the beginning..... DAMN is his new album ooo
To me, the best comparison I can come up with for tpab is that it is the pulp fiction of music. Dense, incredible, generation defying, beautiful, dark, amazing.
first verse of U is fucking amazing
Solid 10
Heard rumors that this review was a 10/10. I&#39;ll come back later<br>Edit: ...holy fuck
Quite possibly one of the best reviews you&#39;ve ever given, I find your critique on &quot;TPab&quot; to be very thoroughly on FUCKING! POINT!! GOD, okay had to get that out. But this really is k-dots best work in my opinion, &amp; of course to think 3 years ago b4 he fucked our shit up again with &quot;DAMN.&quot; ,in a great way lol  that he would constantly keep ascending to be one of the greatest to do it in this decade, fuck in this generation forsure. This album hits home where it feels good &amp; bad, it&#39;s a major inspiration in my lifetime and I find this review to be an major inspiration for conscientious introverted people as myself who are writers of their own stories that can relate so well to someone who&#39;s an artist like Kendrick, Fantano you break this shit down so well my dude, it&#39;s almost to good to be true, I&#39;m just going thru shit rn like everyone else in this crazy strange world, and going back to watch your review on this album well makes me motivated, nostalgic, inspired and all more another reason to pick up the pen again &amp; give a shit. Anyway your review is very helpful and insightful for such things I&#39;m most passionate about, for instance rap. Thank you Anthony peace &amp; love (p.s I&#39;ve been A1 since day 1 on your channel)
Shit music
more like a 3/10
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=400">6:40</a>
Do yourself a favor and listen to the Dissect podcast on Spotify which breaks down this album track by track. I thought I had TPAB figured out until I listened to the podcast. It will blow your mind and I assure you that your appreciation for both this album and kendrick as an artist will double.
this review is actually a 10/10, like no joke, how its structured and everything, Fantano conveys his points really well and thoughtfully. I think this review might be a classic in reviewing history.
Who here after that kids see ghosts review???!!!
Who‚Äôs here after the kids see ghosts review
here after the latest 10
KSG=TPAB
Had to return here after the KSG review
came here after the kanye/kid cudi review
Here after he gave Kid See Ghosts a 10/10
KIDS SEE GHOSTS SOMETIMES
came back from the kids see ghosts album review, fucking tenthony tentano
This album just got new company. KIDS SEE GHOSTS the new 10/10 club member.
He didn‚Äôt seem this excited on kids see ghost review than this lol
This IS A PURE 10
DAMN.
I listen to this album cover to cover once every Summer. It‚Äôs almost that time of year again!
It‚Äôs tough but I like GKMC slightly more than TPAB
it&#39;s 4 am i&#39;m going to bed
Imma have to be onest i liked gkmc more still a modern classic tough
10!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I just wanna see ya happy
I was not expecting to see a 10 from Anthony Fantano ever... Woah... Just Woah!
I swear this comments section is pretty much a mix between trolls, dick riders, baiters, and finally melon memes. Basically /mu/

Mr Melon could you please do a review on Andy Mineo - EP The Arrow
Classic review for a classic album
mortal man is like the best outro I have ever listened
This guy&#39;s taste in music is horrific
It&#39;s 4am. I&#39;m goin to bed. <br>It&#39;s 4am. I&#39;m goin to bed.<br>It&#39;s 4am. I&#39;m goin to bed.

Review  Moe Davis: Comply
at first i didn&#39;t even know that there was a different version then the one the album but  after hearing the single version i have to  say i by far prefer the album one<br>the single version is kind of lacking everything that i liked about the song when first hearing it.
Melon, I can&#39;t even express how much I love you for this review.
hey i am a subscriber and a fan of your reviews and would greatly appreciate your review and thoughts on my album &#39;BELIEVE&quot; i understand you are busy and might not even read this but if by chance you do id greatly appreciate the review <a href="http://kunaki.com/MSales.asp?PublisherId=150413">http://kunaki.com/MSales.asp?PublisherId=150413</a>
GKMC is still the better album
I watched this right after his &quot;what makea an album a 10?&quot; Video
Fuck man! Again your least favorite track is one of my favs lol.. Whats going on.. None the less, this album is a literal game changer. 10/10 easily
YOURRRRRRR RIGHT
this album sounds like he&#39;s a black supremacist hmm it&#39;s a good album but i don&#39;t agree with Kendrick&#39;s views
3 years on, I still consider this album to be amongst the greatest of all time. Not just the greatest of the decade.
cal chuchesta at the ending tho lmao üòÇüòÇ at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1320">22:00</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1325">22:05</a>
Who‚Äôs here after watching that damned-DAMN review üôãüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I listened to tpab when it came out. In late April of 2018 it still sounds as great as it did 3 years ago. This will probably go down as KDOT&#39;s most timeless project
Im still alive
‚Äúthis is not a story album‚Äù whaaaat????? great video though, still watching
Sometimes I wish this review never ended and I could just watch it forever
So people reeeeeally wanna hate on J Cole at all times MOSTLY because hes &quot;boring&quot; but when it comes TPAB, all of a sudden the replay value of a song doesn&#39;t become important anymore and its all about the story and the message of the album. There&#39;s such a double standard between J Cole and Kendrick because I think they both make amazing ass music but J Cole gets so much more hate, its bullshit and people just wanna hop on the bandwagon and say Kendrick is the best in the rap game rn even tho I know half the people that say that probably didn&#39;t even listen to TPAB in full or even section 80... smh
&quot;Cetchy&quot;
How the fuck will anyone ever top this?!?
@maxsmuckers on twitter
He just won a Pulitzer Prize. K-Dot FOREVER
Kendrick Lamar, Pulitzer Prize Winner, 2018. King.
be humble
10/10? DAMN.
Greatest rap album of all time
One of the most iconic reviews on the channel
Good Kid MAAD City is still my favorite rap album cover ever.
Tpab has to be one of the best records I‚Äôve ever heard
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1315">21:55</a> just keep watching this it gets me everytime
till this day the most overrated album ever
Still my favourite Needle Drop review
TRAN<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>its 4 am...im going to bed</b>
Kendrick Lamar albums ranked (imo)<br><br>Section 80 - Strong 7 to a light 8<br>Damn -Decent to strong 8<br>TPAB- strong 8 to light 9<br>Untitled Unmastered- light to decent 9<br>MAAD city- decent to strong 9
I always get so hyped with the build up to when he gives it the 10
aamazing review
Review under the covers by ninja sex party
I remember not liking this album when it first came out when I was 14 and when he dropped untitled unmastered I gave it a listen and was just blown away with the song These Walls being a personal favorite. If you didn‚Äôt like an album take a break and go back because music is like whine, it gets better with time
The melon is hyped!
TPAB is perfect. Fine. Still not over DAMN. being a 7 though.
Anthony is a dick to his review notes
i saw a meme and i couldt believe fantano said 10 so i came to verify
Happy 3rd anniversary guys.
Watch this review every once in awhile to remind me that good does exist in the universe
Slamthony Bradtano
Le Flannel Jaune
Damn is my favourite Kendrick album
you miss some points but ok, not a bad review
Happy third bday to the best album of this decade.
3 Years.
Today are 3 years since kendrick dropped this masterpiece
PRESS 0 TO BAM
Madd city is better
I watch this review weekly
Here for Melonmas #2018
No way this is better than Tetsuo &amp; Youth most overrated album of all time
Anyone who says gkmc is better than tpab are just unable to understand tpab
This album is ok
8/10
I&#39;ve listened to this album a couple times now, it always leaves me feeling kinda empty (in a good way)
His first 10?
Pretty cool video‚Ä¶like what you‚Äôre doing! ¬†You might like this channel - Keepit1oo. ¬†Hope you don‚Äôt mind, I‚Äôm just a big fan of good content and videos‚Ä¶ seem hard to find lately! ¬†So when I see channels and videos I like I try to spread them around :) Keep doing what you‚Äôre doing, it‚Äôs great!
The best album (regardless of genre) of the decade lost album of the year to Taylor Swift.
when shit hits the fan, are you still a fan
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=253">4:13</a>
Great album. Period. Top to bottom.
Red book we should talk hmm if u want down the rabbit hole rg out
I love twopack shaker
I can‚Äôt believe it.<br>Its a Damn 10
UHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.....I GUESS YOU AIN&#39;T GOTTA LIE......IF I HAD TO PICK ONE was my favorite track!
This the same flow that put the rap game on a crutch.
if kung fu kenny would have talked to biggie instead of tupac, biggie would have shot him... not that i dont like kenny, but thats a thing biggie would have done
you gave 7/10 to lil pump but kendrick a 10<br>fuck you melon
Still the best rap album this decade
TPAB is about as close to perfect that an album can get.
Why does melon pronounce ‚Äòpoem‚Äô like ‚Äòpome‚Äô
Hood Politics was foreshadowing songs like DNA and Element. Back to his roots. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23highpower">#HIGHPOWER</a>
i just found out about this yesterday, and it&#39;s pretty cool:<br><br>Kendrick said in an interview with MTV that originally the name of this album was going to be &quot;2 Pimp A Caterpillar&quot;, so that it spelled &quot;2PAC&quot;, but near the release date, it was changed to &quot;To Pimp A Butterfly&quot;, since to him a butterfly represents life and its development in a much colorful and beautiful way<br><br>love this album and love seeing Anthony this excited about music even more: that&#39;s why i just can&#39;t stop coming back to this video
Rating this album higher than GKMC is just stupid, but it&#39;s his opinion and he is allowed that.
this album is like a musical doctorate thesis
it still hurts me how he completely overlooks For Sale?
A melon in his prime
Jeez you don&#39;t decide what the best rap album of certain time period is. I mean you can say this is your fav album of 2010&#39;s but actually DAMN. was adapted much better by the public and you rate it 3 points later. The truth is that something is good if people spend their time listening to it and DAMN. generates much more interest.
david bowie took inspiration from this album so it must be good.!
This album is a little boring at times. But it‚Äôs great nonetheless. 9/10
We gotta get this to 3 million views
Wow melon i cannot believe you gave this a 7 but DAMN a 10
I wonder why he didn‚Äôt mention the song ‚ÄúHow much a dollar cost‚Äù
Tbh the only rap album I actually enjoy.
Hey you gorgeous melon of a man, you! Have you heard of  Kamasi Washington? Kamasi has gained some notoriety for his collaborations with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly. Washington‚Äôs sounds are endlessly eclectic and experimental, whether he‚Äôs working solo or with members of his collective, the West Coast Get Down (he‚Äôs even performed at the Whitney Biennial).
Best album of all time imo I fuckin love this album and it never gets old
Im not sure why but I could never get into this album. Feels very...dry.
The negative reviews are fun and all, but watching him get so excited about music makes me really happy
Bet you didn&#39;t know that King Kunta is sampled from an old Mausberg album. Look up Get Nekkid by Mausberg.
Anthony&#39;s best review - he&#39;s so enthusiastic and articulate. The album ain&#39;t bad either ;)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1316">21:56</a>
Seriously this might be your greatest review!
Still have never heard Fantano this horny in 2018
Fantano in 2037 about To Pimp a Butterfly: classic/10
Classic review for a classic album
Automatic subtitles has every word right wtf<br>Even knack (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=41">0:41</a>) and MAAD city (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=50">0:50</a>)!<br><br>Impossible.
Yeah this  album is fucking ridiculously good.
How can you not like you ain&#39;t gotta lie?
Section 80 was an 8<br>Gkmc was a 9<br>Tpab was a 10<br>Damn. should&#39;ve been an 11
This album has a bone to pick.
I didn&#39;t like it. It just sounds like a bunch of cliche talking points about black communities put to run of the mill instrumental and electronic beats. Not really innovative or insightful.
i never knew how much i love that orange clip on the green scree
Zany
Bam
1. Pink Floyd- The Wall<br>2. Radiohead- Kid A<br>3. Kendrick Lamar- To Pimp a Butterfly <br>4.Tame Impala- Lonerism<br>5. Gorillaz- Demon Days <br>.............................Thoughts?
To me hood politics is about how people in the hood interact with each other. Particularly in gang culture. But, applying the thing he learned in the hood to the rap game makes sense to.
u is my favorite track
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1121">18:41</a> is the best explanation for this entire album.
Legit watched this as soon as it&#39;s over... Would you look at the time it&#39;s 4am I&#39;m going to bed
on the track &#39;u&#39; i can hear kendrick crying
Section 8: 8/10<br>GKMC: 9/10<br>TPAB: 10/10<br>DAMN: 7/10<br><br>:/ you couldn&#39;t have broke the rules and gave DAMN an 11/10 but it&#39;s okay we forgive you
Most album Ive listened to in my entire life, and people still say it has no replay value smh
I put this album top 4 bcuz is not for everyone even if u are a hip-hop fan. But that doesn‚Äôt means that TPAB is not a phenomenal album.
is this the only 10?
When I first listened to this album I did have a really hard time listening to it, especially as an inexperienced novice in terms of listening to hip hop. I had only listened to a few GKMC songs which were easy to listen to, but as I realized the story that was being told my mind almost exploded. Its still the only album I have ever bought a physical copy of.
Banbambo does it again
I rate this review a TPAB/TPAB
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=289">4:49</a> 007 paper thrower
No mention of how much a dollar cost :(
Two years later, I finally own this album on cd. Bless this album
He&#39;s not hating on white people. What he is doing is, however, biased against them. That is, he is conflating issues engendered by poverty with issues engendered by racism. He&#39;s, in effect, trying to inject race where it is well-nigh inconsequential. What he describes isn&#39;t the way America maltreats and exploits black people, it is the way America maltreats and exploits poor people. His bias is understandable yet still rank and racist.
Perfect
Mate, Institutionalised is about people being brainwashed to commit crime and only changing when they consciously stop themselves and ‚Äòwash their ass‚Äô.
Hey good review but I don‚Äôt think you needed to call Kendrick the n word every 20 seconds ...
Kendrick is Hip Hop/Rap&#39;s greatest hope right now for it to return to being about lyrics and meaning and not the trap style or mumble rap. J.Cole and someone like Logic or Joey Bada$$ would probably be the only ones comparable lyrically to Kendrick. However if he were to disappear and all we have left would be someone like 21 or Lol Pump rap would be a lot worse. I&#39;m not an old head either..I&#39;m only in 8th grade üòÇ
I believe hood politics is Kendrick comparing his life in the hood to his life in the rap industry and saying how silly it is compared to the life he‚Äôs went through
I still think this album is a genuine contender for the greatest rap album of all time
Obama himself said How Much a Dollar Cost was the best song of that entire year.
Still the highest rated hip hop album on about everything üòÇ
when you see the 22 minute run time
reverbthony reverbtano here.
Light to medium 0.
I literally can&#39;t pick a favorite song on here
the only video i get off to every time
I always watch this review and it always restarts my excitement for this album. Its just so perfect album and will always be my favorite album by kendrick. It also created my love for funk and jazz.
Michael Gira and Kendrick Lamar are going to team up and make Soundtracks For The Street Blind and Anthony&#39;s going to full blast.
First word in the video <b>DAMN</b>
Not one word about how much a dollar cost. not single one.
I don&#39;t think any album has ever made me feel the way that this did. The deep message along with the AWESOME basslines and jazz elements makes me feel so great. I would give it an 11/10, but that&#39;s over the limit, so 10/10 is perfect. Kendrick Lamar got me into hip hop and it is still my favorite hip hop album, possibly album in general.
King Kunta deserves a better explanation, King Kunta isn&#39;t just some character Kendrick made. The song is based on a story called Roots which follows a guy named Kunta Kinte who was sold into slavery from Africa and shipped to America. I reccomend checking it out, there&#39;s a mini series from 2016 if you want a nice, newer, polished retelling of the story
tarp influence
Best song How Much a Dollar Cost and he doesn&#39;t even mention it
Poem has 2 syllables
there is 2 syllables in poem
I most certainly do not always agree with you. And just like many others especially your views on DAMN. But! I gotta say. You do your research! And you def know your shit. So for that. KUDOS. <br><br>PS: Can you do a review on 6LACK - FREE 6LACK? I am really curious about your thoughts.
Review action beats new album
i watch this every couple months just to reassure me that being subscribed to anthony is a good choice
The review is better than the album
No replay value
Sometimes you review music that is so obscure that people without access to Metacritic would have difficulty finding it. ¬†do you use Metacritic to decide what to review?
Does anyone know where i could purchase this flannel please help me im desperate AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
History teachers used Alright as a song about civil rights at my school .
yellow flannel well deserved
DAMN +3/10
i rate this a lil pump/10
<b>to pimp a melon.</b>
2nd best Kendrick album, 2nd best hip hop album ever
Literally one of the few albums where we all agree this is a solid 10 hands down.
I hate Kendrick and I hate this fucking album
This review is Anthony&#39;s magnum opus
Update: this is indeed his artistic peak
U need a certain amount of intelligence to listen to to pimp a butterfly
If this bottle could talk <b>gulp</b> i&#39;d cry myself bitch everything is your fault.
<b>This dick ain&#39;t free</b>
I think it&#39;s an 8/10 honestly
I would actually love to watch a review of Dr. Dre&#39;s &quot;The Chronic&quot;
Good Review!!! I Learned A LOT üíØ
i remember you was conflicted
The prequel to the betrayal of the decade.
where do you get those mf fonts niggggggggga
he never talked about &quot;for sale?&quot; :(
I didnt grow up in the 90s, so I didn&#39;t really get exposed to &quot;old school&quot; hip hop until I literally went back and listened to a lot of older hip hop albums within these past couple years. So when I first heard this album, I had very little appreciation, if any, for hip hop and its roots, I kinda only listened to trap/generic modern shit (Migos, Future, Gucci Mane, Rae Sremmurd, Young Jeezy, Lil Wayne, etc). Because of this, I didn&#39;t really udnerstand the appeal of the sound of this album at all. To me it was barely listenable, so imagine my surprise when everybody and their mother (not my friends, but people who reviewed it, my friends were just as ignorant as me and still are) said this was the best rap album of all time, and that it was just about a perfect album. At one point I got really fed up with 40 year old mfs telling me the rap we have today is trash, and so I went back and listened to a bunch of old rappers, Redman, KRS-ONE, Rakim, Pac, Nas, Biggie, Common, Mos Def, Talib Kweli, etc, and slowly but surely my taste in music improved, A LOT. I also went out and started listening to current rappers who are legitimately good, Isaiah Rashad, SBQ, Ab-Soul, Jay Electronica (kinda older but still relevant-ish), Mac Miller, Big KRIT, The Underachievers, FBZ, etc, and TPAB has grown on me like no other album ever possibly could. I went from thinking it was near unlistenable trash to thinking it was a masterpiece, and its sound, which is generally the biggest complaint people have about it, finally clicked with me. So, if you dont like the way this album sounds then realistically you probably have pretty shitty taste and you should go back and work on that.
Looking back on this, it amazes me how much this album grew on me. I hated it at first but over time, I ended up loving it. This gets a strong 8.8 from me. Tran....
For sale to momma transition gave me goosebumps to the hair in my nose
This shit is lit homie....check me out when you can
it wasn&#39;t even that good
Hopsin shits on this guy
Don&#39;t get the hype behind this guy, shit is overrated, overproduced garbage
Bam!
You have this a 10 but you gave Lil Pump tape a 7
Does Anthony Fantino hate the underground? As an underground rap collective we have been wondering this for a while. Many people in my book club seem to think he prefers the mainstream only. No love for guys like Bones, XXXTent, Star Valley Crew Ski Mask, wheres the love for underground man?
Blacker the berry, sweeter the juice....I love that song, buit what if a white artist  did that: &quot;whiter the milk, sweeter the cream - , bluer the eyes, long lasting the jeans&quot; brought to you by Dairy Pure and Levi&#39;s Jeans ----HOL UP! HOL UP! DATS RACIST!
I‚Äôm not going to lie, this album didn‚Äôt really fit with my tastes. I preferred the more aggressive and blunt Good Kid Maad City and DAMN. but Mortal Man, These Walls, i and King Kunta are four of my favourite tracks of all time and I appreciate the meaning and depth in the record.
This is proof that Melon is racist.<br><br><br><br>lol
Not even one comment about How much a Dollar costs? why? just why? :(
You gave To Pimp a Butterfly a 10 but you gave lil pump a 7?
He looks like a bee
Been listening to this album all year and I&#39;m still not sick of it. This review was extremely accurate and relatable.
i just wanna say i fuckn hate this album and i hate kendrick, im instantly offput when anyone starts playing that dna shit or &quot;sit down, be humble&quot; that shit is annoying as fuck i hate his voice, i hate his flows and i hate this jazzy conscious rap act he does. i dont fuck with j cole or chance the rapper either. they some booty hole.
This is the rick and morty of albums it&#39;s great but so overhyped by the fan boys that i don&#39;t care for it
you gave this a 10 and hopsin only 3????//????<br>you dont know music
your voice is just a gift of comfort. thank you melon.
poem is a two syllable word
I mean it&#39;s no Either/Or
Perfect album.
Cal chuchesta is my hero
Surprised you didn‚Äôt talk about the reoccurring prayer.
Who honestly thought a rap album with funkadelic and funk hip hop would do this well, I still think that this the best album of the 21st century; boldly maybe if all tine
Spoiler: It&#39;s a 3.
The word &quot;hype&quot; wasn&#39;t enough to describe the media assault on the sprawling 80-minute To Pimp a Butterfly (2015), another meticulously crafted album that employed legions of writers, producers and musicians (including jazz pianist Robert Glasper and jazz saxophonist Kamasi Washington). Six people wrote Wesley&#39;s Theory, including George Clinton, and four produced it, including Flying Lotus. Nine people are credited as writers for the funk-fest King Kunta, making it de facto a collage. The producers threw in more live instruments, resulting in a sound that is more revivalist than innovative, but also a sound that helps the general theatrical atmosphere. For better and for worse, The Blacker the Berry is the epitome of this emphatically pointless but fashionable avant-jazz-rap music. I begins as an olf-fashioned synth-pop hit of the 1980s before it begins to sound like a James Brown parody (with the lyrics &quot;the number one rapper in the world&quot; and &quot;i love myself&quot;) accented by a jovial piano figure. The best psychodrama is possibly one of the simplest songs, the melodic funk-soul These Walls, and the best political sermon the equally straightforward funk ditty Hood Politics. But the music is secondary to the histrionics and it doesn&#39;t matter that the catchy and danceable Alright stands in opposition of the industrial beat that derails Momma, a fact that could account for at least eclecticism. This is a superficial and, ultimately, middle-of-the-road album from an artist who lacks the visceral energy of Public Enemy and Tackhead while also lacking the poetic depth of Kanye West and the musical genius of El-P. He tries to be all of them at once, but maybe he would be most credible if he were just himself: a brilliant script-writer of fictionalized real-life stories: the Christian parable How Much a Dollar Cost presents God disguised as a homeless man
Overrated jazz rap revivalism, 7.5/10 at best,I thought you were better than this melon
Sometimes I come back to this review just to see a super excited Melon.
Overrated, but still a goo album.
Have to go here every after Damn review to hear more Kdot praise
I didn‚Äôt like it the first time but after a few more listens I found myself rapping full bars from all the songs and now I‚Äôm in love
Only song I dislike is the For Free Interlude. its funny but its not good to listen to you know what i mean
I&#39;m not gonna lie, when I first heard this album I didn&#39;t like it. But everyone kept saying it was good, so I looked up the lyrics for every song and now I finally understand how much of a masterpiece this album is.
This is soooo much better than damn
Watching this review always makes me super happy. Reminds me how much I love this album
10/10 but YOU AINT GOTTA LIE is such a dope song i actually think my least favorite would be Mortal Man because it drags itself so fucking long out and the 2pac thing is cool but i dont listen to it again but yeah great album
THIS DICK AIN&#39;T FREEEEEEEE!
GOOD KID STILL DESERVES A 10, HOW CAN YOU GIVE GOOD KID A 9 AND BUTTERFLY A 10?
You know what is amazing about this album is it&#39;s humble, he doesn&#39;t admit he knows the world, he doesn&#39;t think he owns the world, he doesn&#39;t  put himself in the place of a god, but a human
I tried to listen to it again and this is still a wack ass album. There is not 1 good song on here. SMH. Why are people dick riding Kendrick? The dude is wack.
Fun fact: There is NOT a single 808 bass, only live bass was used in the whole album
and people say you never give 10s, it&#39;s not your fault music isn&#39;t as talented as Kendricks brain.
you wore out that Dr.Dre &quot;THE CHRONIC&quot; Vinyl<br>yo melon, we got it!<br>okay<br>shut the fragile up<br>put that shit down
I mean it&#39;s okay if you don&#39;t like Kendrick is for intelligent people.
fucking idiot its an 11/10 review it again
He gave damn a damn but damn a damn?
The Best Rapper of all time.
September 2017 and still listening to this album over shit like Luv is Rage 2 all day
i love this review and this album soooo much but is anyone else bothered by the fact that fantano goes out of order talking about the tracks? i feel like since the order and transitions are significant to the album itself, that should have carried through to the review. but i don&#39;t know. i&#39;m no mortal man. maybe i&#39;m just another whiny youtube commenter
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=654">10:54</a> was that intentional?
tpab was meant to be listened backwards
this album gay
definitely not at all into this album but i can see why others do and i enjoy the reviews/discussions
I love kendrick, but I feel like alot of his albums outside of DAMN. aren&#39;t great to listen to often, TPAB is phenomenal on the occasional listen but hearing it often just depletes the message, moreover I feel like it took me much longer to get into this compared to other kendrick projects. In retrospect I also got pissed off at kendrick fans because they get so mad if you have any little criticism for him.
Phsycadellic, dreamy creamy funky vibe.
One of my favorite rap albums of all time
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=680">11:20</a> <b>O    G    R    E    S</b>
I sometimes watch this video just to see my favorite melon be so happy
the album cover is racist
In the end tbh we should praise Anthony because we wouldn&#39;t analyze lyrics if it weren&#39;t for him
Let me guess...<br>Hey guys ILOVEKENDRICK FANTANO here .. this album is 1835/10 best album if all time this was amazing Kendrick I love this Kendrick Kendrick KDot Kendrick
nigga how is you aint gotta lie your least favorite track? that track is amazing
almost nobody was dickriding kendrick and calling him the goat after TPAB. then damn drops. i want the DAMN listerners to go back and take in TPAB, the greatest hip hop album of our generation
Awful album that makes no sense. 1/10
ok so kendrick wrote a nice book disguised as an album. good job, too bad the music sucked. overhyped as shit, don&#39;t need all this political crap.
I cried at the end of mortal man
I cried listening to this album for the first time
Does he sit or stand in his videos?
Good kid maad city is reservoir dogs and tpab is pulp fiction. <br>Gkmc is clean cool and flawless as is reservoir dogs but tpab goes the extra mile just as pulp fiction does and creates something more special.
He doesn&#39;t even have complexion (A Zulu love) in his favorites... fuck this review
u ain&#39;t gotta lie least favorite? wtf nigga that&#39;s one of my top 5
Did you know this is the first result when you youtube search to pimp a butterfly? you should be very proud mate.
10!
DAMN is a solid 8.
legendary review
Fake interview with Tupac is the most insane, egotistical and delusional thing a pop artist has ever done. 10/10 for pushing the boundaries of retardation. And I&#39;m not saying Tupac is better than Kendrick... I&#39;m saying Tupac is overhyped and not a black hero, and Kendrick putting him up on a pedestal/considering himself the &quot;reincarnation&quot; of Tupac, as if him and Tupac are Jesus figures and/or anything more than popular artists is schizophrenic 2 tha core by Corey Feldman. Still... the pretension makes the music interesting, we can all attest to that. Kendrick Lamar bringing back that old-school rock star airheadedness like its 1971. So glad the first black president and his rhyming minstrel Kendrick Lamar saved the world for us... from the apartheid and what not. Can&#39;t wait for actual literal Helter Skelter to come, DAMN should&#39;ve featured an interview with Charles Manson, maybe then Manthony Titstano would&#39;ve given it an 8 or 9 for relating to his mental issues/alternative vegan lifestyle (Charles Manson is the original vegan).
Best review ever, dude!
Lester from GTA is that you?
I unliked this just to like it again
My short review of every song on this album:<br><br>1. Wesley&#39;s Theory: didn&#39;t like it that much at first but the song grew on me over time<br><br>2. For Free?: I actually used to think this song was trash but after I continuously kept playing it, I grew to really like it and the meaning behind it<br><br>3. King Kunta: although I like this song, this is quite an overrated song to me because this keeps getting mentioned all the time and I think this album has a lot better songs<br><br>4. Institutionalized: solid song. Loved everything about it.<br><br>5. These Walls: one of my favorite songs in this album. Really catchy.<br><br>6. u: this song is amazing. The funny thing is at first, I had mixed feelings on this song, but now I simply love it. The story and emotion behind this song is brilliant<br><br>7. Alright: fantastic song. Loved it from day 1<br><br>8. For Sale?: love this song. Even better than for free IMO.<br><br>9. Momma: another great song that doesn&#39;t get talked about enough<br><br>10. Hood Politics: catchy background music; catchy hook, really strong lyrics. Need I say more?<br><br>11. How Much a Dollar Costs: AMAZING ! BRILLIANT IN EVERY WAY !!!<br><br>12. Complexion: the most underrated song in the entire album. Really, really catchy. Cannot get enough of the second part<br><br>13. The Blacker the Berry: this was one of the earliest songs from this album that I heard before listening to the full album. Loved this song so much that I had to listen to the album. <br><br>14. You Ain&#39;t Gotta Lie: this song is decent and I like it, but it&#39;s no where near as good as the other songs on this album<br><br>15. i: I liked this song a lot when I first heard it, but overtime, it got a little less enjoyable. Still a good song: just not one of my favorites<br><br>16. Mortal Man: brilliant song and brilliant way to end this album. Loved the poem as well<br><br>This album is a 10/10 for me. By far Kendrick&#39;s best album<br><br>Best song(s): How much a Dollar Costs is right at the top for me. Other favorites are: The Blacker the Berry, Alright, These Walls, u and Complexion<br><br>Worst songs(s): although I think this album has no bad songs, You Ain&#39;t Gotta Lie would be right at the bottom
How Much a Dollar Costs will most likely forever be my favorite Kendrick song of all time and one of the best rap songs in history. This album is definitely 10/10. By far his best album
Trap influenced instrumental...
You only gave this a DAMN. a 7 and this a 10????!?? Fuckin melon
I like to regurgitate what I hear on this channel so for a short moment, I too can feel like a music snob and act like I know shit about the meaning behind music.....
Jkiff
I think the main reason this album didn&#39;t have the hype of good kid or damn was because it dives really deep, and until you can understand the deeper meaning held within the lyrics and also emotionally invest yourself in the album it seems almost unappealing. The genius of the album is that Kendrick uses music in such a way that no other rap artist does. Classic
untitled unmastered (7.1)<br>Section 80 (7.9)<br>good kid, mAAd city (9.2)<br>To Pimp a Butterfly (10)<br>DAMN. (9.4)
Anthony gives To Pimp a Butterfly a perfect 10, but Forest Hills Drive a 5 and Life is Good a 4. I can&#39;t take this dude seriously anymore...
i was too young to enjoy the tpab lol.. good kidd mad city was AMAZING to me, so i saw tpab is, not trash... but good album, not as good as gkmc.. i should give the album a try now.. my getting old ahhh XD
A wild 10 appears.
proceeds to give DAMN. a 7
STRIVE FOR GREATNESS FAM
This album reminded me of like wizard of oz visually like he was going on a journey. TPAB is a piece of art still my favorite Kendrick album üòçüòçüôåüèæüôåüèæüî•üî•
You know, after you (and so many others) rated Neutral Milk Hotel (which I still think sounds like crap) so highly, I thought that my plebeian not-music-nerd tastes might just not be in line with those of people who make music a huge part of their lives, and that your point of view was not helpful to inform the kind of music I would like to hear. This review completely reversed that idea.<br><br>I have never really been into rap or hip-hop but this album is beautiful. Every track feels interesting and unique and all of them feel like they have something important to say, without getting in the way of the music while they say it. The poem bit was also well-weaved in and didn&#39;t feel like a gimmick or something that was just done for the sake of doing something different, and it really felt like it added something; the first poem felt like a powerful thesis and the second like a satisfying conclusion.<br><br>I would never have even know this existed, much less listened to it, if not for this review. So thank you for doing what you do.
More life&gt;&gt;&gt;TPAB
6/10 ..if I was black ..8/10
a lil too pro black for me thanks
anthony fantano is the goat
Every time I listen to this album I have to spend 10-20 minutes afterwards just sitting there, taking in what I just experienced
this album got me into hip-hop
DAMN. has a great message but doesn&#39;t sound as good. Other than a couple of tracks. It&#39;s kinda dull. I still love it though. <br><br>DAMN. &lt; Section .80 &lt; Good Kid, m.a.a.d city &lt; To Pimp A Butterfly<br><br>I still love DAMN. but not as much as the other ones.
I love kendrick but compared to other records that anthony has reviewed, its not a 10/10
He looks so happy god bless him
Love U Kenthony Lamtano
in the end of For Sale the intro for DAMN starts
Couldn&#39;t agree more with this review! keep it up man, I love how you dissect the music down to its core
psychedelic dreamy creamy neo-soulful
melon, do a review on to pimp a butterfly
Can you do a review on an old album? MOTM 1 Kid Cudi

you made me wanna go listen to it again
&quot;This Boris Gardiner song.&quot;
&quot;Tee-Pab&quot; Fantano 2017
Timeless Album.
Love watching your reviews but they would be so much better if you could include clips of the music your reviewing. I get it would be hard with the copyright issues but would be so much better
For a long long time I was a music snob. I was one of those people that thought and insisted that rock music is the only music, and that everything else is obsolete. <br>Over the last year or two I started getting into rap slowly - I began listening to Kanye West through a friend. He made me listen to Gorgeous from MBDTF, and at that moment I knew there was something I had been missing.<br><br>I&#39;ve started listening to a lot more rap music, and while I&#39;m still slowly coming to terms with a lot of the commercial mainstream artists like Drake, Kendrick Lamar has shown me that rap, and in particularly the masterpiece that is TPAB, has so much artistic merit. I&#39;ve started to dissect the symbolism and messages behind the music. This album is hands down one of the best records of the 21st century. It has changed how I artistically view and listen to music. It&#39;s so provocative and what I get from the 78 minutes of this album is so fulfilling in comparison to rock records that I enjoy.<br><br>Thank you, Kendrick, for opening my eyes and my mind to the beauty that is rap music.
MELON HOW YOU DON&#39;T FUCK WITH YOU AIN&#39;T GOTTA LIE
Legend has it a 10 was never given again
my favourite song is u beautiful in every way
It&#39;s shit
This is my favorite hip hop album of all times deadass
Eww, a 10.
How is the Rodeo review longer than this?
The Blacker The Berry is fire
This album made me like Hip hop.
this shit wasn&#39;t a 10/10 jesus fucking christ

If you listen to these songs and form your own opinion and you don&#39;t agree with him then you&#39;re basic. LOL.
This is the only 10/10 I&#39;ve ever seen him give to an artist.
how does an album ascend to a level of &quot;classic&quot;?

THIS DICK AINT FREEEEEEE
&quot;..but there&#39;s a difference between black artist &amp; whack artist.&quot;
Remember when people pretended this album was a miss? lmao Top 3 album of the decade, maybe top 1.
Since there hasn&#39;t been another 10/10 rap album, Fantano still thinks this is the best rap album of the decade. Disgusting
This guy&#39;s jump cuts are distracting and annoying. Other than that, good review.
This album still has a few bones to pick. Loved the reference!
I&#39;M TOUCHING MYSELF <del>TONIGHT</del> NOW
kinda said he talked more about popo altho around 90% of black ppl getting killed is beceause of other black people
I give this a weak to light 0, I fucking hate Kendrick, can&#39;t stand his voice
how do you get this good at reviewing things
Didn&#39;t like this album at first. Listened to it about two months down the line. Love it.
this is actually really great. thanks.
bad
Why didn&#39;t you talk about how much a dollar cost? One of the best songs on the album.
i knew this would be a 10 outa 10 !!!

This album is a mystery to me. The message thing I get but the actual songs of the album are just average. It&#39;s not the most amazing piece of music I&#39;ve ever heard. <br><br>This album is a perfect example of crowdthink. People like it because the critics say that we should.
2 million views for a review. That¬¥s impressive
Why did you give it a 3??
it&#39;s 4am im going to bed
I watch this review once a day.
For fuck&#39;s sake... are you going to review Russia&#39;s national anthem or not?
I&#39;m very closed-minded about hip-hop/rap, but this album really changed my point of view about rap
This album is garbage
Take a shot whenever he strokes his chin. Welp. I hammered and enamored.
I really don&#39;t see how you can listen to this album and not think he is the greatest rapper making music right now.
That bone to pick pun was great
Ahhhh, the infamous 10/10
Momma was inspired by his visit to South Africa.That nappy-headed boy with ashy ankles telling him to come back home and learn about his people is telling him to learn about his African heritage.The boy also instructs Kendrick to tell his homeboys to also come back to Africa(their first home).In addition,the focus of HOW MUCH A DOLLAR COST is Kendrick&#39;s encounter with a homeless South African man while he was touring the country.The man was asking for 10 RAND (an equivalent of 75 cents in the US on the 6th of May 2017).
The rating should be DAMN./10
Was this his first 10 that he has ever given out?
wow giving to pimp a butterfly a 3 and yet you give this, oh shit
Lovely review, as always. I appreciate how much you go in depth with each album you review.
p o h m
Why&#39;d you give it a 10? How could it be any better?
you said self love twice. You ain&#39;t slick.
from this to DAMN. ...
9/10 I wouldn&#39;t say 10/10
It&#39;s 4am I&#39;m going to bed.
THIS. DICK. AIN&#39;T. FREEEEEEEE
Thanks for turning me on to this awesome CD. Really appreciate the great review!
Hey there<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>420 DANKTANO</b> here<br><br><br><br><br>The internet&#39;s <b>busiest</b> music nerd
are you sure you didn&#39;t mean to give this album a decent 7/10
this album is classic
so true on people  getting butthurt when he introduces political and social messages.  He is so successful sonically on this project, the lyrics could be thought of as supplementary, but that&#39;s why it&#39;s so great.  It tells a message, it portrays his story and meaning, but sounds flippin amazing.   I&#39;m not saying the lyrics and content take a back seat, I just mean the album sounds so good he can wholeheartedly get away with expressing a social meaning in his music.
classic/10
What?!?!?! A light 2 to a decent 3???? Please never review rap ever again.
fucking love the intro on this one
The only problem I have with Kendrick is that sometimes it sounds like his mouth is full of spit when he raps, or it&#39;s like he&#39;s chewing tobacco 
I swear this album is one of the best rap albums of all time along side with illmatic, the chronic.
Best rap album of the decade?? FOH. Shit is fuckin TRASH and i loved GKMC.
I went back and relistened to this album. DAMN does not compare to this. If this is a 10, then DAMN is a 7 or 8.
LOVE is My Wife &amp; I Favorite track on the album... we fell asleep listening to the record on REPEAT! It brought back the love into our relationship. It&#39;s just a Beautiful, Gentle song about Love.  @TheNeedleDrop I don&#39;t see a ring on your finger, its safe to assume you aren&#39;t married and probably don&#39;t have a lover in your life... if I&#39;m wrong, I can live with that.  and it&#39;s SIMPLE, &quot;I WANNA BE WITH YOU&quot;. SAID IT DIRECTLY! Also, &quot;I had to do it / I bought the big one to prove it&quot;. = Engagement/Marriage.<br><br>GOD is another one of those dope fun light hearted record. You don&#39;t think that that beat is dope? The Migos-Like Flow over a Dreamy Beat with a fun feel. This song is DOPE.
Yo it&#39;s 4 AM, that outro scared the shit out of me
Hahahahahaha, that thumbnail is such a giveaway.
DAMN. was a damn dissapointment
i give it a fucking 11/10.
from to pimp a butterfly, untitled remastered is more better than damn.<br><br>damn album is like his songs from 8 years ago
Remember when you was cool? Not giving K dot albums 7/10. Melon fug.
Where the yella got it&#39;s merit.
thought it&#39;d get a way better score tbh
if i gotta slap a melon ass nigga imma make it look sexy
to 7 a butterfly
So this was the moment the yellow checkered shirt became iconic
i know real breathing sentient people who actually think damn is better than tpab
I come from a future where Anthony gives the next Kendrick&#39;s project a 7 wearing the same shirt.
Best album of all time. This is more than music. Its art.
He Gave Damn A 10 But This A 6 Smh
back here to hear the 10 slip out that melon mouth
dropped from 10 to 7 on DAMN. <br>rip
I feel like he won&#39;t really like DAMN.
where&#39;s DAMN review? *chuchesta voice
anthony was the oldest of seven
The song complexion really grew on me I feel like I can recite the whole thing
&#39;Damn&#39; review? Its really good, not sure its TPAB good; especially after two years of listening.
&quot;This album has a few bones to pick.&quot; Ha.
hurry up on that DAMN. review, melon felon
THE YELLOW FLANNEL BACK FOR DAMN.
REVIEW AT????????????????
DUDE. WHERE IS THE FUCKING &quot;DAMN&quot; REVIEW!!! HURRY THE FUCK UP!!!
DAMN.
Damn.
dude...what are you waiting for? Review Damn please and thank you lol
two real eyes<br>to realize<br>too real lies
where the fuck is damnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
Double platinum with no features. Congrats
Am I the only one who didn&#39;t like this album?  I mean, Kendrick is extremely talented, but I just cringed so much at a lot of the songs.
Get ready for the 14th baby
best rap record of the decade, hell best rap album of all time.
Bam
Do mmlp
Watching in preparation for the new album
This is one of those forms of media that comes out at just the right time that the public needs, not wants.<br>Now looking back, this album was so incredibly mesmerizing by how this leap of faith for a new approach of sound really did change the way I listen to music and even how I see the world.<br>This is the album that will never age. Timeless.
revisited and cried again
best hip-hop album of all time.
Best album in forever
tbh good kid maad city is a 10 and this is a 9
Every single time I listen to: to pimp a butterfly I enjoy it even more than the last
Anyone know what other albums Anthony gave a 10 to??
Did you do this review......For free?
tpab is the best
2 million melon
This is why Kendrick Lamar is the 1,2,3,4,5 greatest rapper alive.
this is the best review ever...detailed
this is the second best rap album of the new century
THIS REVIEW WENT DOUBLE PLATINUM WITH NO FEATURES
First 10/10 I seen this dude give
Beat Poetry?
Shit, this album is good. And I thought I didn&#39;t like hip hop, silly me.

TWO MILLION BABY

who&#39;s watching section 80/good kid maad city/to pimp a butterfly reviews one after another before kendrick drops the first 11/10 in history? leeeeet&#39;s.. FUUUCKING GOOO!!
Kendrick&#39;s new album gonna be an 11
Ok but obviously lil dicky is more talented. No.
2 million melon
almost 2m views, melon
Please review To Pimp a Butterfly
first time I heard this album....smh my favorite album ever made easily
dreamy creamy neo-soul
album is the best I have ever heard in my life also ending skit was halarious
Yo get this shit to 2 million views already.
You can see how Anthony&#39;s look in his eyes seems more sensitive when he starts speaking about the poem dedicated to 2Pac.
APRIL 7TH Y&#39;ALL BETTER HAVE YOUR SHIT TOGETHER!!!
&quot;not because Kendricks being basic, but because you&#39;re being basic.&quot;
Not even gonna lie, I totally slept on this album when it came out. I used to be a listener that never really pays attention to lyrics just mainly beats. But when I came across this video and saw a 10/10 I knew Fantano heard what I didn&#39;t. I listened to it a few more times and it&#39;s by far my favourite hip hop album today. Kendrick the GOAT.
I fuckin love You Ain&#39;t Gotta Lie, this vibes are like just what this world deserve,
Excellent record
Only a 4/10!? What?!?
You&#39;ll never get to heaven is still waiting for you Anthony just open your heart and accept it as your new record to review
I just realised today how much this album reminds me of Selby&#39;s Last Exit To Brooklyn
this album took My musical virginity
Honestly this is my least favorite of his 3 albums, not including Untitled Unmastered. Not saying its bad, cause it an amazing album all around, just personally liked Section.80 and good kid mad city more
Well deserved 10... great piece of artwork
I don&#39;t know about you Anthony, but i&#39;m excited to see the new content that Kendrick is releasing soon.
Kendrick&#39;s new album is coming!
more like internet&#39;s busiest music turd HAHA. kidding. love ya
Hey Anthony, can you please do a classic review of The Infamous?
Sooo would you say this is a must buy if you really really liked good kid, mad city ?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=539">8:59</a> lmfaooooooo
so upset i discovered you so late
Cal could never be happier! <br>Yeah<br>Yeah<br>Yeah<br>Ye<br>Yea<br>Yea<br>YeH
Youre awesome man, cant believe i havent seen this channel before
Remember: <br><br>Hood Politics is also taking about accolades he has coming from Compton. He&#39;s being subtle about his origins, and why he&#39;s not one to be fucked with. Also, he was pondering what was back home after he had left, realizing that it&#39;s the same thing going from when he &quot;made it&quot;.
lol he cussed mathematics by mos def at 9 minutes
TWO YEARS BABYYYY
Ironically you ain&#39;t gotta lie is one of my favorite song from TPABF
Meh fuck kendrick
There&#39;s no way around it, Kendrick Lamar is the greatest rapper of all time. This album certainly deserves a ten.
I like TND but hes giving Kendrick props for the things I see him criticize others for.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1200">20:00</a> Anny Fantany hitting &#39;em with the shade
This album changed my life.  And im not even a huge Kendrick fan
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=620">10:20</a>. You&#39;re welcome.
TPAB is A Fucking Masterpiece. Best Album I&#39;ve Ever Heard in My Life
Lol, you said Hopsin&#39;s Future parody was a great track because it sounded good. This album sounds like garbage and you give it a 10/10? Lame.
Album of the decade 
ISSA 10
This is probably the best album review I&#39;ve ever seen...also one of the best albums too.
Forever?
It amazes me how much lamar has grown on me. When good kid maad city came out I thought it was ok at best, now I think it&#39;s a 10/10 if not a high 9/10 after listening to it through. I gotta try out this album too now because I also thought it was decent but not a 10/10.
Meh
his album was lyrically and musically real good but his voice pitches killed me.. i give it a 5/10.. i feel this album is for mainstream heads... i cant listen to his new style much.. i wished he kept his style like his high power style
zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom zzoom zoom zzoom
fantoine coming up for 2 mil
2M ON THE WAY
how do you do this shit is ridiculous how you can break down music PROPS BRO
Fucking beautiful album each time you listen to it. It gets better. 10/10
I knew from the 10 seconds of listening to Alright on the radio, I was gonna love the entire album
OH YEA, HES GONNA REVIEW IT, HES GONNA REVIEW IT, HES GONNA REVIEW IT
section 80 my favorite album ever right next to bastard by Tyler wasn&#39;t to much of a fan of Good kid madd city though I mean it was good but I only liked 3 four songs
The album is almost perfect but a lot of wack instrumentals. Like the song Alright, whilst having great lyrics, has a crappy beat which on paper seems good seeing as it mixes Trap percussion with Jazzy different styles of music that most kids nowadays wouldn&#39;t listen to. However the execution was poor and Pharrell should be shot for producing that crap imo.<br><br>The songs You Ain&#39;t Gotta Lie, Momma, Hood Politics and Institutionalised also had bland beats which was a shame because apart from those beats all the other songs were perfect and the lyrics, theme and overall cohesion of the album was perfect
If it&#39;s a matter of fact, this album is bullshity not well delivered stuff. It is obvious and doesn&#39;t have a shred of originality. Boring
It is not a 10. And you know that. You just are bored as hell and you love Lamar at that point and it&#39;s like you wanna get married to him.
when i listen to kendrick i kinda feel that there&#39;s still hope for hip hop cuz as you may know mumbling rap is killing hip hop
This is my favourite review of all time. I come back to it so often. I just love fantoine saying &#39; ThiS. Dick. Aiint. FREEeeEEE&#39;
At the end of Mortal Man, Kendrick asks Pac what his thoughts are on the whole concept of To Pimp a Butterfly, which, as we know, is left unanswered. Pac left him hanging, just like he left us hanging. Pac&#39;s life ended so abruptly, he left us wanting more. <br><br>Fun fact: If you listen to the album on loop, there is actually an answer to Kendrick&#39;s question. Pac&#39;s final words to Kendrick were &quot;Every nigga is a star&quot;.<br><br>Fucking. Genius.
IMA get my kids hooked on this album<br>and they ain&#39;t even born yet
originally it was gunna be called &quot;Tu Pimp A Caterpillar&quot; which would have been an acronym for &quot;Tupac&quot;
HE GAVE A 10 HOLY FUUUUUCK
I really want to like this album, but I just don&#39;t...
So I&#39;m new to liking Kendrick Lemar and I want to buy my first album and I wanna know which album do you think should be my first one?
By far the most unique and influential album that I have ever heard in my lifetime. I am however 23 years old so I haven&#39;t lived through some of the break through musical moments in history.
Most overrated album of the century, some of ya&#39;ll saying it&#39;s the best album ever? Cmon now.. Sec80 AND GKMC are both better 
I&#39;ve tried to get into Kendrick for awhile now and I&#39;ve seen all of needles reviews + listened to all of the albums and I just can&#39;t do it. I respect him lyrically and just overall being a great artists but all his music I just can&#39;t enjoy.
2017 still listening to this album front to back
eh, hes so preachy, its actually annoying. I don&#39;t think the lyrics are even slightly impressive, they sound like something anyone could write. His voice is meh. The beats are boring and generic as piss, they actually sound like presets in a free instrumental pack. The songs aren&#39;t progressive or creative, and multiple songs sound far too similar. I really don&#39;t understand in the slightest how this album garnered so much attention, It brings absolutely nothing to the table, I give it a 2 out of 10 overrated poop stains
IF THESE WALLS COULD TALK .... SEX.   <b>MIND BLOWN</b>
&quot;While this album does have a few BONES TO PICK&quot;
like on my momma nigga K dot gonna be the greatest to ever do this shit like forreal doe onna dead homies
okay I&#39;ll be the outcast here. this album is wack. the jazzy melodies are soothing but never really go anywhere catchy or amazing. Kendrick&#39;s nasaly style is annoying as hell. his rap has bad flow over the beats. he comes off as a pretentious hipster trying way too hard to be meaningful and poetic like 2pac ,nas or big. overall, I prefer his bubble gum shit like swimming pools because at least there he&#39;s got catchy beats decent vocals and good hooks which is nothing tpab has.
Kendrick is the 3rd best rapper of all time
Now this album in the Harvard music library, this really the best rap record of this decade
This review is gonna go double platinum with no features
This record is always on repeat when I run... it has made me cry several time, a true master piece THANKS LORD
If Good Kid M.A.A.D. City was Tommy, then To Pimp a Butterfly is Quadrophenia.
Almost 2mil, not bad man, and no wonder, one of your best reviews.
These walls is my favorite kendrick song and I feel that you didn&#39;t discuss it enough
Overly dedicated so underrated
You should do a podcast
<a href="https://soundcloud.com/matthew-coolcat-shaw/sets/roma">https://soundcloud.com/matthew-coolcat-shaw/sets/roma</a><br>SOLO ARTIST I PLAY AND SING AND RECORD EVERYTHING MYSELF PLEASE GIVE A LISTEN OR TWO I SUCK AT EVERYTHING BUT MUSIC AND PART OF ME THINKS I SUCK AT THAT TOO
Have you read the credits on the album? Its ridiculous, Lamar can&#39;t write something by himself. That shouldn&#39;t deserve such a rating.
First good review I&#39;ve ever seen on his channel
I don&#39;t really like modern rap too much, but I like this album. It&#39;s cool hearing that it has alot of depth that I never thought about. Great video :)
Hey, Anthony, I really enjoy your stuff, but I&#39;m curious. Are the zoom ins, audio reversals and loop cuts completely random or is there some kind of meme I&#39;m just not in on? Maybe some kind of artistic brush strokes for consistency?
B A M
a few bones to pick<br><br>geek
Good Kid Maad city is my absolute favorite.
WHY NOT AN 11 FANTANO? HMM&gt;?
Loved the shrek reference at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=685">11:25</a>
who the fuck dislikes this?
This is where they go when their favorite rapper gets a 4/10
Why not an 11/10 you son of bitch!!!
Section.80, still my favorite Kendrick Lamar album
When the cole and k.dot collab album drops...üòçüòçüòçüòç
damn how long did it take you to write this review lol
I rewatch this review just to see Anthony happy.
Can I live with you in the sea.
tpab&gt;&gt;illmatic
hey you should do god vs satan by jakki tha motamouth
Not even gonna look at toxic comments. Just gonna enjoy the review and throw the record on for myself! ...after I type this.
To be completely honest you should not do Kendrick reviews. You will no matter what say it&#39;s good even if it&#39;s awful. You literally jizz by thinking of Kendrick fucken loser
classic/10
Most overrated album of all time
This is one of those albums that makes me go &quot;Oh! I shouldn&#39;t make music!&quot;
omg he a actually gave an album a 10
Section .80-8<br>Good kid-    9<br>Tpab-          10<br><br>Next album is gonna be an 11 guys
isa muhammad
Anthony gives kendrick a 9 for GKMC.<br><br>Fans: WHY NO 10!! <br><br>Gives kendrick a 10 for TPAB<br><br>Fans: <b>ROLLEYES</b> YOU&#39;RE SUCH A KENDRICK STAN!!<br><br>Lol. Fake fans are horrible.
It&#39;s 5AM. I&#39;m still awake.
You gave props to Kendrick for putting the blame on himself when it comes to large social issues. When Macklemore did the same thing, you trashed on him for it. Obviously I think Kendrick is a much better rapper, but just looking for some clarification
U know what was my favorite track on the album? Read the first word again.
Without Kendrick and a handful of other artists, we should be very scared because that will be the end of hip hop with all the greats getting old. Hopefully new rappers will come up with an old school, lyrical flow not this garbage mumble rap. And I&#39;m not an old head, I&#39;m in highschool.
Kendrick is a poet
Good review
some of these comments are cringeworthy, good album tho
If this album was made by anybody else it would&#39;ve got a 6/10
your too critical broƒè
I hate rap fans of now<br><br>All of them now likes Kendrick Lamar and Joey badass
I love the fact that when you like an artist everything he does is just fantastic (actually I do not, it is a sarcasm)... I compare this review to J Cole&#39;s review, I love both rappers and think one is above the other for sure, but they are 2 of the best of this era, different but still great in my opinion... it is okay since people want to compare them to feel like praising the one you like the most and degrading the other, but you do review,your preferences should never be that obvious... you talk like someone who knows what he is talking about so your critics while they are accurate are based on personal feelings, you see the bad side of what the artist you less like does and only the bad... it makes you dangerous.
Anyone here like forest hills drive better I did.<br>Not to say I didn&#39;t love this record but it was more of a conceptual album to me than a sonically pleasing album <br>To me forest hills drive had better samples better beats and more songs to vibe and jam to<br>Plus j cole probably did like 80% by himself which to me gets a lot of respect and no features<br>Let&#39;s get this clear I LOVED THIS ALBUM<br>No hate on it whatsoever I&#39;d give it a 9/10 but my main thing with music is that it has to make me nod my head first and give me a certain level of funk face like something stinks and only a few songs on TPAB did that where as FHD had half the songs like that.<br>Also people don&#39;t get that FHD did have a concept not as much as TPAB but it was a rags to riches concept<br>Also let&#39;s be clear this album definitely bodied for your eyes only<br>Still loved that album<br>That was my opinion what&#39;s yours?
All really true stuff, but man... The thing I hate &#39;bout criticizing is that it limits the power of the message. It&#39;s like explaining love with words: yes, you can give it a shape, but you are not actually describing love.
Damn son. Excellent review
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=683">11:23</a> Damn that Shrek reference.
YE YE YE YE YE
Yall let anybody just come and give their observations on hiphop, like who is this guy! And you obviously don&#39;t know what a metaphor is.. Doesn&#39;t matter how many view you get..you will never be relevant in the hiphop community..who let you in anyways? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23thefuckery">#thefuckery</a>
My favourite album of all time
how do you praise kendrick here for contradicting himself on record and then blast ab soul for the same thing??  no consistency in these reviews
If this was a j cole album, balding flannel would give it a 7.
Congratulations !!!!
One of the best albums I&#39;ve ever heard . . .
What? NeedleDrop satisfied? Nah, blow away! haha
I love listening to Anthony talk about albums that he loves.
liked because of &quot;layers like an onion&quot;
Still no review has he ever been this excited about.
But if Kendrick had a song called &quot;foldin clothes&quot; ... lol
i really dont think the album is as good as he thinksi give it a 8.7/10 and keep in mind im a die hard kendrick fan
I don&#39;t like rap but fuck me this album is good
Best album of the past decade? No way.
Kendrick dickriders.....Kendrick dickriders everywhere!
How Much a Dollar Cost continues to be my favorite rap song to this day
10!
you know when he throws the piece of paper, he&#39;s about to go all out
I still always come back to this album after almost 2 years, and I like it better each time and always catch something I missed the last time, this album deserves hundreds of careful listens. fucking love you Kendrick.
Probably the best album released during my short 18 years on earth
Bompton*
Mortal man gave me chills especially at the end
its 4 am, im going to bed
Almost 2 mil fandango<br><br>EDIT: ALMOST 3 MIL!!
ITS A 10 NOW
I think I&#39;m gonna give this another listen. I already like it, but I KNOW I missed things.
this album was average
god i hate this over rated album so much
Alright is the best in the album, in my opinion
Alright is the best in the album, in my opinion
Kendrick&#39;s just bitching about being black in America‚Ä¶
Is anyone else scared of putting &quot;For Sale&quot; on repeat while your sleeping? &quot;Want youuuuu&quot; üòà
suck em up
Where can i find the jazz track that is played on Mortal Man when he&#39;s having the interview with Tupac? it&#39;s absolutely magnific
You always wear this shirt in videos you want to get a lot of views.
if this was kenrick you would gave it a 10en/ten
SOUR SOUL- BBNG &amp; Ghostface Killah &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; To Pimp a Butterfly- Kendrick this album was fairly wack i&#39;d say kendrick tried to hard
this album was literally life changing for me
you suck
WEW
if it was kenrick or deaf grapr uoi would have given. it a 10
If good kid maad city is OK Computer, then To Pimp A Butterfly is Kid A.
Ive seen this review like 16 times already
I love this album but the songs on it aren&#39;t meant to be played when your music is on shuffle tbh. Kinda annoying when &quot;for free&quot; comes on
The best music is &quot;institutionalized&quot; in my opinion
What&#39;s a concept album?
Anthony&#39;s excitement in this review is infectious.
this must be the dopest album cover of all time.
This is where it all changed.
I totally agree with fantony about how some people might gravitate towards GKMC. I usually don&#39;t take the time to listen to albums in their entirety so personally - after having listened to both twice - I&#39;m gravitating more towards the cohesive story and just casual listenablility of the GKMC songs. Even thought 2PAB is also no doubt a masterpiece, to a more inexperienced listener like me songs like These Walls and Alright are the main appeal. Of course How much a dollar cost and for example u also have quite the kick to them for when you really need some powerful or thought provoking listening.
U
A 10 album and you can&#39;t even make a good TRAN...SITION for it?!
Great fucking review. TPAB really does deserve a 10. This album is one of my favorites and I appreciate it even more after watching this video :) THANK YOU ANTHONY I LOVE YOU
deserved that 10
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=537">8:57</a> hahahahaha
October 2016 and still listening the whole album.
22 full minutes of gargling kendricks nuts. fuck yeah
he gave this a higher score than TPAB lmao
Just listened to the album twice in a row. My ears sting so much right now, but it was totally worth it. 10/10 would listen a third time.
This is the true meaning behind To Pimp A Butterfly and it&#39;s quite amazing: <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/vigilantcitizen.com/musicbusiness/deeper-story-kendrick-lamars-album-pimp-butterfly/amp/?client=safari">https://www.google.com/amp/vigilantcitizen.com/musicbusiness/deeper-story-kendrick-lamars-album-pimp-butterfly/amp/?client=safari</a>
&gt;no trendy instrumentals <br>&gt;parliament inspired rhythm section<br><br>that shit was tired years ago... boring album
I think you&#39;re really biased towards Kendrick, this wasn&#39;t even his top 3 albums let alone &quot;One of the best of the decade&quot;
I think you have a little something white hanging from your lip...
&quot;This many people died. FEEL SOMETHING!!!!!&quot;
To pimp a butterfly was my first full rap album. Did enjoy üëå
Section.80 - 8/10<br>Good Kid M.A.A.D. City - 9/10<br>To Pimp A Butterfly - 10/10<br>Next LP - 11/10 confirmed
so anyone else surprised that he gave an album a 10?
Great video! I first heard TPAB when my brother played u in his car and that day, I really understood hip hop and that it&#39;s not all future Drake and Thug. not saying it&#39;s bad to like them thoughüòõ It&#39;s just the way he really makes you feel what he is feeling, which is something I&#39;ve never seen rappers nowadays. Songs like Alright,I,Complexion,U and more. You know it&#39;s just you never see songs combining real talk about the world and beats I prefer over some Drake and Future songs. And if someone tries to tell me I don&#39;t know hip hop I&#39;ve listened to people likeTribe,Outkast,2pac,Mos Def,Talib,Kanye,NWA,Snoop,<br>Dre and Eminem plus more I can&#39;t think of.
Kendrick thinks white people suck!
This album was complete trash, drake is better
radical stuff
Best album ever created.
An important thing for an artist to improve is to believe that you are already good but not nearly good enough and that you must be better. It stops you from being complacent and stagnating. This is something I believe kendrick does.
But you give plastic beach a 7???? Fuck you
this dICK AINT FREEIUAH
I love who Kendrick surrounds himself with, Flying Lotus, Sounwave, Terrace Martin, Kamasi Washington, Robert Glasper, Thundercat, Bilal, Anna Wise, etc. He understands that you have to work with great musicians in order to make great music, this album is beyond fantastic and absolutely perfect. Great review.
1.7
just noticed for favorite songs and least favorite he didn&#39;t put complexion there.
the most overrated album of the decade.
I love watching this review because Fantano is so obviously pumped about this record. That means he really cares.
That 2pac skit tho
I&#39;ve watched this review 5+ times I have no idea why
This is one of those albums I&#39;ll always come back to and leave with a different experience and different emotions, every time. A true masterpiece.
10/10 review it again 10/10 review it again
Do you still think this is a 10 now that you&#39;re part of the alt right?
I&#39;m a trained jazz musician and have always loved jazz music. I guess that&#39;s why I connected so well with this album. A lot of my friends at first were like, &quot;what? you like that album? that shit was so boring. I didn&#39;t get it at all&quot; and of course thats their opinion so I can&#39;t change how they feel. You definitely have to to have a certain musical appreciation to enjoy an album like this. The average trap music listener or hip hop listener is gonna overlook this album because they don&#39;t understand REAL INSTRUMENTATION, they only know 808s and snappy snares. Which is fine, I love trap music but kendrick is beyond hip hop.
Honestly the most impressive thing about this album was that I actually understood the story it was telling. I always hear about other popular albums telling these intricate stories that you don&#39;t know exist wheras TPAB is so easy to understand.
Banana
It&#39;s a cool album
Whenever i listen to this album, i actually listen from beginning to end. I don&#39;t skip songs (unless i continue where i left off) because it&#39;s so well put together. It would be like skipping scenes from your favorite movie. Dr Dre was right when he said that Kendrick actually got him listening to whole albums again.
YUNO REVIEW JARREN BENTON SLOW MOTION VOLUME 2
Fagtano
Being in the walls of a vagina, the walls of a prison, being in the walls of fame.
It&#39;s actually a story album as well and a sequel to GKMC. This starts after &quot;Compton&quot; and Kendrick getting fame and going through it. Momma means Africa but in the story it means his actual mom. In GKMC his mom leaves a voicemail telling him to go after his dreams but help the kids through his music. Kendrick forgot that and goes through &quot;U&quot; but in Momma he goes back home and remembers what his mom told him and starts helping people through his music, right after that all the songs are about real topics. It has many layers of meaning but I think one of them is a story component.
In These Walls if you pay attention he references sing about me, from section 80. Once you here that song you&#39;ll figure out who he&#39;s talking about in the beginning of These Walls.
22 minutes long. May as well just listen to the album.
how tf does this man LOVE good kid mad city but not 2014 forest hills dr? I honestly thought 2014 was better
smh lil boat got a 7/10 but this trash got 10/10 you done fucked bald ant
This album wasn&#39;t as good as GKMC. Everyone is jerking off over how TPAB&#39;s &quot;a masterpiece&quot; but I think it&#39;s just a 7/10 album.
Hood politics represents a younger Kendrick in his Kdot days when he was in experienced
Onethony Miltano!
This Dick ain&#39;t freee
One of the greatest albums I have listened to, Kendrick&#39;s conscious mind should help wake up those who need to be.
gayyyyyyyyyyyyyy]
his first trilogy albums are real authentic modern classic hip-hop albums. His style more based off the orginal formula of the GoldenAge with a modern twist to it. J.cole is another one especially with his Forest hill project.
Went to this after seeing it as #1 album of 2015. Meh this guys voice and beats are just not my taste.
DELUXE EDITION<br>17. 2Pacalypse Now (untitled 01)<br>18. i (Radio Version)
You gave Kidcudi a 0.989373638 but Kendrick a 10????? Wow you capitalistic pig
guap√≤oo
you all just dont understand,!Kendrick changed his sound to tribute snoop Dogg dr Dre 2 pac ice cube and more west coast legends,thats why it&#39;s amazing,its funkadelic soul and jazz is different and gets the point of view of Kendrick to you,so give this album more credit,a second listen will give you a better understanding to its instrumentals and meaning,plus I&#39;m sure Kendrick will go back to good kid and section80 later,it takes guts to do this on your official second album,to prove the work he put into it,he got 11 Grammy nominations which is 1 away from Michael Jackson, he won 6 which is all the Grammys in the hip hop genre,lol I&#39;m 14 and all you people just don&#39;t understand,its sad what happen to hip hop man,but go ahead listen to future listen to young thug listen to drake,but just know that they are nothing to KING KENDRICK
I fucking hate you
Anyone else think GKMC was better?
Bruh no shit it&#39;s about tupac. It almost called tu pimp a caterpillar tu p a c then he changed it to butterfly.
To PIMP a Butterfly actually is a story. The album is his personal journey of transforming from a caterpillar (or someone who is pimped by the environment around them) to a butterfly  (who pimps it&#39;s environment to its benefit). At the end Kendrick becomes a butterfly.
I remembered it was such a big deal when it got a ten. Now it&#39;s like &quot;well yeah, no shit&quot;. It&#39;s a perfect album
review below the heavens by blu &amp; exile
good album but it ain&#39;t no Views
Good kid, m.A.A.d city was better imo
AYYYYYY CHESTA
Kendrick- &quot;nigga fuck dat&quot;<br>Young Thug- &quot;Fuck Cancer&quot;<br><br>You tell me who the better rapper is.
where the fuck is Black On Both Sides by Mos Def
So many kendrick haters smh too simple minded to understand his lyrics and meaning
kendrick isn&#39;t the future, he is the past.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1320">22:00</a> it&#39;s desiigner everybody! üòÇüî•
MBDTF vs. TPAB<br><br>Thoughts...?
I used to like Good kid maad city better. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I still loved this album, but not as much as Kendrick&#39;s previous effort. But it&#39;s really been growing on me a lot lately,  which I think is a testament to how deep this album is. You may listen to it and initially not get the hype, but after listening to these songs over and over again, you realise that you don&#39;t get sick of them. You only like them more.
This album was trash
Drakes firing subliminals at kendrick in this new feature:<br><a href="https://soundcloud.com/mr-e-and-vitamin-dee/asmr-barber-roleplay-feat-drake-ear-to-ear">https://soundcloud.com/mr-e-and-vitamin-dee/asmr-barber-roleplay-feat-drake-ear-to-ear</a>
Nigga, this is a 7/10 at best,  if anything&#39;s a 10/10, it&#39;s good kid maad city, you melon lookin ass nigga.
It seems like if anthony doesn&#39;t like someone&#39;s favorite artist they say &quot;OH YOU DON&#39;T LIKE MY (FAVORITE ARTIST&#39;S NEW ALBUM HERE) ITS PROBABLY BECAUSE ITS NOT KENDRICK&quot; Like sit the fuck down nigga.
This shit is trash.  Nothing on this shit goes harder than ugly god i beat my meat
Was this Anthony&#39;s first 10/10?
I love drake but I find as time goes on I lose that love. All drake ever talks about is love and the girls he had when Kendrick has a story and his lyrics have a meaning to the point where many people would cry Bc of the current events that are going on. This album was strait a amazing. &quot;Martian had a dream,Kendrick had a dream.&quot;
Pimp Pimp
The original title of this album was titled: 2PAC = To Pimp A Caterpillar. <br>No joke.
Lil Boat is only 3 away from TPAB?
I mean, it&#39;s a great album. Definitely will be a classic, but I still find it a little bit overrated. Imo, it&#39;s not as good as GKMC. It just doesn&#39;t have the same replay value and some of the songs is quite boring actually.
This is a good album it has some really good songs but everyone overhyped it and jumped in the bandwagon to dick ride kendrick, just bc he addressed big issues, but if Kanye or someone else does this people attack wtf
I think it&#39;s about 4am, perhaps I&#39;ll hit the hay.
With all of the things I&#39;ve disagreed with you about, I can forget about all of that knowing that you gave this masterpiece the perfect score it deserves.
This is as easy as it gets to give a 10! Is there any other album he&#39;s given a 10????
I personally liked G.K.M.C way more than TPAB, in all honesty I thought TPAB was a 6/10, just couldn&#39;t get into it.
this DiCk AiNt FrEeeee
you ain&#39;t gonna lie is sooooooo gooodd though !!!!!!!!
This dick ain&#39;t free
This is overhyped honestly. Hell yeah Kendrick Lamar is talented and this album is great, but this is child&#39;s play for other rappers. People just hype this up so much because Kendrick is a more mainstream and more well known rapper in the hip hop industry, so when he drops good stuff of the caliber, it&#39;s a big deal. Kendrick is going to be the face of political rap in the eyes of all these people who don&#39;t bother to give anyone a listen who doesn&#39;t appear on the radio, which is sad. For example a certain phone brand made a waterproof phone, a year later a different phone brand who happens to have a fruit for their logo will do the same, then everyone will be mind blown even though it has been done already, just by a company that isn&#39;t regarded as much. Just an analogy that came to mind. Once again not saying it&#39;s bad, just overhyped since underground artists have been doing stuff like this. Give underground artists a chance, you will be enlightened.
Fantano changed his wallpaper for KDot.
Omfg! Me and needle agree on something!!!
I&#39;m usually not a huge hip hop fanatic. But this album shocked me. I think this album will go down in history as being one of the defining albums of the 2010&#39;s, and one of the greatest albums of all time.
These Likes ain&#39;t free!
flawless
The relevance of this album today is absolutely amazing.
+theneedledrop review Kush x OJ.. very important mixtape for modern hip hop
oh shit. I need that I need that sloppy <br>that sloppy<br>like a chevy in quicksand <br>gyeah<br>that sloppy
Best album of the decade? <br>Only if its the most RACIST album of the decade.<br>This album is thrash.
looking back I remember throwing the album to the side because I didn&#39;t like the different fusion of rap with other genres but after months and came back to realize how genius it was truly a milestone in hip hip
Damn he gave it 10! That&#39;s wild
I&#39;m surprised you didn&#39;t touch on the story he presented on How Much a Dollar Costs. What I got from the song is that the money he got from his fame has come in-between his spirituality.
Pray that we exit the Bling era. I&#39;m tired of &quot;Versace Versace Versace Versace&quot;!
Would you consider this as one of your favorite albums ?
This is an amazing album, probably the best modern day hip hop album yet. I still think Kendrick can improve.
Man this album gave me such a satisfied feeling when I finally absorbed it all the first time
So re-watching this I noticed that Anthony&#39;s background record when reviewing this was The Chronic by Dr. Dre. I assume this is no coincidence. What other times does Anthony do this?
I was on the brink of tearing up after seeing this all the way through.
You can see Anthony so incredibly pumped up and hyped in this review. It&#39;s pleasant to watch how much he enjoys music.
might as well change this review to classic/10
I hated this record when I first listened to it because I was expecting/hoping for some catchy songs that were easy to listen to. I didn&#39;t  listen to it for about a couple of months and I was so disappointed. After hearing all the hype and things about it for a long ass time I gave in and decided to listen to it again, and I was in love. I looked up many lyrics on Genius and was absolutely blown away from the grand-ness of this album. This is absolutely positively one of the best albums I have ever heard. This needs to be a message to all artists who keep coming out with albums with no meaning, every album I know that dips deep into human emotion, etc. is always a good one. LEARN FROM KENDRICK
honestly I tried listening to this album before I&#39;d heard any Kendrick Lamar, or really trying to break down the music myself, and I feel like you have to have certain level of maturity and/or musical appreciation to really love this album
The juxtaposition of the cover art alone  is a 10.
This is the first hip hop/rap album I&#39;ve bought! I love it
guy&#39;s please check out the dodiboys the name of the song is Hello There
Kendrick is mainstream, but hes not mainstream
96 on Metacritic,Jesus Christ
good kid maad city was his best album imo
I love this review
this is such a good, well informed  review by Anthony. well deserved 10 to this album
The best thing about Kendrick, and what sets him apart is that he doesn&#39;t &#39;&#39; shove ideologies and statistics to you.&quot; He presents them to you humbly but at the same time convincingly.
TPAB&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
The only time I really felt him, was when he went on a track with Talib Kweli, and Curren$y
one of the albums that gives goose bumps
Kendrick Lamar aka the most overrated rapper since 2pac
Review 2pac - Me Against The World!!!
first time a review has made me cry
I love a lot of Kendrick Lamar&#39;s lyrics. But I feel like I have to sit down and read them to actually fully understand them and then research the references to god and the older rappers.<br>I like his music but I feel like a lot of the lyrics go over my head.
This album shouldn&#39;t even be in the same room as the chronic. It&#39;s a fucking joke compared to Dre
The best album reviewed by the best teeth in the fucking game.
Disliked.
fuck yo thoughts
This guy is so gay...
still amazes me how much this album grew on me
I masturbate to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1318">21:58</a>.
this is bullshit lol wtf of course you jump on the bandwagon
you pose¬† bias
your music artist and social knowledge made ur description of the album dead on!! kudos!!
looking back, this album has ruined hip hop for me. now whenever I hear an album, I&#39;m looking for a message or something with some substance. when I don&#39;t get it, it&#39;s immediately written off as bad in my mind. haha. only a few albums at this point that I can listen to, and of course, this is one of them.
review BERNERs HEMPIRE
Without a doubt, one of the BEST reviews I&#39;ve ever heard of any album, ever. No, scratch that, one of the best reviews of ANYTHING ever. So much information, opinions, extensive knowledge and well thought out points of view. This was amazing to listen to just like how To Pimp A Butterfly was! You just got yourself a new subscriber!
i cry evrytim
When Kendrick won the Grammy for Best Rap Album he saluted Nas &amp; Snoop and said, &quot;We will live forever, believe that.&quot; <br>Considering the fact that this album is already being taught in some schools, and the impact it made, like the protesters chanting &quot;Alright&quot;, I truly believe this album will live forever. It&#39;s just perfect.
yes
to pimp a butterfly or madvillain
I&#39;m pretty sure this is the most overrated album of all time
I have the same shirt.Kendrick-I tried.not for me.too much
Lmao when you realize King Kunta is just a good Started from the Bottom
how the fuuuuck did he not talk about how much a dollar cost. that song is imo the best track on the album! he is talking some reeeeeal shit
Pretty much the only track that I didn&#39;t enjoy all that much was Alright. The rest either made me go &quot;this is pretty good&quot; or they made my earpussy tingle like it was getting fucked by a 16inch sonic dildo. Outstanding album
A year later, I&#39;d give this album a 8/10. Tetsuo and Youth should have gotten more attention imo
this is amazing little late on my part but great video !
Speedin bullet 2 heaven was better
You could tell Fantwan was excited to review this. You could immediately tell by how he said his catchphrase.
Kendrick sucks Fetty Wap is better
One of the shittiest albums I have ever heard
dude in your 2 most popular videos you&#39;re wearing the same shit
I loved Cal&#39;s celebration on this on...
This Album is like many different perspectives, the perspective of the city, the perspective of the boy, the perspective of the celebrity, the perspective of the drunk, the selfish, the angry, the pessimistic, the optimistic, the industry, and many many more. <br>This album is literally a collage telling the story of the pains and problems of becoming famous coming from a poor background, using the facets associated with said problems as a conveyer of the messages and references he uses to tell us his story and points of view. That&#39;s what I take from it.
I gotta say. When you listen to GKMC you get into it quickly. When you listen to TPAB you have to listen to it a few times. But then its a truly masterpiece of the 21st Century.
This album made me wonder why racism still exists.
to pimp a butterfly aka most overrated album of 2015, by Kendrick Lamar aka a rapper every white person likes because he doesn&#39;t smoke weed.
Don&#39;t burn me at the stake but I don&#39;t like it.
i don&#39;t like it when cal dances or indicates that he is happy
I just love &quot;how much a dollar cost&quot; . so powerful
Coloring book or nah?
shut up
Your opinions suck
I don&#39;t see how you could rate this album so high. I was extremely disappointed with it. Honesty thought it was awful and a waste of $16. I think I deleted every song except King Kunta because the full album was Painful to listen to. It was literally hurting my ears. This is not a joke, the album was utter torture. I&#39;m not a hater. I wanted it to be good, but it was SO bad! Rant over
In my opinion Kendrick is probably going to end up like Eminem. He had a pretty good first album. His next album is arguably his best album. And this one is also thought as his best. And we don&#39;t know what is coming next. It will most likely be crap. If that&#39;s not the case..,.. Well shit.
Can you do Chance The Rapper album &quot;Coloring Book&quot;
this album has one of the best cover pic ive seen in, one of the best titles. I was feeling like listening to an album same lane as GKMC but better more polished, which kinda didnt make sense now that I think about it. I gave it half a listen on loud speaker lol but I&#39;m gonna listen to it now tho start to finish
I want no hate for this but... I think kendrick is pure ass lyrically. Kendrick is more of a listen-to vibe guy. My opinion though‚Ä¶
he looks like admiral bahroo XD
On God that yellow checkered shirt in this video, is so iconic to the theneedledrop it&#39;s amazing
In Momma he was actually talking about when he went to Africa and when¬†he talks about &quot;going back home&quot; he&#39;s referring to Africa. &quot;Tell your homies especially to come back home&quot;
This album really grows on you. The first time I listened to u or i or you ain&#39;t gotta lie or how much a dollar cost, I didn&#39;t like them. Now I love them
This is album is not a 10/10 .This album isn&#39;t even CLOSE to good kid maad city. This album was a step back.
kendrick lamar overrated
I don&#39;t even like this style of music, at all.. but this did impress me
GKMC still Kendrick&#39;s best album IMO
Rip Mama Pac
this review itself is a 10
The advantage of not being a native English speaker is that I can appreciate US Rap without being bothered too much by the lyrical content, most of the time. Of course I get some of the lyrics (and the spoken parts like the poem), but getting all of them would take too much concentration, especially with rappers who use heavy vernacular like Kendrick.<br><br>So yeah, I don&#39;t know if the album is super-political or what, but I really enjoyed it primarily as a piece of music. Despite its diversity it felt like one long, continuous track, and really unique overall. That can make it a bit tiring to listen in its entirety, but it&#39;s worth the effort ‚àí and it&#39;s certainly easier the second time, once you know what to expect. It does have its weird parts though (THIS! DICK! AIN&#39;T! FREEeeEEE!!!).
This album trash I got to track 4 and shut that shit offb
EVERY DRAKE ALBUM IS BETTER THAN TO PIMP A BUTTERFLY YOU DONT KNOW WHAT THE HELL YOURE TALKING ABOUT AND YOU CANT COMPREHEND THE GREATNESS IN DRAKES LYRICS
&quot;...a few bones to pick,&quot;. Clever slip-in
By far the worst album I have ever heard in my entire life. A review shouldn&#39;t be 100% opinion based, it should be split in the middle 50/50 between personal perspective and mass perspective. <br><br>Not only was this album boring, but there was no surprising lyrical content, the instrumentals were ALL trash (every single one), his flow is just annoying and doesn&#39;t even compliment the beats he&#39;s rapping over, he sounds like a 11 year old Casper the Ghost, and worst of all (did i forget to mention?) it&#39;s just boring, boring, boring.<br><br>I don&#39;t even like banger party music that much. I like real rap from people like Joey Badass, Earl Sweatshirt, etc, But this guy, he turns &quot;rap music&quot; into this god-awful compilation of dry beats accented by stale flows and dumbed-down boring lyrics.<br><br>Before anyone replies saying &quot;BUT HIS ALBUM HAS MEANING!! RACISM!!&quot;. Just shut up.  Want meaning? Go read a book, watch a documentary. Don&#39;t listen to some 11 year old Casper sounding depressing rapper trying to tell the world racism exists (duh). <br><br>Anyway, Kendrick I still like you as a human being, but your music was trash after MAAD City. Bye.
personally prefered tptb than tpab but thats just me
thith album ith largely contherned with thexual intercourthe
kendrick lamar sucks ass
You knew this dude was gonna give this album a 9 or 10 if the video was 22 minutes long...
Mr.clean
I personally feel that TPAB is equal to GKMC, probably better.
TOP 7 GREATEST RAP ALBUMS OF ALL TIME:<br>1.Illmatic<br>2.Enter the Wu-tang(36 Chambers)<br>3. Madvillainy <br>4. All eyez on me <br>5. Ready to die<br>6. Reasonable Doubt<br>7. To Pimp A Butterfly
Bought this album on google play and also got a hard copy but I&#39;d rate it 8/10 or 9/10
@theneedledrop hey your reviews are great!! i have one question, do u know an album what have a similar vibe like good kid maad city or tpab? like some psychadelic hip hop<br><br>greatings from germany :)
This album is so great that I have no idea how he can even follow it up.  The fact that Kendrick managed to catch lightning in a bottle twice like this is mind-blowing, but I&#39;m expecting the followup to not be as good.  Really, how do you follow up something like this aside from making the next Illmatic or something?
&quot;THIS MANY PEOPLE DIE, FEEEL SOMETHIN üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ omg

i love how he puts a vinyl of one of dr dre&#39;s first albums in the back in order to make himself look like he knows shit about rap but we all know he doesn&#39;t. <br>XDDD
KENDRICK IS A FUCKING GENIUS
can someone help me explain how to ignorant fools how the white person dead on the album cover of tpab is nothing against white people
you need to get in to Terrace Martin&#39;s new album &quot; Velvet portraits , browwww! ! ! ! ! !

How come you didn&#39;t add How much does a dollar cost in this? That was a huge turning point in the album

what&#39;s your favorite song on this album?
how does he give my beautiful dark twisted fantasy a 6/10 but this a 10/10? ok.
damn, great review. still bumpin TPAB to this day. keep up the good work. subbed.
illmatic will always be better
The instrumentals are, I guess in this generation, an acquired taste. That&#39;s mostly what I hear from people that call this &quot;trash&quot;. Of course you dont have to like this album because of it but you have very limited boundaries as a music listener.
how can you like this album and not like The Machine Gun Kelly album
i dont really like Kendrick //:
Just give this album time ... It will grow on u.
Hey, you should review Blessthefall&#39;s album &quot;To Those Left Behind&quot;  it&#39;s a great album. &lt;3

Sonically not even possible for ten.
cannot believe it&#39;s been a year. time flies. the memories of 2015 were great. great review as well.
I feel like GKMC was The Bends, and Kendrick just had his OK Computer with TPAB. The only question is can he drop a Kid A?
ha the ending was lolz
am I the only one who thought the only mediocre song on here was king kunta?
Imma be honest with u guys the only songs that really popped to me on this album was &quot;alright&quot; and &quot;King kunta&quot;. This is coming from a Kendrick  fan. To be straight up honest again. Dr dre&#39;s compton was a better album. REMEMBER I AM A KENDRICK LAMMAR FAN!!!!!!!
Kendrick is the Tupac Shakur of our generation
I thought this album was amazing, but I thought The Blacker the Berry was the worst song on the album.
so how much did Kendrick pay you to write a good review lol this album is sucky as hell
Kendrick Lamar: <b>burps with little belch</b><br>Anthony Fantano: 11/10
you ARE a joy and an inspiration!
Kendricks a good rapper, but him, j cole and logic have the biggest dick riders in the music industry
Most overrated hiphop album of all time in my opinion &amp; I&#39;m a Kendrick Lamar fan. Think everyone just got on the k.dot wave after he got those Grammy nominations and after he won. GKMC was waaay better Grammy or not.
DO AZIZI GIBSON
HUGE FAN OF KENDRICK I THINK I RESEMBLE HIM OR ATLEAST HIS RAW STYLE<br>WITH THAT SAID<br>ANTHONY CAN YOU PLEASE GIVE ME A HONEST REVIEW ON YOUR CHANNEL<br>I GO BY $HO LIV<br>MY EP NAME IS HEADBANGERS
This<br>dick<br>ain&#39;t<br>freeeeeeeee<br>REEEEEEEEEEEEE
Why does everyone forget about O.D. I love that album as much as any other one, almost more
TLOP is gonna catch this in views soon enough
how are you gonna make a 22 minute review?
Kendrick sucks
THUNDERCATS AAAOOOOHHH
as a teenager I like GKMC more because I can relate to it more, but as an adult I like TPAB more because of it&#39;s impact on society
Review Beautiful Pimp 2 by Rome Fortune plsssss
kendrick look like beetle lol
@theneedledrop was this your first 10? I dont remember you giving death grips a 10. Love the show dude, great job.
This and Rodeo are two of your longest/most detailed reviews. Very fitting for the best projects from 2015!
You have to do a review on untitled unmastered!
When are we going to get an untitled unmastered. review???
IGtony Ntano
Section 80 is better
they say the goverment aint the truth(4x)
You really gathered alot and understand the album and look deeper into it then most people do thats why i like your album reviews. Kendrick is a muti layered rapper and deserves someone to fully understand it and look for deeper things in lyrics
I listened to this album and I loved it
untitled.Unmastered??
Sooo Untitled.Unmastered????????????? I&#39;m waiting on the review
review Jummy by Gerry Read
When will we be seeing the review for &quot;Untitled Unmastered.&quot;??
Untitled/Unmastered 11/10
Untitled soon baby
This album is one of the ONLY albums that I can honestly say I like every song, It&#39;s up there with Enter the Wu-Tang for ME. 10/10 would save on spotify AND buy physically!
All these people died! Feel something!
At the beginning he sounds kinda like Spike from Cowboy Bebop...
Lol this guy &quot;praises&#39; Kendricks album  but doesnt &quot;get&quot; J cole?? i think he wants to get this because its openly positive, but other black artist that pretty much say the same he doesn&#39;t understand.
Lol damn I know he said if he had to pick one but I thought you ain&#39;t gotta lie was straight üî•üî•üî•
Fantano does love his bars.

This, is an Amazing review, Bro. Wow. You took the time to explain every issue-<del>in every way-</del> from depth and on point. I have never seen any of your other interviews, however, I shall. You spent the time necessary, to bring the most out of what is a highly complex awesome piece of history. Thank you for being more than an anthropologist ( which many people of different cultures are trying to do with their reviews of this work)--Thank you for being A Believer. A Participant. A Messenger. All I can say is. You Totally Brought This. Epic interview, dude. Epic. Btw, Hood Politics is more of Kendrick&#39;s strong stare in the mirror, and using the man he sees in that mirror, to speak to everyone who refuses to look into their own, bro. Layers upon layers of truth here. And, as I had a later introduction to Kendrick&#39;s Masterpiece, I can tell you, &quot;Most People&quot; agree with you. This IS the Best Rap Record of the Decade. And, even THE GRAMMY&#39;s agreed. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23puregenius">#puregenius</a>. It is a 10+
I really can see Kendrick collab&#39;n with the likes of Herbie Hancock, Janelle Monae, Sade, Ab-Soul, Robert Glasper, Black Thought etc in a psychadelic/ RnB funk album (if he hasn&#39;t collab&#39;d with any of them already). This was the first Kendrick album I&#39;ve listened to, and was extremely pleased...I mean, the production alone is unlike anything I&#39;ve ever heard, and I&#39;ve listened to quite a bit of music from all talents in all genres.
ALRIGHT
I only listened to the album once. It was alright.
This album is great and all, and this album is better than pretty much all of Kanye&#39;s album&#39;s....but how can always give Ye&#39;s albums 5&#39;s and 6&#39;s.............. MBDTF was AT LEAST an 8 bro
&quot;...he&#39;s dropping what&#39;s possibly the best rap album of the decade.&quot; Yes.
Great review, but what about that point at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=720">12:00</a>, people saying: &quot; &quot;Kendrick&#39;s just bitching about being black in America, Kendrick thinks white people suck.&quot; Well, that&#39;s really kind of a basic point of view.&quot;<br><br>Yeah, I agree, but who the fuck is saying that? No one.
Do you get paid for this. Like damn I need to get in this line of work
I was watching on 1.25 speed and I was wondering why he was running out of breath.
Can&#39;t wait to see Kendrick perform in March
LMBAO. hilarious comments on here and I love you youtube commentators - absolutely crack me up. With regards on the posted video review, then on the album TPAB. I really liked &#39;theneedledrop&#39;s review but it should have been only 10/15minutes tops. He rabbled on unnecessarily after discussing about how the album ended with a mind-fuck which I absolutely agree. I was in the basement of my house working out alone when I first heard the ending and I had to turn it off cause It felt like I was listening to a ghost and it spooked the $h!t out of me.
not one mention of being him being inspired by his trip in South Africa? ....uuuuuhm really? GTOOHWTBS!
Good review, detail review = Subscribed. <br>Thank you sir.
This album reminds me of when common dropped <b>resurrection</b> and I swore up and down nothing in the world was or would be better ....<br><br>The year was 1994<br><br>So you already know what I&#39;m bout to say. ..<br><br>Next thing you know<br> ILLMATIC DROPPED and nas been the king ever since. ...<br>But now <br>Kendrick<br>Lamar <br>IS <br>The<br>One<br>And<br>Only<br>True<br>Threat <br>To <br>The <br>Crown <br>Nas<br>Been<br>Wearing<br>For over twenty years of my life
Rapperss alway trying to sound so intellectual  with their album titles but they are not. There&#39;s a mile differnce between their personal life and character than their music and lyircs. They live in a dream world.
i disliked kendrick before this, wasn&#39;t a fan of GKMC or section 80 cause i wrote him off as a mainstream catchy rapper but after listening to TPAB i was stunned at how great it was. Been my favorite album of all time since and i&#39;ve re-listened to GKMC and section 80 with a new mindset and holy shit kendrick lamar is the best artist of our generation.
need to do &quot;YOU SHOULD BE HERE&quot;  - KEHLANI
Don&#39;t forget the religious themes!!!<br><br>TRUST IN GOD
I&#39;m not really a rap fan, but should I consider buying this album? This review and the reviews on Metacritic seem extremely positive.
This definitely deserves the 10.
I love that he references Fela in this album
That Lucy stuff really isn&#39;t anything new. Slug was using the term way before Kendrick.
I wonder if Kendrick&#39;s next album will top this. Or really if people will view his next album as better than this album.
I wonder how Kendrick feels now. He is going down as one of the greatest rap artists of all time, and maybe even one of the best artists of our generation. Well done Kendrick, and well done Anthony, good review.
Fuck Taylor swift
I&#39;ve had this album playing in my car for over a month now. I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m going to burn myself out on it and never listen to it again, but this album in particular is all I want to listen to right now. It&#39;s just so insanely good. Easy 10 for me and I&#39;ve never given any album a 10 before. I&#39;ve never given... anything a 10 before really lol.
I agree with the 10, but the ending of this video might be the most incredibly obnoxious thing i&#39;ve ever seen.
how in the FUCK did Taylor swift beat this????????????????
fun fact: institutionalized can also be heard as institutional lies its the same thing as what he did in ADHD when the chorus says &quot;fuck that&quot; which also sounds like &quot;Fuck Thought&quot;
I thought this album was boring
the album is amazing but u my friend r a pile of shit
I like how he writes his notes down. just a suggestion speak straight up
Am I the only one that thought this album sucked?
you should do a review on Karol Conka, a brazilian rapper !!! She is awesome
this video has more views than kendrick sold albums. guess that tells me about how good that did huh? Nice grammy i see you kendrick
although really invested music fans tend to not care about the GRAMMY&#39;s or who receives them, still can&#39;t help but be mad at Kendrick not getting album of the year for TPAB. With that the GRAMMY&#39;s are saying, Kendrick has to exceed perfection to win. How does this one slip away? Seemed like such an easy choice. hmm.
10/10. To be exact, my 238th favorite album ever.
I don&#39;t understand how someone can keep making masterpieces over and over again. Kendrick Lamar is special
So you gave FHD a 5-6 yet Kendrick a 10 ? lol ...OK
Given how open you are to Sargon, dislike the PC crowd, love music albums that rightly deserve their spotlight, bravo Anthony. Just. Bravo.
It&#39;s amazing...this is one of those rare instances where everyone seems to agree on a album that is totally a 10. Worthy of it&#39;s Grammy win. Thundercat needs a lot of credit for helping shape the overall aesthetic of the record.
This is by far the best scripted review you&#39;ve ever done. Fantastic review.
Okay, you&#39;ve enticed me! I will get this album.
Am I the only one who loves TPAB but finds GKMC easier to enjoy and jam out to?
I cant&#39;t believe he didn&#39;t talk about How Much A Dollar Cost?
Rap sucks!!!
KENDRICK GOT ROBBED YET AGAIN!!!
tbh i barely noticed the judge at the bottom of the album cover.
It is an absolute abomination that this did not win album of the year. I cannot put in to words how disappointed I am in the Grammys YET AGAIN, just flat out absurdly unconscionable.
Anyone else rewatching this after the disapointment at the grammys?
onethony milltano
I wasn&#39;t impressed with the album...or Kendrick Lamar in general.
I want to make a ringtone of you saying &quot;THIS. DICK. AINT. FREEeeeEeEeeEeeeeEEEEeee&quot;
I just listened to the ending of mortal man at the park. <br>The moment he&#39;s telling pac about the butterfly a white butterfly passed by. <br>I was magic johnson park in  compton.
I still feel 2014 forest hill drive is better :/
Though I think the album is rather overrated, I enjoyed your detailed review. I think Lupe Fiasco&#39;s album of 2015 is the best and most underrated Hip Hop record and deserves as much praise as Kendricks
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=724">12:04</a>
you should make another review for it... because there are a lot of hidden meanings which you missed on the first listens
shocking bandwagon douche heard something was interesting
Cal is so weird I forget he&#39;s Fantano in a costume lol
beautiful
Future and Young thug fans leave now.
I didn&#39;t even like rap before this, that&#39;s how good this shit is god damn!
I would say king kunta is radio friendly though (not necesarily a bad thing)
Great album, my favourite Hip-Hop album since Madvillainy. I still prefer Madvillainy though.
Yes it&#39;s all true, everything you&#39;ve said depicts Kendrick&#39;s message and I thank you needle drop for explain the incredible genius behind Kendrick&#39;s &quot;To Pimp a Butterfly&quot;, to those who don&#39;t understand the meaning and those who hated this album because they wanted another &quot;Good Kid Maad City.&quot; When this album first came out it was hated and disliked for not being another GKMC and Kendrick did not get the credit he deserved for bringing so much rap and hip-hop history into one album, while also making it appeasing to multiple audiences. So I&#39;ll say it again, Thank you.
When kendrick wins the album of the year (I believe :D ), I&#39;m gonna flip the f out :).
I like how you can describe the music with the words you use.
I understand why he loves his album but like 10/10? He gave MBDTF by Ye a 6/10 like what
This album grew on me like my erection. Soooo good!!
Lol, you people really overrate..
I hope that you actually feel this way as much as this video is edited. Its edited so much that its hard to watch at points.
I thought it was decent.. then i listened to it after some boomers. It all made sense.
After the first time I heard To Pimp A Butterfly I did thought it was cool, but to be honest I rather just listen to some old Nujabes tracks.<br>I liked Good kid Maad city more.
Been a fan of kendrick sense 2007
Kenthony Lamartano&#39;s favorite albums of 2015:<br><br>To Butterfly a Pimp - Anthrick Famar<br>Speeding Heaven to Bullets - Kid Cudley<br>Zeeyus- Wanye Kest
Review Islah and luca brasi 2
In order to understand this review and the true art displayed in this album, you need to read the LYRICS. Go back to Pac days were the beat doesn&#39;t matter, it&#39;s what is being said. This is the best album of our generation. No one compares, I&#39;m sorry.
Anthony,<br>Before his death David Bowie cited Kendrick Lamar as an influence for his final album &quot;Blackstar.&quot; In your opinion is this the album you think was the one he was referring to either musically or lyrically?<br><br>Thanks.
Misusing your Aunt Florence...
I hate that people state their opinions as a fact and then expect to not be harassed by another people, you guys just have to understand that everyone has a differente taste and approach in music. I liked the album alot y¬¥know but it&#39;s way &quot;dense&quot; to get into (comparing to GKMC). I love funk and jazz maybe that&#39;s why im more drown into it if you dont like it, that&#39;s fine you dont have to call other people dickrickers cuz they like music that you dont. ITS FINE (btw sorry for my bad english)
I like GKMC more for its more ranty songs. I like those.
I would be interested in seeing a review of Soilwork album The Ride Majestic
Review the Greay(t) Area by Hdbeendope
Hip hop music sucks wang wtf is wrong with you people
Kendrick is the best of course
To everyone who didn&#39;t like this album based off of a few listens, re-listen to it and really focus on the lyrical content or even read the lyrics while listening. This album has so many layers and metaphors that will be missed over and over if this album is listened to mindlessly. It is definitely worth it to truly understand this project. This album will go from a bad/decent album that probably has some good message behind it, to a perfectly crafted masterpiece. You will appreciate Kendrick&#39;s work so much more.
This album is timeless. Destined to be a classic.
Honestly I&#39;ve really struggled with liking this album. I&#39;ve listened to it a few times after it was widely posited as album of the year/decade and really wanted to like it, but it seems wildly overrated to me. Granted the beats are different but that doesn&#39;t necessarily make them good  and the lyrics are good/ the flow is pretty tight, but for some reason the moment this album dropped other artists who&#39;ve been rapping about the race issue for decades seemed to not exist and everyone was saying he was the only artist to ever touch on the subject. I don&#39;t mean this comment as an attack but instead I want to understand the mindset of why this is so much more different/better/original than other, very real, exceptional artists like Tech N9ne, Murs, Dizzy Wright, Immortal technique, Lupe Fiasco etc...
All Balls Don&#39;t Bounce, album by Aceyalone (1995) <br><br>educate yourself ppl
memerap
I&#39;m not the biggest hip-hop/rap fan, but thanks for turning me on to this album and artist, Mr. Fabtanlio. Good shit.
this album was great lyircally but sonically it was terrible which is why i dont see why this album is that great. production plays a key role in music and the beats just didnt cut it for me.
I know this is usually a deductive saying, but it rings so true here: if you don&#39;t think this album is a huge artistic accomplishment, you just don&#39;t get it yet
you should review rigmarole by pep love
New Radiohead LP Scantpony Nintendo?
The first time I saw this review was over 22 minutes, I knew he was going to give it a 10.
damn i listened to the album on shuffle, never understood the point of the poems -__-
race is literally just an illusion literally smh if kendrick an tupac don&#39;t do it I will.
someone tell him please tell everyone
cause I see what he&#39;s tying to do but he doesn&#39;t know how to give the killing blows and that science  is all he fucking needs!
and those two if they knew would be the cannons of stopping human ignorance if only someone gave them the ammo
it&#39;s this EVERY HUMAN ON EARTH&#39;S BLOOD AN DNA IS TIED TO ONE ANOTHER MAKE ING US ALL COUSINS WERE LITERALLY FAMILY AND ONE RACE RACE DOES NOT EXIST THIS IS SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN. if everyone knew that one simple fact we wouldn&#39;t have racism or be a giant step towards stopping it for good
I wish tupac was alive and I pray someone tells kendrick this one fact because of someone did the fire power they would have in there raps towards racist culture would be unbeatable
the only problem I have with kendrick and tupac is there human and humans like to say ignorant and vibe and feel special I hate humanity for raising two geniuses and putting a veil over there eyes because of that veil wasn&#39;t there they&#39;d be aliens better than humans
My ranking of the tracks<br><br>1. The Blacker The Berry<br>2. u<br>3. i<br>4. How Much A Dollar Cost<br>5. King Kunta<br>6. Mortal Man<br>7. These Walls<br>8. For Free? (Interlude)<br>9. Hood Politics<br>10. Complexion (A Zulu Love)<br>11. Momma<br>12. For Sale? (Interlude<br>13. Wesley‚Äôs Theory<br>14. Institutionalized<br>15. Alright<br>16. You Ain‚Äôt Gonna Lie (Momma Said)
kendrick lamar is pretty basic for my ears, i prefer to listen jhoann sbastien bach or enigma
U is the best song
overrated shit rapper the only reviews i did like was kid a and david bowie  the rest of the albums  were overrated or underrated, its a normal boring rap music
It is weird and sad that you still have to say &quot;George Clinton of Parliament Funkadelic.&quot;  I deplore snobbism, but if you seriously don&#39;t know who George Clinton is, connecting him to one group (that you also wouldn&#39;t know, if you don&#39;t know who GC is) isn&#39;t going to help.  In any case, nice job with the comments.  It isn&#39;t easy to opine about music, and you consistently do a great job.
S80: 7/10<br>GKMC: 9.5/10<br>TPAB: 9/10
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=326">5:26</a> what is that word? vinyette, vinyef?!! hard to look up the definition of a word you cant make out
Man if everyone could break down music like this we would be fine. Most people don&#39;t listen in detail.
wish you could have done a review on jadakiss&#39;s t5doa album...
I want to love this so much, I&#39;m fascinated by a record so prestigious, so heavy hitting with such a clear voice speaking on so many issues but I can&#39;t? The instrumentals bore the shit out of me, I can&#39;t stand it :(
Would anyone believe me if I said that I know people who don&#39;t like Kendrick Lamar&#39;s music? So far, it&#39;s only two, and no I don&#39;t know why either and they both listen to rap regularly too.
am i the only one who cant watch it anymore on youtube?
Maybe a 2Pac record should have been on the shelf instead of Dr. Dre.
i had to listen a few times
&quot;not a story album&quot; boii there&#39;s a story from top to bottom
I find it interesting how the black power &quot;wake the fuck up&quot; &quot;here&#39;s some random shit you can relate to&quot; etc etc structure/concept has been done plenty of times on albums, before TPAB, &amp; all of those (that I know of) are critically acclaimed. It seems that to get that stamp one has to talk about issues &quot;everyone can relate to&quot; &amp; do so in a &quot;fresh &amp; unique&quot; way. Kendrick&#39;s album was considered a classic before a full week of it being out, &amp; to this day I still think it&#39;s a 7/10. It grew on people I know. But to me it hasn&#39;t grown on me to that extent, &amp; I don&#39;t think it ever will, simply because it&#39;s an approach I&#39;ve heard time &amp; time again from great artists, or emcees. Nas &amp; Common both have a whole discography of albums with concepts like TPAB, &amp; that&#39;s just naming two emcees/artists of many. Kendrick is just great at adding to a style of music that already existed. I wouldn&#39;t say he&#39;s an innovator.
I thought this was a masterpiece, but GKMC was subpar in my opinion
if someone explained why this record is good to me who isn&#39;t really convinced that it&#39;s &quot;10/10&quot; album, u&#39;ll be a hero
When he wears that shirt you know that review gon be gud.
modern hip hop or whatever that is sucks sooo much....
i dont like it....its almost unlistenable execpt for a few funky  tracks...and he has no flow!!!!
I think with the exception of I, Alright and Blacker the Berry, this album tried too hard to be different. The instrumentals were fantastic but the lyrics were jarring and pretentious. It lacked the raw power and precision of Good Kid Mad City. Is it a bad album? No. It&#39;s got heart and promise but the overall concept is cringe-worthy. And Kendrick&#39;s butterfly rap screams bad fifth-grade poetry.
I love how at the beginning of his high rated videos he already looks really happy
This or My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy?
Best Album of 2015
Accessible lower-middlebrow schlock for the &quot;conscious&quot; house nigga and their peckerwood admirers...  <br>Light to decent 4/10
Section.80 &gt; GKMC &gt; TPAB
HIT ME
ONE MOLA BABY!!
Gives us your thoughts on Kendrick Lamar&#39;s &quot;God is gangsta&quot; (U/for sale?) music video
Is this Anthony&#39;s first 10 on the channel?
sub espa√±ol please:(
i don&#39;t care about grammys, but if this album wins its gonna be the best thing that can happen in 2016.
K&#39;man K&#39;man
I honestly didn&#39;t like this album, I thought it was too much to listen to.
Best album i&#39;ve heard this year.
Lol I checked the guest reviews on Metacritic for this album and there&#39;s just a bunch of troll comments such as &quot;This album sucks, he should&#39;ve made a GKMC 2! 0/10&quot; Meanwhile the actual critics positive reviews have brought the score up to 96. <br>Other reviews include:<br>AllMusic- 4.5/5<br>Chicago Tribune- 4/5<br>Cuepoint- A-<br>Entertainment Weekly- A<br>The Guardian- 4/5<br>The Observer- 5/5<br>Pitchfork Media- 9.3/10<br>Rolling Stone- 4.5/5<br>Slant Magazine- 4.5/5<br>Spin- 10/10
I believe he&#39;s talking to 2pac because he doesn&#39;t have anyone else who can understand his language like he does. Kinda like how Logic says he&#39;s the reincarnated Sinatra....Kendrick feels some deeper connection to Pac.
Snipe&#39;s Theory is my favorite song on the album.
Good Kid Maad City &gt; To Pimp A Butterfly
every album deserve a chance.. chill and listen to this album ...its incredible
what if anthony keeps on doing music reviews till hes dead and 20-30 years from now when hes old and wrinkly and shit for classic week he&#39;ll do tpab, to be kind, and the money store. wow
This album is a work of genius. One of my favorites of all time, because of the emotional impact it leaves on me. It really punches you in the face. Everything is communicated so perfectly, and the story is carried out at such a comfortable pace. <br><br>Also, if you put the entire album on repeat. At the end when he finishes reading the butterfly poem to Pac, and he says &quot;what&#39;s your perspective on that?&quot; It goes back to the beginning song and opens with &quot;Every nigga is a star&quot;. It sent chills down my fucking spine.
I&#39;m a huge Kendrick Lamar fan, but to be honest I thought this album was somewhat of a disappointment. The lyricism was amazing, but the producing was unappealing. As much of a great rapper Kendrick is, he can&#39;t just rely on his rhymes and meaningful messages to sell an album. You need BOTH good lyrics AND good beats to make a great album.<br><br>Personally, I&#39;d say Good Kid, Maad City had that perfect balance and that&#39;s why I say that album is better than To Pimp a Butterfly.
LOL! He said &quot;i&quot; isn&#39;t deep. Those lyrics are very poetic and subliminal and stuffed with double entendres. The whole song in general even has two meanings
If there was a PH.D. For 2pacOlogy Kendrick would have surpassed it. Kendrick sees himself as the second coming of tupac and he is.
I&#39;ve rewatched this video as my perceptions have changed of this album, and like I appreciated the album more and more as I relistened, I&#39;ve appreciated this review more and more. It has helped me put into words just what I love about this album.
a
10/10? Compared to what? The Captain &amp; Tennille? This joint is production smoke &amp; mirrors with lame writtens.
T(w)o Pimp A Butterfly = TPAB = 2PAB<br>T(w)o Pimp A Caterpillar = TPAC = 2PAC<br><br>&quot;Kendrick leaves with a great poem that he made for Pac and leaves us with a caterpillar which becomes and butterfly to escape the m.A.A.d city.&quot;(taken from genius)<br><br>Knowing that the album has many deep and hidden messages, this can&#39;t be a coincidence.
Anyone who absolutely loves You ain&#39;t gotta lie (momma said) ? Fucking love it haha
you didnt mention Alright smh
10 out 10 especially in this era haha
people who say kendrick is overrated are the dudes that dickride j cole
Anthony what are you thoughts on this? Do think To Pimp a Butterfly will beat 1989 at the grammys? I think To Pimp a Butterfly is much better lyrically AND musically, however more people can probably relate to Taylor Swift more than Kendrick Lamar... TPAB requires much more attention and is a lot harder to listen to for most people probably, but it is so beautifully crafted. To be honest it would be heart breaking for me at least to see an album with so much depth lose to the pop/mainstream one. What do you think?
But still, I can&#39;t see Kendrick ever topping &quot;good Kid Maad city&quot; <br>That album, minus the song &quot;Real&quot; was perfect
I&#39;m a fan of rock music, there is some hip hop albums that I like, but it&#39;s not really my taste in music, usually NME and pitchfork put some good rock albums or indie rock albums at their top of the years list, and I do enjoy some of them,  however this year they put this album, which I&#39;ve been giving it a listen over the past few days and I just don&#39;t seem to get it! Is it that I&#39;m just not a big appreciater (if that&#39;s even a word) of hip hop music? It&#39;s also so universally acclaimed and religiously protected from any bad criticism. Why? I felt nothing special hearing the dim witted lyrics, it&#39;s politically stupid, it&#39;s not catchy (other than &quot;King Kunta&quot;) it&#39;s musically disorganized and very messy and not in some &quot;artistic&quot; way either but in a literal sense, in which it sounds like garbled up crap! I just don&#39;t see how and why so many writers and listeners are heralding this album as &quot;iconic&quot;. I think they&#39;re reading too much into the abstract experimentation that went into this album. I can defecate in an art gallery, and people will stop and find some deep artistic meaning behind it, but in the end its just feces! There&#39;s better music out there people!
I didn&#39;t even know about the Tupac thing that&#39;s insane!
If Kanye out out this exact same album y&#39;all would have no gripes whatsoever.
I&#39;m loving how funky this album sounds. Why are there so many &quot;dickrider&quot; comments guys, it&#39;s a good album he can like whatever the fuck he wants.
AOTY
I hate that people solely believe TPAB is trash because of the instrumentals. No there isn&#39;t any trap beats, but don&#39;t you dare call it trash, because you can&#39;t comprehend spoken word, funk and soul music. And the deep messge. I&#39;m only a 12 year old girl, I honestly don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever fully comprehend it, but with eveey listen, it gets deeper, and you can just relate no matter what. Tracks like mortal man, and u are just so deep. I feel like people trashing Kendrick just because they being basic.
so the way it was explained to me, the third verse in these walls Kendrick is talking to the man who killed his friend in good kid maad city. considering that that death really happened in real life, I wonder if possibly Kendrick may have actually slept with the mans girl, and whether there actually is a man in jail somewhere listening to this
rip in peace the best song on the album &quot;Alright&quot; was never mentioned
I feel like Kendrick could have released an album consisting of the sounds he makes when taking a shit and theneedledrop would have given him a 10 out of 10.
You Ain&#39;t Gotta Lie is my favorite song, lol
check my song out I wanna get yo opinion <a href="https://m.soundcloud.com/810chance/share-a-thought">https://m.soundcloud.com/810chance/share-a-thought</a>
final conclusion: this album is fucking genius.
Here is a GOOD question...<br><br>Who has had a better three album run than Kendrick in HIP HOP HISTORY?!<br><br>1. Kendrick <br>2. Nas<br>3. Tupac<br>4. Kanye
Biggie is better
I know a lot of people will say it took a while for them to see how good this was, but the first time I listened to it, I loved it. By the second I was comparing it to MBTF , by the 3rd I knew it was better. I&#39;ve listened to it about 40-50 times since then and I truly believe it is IMO the greatest hip hop album ever. Like I know people will say illmatic but IMO this beats illmatic just because while illmatic is probably the greatest and most vivid story-telling album ever, TPAB goes beyond telling a story, it&#39;s like 16 stories in one album which are all interconnected but afterwards you get the same feeling as you do when you bust a nut....you know what I mean.
album of the year, all genres
to pimp a butterfly more like to shrimp a flutter guy lmao my sense of humor has been deteriorating since the 10th grade anyway listen to this <a href="https://soundcloud.com/yung_vonnegut/sets/feminist-social-thot-1">https://soundcloud.com/yung_vonnegut/sets/feminist-social-thot-1</a>
Yeah, this album is great
i rate 5/7
am i the only one who didnt like this album?
Is it really that good?üòê Which are the best songs?
Okay so this TRASH got a 10/10 but Kaleidoscope dream and wild heart got a 5/10 and a 6/10
I think that Good Kid was better. I didn&#39;t really like Pimp all too much.
what are the 10s he ever gave? Is this the only one?
Eattony Asstano
Political correctness and tepid worldview disguised by pseudo-intellectual lyrics and experimental, kitschy beats... Heartwarming and uplifting as a pile of steaming manure.. Feast on!
Stick this whole album on repeat and listen to Mortal Man, THEN Wesley&#39;s Theory. The intro to the first song on the album answers Kendrick&#39;s last, unanswered question to Tupac on the last song. Fucking albums looping into themselves people this is where we&#39;re at
Greatest Rap Albums IMO:<br><br>1. Ready to Die - Notorious B.I.G.<br>2. All Eyez On Me - Tupac<br>3. Enter the Wu-Tang: 26 Chambers - Wu Tang Clan<br>4. 2001 - Dr. Dre<br>5. To Pimp a Butterfly - Kendrick Lamar<br>6. Marshal Mathers LP - Eminem<br>7. Get Rich or Die Tryin&#39; - 50 Cent<br>8. Straight Outta Compton - N.W.A.<br>9. Illmatic - Nas<br>10. The Black Album - Jay-Z<br>11. Life After Death - Notorious B.I.G.<br>12. Speakerboxxx/The Love Below - Outkast<br>13. The Chronic - Dr. Dre<br>14. good kid, m.A.A.d city - Kendrick Lamar<br>15. College Dropout - Kanye<br>16. The Carter III - Lil&#39; Wayne<br>17. The Eminem Show - Eminem<br>18. Doggystyle - Snoop Dogg<br>19. Paid in Full - Eric B. &amp; Rakim<br>20. Licensed to Ill - Beastie Boys
Review Kanye West Graduation
the thing i don&#39;t understand is.. why are we listening to this guy talk about music? isn&#39;t music subjective? there is no &quot;right&quot; or &quot;Wrong&quot; music? if people like it, they like it? there is nothing that makes one song better than another?
This album ended up becoming my gateway hip-hop record. On my first couple of listens, I was loving it for the instrumentals. And then the lyrics started making a glimmer of sense. And then the conversation at the end started making sense, and I learned its context. And now I&#39;m listening to this thing every other day. And I was proudly saying only a few months ago that I didn&#39;t dig hip-hop at all.
Hood politics is the best song on the album
All he does is dickride kendrick. like damn he really dislikes every other rapperüëé. Kendrick this, kendrick that, u should respect other rappers for what they do.
What a wonderful album review you did sir. You&#39;re well spoken and thoughtful and you couldn&#39;t have worded this any more beautifully.
This album sucked (imo)
dickRider
Wow
people everywhere, show your stupid friends this video so they can begin to understand. thank you.
You melon
speedin bullet 2 heaven is better
Anthony didn&#39;t like Complexion :/
This guy needs to be syndicated and given a bigger platform. 2nd vid and love his clarity.
8/10 Maad city was def better. Kendrick fan boys like Anthony Flamingo should make less biased reviews.
This shit better beat Taylor Swift&#39;s flat ass at the Grammys
I&#39;m just struggling to find like minded people who thought momma was like the best song on the album, obviously my own opinion. Gosh that song was just nostalgia and love and peace all together.
TPAB is easily the best hip-hop/rap I&#39;ve ever heard. Quite possibly in my top 10 favorite albums of all time
this shit was trash üöÆüöÆ it&#39;s actually a disgrace. everyone only likes this because it&#39;s kendrick. biggest letdown of 2015
What if his next album is even better? Would you give it an 11?
look up k rino. best ever. guaranteed
To Pimp A Catapillar= 2PAC
not future 1/10 boi
King kunta wasn&#39;t &quot;trendy&quot;?
This makes Kendrick sound so fricking smart. Like a classic writer you hear about in English class
Pure musicality
I know you might not care, but i just discovered your channel I&#39;ve watched only 4 reviews but the way you talk albums good a bad is just great. Honestly I love it. Articulated correctly, true honesty and passion. from a normal guy out here in london. I thank you and value your opinion on all music from here on out. Even if we disagree. Thanks again
I liked mad city.. but to be honest this album is just terrible.
WHY ISNT COMPLEXION ONE OF YOUR FAVORITES
these walls was like a sequal to sing about me
To Pimp a Butterfly is like therapy for me, I always feel optimistic after listening to it
He needs to release an instrumental version of this album; the production is just beautiful.
I&#39;m really trying to listen to this album,  but am finding it hard.  Everyone says it a great album but when just listening at work I don&#39;t like it,  but when I actually listened to what he was saying I liked that better then some of the songs. I don&#39;t know if that makes a lot of sense.
Topimpthony Butterflytano
I don&#39;t get how people say gkmc was better than tpab. On Good Kid Kendrick had to compromise between his artistry and what the label wants him to do. Swimming Pools was intended to be on the Radio as a single. A true artists would never do anything just because of it being lucrative. TPAB was 0% compromising. It&#39;s 100% Kendrick Lamars music. No Radio singles, no wannabe-mysterious-trendy sound. It&#39;s just 100% of Kendricks mind, that&#39;s why it&#39;s so rich in any aspect.<br><br>This Album is something i have been looking for all of my life. I can&#39;t name really any other Hip Hop Album that has 0% compromising. maybe Illmatic.
man, i agree with everything on this review, i remember when TPAB was release, only few people undestood the album at that time, i was one of them, i got this album onn my 4 5th listen. the album is great, one of the best hip hop album ever, no doubt. well Anthony said it all, just listen to his review.<br><br>one thing that most people miss, this album as a lot of influence from Kendrick trip to Africa, i know cause i listen and i know the things he did in south africa cause i was there and i watched his show, was dope.... he said he&#39;d be back, he loved, hope he really comes back.<br><br>peace
how long does it take Anthony to come up with these speeches, they seem done really fast but really thought out and he always uses the right words, that&#39;s why I do like Mr. Fantano&#39;s reviews
I usually listen to Metal and Punk. I usually despise most modern mainstream Hip-Hop that I come across. However, this album is ridiculously good and for some reason it just clicked with me. Does anyone have any other suggestions for albums like this or hip-hop artists like Kendrick? I really like the approach of incorporating funk, jazz and experimental music into what he does. His lyricism seems to also be incredibly well thought out and insightful. Any suggestions???
Okay Kendricks new album was beyond shit I&#39;m serious his flow was god awful good kid mad city was beautiful and wonderfully done but this album was shit couple songs on this was good but beyond the few it&#39;s god awful
Okay Kendricks new album was beyond shit I&#39;m serious his flow was god awful good kid mad city was beautiful and wonderfully done but this album was shit couple songs on this was good but beyond the few it&#39;s god awful
Trash 0/10
damn i agree so strongly with your nasal voice opinion
you gave this a 10/10, and summertime 06 a 6/10, fuck you Anthony
do a classic review of a bizarre ride II the pharcyde
This is an album that has to played start to finis, unlike M.A.A.D city where you can just play a song. I don&#39;t know, that&#39;s how I look at tpab.
I just love how the chronic is in the background ahahaha
this album was just too much. period.
Dang the album was like 7/10 king kunta was the best song but its over rated
check out Kendrick Lamar &quot;Black Friday &quot;
This album is so fucking amazing. After my first listen I&#39;m only beginning to understand kdots message and themes, but every song is so damn dense. I&#39;m excited to re listen to this album.
Hey, this many people died, feel something!

Section 80, 9/10<br>GKMC 10/10<br>TPAB 4/10
Honestly, in the beginning when this review dropped, I disagreed, but then I really listened to the album. I took in all the detail within the lyrics and beats, and it pays off amazingly.
My favorite band is Velvet Underground. I love Queen, Bowie (pretty obvious), Moby, Clash, Pink Floyd, etc... But I simply loved this entire album. I fell in love with the sounds, and the critics that Kendrick proposes, and there are so many emotions in it. Best album of the year.
Kendricks talent will stand the test of time üëè
KEndrick is overrated as my asshole
It&#39;s crazy how the one track everyone can relate to is never mentioned. Mortal Man. People will say they&#39;re loyal but will run away the moment you make a mistake and need help. People are quick to degrade the leaders or icons they follow when they publicly go through bad times. It&#39;s one of the truest songs Kendrick has put out.
Hmmmmm very interesting.
ANTHONY PHUCKTANO..THE INTERNETS BUSIEST ADJECTIVE USER
In hindsight, although I still think this record is great, it&#39;s not as great as I thought it was. :/
I&#39;ve been considering off and on with try to go back and explore the realm of conscious hip-hop/rap. I&#39;ll try and give this album a listen.
all about rasicism thats all? its so stupid thats all anyone talks about
Tu Pimp A Caterpillar.
Love this album,  I really do. But I still don&#39;t understand how this gets a 10 and My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy gets a 6.
honestly, for a long, long time, I absolutely hated this album. I couldn&#39;t picture why everyone loved it so much. But after listening to it many, many times, I can see why. this is great
I have auditory issues and so hearing lyrics to a song is rather difficult for me. I usually listen to music for beats rather than lyrics. However, I forced my self to learn the lyrics to everyone of these songs, then went on to try and listen to each song as I follow the lyrics on my screen. <br>And thus, this is now the first album I have ever understood the lyrics to, and it&#39;s one of the greatest things I have ever had the privilege of listening to. <br><br>That&#39;s all I wanted to say really. Good day. Oh, and well done on 1 million.
is this the only album he&#39;s ever given a 10?
U <br>is one of the best songs in that album.  what an amazing song
You didnt mention How Much A Dollar Cost? That song, in my opinion, is the best song on the album...
Lol Kendrick Stan
Comments: &quot;NO WAY, NO ONE CAN DISAGREE WITH MY ARTIST BECAUSE THERE ALBUM IS THE BEST THING MUSIC HAS TO OFFER AND THATS A FACT!!  ANYONE WHO DISAGREES WITH ME HAS NO TASTE AND IS THE DUMBEST PERSON EVER!!!&quot;
you should do a review for black star&#39;s album, mos def and talib kweli are black
Great review!
it&#39;s a good album but it&#39;s so fucking overrated I swear Man.
what flannel is he wearing
Being a Kendrick fan, on my first listen I wasn&#39;t too impressed.  After about 2 months I listened again and fell in love with it.  It&#39;s damn good on so many levels.  This is an album that will be talked about 30 years from now.
10/10üî•üî•
dude stop shooting up oregon
He&#39;s already alot more lyrical than 2Pac. When it&#39;s all set and done, he will go down as probably the greatest of all time. I don&#39;t know but I really really REALLY hope his next tops To Pimp A Butterfly, because according to music critics, this is the best Hip Hop album of all time. He is hands down the greatest of this generation. Now I&#39;m ready to be attacked by the &quot;dick rider&quot; comments. Get a grip you Youtube thugs lol
I had a friend who told me that he didn&#39;t like this album as much because there were too many skits. So I told him that just because he doesn&#39;t understand it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s lesser of an album. It certainly takes some digging, but it gets better the deeper you go into the message. Hell, I&#39;d say I&#39;m only like 50% understanding of everything that goes on in the album but every listen is better than the last.
How can u say this isn&#39;t the best album of 2015..or even the 21st century. Man when I first listened to this album I started crying becuz I was able to relate to so much.easily my fav album of this year and it&#39;s gonna be hard to top! This is a Tru genius at work
OMGGG YOU SHOULD TRY RADIO INTERVIEWING !!! YOU&#39;RE REVIEWS ARE AWESOME
people dick ride Kdot to much. This album was a disappointment
Nice take on &quot;swimming pools&quot; I got pretty sick of people judging Kendrick for making a &quot;drinking&quot; record.
Amazing album but unfortunately it doesn&#39;t have much replay value for me.
&quot;POME&quot;
If you really don&#39;t like this album it&#39;s just blatant you are not analyzing the lyrics and seeing the messages and story he put into the album that even some of the best rappers of this generation haven&#39;t gone so far with before.
think the message is great more then great i didnt enjoy every track yet you can hear that the message is great<br>my fav track:institutionlized<br>momma <br>hood politics <br>how much is a dollar cost<br>complexion
Coitus.
I think the album was a bit over rated tbh I just didn&#39;t feel it , not trying to disrespect anyone but I thought it was kinda whack but don&#39;t get me wrong there&#39;s one or two good songs but that&#39;s it /:
&quot;It&#39;s 4am... I&#39;m going to bed.&quot; Love it.
Thought I would never see a perfect score on this channel :| can&#39;t disagree though, thanks everybody!
This record sounded like a whole heap of discarded Roots studio sessions thrown together..albeit, with some strong and interesting vocal performances from Kendrick. I respected the ambition, but found it very tough listening. Certainly not the best rap album of the decade.
nah tupacs still alive
Section 80 8/10 (Great)<br>Good kid m.A.A.d City 9/10 (Awesome)<br>To Pimp A butterfly 9.5/10  (Excellent, Semi-perfect)
the entire poem aspect to tupac is brilliant. how he ties every lyric into it is genius. album of the year. if someone like Taylor swift wins the Grammy over him, I will go off.
Section 80: 8/10<br>GKMC: 9.8/10<br>TPAB: ‚àû/10
This is potentially the best review i have ever seen in my life. I agree with every point, and this being a 10/10? Couldn&#39;t agree more; best album i&#39;ve ever heard and i don&#39;t really give a shit about what anyone else thinks about it. I literally thought about my life after listening to this album, assessing and comparing my self-introspection with kendrick&#39;s bars and plea of positivity he brings with it. Masterpiece.
TO EVERYONE: ..What do you think Kendrick&#39;s next album will talk about because I have no idea what direction he will go in now
When shit hits the fan is you still a fan? BEST ALBUM I&#39;VE HEARD IN YEARS!
I just rly don&#39;t like his voice I wish I did bc he&#39;s a genius
tbh I liked Good kid Maad City better than TPAB too.
Alright I finally listened to TPAB. It was ok. Not great. Definitely not 10/10. Lingered too much in the smooth R&amp;B sounding production. &quot;The Blacker the Berry&quot; and &quot;i&quot; were easily the best songs off the album and I had heard them before I even heard the album.<br><br>Or, to put it in meme terminology -<br><br>TPTB&gt;TPAB<br>TPTB&gt;TPAB<br>TPTB&gt;TPAB<br>TPTB&gt;TPAB<br>TPTB&gt;TPAB<br>TPTB&gt;TPAB<br>TPTB&gt;TPAB
this album suckss
wesleys theory is one of the best intro songs ive ever heard... shit is mad sick
I just realized the reference at the end XD. &quot;It&#39;s 4am. I&#39;m going to bed&quot; x3
Haha you would give this awful album a 10/10.
If you don&#39;t like this album 1. You don&#39;t like good music OR 2. you&#39;re salty that kendrick is on top and your favorite rapper isn&#39;t
I actually think this album is better than GKMC.
Hey guys if you love Anthony&#39;s channel come check mine out! I do great reviews!
TPAB is a masterpiece
GOOD JOB WITH THE BARS ABOUT BEING BASIC ANTHONY
lol this man was the only person I wanted to hear from when the album came out.
AOTY.
ant/10
COMMENT CHAIN TIME!<br>I remember you was conflicted.
This is the best album review i&#39;ve ever seen so far and best album this year
am i the only one that doesn&#39;t think Kendrick Lamar is the best rapper. Like hes good but he is so over hyped.
Joey Badass is the best rapper listen to 1999
Utterly slept on in my experience. Favourite release personally of this year so far.
It was wrong of you to shoot up that school, Schoolthony Shootano. Unsubscribed!
this dude put the whole tracklist on fav tracks, love ya needle lol üòÇüòÇüòäüòä
If Taylor Swift wins Album Of The Year instead of Kendrick, i&#39;ll have to shoot somebody.
This was one of those albums I can kick back and enjoy which is why I love Kendrick Lamar. His last 2 Projects were hard hitting but at the same time a super fun and enjoyable listen for any fan of rap. This album in my opinion was incredible. It was groovy, funky, politically charged, soulful and hard hitting. Kendrick&#39;s music has evolved a lot since Good Kid M.A.A.D City in the sense that this entire album was made in his own image. I did not hear a single trendy, mediocre or generic instrumental. Combine those groovy, soulful beats plus his powerful lyrics and unique flow and voice and you have the credentials of a perfect album. Still to this day I can come home from school, kick back and just doze off listening to the tracks on this album. Same with all his other projects, as well as B4.DA.$$ by Joey Bada$$. These albums just have so many bangers that you will remember a few words and straight away browse your iTunes to try to find them hahaha.
Tetsuo and youth vs to pimp a butterfly<br>What u guys think
This album is not a 10/10. It just isn&#39;t. I&#39;ll give it a 7/10.
I wonder which album Fantano thinks is the best out of these: The Money Store, To Be Kind, or TPAB. Personally I choose TPAB
As much as I love GKMC,To Pimp a Butterfly is perfect and a step in the right direction
In my honest opinion, I agree with Anthony&#39;s review. While I believe J. Cole&#39;s 2014 Forest Hills Drive was also a great album, I found TPAB more consistent. I had trouble listening to the second half of 2014 FHD. TPAB maintains its message throughout the full album in a unique, artistic way. The poem seams each song together to construct a beautiful metaphor. Incorporating the Tupac interview was also a unique, bold move. TPAB is by no means a mainstream rap album and I believe Kendrick did not entirely intend on making a mainstream album. What Kendrick is doing is introducing new concepts into the modern sound. The way he addresses certain topics is in depth and detailed. The album is just SO dense, it is incredible. This of course, is my opinion.
please review the great pretenders by mini mansions
The original album name was To Pimp a Caterpillar (To PAC) ala Tupac ala The album is To Pac.
I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s a complete rap record maybe a blend my friend told me it wasn&#39;t a rap record that&#39;s when I realized it&#39;s a musical album not a rap record so after I got that I realized how extravagant this album was
I enjoy some songs on this album a lot but for me it&#39;s not a 10/10. I like some of the different/funky beats on some songs, but others I wish it was a bit of his older style. I like trap more than Flying Lotus-type stuff. I find fans of that are really pretentious and annoying. For me this album&#39;s an 8/10.
hehehe, &quot;bones to pick&quot;. gotcha.
i dont think you cant call it a story album.
and it&#39;s musically very experimental
911 dislikes? Umm coincidence?
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/0M5EaqyfRWNinTAuE95Dmr">https://open.spotify.com/artist/0M5EaqyfRWNinTAuE95Dmr</a> Capeless Heroes Stained Glass EP
Am I the only one who wasn&#39;t crazy about this album as a whole? Wesley&#39;s Theory, King Kunta, Alright, Momma, Hood Politics, The Blacker the Berry, and I were all really good tracks but the rest just really failed to stick out to me. I think it&#39;s a great album but as a whole isn&#39;t that great. I personally rate good kid maad city higher than to pimp a butterfly but that&#39;s it.
best album i&#39;ve ever listened to.
I love how kdot goes back to his African American heritage he throws some jazz brings up a lot of good points and give resolutions to them
Whole record&#39;s absolutely incredible. I mean good god, spend a week listening to this and you will be a richer human being. Favorite song at the moment is &quot;Hood Politics&quot;. I love how original it is yet how strong the pure hip-hop flavor is on the song. No trendy compromise, just innovation all around.
i saw this the first day it came out
Love the album but momma is my least favorite song on it.
best tracks for me:<br>1) These Walls<br>2) You ain&#39;t gonna lie
my favorite song is bad blood
When you hold your chin it&#39;s irritating me.
A review on the Growing Process would be nice??
Best tracks<br>1.momma<br>2.i<br>3.king kunta<br>4.mortal man<br>5.blacker the berry
You made a shrek joke. üòÇüôå
the blacker the berry was such an articulate song. it had such a deep meaning. I really like politics and stay updated with news. and while I&#39;m not black I could see what he was saying.
this album is extremely overrated and so is kendrick lamar
ADHD, man what!?  ... 1 million views on a 20 minute video. That&#39;s crazy!!! ... Excellent review. I am just discovering this channel. I do have an appreciation for your ability to breakdown and vividly describe such art. Do you have any artist/producer/writer interviews or discussions detailing their albums?
For all those people who were not impressed by this album listen to lyrics whilst reading the lines via Rap Genius you&#39;ll be surprise of how it really connects 
a lot of people are forgetting this is anthony&#39;s opinion, if you dont like the album thats fine go away
Been 6 months and his only upload with 1 million views, regardless of what people think of TPAB they interested in what score he gives this masterpiece üôèüèº
Best hip-hop album of the decade?<br>Shit, barring <i>Kid A</i>, this is probably the best album of the 21st century.
No, just no. To Pimp A Butterfly was an album that Kendrick made just to appeal to a larger audience. I like Kendrick but recently he&#39;s just not what he was. Compare this album to m.a.a.d city and you realize what garbage this.
Went to Best Buy, bought the CD a couple weeks after it dropped and for the past 6 months have been listening over and over and over and over........ This album is a hip hop masterpiece for sure.
Largely agree with this but I love that hook on Wanna Ride
This album INSPIRES!!!!!!
I feel like I sound like one of those old dudes when I say this but I&#39;m not trying to. Hip Hop is dying. but I am not saying it because of rappers. I&#39;m saying because of the audience. this album is perceived so badly by a lot of listeners simply because..... wait for it...... it&#39;s beats aren&#39;t as &quot;good&quot; -__- listen to the lyrics! the beats are not even half of rap in my opinion, rapping has always been an art to convey what you say in an appealing way. Key Words: what you say. the beats should go along with what you say, which this album does beautifully. Idk I&#39;m probably just rambling and whining and not getting my point across like I want lol whatever
I&#39;m happy I&#39;m alive for the kendrick era of music.
So tired of people dick riding TPAB. (Not Anthony) a lot of people only like it because it&#39;s so highly praised.
I can&#39;t even look at music the same after listening to this fucking masterpiece. Kendrick is another level, this man grew out of rap. Now he&#39;s going above and beyond, my favorite current artist no debate.
3) Wesley&#39;s Theory<br>2) The Blacker the Berry<br>1) King Kunta
With all due disrespect mr. Theneedledrop, you suck ass. You gave Kendrick lamar&#39;s album a 10 and J. Cole&#39;s album a 6. I might be in the minority but I know a lot of people that feels the same way as I do. TPAB sounded like shit outside of a couple songs, it was awful. 2014 Forest Hills Drive was way better.
Everything you said is on point. Awesome review.
I don&#39;t wanna hear any nostalgia bullshit, there&#39;s maybe 10 rap albums better than this
Is this album from Tennessee?
lol, &quot;This album doesn&#39;t have trendy beats.&quot; Yes the fuck it does. Nostalgic beats are in right now, such as funk. Listen to today&#39;s new songs on the radio, they&#39;re two types, techno and nostalgic beats. That&#39;s why King Junta has the most views from the album, because of its funk beat. You&#39;re just a Kendrick hypebeast. But won&#39;t listen to the newer hip hop feel and knock the albums. And I don&#39;t mean Trap or anything either with the hip hop feel.
The album&#39;e original name was gonna be called &quot;Tu Pimp A Caterpillar&quot; which all the first letters spell Tupac
I dont really like it. Been down since 09. I appreciate growth. I couldnt really get into Speakerboxx/love below, and I listened to and owned everything outkast since 93. But that was too left field sounding for me. And tpab is too. I like soul, smooth beats. Lyrics are cool, but I cant vibe and take in everything. Good but not great. Not better than gkmc to me.
Alright is so dope
wow i didnt realize that was tupac at the end. amazingly done
Wait was he making a joke or did he really not like You ain&#39;t gotta lie ?
Kendrick lamar is the reason why i listen to good music.
I watched this review more than 5 times.
of course I wanted something like this but speaking for everyone that&#39;s not the case
this was a masterpiece and the people who cant see that they need to listen to more music. kendrick really showed us the roots of hip hop and gave us an album we need,not that we want

How THE FUCK is this a ten and B4.DA.$$ an eight. SMH.
Saw his performance on The Late Night show With Stephen Colbert. Was amazing. So I preordered the album on Vinyl straight away.
...<br>So DSOFTM is overrated...and this gets a 10?<br>Your opinion man. <br>I guess.
Patiently waiting for a review for Jay Rock&#39;s 90059 from the internet&#39;s busiest music nerd.
This album is almost flawless. kendrick is a genius
l don&#39;t even like hip-hop but your making me want to check this out!! I see you know your music from your black metal reviews!!
Review the new Infected Mushroom album Converting Vegetarians II
90059!!!
nigga deadass included the entire album in his favorite track list
My personal list of the best rap-albums so far in 2015:<br>5. Future - DS2: Perfect club-album filled with trap-bangers. That&#39;s what Future does best.<br><br>4. Earl Sweetshirt - I Don&#39;t Like Shit i Don&#39;t Go Outside. It grew on me after my second listen.<br><br>3. Snoop Dogg - BUSH. This makes me remember the days of &quot;Gin &amp; Juice&quot;. Combined with the beats produced by Pharell it&#39;s really a funktastic record.<br><br>2. Kendrick Lamar - To Pimp A Butterfly: Srry, but it isn&#39;t my favorite so far this year(you mad bru?)<br><br>1. Lupe Fiasco - Tetsuo &amp; Youth: Srry but it grew more on me then K.Dot
This album is pure fire. Very, very interesting artistic direction Kendrick decided to go with this.
loved the review

you look like the bald version of Lester from gta v
Do you only review hip hop albums?
I don&#39;t mean to go against the grain but its just shit, the voice...the flow. It&#39;s just not for me. People forcing themselves to like this it seems
Moodie Black - Nausea
Love this album and agree on the fact that Kendrick uses G Funk melodies on this album as did all the west coast rappers in the 90s, but the great part is that he does it in a very modern way and not like Warren G, Snoop or others! The funny part is that Dr Dre&#39;s Compton is also an album that has the same sounds, you get that Dre is in this flow now but even if Dre&#39;s album is very good, for the moment TPAB is my favorite between the two!

Hip Hop Album of the year!  10/10
anthony!! review melanie martinez&#39;s album!!! 
onions have layers
Great review of an immense album
I loved this album but i&#39;d say it gets a strong 8 ti a light 9, GKMC deserves a 10
Please review Noise vs Beauty by BASSNECTAR.<br><br>I&#39;ll keep commenting on each and every video, I watch until I see a review of a BASSNECTAR album
I love kendrick. I love this album. Both kendrick and this album are extremely overrated. It is not that hard to come up with a concept (the very generic concept of being black, isolated, struggling to love one&#39;s self because of the way white media portrays us, colorism, classism, etc.) the production wasnt there on some songs, but even worse, he did stupid alien shit at the end of great songs like &quot;Momma&quot; it just ruins the vibe for me. I didnt like his outro on Complexion. Its like he felt he had to say something because Rhapsody stole his show. She fucking killed it! Anyway, its a good album with a good message but... Stop dick riding... like fuck! Its not The Color Purple, it&#39;s not The Autobiography of Malcolm X, it&#39;s a fucking black history open mic night.
love this.
I wad addicted to s80 and gkmc but tpab wasnt for me
Love this review.
seems as though Quanthony DickWango doesn&#39;t realize who Kendrick is talking about on the third verse of &quot;These Walls&quot;
The main divide between Kendrick fans and haters is his voice. That seems to be the dichotomy that this album has created as well. You have to be familiar with his work to understand the stylistic changes and messages in this album. Really, we should have all expected this album from K. Dot.
If people think Kendrick has an over bearing message on this they should go listen to Hopsin&#39;s new album now there&#39;s a guy who has zero subtlety
I totally agree with you, but for an album that requires your complete attention to enjoy fully, the album felt a little too long.<br>9.5/10
I came here with Cal&#39;s mentality, just waiting to hear that 10. And oh, how sweet the sound.
I feel like he could have gotten more into the track momma, that is the biggest stand out record for me, the delivery at the end makes kendrick lamar&#39;s musically talented mind so damn interesting
I feel like he could have gotten more into the track momma, that is the biggest stand out record for me, the delivery at the end makes kendrick lamar&#39;s musically talented mind so damn interesting
After sitting with he album for 5 months now I have to say that the ending takes a little bit away from the album. The focus on 2pac and the title which is also related to 2pac takes a little away from the message of the &quot;poem&quot; and the album as a whole.
Swimming pools is really fucking garbage but Kendrick Lamar is pretty dope
Never agreed so much with a review in my life
A fucking review got a million views? lmao. well played, props
i still think my beautiful dark twisted fantasy is better than this album
TPAB is one of the best rap albums ever
I really like the focus on song structure and musicality on this album. Any other rap albums like this?
I&#39;m equal parts surprised and disappointed that your hard-on for Kendrick Lamar has not translated into any Jay Rock track reviews. tisk tisk.
This record is very near a ten for me and would be, but Rapsody&#39;s feature on Complexion just kind of derails the point Kendrick is trying to make. ¬†What Anthony said about &quot;bumper sticker&quot; philosophy is exemplified in her verse and is relative to a post one would see on some self-divine tumblr. ¬†Kendrick is making a very intelligent and self aware case for the black community in his music on this record, but then Rapsody just fucks it up.
this guy is so cute
This is the album that would&#39;ve put a smile on on Malcolm and made Martin Luther tell god Kendrick is the future for heavens talent
Good job on 1,000,000 Anthony!
Most overrated hip hop album of all time.

These walls means so much more than just what this guy said
Can you review other albums from the past that you would consider a 10. As well as old Eminem.
Milliony Viewstano
Is this your first 10?
See this is how you make a political rap album that has a message hopsin could learn a thing from this
Don&#39;t know why but i can&#39;t get into hip hop.¬† I feel like it&#39;s not meant for white people, so i therefore feel a bit alienated by it.
This album sucked imo. Sorry I just can&#39;t relate too it..Incoming hipster comments !! haha look up beatjunkie82 that&#39;s real hip-hop

1,000 more views!!
LETS TAKE THIS TO A MILLION FAM!
At first I was like &quot;Pfffft can&#39;t be that good&quot; Just listened to the album today, after a bit of listening. 10 outta fucking 10. Spectacular on all fronts.
The only gripe I have with this album, is that the lyrics didn&#39;t come with the CD. However that just encouraged me to listen closely to what Kendrick has to say.
997590
whether or not you agree with Kendrick&#39;s views you have to give him props for what he stands for and how he portrays and delivers them. To risk sounding clich√©d I think he&#39;s a prophet.young republicans and liberators of the new world alike should listen to this. He&#39;s one of the few down to earth rappers who broke through the mainstream and are actually using their fame and influence in a constructive way and not rapping about how many bitches he&#39;s fucked in the last 12 hours period or how many houses he owns. I like those rappers too because they&#39;re fun, but if it came down to choosing who I&#39;d rather sit down with over a cup of coffee to discuss social issues with I&#39;d choose Kendrick. I feel like whether you love him or hate him, he has cemented himself into pop culture, and with that people are aware of the messages and opinions he&#39;s trying to get across to the millions of people who listen to him or are simply aware of him.
2010-2020 To Pimp A Butterfly<br>2000-2010: The Marshall Mathers LP<br>1990-2000: Illmatic<br><br>Best of each decade just my opinion
I&#39;m on the verge of giving TPAB an A+, but he gave this a 10 while My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was given a 6 by him, and that&#39;s the greatest hip hop album of all time, only rivaled by Illmatic.
To pimp a butterfly was easily one of the worst albums of the year

Holy shit, after 6 years on Youtube Fantano&#39;s finally going to have a video hit 1 million. Well done dude!
Almost 1 Mil Fandango
After watching a YG interview i needed to here this guy speak to make me smart again
How could you forget the influence of Robert Glasper on this project.¬†<br>His hand is shown widely through most of the album.
Why does Kendrick use those weird voices in his music ?
meh doom tree is better
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=513">8:33</a> so like &quot;Murder To Excellence - Kanye West &amp; Jay-z&quot;
will it hit a million tho!??????? 
this will be your first 1 million view video. congrats antony :^)
almost 1 mil
Yo +theneedledrop this is your best review and your mot popular video. Almost a million views good job!
People seem to overhype this album <br>just because of the message it has behind it. Although I have to admit, <br>the message was powerful but other than that, this album wasn&#39;t as &quot;earcatching&quot; as GKMC. GKMC had a interesting story/message behind it, AND it caught my ears very easily. <br><br>Overall, IMO <br>GKMC &gt; TPAB<br><br><br>Explanation:<br>An album needs to have a strong message/lyrics(any topic tbh,as long as it&#39;s executed well) AND display great music as well. TPAB has one of those but lacking on the music part, in which GKMC has both.<br><br><br>However, Kendrick has evolved from GKMC and he has reached a very high standard of artistic messages displayed in this album. But musically(excluding the message), this was a stepdown IMO.<br><br><br>
Most pretentious album I&#39;ve ever heard with boring instrumentals, and kendrick&#39;s disgusting voice being overly processed on some tracks is just the uppercut to make it a 2/10.
I like Kendrick but not like how everyone says he is the best rapper in the game cause some of the stuff he says on some songs on section 80, Gkmc, and tpab come of very forced and I feel like he is trying too hard to sound like a scholar or something. (Sorry for bad English it is not my first language)<br>
I don&#39;t always agree that often with this guys reviews but he nailed this one on the head, this album is interesting and attention grabbing from beginning to end. 
I watch this review over and over for cal.<br>He makes me happy
Damn, I wish I could write my essays with his ability to talk and point out analogs.
Wow so this gets a 10 but To Pimp A Butterfly gets a 10? You suck Fantano!
Best album of 2015
i dont listen to kendrick does he still hate white people though
Great review. I like your outlook on the album.<br><br>I didn&#39;t care for this album &amp; was disappointed with it. The production was decent at best. I loved the message but the execution wasn&#39;t good in my eyes.<br><br>The highlights were How Much a Dollar Cost, King Kunta, Alright, u, For Sale, Mortal Man (the interview), &amp; i (the acapella part). The rest of the album was pretty forgettable. <br><br>I feel like Kendrick music has been getting less engaging since Section.80 which is my favorite work by him. That album is one of my favorites behind Before The Internet, Take Care, Under Pressure, Control System, 2014 Forest Hills Drive.
i don&#39;t understand people who pay strict attention to the message of some lyrics off their first listen. personally, it takes me a while, i feel the music and feel the beat then i dive in later
I have never seen this man give a perfect 10 to anyone......whoa
i think this a pretty good album as far as hip hop goes. the problem with hip hop music is that the music is almost always secondary. its background and rhythm establishment that one can rap over. but yeah this doesn&#39;t touch paid in full and it takes a nation of millions (greatest hip hop albums). idk where this clown gets off calling this shit a 10/10 perfect album
Fantastic review!!!!!
didnt like kendricks first 2 albums didn like this one
Me and my sister jam out to this album like all the time
I love you man the other dude pissed me off I like you a lot for this
Honestly TPAB is a subpar conscious rap album at best. It&#39;s only being praised because it came from a mainstream rapper that people already think whatever he puts out is the best album ever b4 it&#39;s even released.
waitin for this shit to hit one mil
How much a dollar costs?<br>                 ‚òùüèª‚òùüèº‚òùüèΩ‚òùüèæ‚òùüèø<br>             Knowledge <br>
Wesley&#39;s Theory is a masterpiece.
The beat switch of the track &#39;u&#39; is one of my favorite moments in hip-hop history, utterly fantastic
Is it just me or does Anthony look like a white Jarren Benton
You mentioned neo-soul, what is that. Do you mean soul music, SOUL, it&#39;s really music you can&#39;t really relate to or understand, so the wizard labeled it as such. Eye are opening, you can&#39;t hide truth for ever. Black is the vibration of this fragment called planet earth, bounce bounce
Fuck the haters. Everybody wants to cut the legs off him.
Lil B inspired this record! May the Based God bless us all!
LOVED Wesleys theory but unfortunately not enough trap 1/10
so close to a million views....yet so far.....
What&#39;s funny is that, at first, I couldn&#39;t stand this album; it wasn&#39;t the message, because the message is essential. It&#39;s just the sonic quality and beat selection. In other words, just because a rapper is speaking about &quot;true&quot; and &quot;conscious&quot; tidbits of life, if the sound is not appealing, the music is not as well (I think Fantano addressed that at the end of this video).<br><br>I will say though: I recently ran across Blacker the Berry (only track I had saved from the album to my music) while skipping through tracks on Spotify and I was for some reason dazzled. I was dazzled when I first heard it, but it got a bit old and annoying after a while. But I heard it again, and for the past two weeks, I&#39;ve probably listened to it like 200 times. It&#39;s soooooo good! It made me go back and try the album again. I tried hard as fuck to enjoy it, but I just couldn&#39;t. :/ but I did end up saving a few more tracks like Alright, You Ain&#39;t Gotta Lie and King Kunta. But still... It went from a 4 to a 6 though. Maybe it&#39;ll grow even more though. We&#39;ll see.
WOAH JUST PASSED FLEET FOXES THIS VIDEO DID
He said decade not century... come on guys smarten up
Great review anthony. This was easily Kendrick&#39;s best album no way is GKMC better
The trap influence bit warmed my heart
I am feeling a light to decent 12 lol. But seriously it is a great album
Was I the only one who lost my shit when Kendrick said &quot;THIIISS DICK AIN&#39;T FREEEeeeeEE&quot;üòÇüòÇ
M and kendrick the g.o.a.t
yeah i thought the hype would die off in a minute but it didnt its still my favourite album of the year probably my favourite hip hop record of all time its honestly so rare to come across an album like this its brilliant im still listening to it its beautiful and mortal man kills me every time
Best album of the last 15 YEARS for me. Bold statement? Don&#39;t think so, in my opinion.
tpab &amp; section 80 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; gkmc
That alright instrumental is a beautiful thing, the whole album is a joy to listen to.. 
I love King Kunta so much, it has that kind of 90&#39;s hip hop feel to it but still very much it&#39;s own thing
Im tripping on acid and watching this
This album has grown on me and now I can see the genius behind it.
TPAB is Kendrick&#39;s best work yet. Wesley&#39;s Theory is by far the most underrated track on the album.
Although this is a pretty nice album, it&#39;s not a fuckin 10... pretty much nothing is a 10!!! Dig into hiphop a little. I still think you&#39;re stuck in the mainstream/newskool scene too much.<br>Peace.
Joyner Lucas- Along Came Joyner mixtape is simply..freaking..amazing! His first song Ross Capicchioni blew my min and the mixtape is really groundbreaking in the world of hip hop
But I can&#39;t believe you didn&#39;t talk about &quot;alright,&quot; that&#39;s one of the best moments of the record!!!!!!!!
It took me six months, but I finally TOTALLY agree. What an exceptional, amazing record.<br>I literally bought it, returned it, and bought it again. I love it.<br>Reminds me of &quot;Thriller.&quot; 
On a different scale from F-A+, this one is definitely an A, leaning towards A+ in retrospect. ¬†But I still can&#39;t get over how he gave My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy a 6, which is definitely an A+ and has reached that modern classics status.
If you liked Kendrick&#39;s album, you should check out this 17 year olds mixtape it will CHANGE YOUR LIFE¬†<a href="http://www.datpiff.com/Jay-Juelz-Lost-In-Space-mixtape.708160.html">http://www.datpiff.com/Jay-Juelz-Lost-In-Space-mixtape.708160.html</a>
Isn&#39;t to pimp a butterfly also kind of a reference to to kill a mockingbird?
Alright,complexion(a Zulu love),these walls and momma are absolute masterpieces 
Social media gives everyone a way to say what they feel disagree with most this dude says but it makes sense what he saying objectivity folks 
It&#39;s just his opinion it&#39;s music and music is for people to start thinking and talking about 
One thing i can tell you is, since I bought the cd, i haven&#39;t stop listening it to it, its one of my favorite/classic albums  especially &quot;For Sale&quot; and &quot;Mortal Man&quot; OH and &quot;These walls&quot; god this album sooo good K.Dot did not disappoint me this time üëåüèΩüíØ
I think the album is ok. I just don&#39;t see what everybody else sees in it.
It was a good album but decade?!? Da fuck u smoking?
This is the hip hop version of Songs In The Key Of Life 
üî•üî•üî•üî•
This was an amazing album but gkmc was better 
For people who do not like this album, or Kendrick Lamar, i am interested to see what you think a good/great album is
Kendrick didn&#39;t write the poem thoüòÇüòÇüòÇ he said a friend of his did, but I like your accuracy and views. Got a new subscriberüëçüèæ
Uhhhh Ritzz uhhhhh Next to uhhhhh Nothing uhhhhhh Please uhhhh Review uhhhhh Thanks
music nerd hsdhsdsdsdsudshhds sdf
This album fucking sucked wtf
This is classic. I could watch this alot<br>Fye ass album
I don&#39;t understand how other teens don&#39;t like this album it has a positive message I love this album.
Good kid maad city is a 10 , can&#39;t believe you gave it a 9 fantano bleugh and TPAB for me is like 8 for me, I feel as you just gave it a 10 to compensate for not giving GKMC a 10
You&#39;re so biased it&#39;s funny
lol I also got that feeling with king kunta
you aint gotta lie most underrated track on this LP
At first I didn&#39;t really like it, but since everyone was going crazy about it. I listened to it a couple more times, and now love this album. <br><br>The only problem I have with album is that it&#39;s not really relatable emotionally. I can empathize with Kendricks portrayal of certain problems and understand them and feel them, but to a lesser degree than other albums like MBTDF. Maybe it&#39;s just a rationale for why I like MBTDF more.<br><br>Either way both were fire, Fantano simply doesn&#39;t like Kanye&#39;s style and obviously loves Kendrick&#39;s.
I&#39;m so glad he was brave and traveled away from GKMC. As great an album as that was, this one has a soulful charm and artistry that I&#39;m more than pleased the old &quot;fans&quot; Don&#39;t understand. Stay with your swimming poolsÔªø
Was this the first ten if not what others got it?
Review Ego death
Wonder what is next in his discography. When an album is as inventive and different as this one, to evolve from it is almost paradoxical for the artist... unless Kendrick is truly embracing the prodigy perspective, and not buying into the stay safe sell records motto.
Kendrick Is Hip Hop .
I can&#39;t wait for the vinyl release!
There is so much fat in this album, the most I&#39;ve ever seen, it is obese seriously in most songs it takes about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=90">1:30</a> mins to get in to the actual verses, which are the most important aspects of the songs.<br>In some cases like King kunta there is only about 20 lines most of which are terrible.<br>I nor love nor hate the style, I feel this album is really clever, but the flow and lyrics were off and therefore most of the meaning came from the poem and intros, rather than the verses.
You ain&#39;t gotta lie is one of the best songs on this album! Keep listening it&#39;s crazy. I don&#39;t have a least favorite song on this honestly.
I find it so amazing how this guy always praises kendrick like just look at how long the intro is we came here for and album review not his life story.
O V E R R A T E D<br>V E R R A T E D<br>E R R A T E D<br>R R A T E D<br>R A T E D                   as fuck.<br>A T E D      not even his best album lmao<br>T E D<br>E D<br>D
coming for the 1 million mark.
Why all the dislikes?
I gotta admit, I was not a big fan of this at first - maybe I was a bit biased after GKMC (not a huge fan, I really liked Section 80 though).<br><br>Somehow, listening to this during a heatwave/cooking some Mexican food it really grew on me a lot. And while there&#39;s still some tracks where I&#39;m not the biggest fan of how Kendrick alters his vocals I still think this is a much more consistent record than GKMC.
When i first heard this album i fucking hated it. It sounded like old funk shit but done way to sloppily. I gave this album a 1.5/10 because i liked blacker the berry and wesleys theory only. I got my brother to give me his copy of it and i loved it cause i kept hearing songs and like em mor and more. Kendrick really spoke to me personally that in everything thats been going on with black people and in my own life as a black person that being angry is fine but being hateful isnt with blacker the berry, i have problems with the song(BTB) but the message is where it really lies but i wont speak on how i personally feel. The song is amazing, i hated &quot;I&quot; the worst when i first heard it but i loved what he said about NEGUS which is what ive been saying for a long time i was happy as hell to hear him enlighten people about that (too bad he didnt mention ngr from egypt) but its an amazing album. But i will say &quot;U&quot; is the best song. At that moment you hear the hate that people feel towards you while youre doing youre best and someone dies. But it also sounded like he feels that guilt and animosity towards himself and he&#39;s really coming at himself about not being there for someone he should have been there for before he died. I could go on and on for this track. I gave this 8.5/10 myself, but the more i think about it and hear it i want to give it a 10. And really i do i just need to find that time myself. Amazing how you can hate an album so much and then love it so much once you take the time to enjoy it and hear it. Easily one of the best albums ever. 
omg this video ended at exactly 4am
Vid way to long <br>
If you ain&#39;t Kendrick Lamar your album is a 6 according to this dude. Kendrick new album aint no 10 gtfo. 
The best album of all time... legendary!!!!!!
How do people like &quot;For Free?&quot; that song is easily the worst on the album for me. It&#39;s childish and ratchet, there&#39;s no flow and the music is just discordant jazz in the background. Can anyone that likes this song explain to me why?
Great album, can you do a video on the best hip hop group/duo of all time please?
Wtf I thought it sucked 
He gave a 10......<b>slow clap</b>.............it happened......i think some fans are so satisfied now theyll stop listening lol
Kendrick thinks it through the most for sure, I still think ab-soul has Better lyrics, ScHoolboy Q has the best flow and ideas of the groups while Jay Rock probably has the best all around artistic/hip-hop connection
Idk about flying colors.. Having the best structure doesn&#39;t make u the best rapper, I think black hippy is all pretty equal, Kendrick is the most well rounded but that doesn&#39;t make him the best.. I feel like he should shout TDE out more.. Like he says he loves Danny Brown and Chance the Rapper so why doesn&#39;t he shout THEM out on control? If he&#39;s trying to be the 2pac/heart why does he let his audience have a closed mind when obviously his goal seeeeems to be opening minds.. Anybody?
do mac demarco
This fucker just taking anything Pitchfork rates and giving it the same rating  
Album is dope!! But it&#39;s forgettable nit in bad way is what it is!!
TPAB isnt even an album, its a movie or a book the more you read or watch(listen), the more you understand and start loving it
Only good track here was maad city though the lyrics sucks
To Pimp A Butterfly is the Hip Hop version of Songs In The Key Of Life....<br><br>YES.... I SAID IT!!!
only relevant hip hop review from fantano.
obama say what it do
As an whole this album is a work of art. Although I must say that for me there are only a few tracks that I would listen separately. This LP is something that has to be taken as a single piece. That is my opinion. 
I&#39;d like to hear your take on Conquering Dystopia&#39;s self-titled.
10/10 love it. Instant classic, the entire album is a masterpiece. I didn&#39;t think Kendrick could top GKMC but he did. He rose the bar with &quot;To Pimp A Butterfly.&quot;
Rapsody doesn&#39;t like to be referred as a femcee..
Remember Kendrick once said &quot;I&#39;ll make an album that&#39;ll put a smile on Malcom&quot;... this is that album.. Kendrick kept his word.
The album was terrible besides a few songs. Super overrated.
Man! he really reminds me of Lester Crest
Love the album but how can you call it perfect if you have a least favorite track. (Just wondering).
10/10 album, 10/10 review
With this album as well as many great albums, it sounds like you are listening to one very long song. Kendrick is extremely clever at getting the listener placed into his world and way of thinking - a very intricate thing to do which requires much imagination and an amazing creative process. He allows you to enjoy the experience and at the same time, learn a thing or two about life, education, self worth and how important it is.
But what about the hooks, Anthony?

overrated as fuck
I think this record transcends genrs, doesn&#39;t matter if youre into hip hop, metal,pop, EDM, rock whatever you gotta listen to this is just amazing 10/10 
Kendrick Lamar EP: introduction <br>Overly Dedicated: prologue <br>Section 80: socially aware novel<br>Good Kid MAAD City: autobiography film<br>TPAB: a fucking Broadway Musical Masterpiece. <br><br>Kendrick definitely displayed how talented he is on this album, he is without a doubt on the forefront of rap right now. AOTY
This album sucks. What happened when you could have a message and spit hard and the music still sound good. The cool by lupe is a perfect example. This album is at sometimes unlistenable with that trying to be 70s funky shit. Surf by chance sounds more soulful. 
So, Anthony...What happens when Kendrick&#39;s next album is even better than this one? ¬†Do you give it an 11??? ¬†:)
Im so tired of people like that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=687">11:27</a>
This dude missed the whole point that he was talking about all the problems and issues that happened/are happening when Kendrikc &quot;got out of the hood and went in the star light&quot;
This Album BLOWSSS dont try to make it sound good cuz it doesnt
You should play the album in the background during your reviews. It helps. That&#39;s what I do when I watch you
How much a dollar cost and Mortal Man<br><br>TWO MASTERPIECES
It was funny. I saw Kendrick Lamar live at the Pot of Gold Festival 2 days before he surprise early dropped the album. I&#39;d went with some cool friends. I had already pre-ordered the track, so when it came out I locked myself in my room and ate every track. Every verse. Every bar. It settled so heavily on me that I can truly say that it changed my life, or at least perspectives that I have on A LOT of things. When I finally came to from my Kendrick coma, I went to my friends and ask their opinions on the new project. The same kids that stood next to me and sang out &quot;pour up, DRANK&quot; and exclaimed how much they loved Kendrick were the same kids that shunned the album completely. Called it garbage. Mainstream music with shallow insides jelly filled with ass giggling beats doused in shiny words and the ideology of pussy and money are the reason music with a message falls on deaf ears. It makes me sad
&quot;You&#39;re being basic&quot; hahaha
Art is, and should be very personal<br>&quot;Trendy&quot; usually allows you to lose some of the personality and closeness that you have to your art and that is what happened in some of Kendrick Lamar earlier stuff. You get kinda confused at who he is and what he wants to be but this album... this album is just fucking amazing. It is so meticulously written, produced, recorded while still being beautifully raw but most importantly he put himself on the track. He gained the confidence to express himself so vividly and succeeded with his risk. ¬†This kind of risky, personal music has been lost over the last couple decades and is a blissful sight to see it comeback in the form of To Pimp a Butterfly.<br>Great Review Man!!
love your videos man , you really make shit clear and interesting
So I saw your description box and where does Complexion (A Zulu Love) fall into. Pretty sure it&#39;s in favorite tracks, right. 
Kendrick is wack just like Eminem. I disagree with this, should&#39;ve gave it a 3/10
I feel like there are people who actually listened to this album and recognized that it was good, and then there are more people that just hear every other one else say he&#39;s a god, so they agree without even listening and comprehending the album. they don&#39;t even form an opinion. too many sheep in this world. 
The main reason most people don&#39;t like this because it&#39;s something different. If this isn&#39;t hip hop, than hip-hop is failing without it. Instant classic.  You guys just look for radio hits and bangerz to play at parties. If that&#39;s the purpose of hip hop than we&#39;re screwed. 
That album was trash!
This album was too boring for me to bump. I prefer good kid mad city way better.
Review some Me&#39;Shell Ndegeocello - Plantation lullabies
You know absolutely nothing about rap. Man rated drakes mixtape over GKMC haha
WAIT HE GAVE IT A 10/10.¬†<br>YOOO
This is i thing my first experience in Hip hop, maybe flying lotus (not really hip hop), but im all in on that For Free track. Its genius
i still dont get why people think this is good
&quot;this record has a few bones to pic&quot;<br><br>Intentional?
why do i get the feeling that at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=93">1:33</a> that has some sort of meaning??? Its drawing me in and I feel like I know whats going on but I could be totally making shit up haha
Anthony you dont get it. 
Real review: If you are a gemini GET THIS ALBUM. If you are on acid GET THIS ALBUM. If you happen to be me, a gemini on acid when he gave the album a listen, this is going to be you&#39;re favorite album EVER.
I think the people making a fuss about how average they think this album is (which it CLEARLY isn&#39;t) are just doing it to make themselves feel like they&#39;re cool. <br><br>Having a different opinion about something that the overwhelming majority of people rightly recognise as one of the best hip-hop records of all time doesn&#39;t make you edgy or interesting. It just means you don&#39;t like it. Feeling the need to talk about how bad you think it is? That makes you a troll. <br><br>If you don&#39;t like it, don&#39;t listen to it, it&#39;s super easy to ignore things you don&#39;t like nowadays. Just let people enjoy this amazing record. 
great to see the channel stands as GREAT AS FUCK!!! Keep the good job, man!!!
Why did you laugh at that 2pac part. I expected better from you fantano.
The end was hilarious 
I think the album version &#39;i&#39; was inspired, by Jay Z - 22 Two&#39;s
I fucking hate hate hate the magnum advert goddamit. Fuck you gregory

fuck kendrick to bring 2pac here is wrong because 2pac he never talk shit to his ppl.
Do black Hollywood 
I keep going back to this album trying to understand why people love it so much??? Is it hype? Is it just the struggle he went through so people want to love it???? I just don&#39;t understand the love for this album. I feel like there is maybe 2 songs that are above average.... and the rest are just sub par at best.<br><br><br>Okay after listening again I want to change my opinion. There are only 2 or 3 songs I don&#39;t like... His messages are strong, but I wish he had left For Free? off the album... This record has such a serious tone, and I feel like the joke song took away from the rest of the album. That being said, I was also annoyed by the song where he says Booboo or w/e over and over.... that was pretty stupid. Other than that, it&#39;s an amazing album..... The beats are truly complex and unique so hats off.
GKMC is like a really hot girl. TPAB is like an average looking girl that grows on you every day, until you realize you love her and she&#39;s amazing in every way. 
For free made me cringe
cover a Tool album
Okay, yeah it is a great album and all, but it is SO. FUCKING. BORING.
I have a hard time going back and enjoying GKMC after spending the past couple months listening to this album.
He said lest favourite you ain&#39;t gotta lie lol what an idiot that&#39;s the best track on the album man this guy is dumb 
This review is less than 100,000 views away from being theneedledrop&#39;s biggest review ever!!!
will you review &quot;the sixth man&quot; by QUE
This is the first album I would give a 10 to in years, and I cannot explain the excitement I had when I saw you give it a 10, too. FUCK YEAH.
kendrick likes pac, we all like pac. But kendrick presents a skewed version of pac on this album. Pac was crazy, snoop said it himself. Yes he was revolutionary, (his mother was a black panther) yes he was socially conscious and composed because he learned to present himself this way to be politely antagonistic to those that wrote him off as an ignorant, uneducated black man. BUT Pac was also reckless, short-tempered, paranoid, violent, AND yes at times ignorant. Classic icarus story of a young man attempting to rise above his circumstances and flirt with spirituality and higher social consciousness but becoming too infatuated with the power of his own fame simultaneously and having grown up in a punch the biggest bully in the face on the first day environment, went too public with his loud-mouth braggadocio which everybody admired him for and hated him for. He was controversial not just because he pushed the status quo with the in-your-face this is what I am black man in the media like Kendrick and other young black men of this generation idolize him for, they forget how violent ignorant and brutal he could be towards other members of the community (beating up the hughes brothers) and towards women simultaneously eloquently parading the power and strength against unfathomable odds of women and mothers, and then fucking them and leaving them out to dry himself. He himself was a child of abuse, maybe not physical but of abandonment, drug addict mother in and out of jail. He fit the classic profile of emotional behavior disorder- a mental condition derived from stress as a child. As MC eiht put it &quot;a fucked up childhood is why the way I am.&quot; Pac was a colorful character, but Mortal man makes Kendrick lamar look a little naive. Kendrick is way more socially conscious collectively in his music, an din personality does not resemble pac in any way shape or form- and I mean that as a compliment. So he needs to quit all of these tired New-pac tropes. He talks about mandella and mlk on this album as well. Find some better role models man.

1. TPAB-beautiful funk and jazz<br>2. Section 80-one of the best hip hop based albums next to albums like graduation<br>3. GKMC-awesome story but is #3 bc there are some trendier beats.<br>4. Overly dedicated-little weaker version of section 80 but still awesome<br>Hard to rank them, they&#39;re all good
To Pimp A Butterfly: A Blank Letter By Kendrick Lamar <br><br>(The Full Album Title)
REVIEW &quot;AT.LONG.LAST.A$AP&quot; !!!!
 Long post, idgaf. I have to express how I feel about this album in relation to his first two albums.  <br>I liked the album but don&#39;t regard it as a classic or think that it&#39;s  as powerful as Section 80 or GKMC. I&#39;m interested in hearing the direction of his songs after this album. Section 80 and GKMC were both raw and touched on the same  topics. Those two albums were also more organic and adventurous in style. This album was more mature in sound and content. It almost feels as if this album was made too soon. Again that&#39;s just my opinion based off of the type of music he created before TPAB. If he takes his discography progression seriously, it&#39;s going to be nearly impossible for him to make music like GKMC after he dropped a more mature and artistic album like TPAB. That&#39;s why I&#39;ll always cherish Section 80 and GKMC as classics because I feel we won&#39;t be hearing content like that from Kendrick anymore. <br>Its similar to when Kanye came out with My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, he chose to go in a different direction as a musician. But Kanye did that after 3 solid albums and one sonically sad album. After MBDTF, he dropped two collaborative albums(Watch The Throne and Cruel Summer) that were more similar in sound to MBDTF than to his first 4 albums. He went from making content with melody  to making music with loud,  brash lyrics. <br>I&#39;m not saying there is a right or wrong way to change your style or progress as a musician, but as shown by Kanye&#39;s discography, artists can sometimes drift away from what made them so beloved.  A lot of that obviously has to do with life experiences so we can&#39;t blame the artist for reacting and expressing their emotions. <br>Kendrick&#39;s change of direction isn&#39;t as radical as Kanye&#39;s but it&#39;s still a change nonetheless. That&#39;s why I like to call albums like MBDTF and TPAB transitional albums. Every musician has one album where they change their style or potentially hit their stride as an artist. This was Kendrick&#39;s. I&#39;m fairly confident that after he stops making albums, we will look back to TPAB and regard the album as the beginning of the rest of his career, and the beginning of the type of music Kendrick will be known for. If that does indeed happen, it would leave Section 80 and GKMC as his old school, hungry rapper with something to prove music, and that&#39;s why in my opinion, his first two albums will be regarded as better than TPAB.  We&#39;ll be hearing more material like TPAB, but the style of his first two albums won&#39;t be heard again. 
I loved how much a dollar cost great message and beat
..All of To Pimp a Butterfly is a Dream.. 
As time went by in my opinion TPAB is better than GKMC
I have <b>never</b> seen you this excited, honey. Gets me all flustered...<b>gosh</b>.
This album will go down in history as one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time.
Subscribe to stay fresh and I will sub back to Anyone who does . I just need some to get my channel off the ground . I post underground hip hop , no mainstream . Playlists and chill tracks . Thanks
The reason it won&#39;t dawn on you immediately is because you may be in a different mood that the soulful mellower mood of the album won&#39;t resonate with. You need to be in the right mood to appreciate this type of musical work.¬†We are so inundated with the mainstream pop sound that you have to get yourself in a position out of that frame of mind to appreciate this work.<br><br>For like the first day all I could listen to were the single type tracks like Alright, Blacker the Berry, Hood Politics and King Kunta but I picked it up another day and tracks like Momma, You Ain&#39;t Gotta Lie, U, How Much a Dollar, Mortal Man etc. all started to dwell on me. ¬†I was expecting another Good Kid Maad City hype type of music having listened to Drake and Cole&#39;s new records and expecting some more mainstream beats to nod your head to from Kendrick.<br><br>Now the only tracks I still hate is For Sale and generally some portions of initially perfectly good tracks where the instrumental may switch up in an eclectic way. If there is any criticism I think he overdoes the creativity on certain tracks where he has too many ad libs, sound effects or extra background instruments which just get in the way of the main sonically pleasing piece of music and threaten to turn the track into plain noise.
Kendrick is bringing back that Native Tongues movement but in a modern sound.
this album sucked imo.
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1166">19:26</a> did he mean to say<br>&quot;If the music under your message is garbage, the message is garbage&quot;<br>Or did he mean it the way he said it?
I feel bad for Kendrick, he is obviously very passionate about sending a message to the youth but this album is just so dense in content, and it ends up falling on deaf ears for the most part. In order to absorb everything he is trying to say, you have to put in effort when listening. I believe that this album is truly a work of art. Every word, sample, and concept has been carefully selected, and it is pretty clear that Kendrick put so much time and effort into this. I had so much fun listening to the songs over and over again trying to take as much as I could from this. But most kids will not do that, so the message is often lost on those who need it most. 
Great review dude. This album floored me. The caterpillar poem at the end made the hair on my arms stand up lol.
got mad love to k-dot and all hes albums but shit i was disappoint he could do much better be wating for this for years and this record dont convince in my opinion ghost face killah and bbng album .. way better
Review Lil Boosie new album
your command of what you do is frighteningly acumen. ¬†I feel about as strongly as I can about a stranger...about you. DO NOT EVER STOP. or i will find you. ¬†thank you.
That beginning bass line in Hood Politics though?!!! Am i right or what?
People hate the album, is because the dumb are usually intruiged by the drum.
After second listen through the album, I have to agree that this a masterpiece.
I don&#39;t like Kendrick. I&#39;ve tried, I really have. Can&#39;t do it, im going to stop trying.
If this isn&#39;t at least nominated for Album of the year not just for rap I will punch someone.. 
This is my favorite rap album ever. Period. Even better than Illmatic or Nation of Millions. I know it&#39;s crazy to say, but for me no other album has been both so incredibly insightful in lyrics and so dense and varied in music. 11/10 XD
Love Kendrick, didn&#39;t like this album 
Hey man really appreciate your reviews.. awesome variety and good music.. can you do a review on oddisee&#39;s new project -the good fight.. he&#39;s had a few good tracks like own appeal prior, with abstract ways of thinking and was excited about an artist that doesn&#39;t water down or dumb down for a people and i like his delivery and flow .. lmk man thanks @theneedledrop  
Aquemini
200k till 1mil, lets go fam
Excellent album with an excellent review. Good job :-)
The world will catch on years from now Kendrick Lamar is pure genius 
Dam this guy knows his shit good review !!!
Didn&#39;t enjoy this album at all, Nice review as always though.<br>Personally a 2/10 imo
yes. you can finally retire Bigthany Fambrother..
Anthony I don&#39;t think the album version of &quot;i&quot; was an actual live performance. Probably mixed and mastered to sound like it for the purpose of him delivering that &#39;mid - performance&#39; lecture to the niggas who were having a little dispute. Painting the bigger picture with one stroke. 
PAOW! PAOW! Mats Nilesk√§r!
CAL 
Doc Shemp if you think this album is whack i feel sorry for you man (prime example of institutionalized)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1187">19:47</a> I thought he&#39;d say This dick ain&#39;t free
This is gonna be the first TND video to hit 1mil I bet
Anthony, check out an LP called Silk Rhodes - its done by stones throw, pretty good album
Acting like he completely understood section .80 enough to act like he understood tpab
Anthony! What do you think about Kali Uchis? Let me know. :3
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1224">20:24</a>¬†<br>What a concept; you should actually pay attention to the music you&#39;re listening to in order to enjoy it fully.
Love the review, I will definitely be subscribing.
My honest opinion. People are too use to the way music has been over the past 15 years... i will say kendrick is very much so favored out of everyone else in mainstream, but there is a reason for that.. kendrick came out with GKMC which made people trust and believe in his music, which is something that most rappers did not do. Kendrick revolutionized hip hop. There are only a few rappers that have done so. 2pac, biggie, 50cent, lil wayne, and kendrick. And out of all 5 of them, 2pac and kendrick are the ones that are mostly like activist or preachers to the world. And both strongly belived in god and both are favored highly because of the positive movement. So when kendrick put this album out, im not going to lie i wasnt feeling it at first, but when i kept listening to it i appreciated it, and i trust it. I know if i listen to this album nonstop it wont influence me to be popping mollies or doing drugs like other rappers would. Kendricks album is much so like a college course or a pamphlet of how to live right. And it takes time to study, it takes time to appreciate.. dont knock it because its the first of its kind. This album touches my soul man, ever song the notes the backround music the vocals strikes a spiritual positive nerve in me that ive never got since GKMC.. 
I think that For Sale is one of the most important songs on the album. You kind of skimmed over it but I think it&#39;s important to point out that the song is an interaction between Kendrick and Lucy (Lucifer) who is trying to capture kendrick with her sexuality, talent, and words. Ending the song by directly asking him to sign a contract with her for his soul.
In the &quot;live&quot;, ¬†&quot;i&quot; a fight breaks out in the crowed. He explains to them, that it &quot;wont happen on his time&quot;. Then he explains to them that American culture turns black people against their own people, and that they should be able to come out to a concert without fighting. That&#39;s what I got.
section.80: 8/10<br>Good kid maad city: 9/10<br>To pimp a butterfly: 10/10<br>ANYONE ELSE SEE THE PATTERN?
Kendrick Lamar is bad. Rap is bad. Bad bad bad. His &quot;best song&quot; king kunta is the same beat and lyrics over and over and over and over again. Dumbest most ignorant thing I&#39;ve ever heard. Same as everything else.
True Hip-Hop not that fake shit rappers nowadays come up with. K.Dot , truly one of a kind.
This is the best hip hop album I&#39;ve ever heard since....ummm.....good kid M.A.A.D city LOL
What record were you saying was the best rap record of this year? The Blacker The Berry??
FALSE ADVERTISEMENT GUYS I LISTENED TO THIS ALBUM A MILLION TIMES AND HE NEVER TAUGHT US HOW TO PIMP A BUTTERFLY!!!! üò°üò°üò°üò° Nah I&#39;m just joking though he&#39;s my favorite rapper probably in the top 50 albums of all time IN MY BOOK
The only I disagree with you about this critique of the album is that you said that it&#39;s not a story book album. For me anyways I have to listen to the album front to back and treat it like a book in order for me to understand the totality of the project.
I still listen to this album, not in full, almost everyday. Coming home from college and seeing how my friends interact with it, it seems yo only listen to 3 songs. Alright, King Kunta, and The Blacker The Berry. It&#39;s a shame really, this obsession with bangers has become extremely frustrating.
your like the eric the car guy of music, more specifically etcg1

Every single piece of music today has been influenced by blues, jazz, rock, and funk. But this album combines all of them beautifully.

Cherry Bomb was horrible, Don&#39;t you dare compare Cherry Bomb with TPAB.
You&#39;re funny.
kendrick lamar, to pimp a butterfinger
meh.. nice review buuut.. kendrick is about as deep as a thimble.. and the juxtaposition between him and pac is forced on the track mortal men.. Evidence of his shallowness:¬† U said it urself: &quot;Is it genius or garbage?&quot; its scatterbrained bullshit.. the issues he traverses thru he never addresses, just questions most of the time like a man who hasnt made up his mind or hasnt educated himself on it so he talks around it with a bunch of nice sounding things that dont add up; stringing shallow and unrelated metaphors together like a more well spoken weezy
Honestly I don&#39;t even think Kendrick is that good, couldn&#39;t even listen to the whole album through, to me he&#39;s kind of boring.
Review SPM Never Change album 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=825">13:45</a> you&#39;re welcome!
theneedledrop whats your favorite track on this album?<br>My personal fav has to be Wesley&#39;s Theory 
Already one of the best albums of all time man. What a masterpiece.
Overrated. 7/10
This dude is a perfect example of kendrick fans. I imagine all of you look and talk like this. Who would take some hipster white dudes opinion on rap music serious. Its like taking peter rosenbergs opinion serious you just cant do it and expect people to take you serious. 
The original name for the album was suppose to be &#39;&#39;Tu Pimp A Caterpillar&#39;&#39; which abbreviates to Tu.P.A.C.
I just recently got my hands on this and like any album there certain tracks that naturally appeal to you more than others and I like the album as a whole it&#39;s creative and well done but I don&#39;t know if I &quot;love&quot; it yet. I had to listen Acid Rap and Good Kid Maad city repeatedly until I fully understood and appreciated each track before I declared I loved those albums.
Igh
FgS
Du
For real there are so many themes in this album and concepts that you just don&#39;t understand after 1 listen. Take time to digest this album, try to understand the lyrics and themes and you&#39;ll see this is honestly a masterpiece. The 10/10 is well deserved.
Complexion/Mortal Man/Institutionalized are my 3 favourite but every song is amazing, one of the greatest albums i ever heard in my life, Up there with the Reasonable Doubt, illmatic, Infamous, Black on Both Sides/ ect
You know music Mr Fantano. except for your Days before rodeo review, got that score wrong
Anyone else get the feeling that Kendrick is referring to the song &#39;Sing about me&#39; on GKMC on the track These Walls? Specifically the last verse? Listened to it a few times before it clicked but I just wonder who else has, if at all anyone else has?
&quot;u&quot; is one of my favorite tracks on the album. Extremely deep. &quot;Alright&quot; and &quot;King Kunta&quot; are my other favorites.
Will this review get more views than Fleet Foxes??<br><br>Only Time Will Tell.
I always know its a 8 or above when the video is 20 mins plus lol
doPe reviews i subbed!!!
First listen - Hmm.. interesting (interesting production. good lyrics. great concept &amp; subject matter)<br><br>Second listen - Woah (Very vivid lyrics, poetic, production is very catchy &amp; I caught myself bobbing my head)<br><br>Third listen - goosebumps. I caught too many things I didn&#39;t catch at first   <br>(Lyrics)<br><br>Fourth listen - Classic (everything he decided to bring, he tackled every detail about what this poem was about)<br><br>Fifth listen - MASTERPIECE <br><br>Sixth Listen - alright I&#39;m done this nigga on anotha level. PEACE OUT <br>
I like this guy lol 
Hood politics is him speaking as his younger self... Hence the higher pitch voice
If you&#39;re reading this it&#39;s too late....<br><br>A blank letter by Kendrick Lamar..<br><br>Haa!!
Album sounds like it could&#39;ve been released in the 90s
Somebody needs to make a gif of Cal&#39;s reaction at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1320">22:00</a>.
Perfect analysis..
Hey Anthony, 3 things I&#39;d like to say/ask you.<br><br>1. 22 minutes for an album review video is pretty long. Even tho you know what youre talking about and are entertaining to watch I still feel like its a little too¬†lengthy. I think 15 minutes is about the longest these type of videos should be.<br><br>2. Since you know so much about music and seem passionate about it, have you ever considered becoming a musical artist yourself?<br><br>3. Are you open to reviewing old albums? In case you are, I would like to know your opinion on some classic albums like the marshall Mathers LP by Eminem, Demon days by the gorillaz or hybrid theory and meteora by Linkin park.<br><br>Kind regards,<br>A regular viewer.
review Night Lovell 
Anthony you duh man. You take everything im thinkin about in album&#39;s right out my mouth and you make me notice thing&#39;s I didn&#39;t pay attention to. You wanna know somethin else I wish you rap cause your intelligent bro you would have some dope ass songs bro
This is probably one of the best albums I&#39;ve heard, ever. Not only is it a landmark hip hop album, but it&#39;s a landmark album period. I&#39;m talking Sgt. Pepper or Thriller quality. At this point Kendrick&#39;s biggest challenger is himself. How is he gonna top this? I guess we&#39;ll have to wait and see...
its sad to say but most of today&#39;s youth are to dumb to get this album. they don&#39;t like it because, they only care about a catchy beat with &quot;hella base&quot;. ¬† simply put it goes over there heads.
on these walls ft bilal, anna wise, and thundercat, bilal sounds like d&#39;angelo when he is hitting those notes.
the uh kendlick lamall albem to pump a caterrpillur is uh my favorite lp frem the yer so yea. - cal chuchesta
Whitethony Guiltano
This album is a soundtrack for what&#39;s happening now. I think it was right on time. 
Review Felnuts&#39;s Milk and Sugar. Too dope
That Boris Gardner song is also used well on Good Night- Kanye West
He says it&#39;s good now I&#39;ll think it&#39;s good.
Top 5 favourite songs TPAB songs:<br>1.) Mortal Man<br>2.) The blacker the berry<br>3.) King Kunta¬†<br>3.) &#39;U&#39;<br>5.) Hood Politics
Kinda biased. U can&#39;t cell for free? Or for sale? As good. It&#39;s not that funny. There&#39;s Wesleys theory, these walls(kinda), backer the berry, and alright. It took him 3 years to make an album 15 place behind drakes mixtape. I&#39;m a big sean fan and u can think I&#39;m biased, but I wanted a lot out of this but it was trash. And no King Kunta is not a good song.
Review Kamasi Washington&#39;s album The Epic! It&#39;s out next week on Brainfeeder. This guy was heavy on TPAB, doing sax and string arrangements, and has lots of other musicians from that album on it as well (thundercat!). And don&#39;t sleep on Hiatus Kaiyote&#39;s May 4th release Choose Your Weapon, cuz you slept on Tawk Tomahawk, and they&#39;re blowing up right now. Much love.
2014 Forest Hill Drive&gt;To Pimp A Butterfly
This album is hot
Has anyone noticed that the albums name actually has a hidden meaning. Its called To Pimp A Butterfly, however, what&#39;s a butterfly before it comes out of its cocoon?...a Caterpillar . Now call the album To Pimp A Caterpillar and spell out the initials. Spells 2 PAC!
Great album but dosnt touch Good Kid Mad City....surprised you rate TPAB higher
It&#39;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=266">4:26</a>am. I&#39;m going to bed.
Dude, this is my first video of yours I&#39;m viewing. I can assume you get this often but....You seriously rock. Hold it down! You seriously make the world a better place to live in.
Please review &quot;MTV1987 - Kevin Abstract&quot; and/or &quot;Hello World - Daye Jack&quot;
One of them albums even the pirates be buying in stores.
Great review 
is it me, or does it seem like this guy gave this album too much attention? it&#39;s almost like he received a check for this review.
How do u top this 
Easily the best album sense mmlp 
He&#39;s ugly 
This will be his first video with 1 million views. ¬†early congrats ant fant

Personally i didnt like this album.. actually 50 years from now i dont even think these artists booming right now will even be mentioned for being some of the best but thats just me
I&#39;ve had this album on repeat for the last 2 days, unreal lyrics, and his portrayal of the issues is beautifully expressive and like he (^^) said &quot;poignant.&quot; Great review, wouldn&#39;t describe it any differently.
Isn&#39;t &quot;King Kune&quot; the &quot;Swimming Pools&quot; of &quot;To Pimp a Butterfly&quot;, Anthony?
I kinda view this album as a narrative as well, but an abstract one rather than the physical one in GKMC. It&#39;s a narrative in the sense that his state of mind changes throughout the LP. The first two or three songs are borderline bodacious, as if he is loving life as a famous rapper, then along comes Institutionalized, These Walls and u where he is hit by realisations or reality checks back home (he once spoke about how on his GKMC tour three of his best friends were killed back in Compton). Alright is next, where he climbs out of that rut, knowing that he has to find a way to get back in the right frame of mind again, and is looking for answers to this in For Sale?, before he realises that in order to get his thoughts straight again he needs to go back home and go back down-to-earth for a while, as we see in Momma and Hood Politics. How Much A Dollar Cost, Complexion and The Blacker The Berry were inspired by a trip he took to South Africa, where he realised that the ethnicity was far different there to what he had been told his whole life, and he uses ideas from the consequences of apartheid. After this he feels even more open and awake, and is back to giving advice on You Ain&#39;t Gotta Lie, and coming to terms with who he is again and accepting it in i, before finally questioning his fans directly on their trust and judgement of his actions. I feel like that is a narrative in a way.
I love hip hop, mostly older hip hop, but I just don&#39;t get this album. ¬†6/10 at best... not feeling the beats very much, and not seeing what people see in his flow/lyrics either... it doesn&#39;t sound like he&#39;s even listening to the same beat when he&#39;s rapping..
Review the album about nothing
Kendrick sounds like he really likes HIP HOP and lyricism.
Every song touched my soul 
it sucks
&quot;reblogged 140 character, bumper sticker philosophy &quot; lol
Kendrick even said earl was his favorite rapper
Kendrick is fake as fuck he ain&#39;t lived nothing you are a bandwagon fuck
TIL Kendrick Lamar is a Christian.
Ima GET ALOT of HATE for this comment but this album for lack of a better word is slightly gassed I&#39;m a very intellectual indivisible and think on a higher plane and I understand the message he was trying to convey but forget all the creative concept shit and let&#39;s just focus on RAP and on certain tracks his bars are not up to par like at all and it&#39;s just a bunch of &quot;reaches&quot; only real rap fans will understand that and I listen to the album more than once BTW 
totally agree with this awesome insightful review, was never really a Kendrick fan up until TPAB but I always knew he had it e.g section80 proved this. as for the haters who only appreciate noise and miss the whole sermon here, that&#39;s your loss guys and this IS THE BEST RAP ALBUM OF THE DECADE, true work of art. just hope Lucy don&#39;t get mad and make this his last.
I have to agree.. When I was first listening, I pictured a blank canvas and then each sound was a different glob of paint being thrown on to it. Great instrumentals.. very trippy :)
I dont get it, none of these songs have a catchy tune?
My opinion states that your opinion is shit.
Yo ANT, I have now checke the album out, and I can&#39;t put it down! In my opinion, it is hiphop album of the year! You have beautifully reviewed this album man! No body can do it like you! YOU ARE THE MAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
as much as i&#39;m in support of the social issues addressed with this album, I couldn&#39;t enjoy it as a cohesive work. Unfortunately, I genuinely only like two or three songs, regardless of how i listen to them (through the album as a whole or individually) and didn&#39;t really like where he went with this record.
Pac <br>B.I.G <br>Nas <br>Andre <br>Em <br>All of them better than Kendrick, I can name 10 plus in the game still and they&#39;re all better. The only reason I&#39;m coming off harsh or disrespectful is because I&#39;m annoyed with the amount of fuck boys we have in our society. Oka , okay maybe not that harsh but Kendrick is so overrated it&#39;s annoying  what&#39;s the hype about. He only has a deep message and some decent beats.. His voice is rather annoying he has Some flow, decent wordplay, shit sound in general though. <br>Im really curious about how he gets so much praise that males want to dick ride this man, now don&#39;t get me wrong I definitely love a good message and he delivered but there&#39;s more than the message, music is about the sound is it not(catchy isn&#39;t all bad, trap beats are dope if produced right and can really test an artist same with the more electronic experimental beats).. I love poetry but I didn&#39;t appreciate Kendrick&#39;s take too much, I love soul music jazz rock edm almost all types but wtf I&#39;m not buying this hype someone tell me what I&#39;m missing, analyzed almost every aspect. In my opinion Kendrick tried to progress music with just one attempt these things take years to do it need to be a transition phase for a smoother landing Kendrick tried doing in one go because he seen rappers like Drake and jcole raise the bar. And as someone who is truly conscious that&#39;s literally the only reason I can listen to this album at all, <br>6/10
Yelawolf love story review please 
3
album&#39;s enjoyable tracks:<br>Wesley&#39;s Theory<br>King Kunta<br>For Free?<br>Institutionalized<br>Alright<br>Hood Politics<br>How much a Dollar Cost?<br>Complexion<br>The Blacker The Berry<br>You ain&#39;t gotta lie<br>i<br><i>________</i><br>These Walls(least favorite track for me)<br>u<br>for sale<br>momma<br>and mortal man<br>are the only songs you can&#39;t fully ride on unless you begun to appreciate its work of art, message, symbolism etc. these songs are not for cruising and chilling, these songs seems like you have to be on a mood or a state of mind to enjoy these tracks. I appreciate these 5 songs especially u, for sale, and mortal man but i feel like cruising on these 5 songs is less enjoyable than the ones above.
I&#39;ve come to the conclusion he&#39;s on kendricks nuts I mean look how long the video is and Kendrick has some of the low quality instrumental lmfao
For those who don&#39;t like the album, keep listening. The tracks grow on you
This is a black album. I think only we can fully grasp a song about being black in the U.S., but Antonio gave a pretty good musical breakdown of the album
Amazing analysis, I shared many thoughts after listening to this album, and you also enlightened me on a lot. Thanks so much for doing this
I still like Pinata better, hate on me all you want, Freddie Gibbs x Madlib can&#39;t be touched
still no review on the album about nothing...
For sale? Is soooooo sick. Favorite track on there.
it&#39;s nice to see how enthusiastic anthony is during this review 
When Anthony introduces himself as Anthony Fantano, the album is a 10.
My hip-hop knowledge is not nearly as diverse as other genres I listen to, but many commenters here seem to have pretty extensive knowledge of hip-hop music.<br>I enjoy Kendrick Lamar&#39;s music, so who can point me in the direction of some great, similar modern artists?
bam. nice intro.
still dont get how this guy didn&#39;t like isaiah rashads album
TPAB tackles black issues using old school black music. And it&amp;apos;s perfect for what it is.
I am hoping that the instrumentals on this album turn more people onto jazz
why the fuck is he pronouncing poem as POME
listened to this shit on shrooms and holy balls...thats all i could say
Stop comparing GKMC to TPAB, they&#39;re completely two different types of sound. 
Kendrick has been an inspiration to me since K Dot. I had seen him freestyling and once I heard Drank for the first time on the radio some years later I knew I heard the voice somewhere and finding out it was Kendrick blew my mind. In every album or feature he never fails to surprise me and in this album I think personally for me at this point in my life he draws in an easy audience for EVERYONE to &quot;Ask the man in the mirror&quot; to make a change!!! Lol I absolutely loved not only the songs but the lyrics and I hope and aspire to be as great on my own level as this man Kendrick Lamar! ^~^ 
The album was too boring good kid mad city was much better
Good shit. Good way to describe it. 
Why are you avoiding For Sale? Its much more complex than you make it seem. Its one of the most important tracks and I think you have the ability to open peoples minds about the message he is sending within that track. theneedledrop
1pac gets a 6 out of 10 just j.Cole well If that&#39;s the case rap music is fuckedÔªø
this is an old one but do retch delinquents &amp; degenerates
Shit I wonder what Kendrick would say about this deeply psychological analysis bout him..
anyone else loving &#39;you aint gotta lie&#39;?
This is why ultimately GKMC is better than TPAB in my opinion. Sonically, I&#39;m more inclined to give it to TPAB as I really like that style and am a huge FlyLo/Thundercat fan, but as a concept album and full package GKMC edges it out. I much prefer Kendrick the storyteller from GKMC that simply provides you with an anecdote (even from multiple perspectives) and allows you to take from it what you will, then Reverend Kendrick Lamar from TPAB who comes across as a holier-than-thou.¬†<br><br>And no theneedledrop¬†this doesn&#39;t make me basic. Most of Kendrick&#39;s &quot;eye opening moral insights&quot; on this album surpass pH 14. I&#39;m talking suburban white girl, wearing an infinity scarf and Uggs, intravenously being fed pumpkin spice latte in a bathtub filled with bleach, basic.<br><br>&quot;How Much a Dollar Cost&quot; is a prime example of this. Sonically the song is great, and Kendrick demonstrates yet again his ability to create vivid imagery with only his words. Then what does he do? Ruin the excellency of his narrative with arguably one of the most banal messages known to man &quot;Give to the poor, or go to hell&quot;. Veryyyyy creative, especially the part where some heavenly being comes down to earth to test the fibre of man&#39;s moral character (blatant sarcasm).<br><br>&#39;i&#39; remains probably one of the cheesiest songs ever released. The Blacker the Berry however, is fantastic. The reason being, a black dude standing up and admitting the hypocritical elements of black culture, and the fact that he himself has perpetuated this hypocrisy is actually insightful, especially coming from a rap artist who&#39;s success ultimately derives from black culture. To do so in spite of the fact that it&#39;s easy for people to relegate him as an Uncle Tom is a bold move and so mad props to him.<br><br>As for the whole 2Pac conversation at the end...Meh. The whole, unabated reverence for 2Pac thing is also way overdone in the rap game, and probably only because he has an air of martyrdom to him.<br><br>GKMC is a 9.5 TPAB is an 8.5. You mistake a lot of insipid messages as being thought provoking.
Just watched this for the first time. No wonder you killed Cal. &quot;It wasn‚Äôt a human being I killed, it was a principle!&quot;-Raskolnikov, &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;
Not falling for the hype with this one. There&#39;s too many people forcing themselves to like this album because it&#39;s Kendrick. I see too many saying things like &quot;I didn&#39;t like the album at all after 3 listens, but after 10 listens its the best album in forever.&quot; I understand some saying it&#39;s great cuz there are some great songs on the album, but to say it&#39;s a flawless masterpiece is a big stretch. There&#39;s flaws all over the album. Vocally, Kendrick is just terrible on most of this album. Especially with all the corny voice changes. Others get panned for this, but for some reason he gets a pass. Lyrically he&#39;s a beast, but his delivery and flow on this album is stiff, choppy and off beat on a handful of songs. Kendrick seems to rap fast when it&#39;s not necessary and it&#39;s distracting over slower tempo beats even worse in spoken word poetry. There&#39;s some weak hooks (ie Hood Politics). Once again, something that Kendrick gets away with. Production is solid, but he went for too many different sounds on the album and some instrumentals just don&#39;t mesh with his voice. To end things, the Pac interview was unnecessary. The idea and concept of the album is great, but musically its overrated. I don&#39;t see how this album got a 10, and Lupe&#39;s only a 7!?!? Tetsuo and Youth is just as lyrical, creative, way tighter flows and has a much more cohesive sound from start to finish.
&gt;mfw its really a 8/10 at best
That Tupac dude&#39;s career is about to take off thanks to Kendrick
<a href="http://m.datpiff.com/tape/619284">http://m.datpiff.com/tape/619284</a>
Kendrick is so inspirational , I actually made a track¬†talking about some of the same things he talks about on this album<br>Link to my track --&gt; <a href="https://soundcloud.com/ego-ypc/dying-4-ego-1">https://soundcloud.com/ego-ypc/dying-4-ego-1</a> I&#39;d really appreciate if y&#39;all would check me out I&#39;m only 17¬†an I&#39;m really trying to inspire others with my music like Kendrick!
Bro this is my first time watching your channel.... U had me with the review fan guy LMAO!!!!
I honestly can&#39;t think of another album that is so universally loved (I&#39;m in the loved group) and also so universally hated at the same time.
All you people saying this album is shit, go take an IQ test and let me know how low the results are.
In which song does he recite the whole &quot;I remember you was conflicted poem&quot; the last song I hear it in is at the end of Hood Politics
what fonts are those at the beginning of the video?
Best Album review to date i&#39;ve seen from Needle Drop. TPAB definitely deserved a 10... it was literally an audio theatrical play. Nowhere near as enjoyable to listen to as GKMC but far more creative and complex. Kendrick definitely secured his place in Top 5 dead or alive in hip hop with this album. Hiiipower bish.
Dope review!
After weeks of listening this album is a 7 at best ....
Now a fan of you. Great review!
Hilarious @ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1315">21:55</a>
Hey man, you should do a full review on Tyler the Creator&#39;s new album &quot;Cherry Bomb&quot;
This dude just nut hugs kendrick
i give this a strong curtis to a light mayfield...
üëé a few good songs, a few.<br>
I feel like People are proper scared to dislike something Kendrick has done..This album isnt great, the fact it&#39;s named as one of the best albums in the last century worries me lol 10/10 Albums should be relatable to anyone and the vocals need to be on point, which they werent. And trust me, this &quot;power to the people&quot; and &quot;omg the system is so fucked&quot; theme will pass, had it with Mos Def, common, 3stacks etc..
This album was really good, bold instrumentals &amp; great conceptually, but I dont consider this album a classic.
In &#39;these walls&#39; the woman that he is sleeping with in the track is actually the partner of the man who shot and killed Kendrick&#39;s friend (named Dave in Good Kid Mad City). Throughout the¬†first 2 verses¬†I think Kendrick is referring to the walls of the vagina of the woman that he is sleeping with, but in the 3rd verse with all the talk of deciding fate and race wars with wardens leads me to think that he&#39;s referring to the walls of a prison; the walls of the cell that encloses the man who shot Kendrick&#39;s friend to be specific. Notice that he says &#39;walls telling you to listen to &#39;sing about me&#39;&#39; and that &#39;retaliation is strong&#39; which leads me to think that Kendrick is sleeping with the man&#39;s partner as a form of vengeance for his murdered friend and how he could use his power of fame to easily achieve this vengeance. Another thing to note is the lyrics &#39;so retaliation is a must&#39; in the song &#39;The Jig Is Up&#39;. This can give some insight that maybe Kendrick had been planning on gaining vengeance in this way, coupled with the line &#39;I&#39;ve been on the streets too long, looking at¬†you from the outside in&#39; from¬†&#39;these walls&#39; also showing that he was looking at her, maybe with¬†malicious intent to harm the man who had hurt him so badly.
MY opinion on this album: GREAT loved it on first listen<br>Why: I had a crush on jazz music resently with Flying Lotus album, Thundercat and many more Jazz music(old jazz also), also alot of korean music has jazz influences.<br>For me when i heard for the first GKMC¬† i didnt liked it because i didnt understood the message and it was a bit too dark( i am not native)¬† but when i read the lycris and understood more about hip hop in general i liked GKMC and Kendrick became my favorite Rapper but now TPAB is my favorite because right now i am on a Jazz trip and Kendrick just gave what¬† i wanted i am so happy that he hit my taste so well.
Stfu you bumblebee fuck
What&#39;s more important..good music or good message on bad beats?..

Shit album... Cherry Bomb will be better
if you don&#39;t think this is a story album, i&#39;m not sure you&#39;re listening hard enough
kendrick is so overrated...dick riders galore
WHAT AN ALBUM!!!!
You might regard this as spam, if so, then so be it - here&#39;s a remix of King Kunta<br><a href="https://soundcloud.com/samasgari/kendrick-lamar-king-kunta-sam-asgari-remix">https://soundcloud.com/samasgari/kendrick-lamar-king-kunta-sam-asgari-remix</a>
-SITION.<br><br>The lack of closure was horrible.
I&#39;m probably gonna get a lot of shit for this, but I think you would look better with hair.
the nut riding on this album is unbelievable. Great message behind it and a few good songs, but the majority of the album just SOUNDS like shit. The sound of the music isn&#39;t good. Like i said, great motives and thoughts behind the album but it just doesn&#39;t sound good. You shouldn&#39;t have to force yourself to accept a sound to extract the good in an album, it should come naturally.
J.Cole and kenkdrick holding me down
It seems to be the sequel to section 80 where he was the student. In to pimp a butterfly he is now the teacher.
how come he hasn&#39;t done any reviews or mentioned nicki minaj ever?
Dude your reviews are amazing. I&#39;m also thinking of making my own reviews :) I hope you do a review on the upcoming YelaWolf album, Love Story!!!
I actually didn&#39;t like For Free... I tried but i just don&#39;t like it... The other songs tho are fucking amazing
Very nice review !<br>Congratulation from France !
(euphoria intensifies)
TPAB is out of its time and wasted on the shittiest generation that doesnt appriciate its brilloiance
To Pimp a Butterfly is the worst rap album I&#39;ve ever heard.
I have been listening to this album nonstop! It&#39;s the perfect blend of all my fav genres  
I&#39;ll have to go back and listen to it again,  but in all honesty this shit is fire
Lamar is the deadmau5 of rap. An anti-conventional, crowd-hating, deeper-thinking artist. Respect.
Kendrick&#39;s music is the type that rubs of on you over time,it isn&#39;t for the simple minded
Dude... I&#39;ve been watching your videos for a while and your perfecting your craft. ¬†Whether I agree with what you say or not, you are excellent. ¬†You make the music you review better and more important. ¬†I thought I had this album completely figured out but you showed me some details that I were right under my nose. ¬†Really thankful that you do this. ¬†I&#39;m sure these reviews are bringing you success and I am sure they will bring you much more cause you definitely deserve it. ¬†I&#39;m currently about to graduate college and aspire to make music. ¬†I could be shit and If I am I can only hope and dream that someday you are the one to tell me.
Why would anyone not want a &#39;trendy instrumental&#39;? it just generally sounds better
What time was it and don&#39;t you. We&#39;d to get some sleep?
You forgot how he talks with Satan and God throughout the album
you&#39;re truly great sometimes. love you anthony
The Best Fucking Album in a VERY long time!!!!! ¬†Legendary.
next, lower dens
Kendrick is WAAAY better than Drake, but even with Cole.
To Pimp A Butterfly and Late registration are the only albums in which I don&#39;t need to skip a song.
I&#39;m surprised that so many people watch a video of someone reviewing an album. You can literally listen to the entire album for free, why take the time to hear someone else to review it?
TPAB Has nothing on Drakes new mixtape. Drake is a better rapper because Kendrick just doesnt seem to know how to tell a story with his music.
Excellent breakdown......
How does he not get that j Cole is better than kendrick
Kingthony Crimstano
Kendrick Lamar went far and beyond on his latest album it&#39;s crazy!!! The rap, the production, the message behind every song is transparent and embodying!! One of the Brest albums in 2015! I rate this a 9
holy shit a 10, I&#39;ve never seen you give anyone a 10
The message in this album is a masterpiece. The actual music it self is trash AF. Don&#39;t get it confused
Ya favorite album is BOO BOO!
Maybe an 8, GKMC was more 10ish than this.¬†
1/5
I liked backseat freestyle but the rest of his music i find too.....weird? The beats ect struggle to rhyme and he sounds a fair bit like lil Wayne.
Really conflicted about this.. In terms of context, this album is flawless. I mean, DEHH pointed it out perfectly how the title describes how Black people grow out of this cocoon and Kendrick explored this topic so well. This dude seriously just dropped another movie, it&#39;s like the sequel to GKMC.. I agree that this album was incredibly put together and the concept of it was really well drawn, but I&#39;m not liking the actual music or how he executed these ideas. King Kunta, Alright &amp; some others I really enjoyed but as a whole, it&#39;s too &#39;funk&#39;y and sounds a little too ambitious to me, keep in mind this is after 1 listen but as of now, I look at it as a strong 6. I really hate that I feel this way but come on.. The version of &#39;I&#39; that was put on the album just sounded awful and some of the earlier tracks just didn&#39;t flow well together at all. I loved how edgy GKMC was and stayed kind of relevant with modern day instrumentals with songs like &#39;Swimming Pools&#39; and &#39;Backseat Freestyle&#39;, but this is exactly what I didn&#39;t want to hear from Kendrick sonically.. A whole album of instrumentals identical to &#39;Black Boy Fly&#39; and &#39;Real&#39;. I mean god damn, the instrumentals just sounded so dated and washed up and made it hard to enjoy the album for me, especially the first half. I can see why everyone&#39;s praising the concept but I&#39;d just like to call EXTREME bullshit on all these magazines rating this a 90-100.. I mean Kendrick&#39;s amazing but there&#39;s just so much dickriding going on over this album and Fantano I love you but really? A 10?? I&#39;m just saying that I don&#39;t see it at all.. Maybe it&#39;ll grow on me but seriously, if this is one of the best rap albums of all time like y&#39;all are saying, I&#39;m worried. 
i think you have a biased for albums that tell a story.
Smh, people are so fake! Saying shit like &quot;I wasn&#39;t feeling the jazzy, funk type style to it&quot; Foh! You know that most of Kendrick Lamar&#39;s work is a 10/10 not all of them but most. Stop saying shit u jus heard another person say who really felt that way about the funk soul jazz shit. People find any reason to hate on anything or anybody. Why does everything that becomes popular has to be hated? His work is great and this album was fire. Shit like &quot; It&#39;s boring&quot; just means that u listen to rap for the beat, which is clearly why &quot;It&#39;s boring&quot; is invalid! If you think that then u really have no taste, no sense, and no understanding of the roots of rap. Beats of rap music is made to intrigue the audience, rap period always delivered a message! I understand if u just don&#39;t like the album because u prefer to be a chief keef young thug dumbass with no life or if you just couldn&#39;t relate to it and felt as if some other work was better. But please respect good REAL music masterpieces. Kendrick is working his ass off from all his releases to change the world with what he loves and to deliver messages and open human beings eyes to true reality, but people still disrespect what beautiful messages he conveys! No, I&#39;m not &quot;dickin&quot; Kendrick or anything, I understand that other rappers are good, but Kendrick is a rapper who has dominated the rap game lately! No, this 1 great album doesn&#39;t suddenly make him the best (because then it would turn into how people think Eminem is good because he raps fastüòÇ ) but all his albums have an excellent concept to them and the best is not even that bad! Plus, the funky jazz shit doesn&#39;t have much genres in rap these days so its good to have them added in! Kendrick fused different types of music into rap and it binded well. Come on people, don&#39;t just open your eyes but open your hearts! Listen before you judge! Hate on Kendrick because he was not in the rap game as long as other rappers and are passing them by like nothing. Appreciate good work, admire great artist. Kendrick has been my favorite rapper before this album came out, I got attracted to his emotion and meaning in rap and how he made it relatable and has lightened up a dead community of rap, and now he takes it even further. Kendrick Lamar Duckworth  started with a bang, continued with a bang, and will end it with a bang, then start again with a clash instead of a bang. Rappers appreciate his work but us non rappers can&#39;t, we should be ashamed to call ourselves! What type of music junkies are we? üòî
Dude, your dope as shit.
Initially I hated this album , I was expecting another Good Kid MADD City. It takes a few listens for it to grow on you . You start to get the message and story behind the album. I&#39;m not sure about 10/10 but it&#39;s a damn good album if you give it a shot.
This guy reminds me of Lester from gta 5
DUDE..... I THINK I LOVE YOU!!! LOL<br>THE ALBUM IS GOLD!!!! PURE 24K
kendrick lamar is the most overrated rapper since Tupac. Ironic the album ends the way it does.
What&#39;s with white people trying to alleviate their white guilt by listening to rap music <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23starbucks">#starbucks</a>
This Album is beautiful something everyone should listen to
farva?
I dont like the album at all (besides a song or two). But I still respect it, and what he was trying to do. I guess its not mainstream enough for me, before you haters say that. Good day.
yo people talking shit to those who don&#39;t like the album and saying that they &quot;love Drake, only like trash rap, only want bangers, are close minded&quot; need to chill. I was amazed and love the message AND the music, but some people just don&#39;t like the sound of it! People like what they like. People will not even try to listen to the album &quot;properly&quot; and totally miss Kendrick&#39;s base message, but conversely, people WILL try to do that, and both are fine. It&#39;s a pointless argument between those who like and don&#39;t like this album... or any album for that matter. I also reckon that to really get this album, you need to just slap on some headphones, get comfortable, get rid of all distractions and play it start to finish in a row like you do with some of the greatest rap albums ever to grace our ears. Shits like studying for an exam yo, get around it.¬†
At the end, did anyone else feel as if Tupac was still alive after heating that interview for the first time?
Kendrick could have recorded himself taking a shit and you fuck niggas would say it&#39;s the best shit ever.
anything less than a 10 and you would have been internet-crucified
Album sucks nuff said
Anthony, I&#39;ve been watching your reviews since way back in 2009, and I must say...this is your best review ever!
–õ–´–°–´–ô –ì–ê–ì–ê–¢–£–ù!!!
How the fuck do you get so many views??? BIG QUINT IS WAY FUCKING BETTER 
I&#39;m just so happy for the 12 or 13 year old that hears this album. This is their Illmatic.
YOU HATE HIP-HOP!!!
GREAT JOB my man! God dam you are good at what you do.
You speak hella wise on this my man , i had a certain opinion about you before but things do change
Nas set the standard for perfect hip hop albums with Illmatic but Kendrick just might have surpassed him with this one.
The live version of &quot;I&quot; is amazing
To anyone saying this album is garbage: You are too immature and uncultured for it. This entire album has great and interesting messages about society, and how Kendrick perceives it. You don&#39;t have to love it but at least respect the craft.
Damn Anthony...you have really endorsed and promoted this album!!! NOw I will check it out for myself!
Should&#39;ve been To Pimp A Caterpillar: ToPAC
Almost a month later and I&#39;m still loving the album. I&#39;ve been playing it everyday since it&#39;s release. <br><br>My favorite songs is King Kunta, and I (single version)<br>The best song IMO is The Blacker the Berry <br>Most Shocking: U, and Mortal Man 
why you gotta say black like that homie?
This Anthony guy really does his homework !
Needle, can you do a list of your favorite hip hop albums ever? Love your review and TPAB, obviously. Such a sick record.
FUCK YOUR REVIEWS UNLESS YOU MAKE MUSIC TOO, AND HAVE SOMETHING RELEVANT TO SAY! HE DIDN&#39;T WRITE A SINGLE FUCKING SONG SINCE SECTION 80
hey anthony I&#39;ve noticed you&#39;ve never reviewed stromae! if you got the time you should def review his stuff I really dig his discography, would be cool to see your take on it.<br>thanks
8.2/10
10/10 for me. This album is going down as one of the greatest albums of all time. In my opinion this album is better than GKMC. Kendrick is just on another level. And i am thankful to listen to this album. TBAB is a classic and this album was needed¬†
LOVE this review. The album was brilliant! Very deep!
Was never really a fan of Kendrick but this is better.<br><br>Please review Dance Gavin Dance - Instant Gratification. It comes out on the 14th of April.
Next we need:<br>That Jay Rock album<br>That GOOD ab-soul album<br>The kendrick-cole collab<br>Black Hippy debut
Best review that I have seen for this album online. Great perspective.
I&#39;m watching this on shrooms I&#39;m hella trippin lmaooooo 
i like this album but king kunta is trash
Bro, no mention of &quot;how much a dollar cost?&quot; :(
Amazing music critic! This is my first video, on a whim. You are well spoken and musically / intellectually stimulating. I needed this right now.
Will his album take me back to the early to mid nineties to try n recapture that G-funk era, or is it a grand homage to that era and Kendrick&#39;s recognition and respect for it!?! 
this album sucks all of you are freaking retards if you like this crap.
Kendrick kills it. If you like this shit check out Open Mike Eagle, similar flow talking about similar things with a comedic outlook. great rapper with a sick flow, when a homie first played me his songs, i said wtf this sounds like Kendrick&#39;s dad.
There are a lot of good lyrics on this album KEndranthony Lamtano!
Overated as fuck. This album is no 10
1. How much a dollar cost<br>2. These walls<br>3.King kunta<br><br>How much a dollar cost actually hit me when I listened to the lyrics 
When I first listened to the album, I didn&#39;t get hooked right away, but I knew this was way better than all the rappers now, after listening to it a couple times I liked it so much, it&#39;s throwing it back to when rap was at its prime, not bs about how much money they have, and where they store their weed, and how many bitches they fucked. And how they don&#39;t fuck with poor bitches. This album is the best 
I love how you people act so unimpressed just cause it&#39;s popular. 
I like all the songs but the part that hit me was the end of these walls can talk with his voice changing right to left 
what a joke this album. Couple of ok songs, nothing like good kid mad city. Fuck this
Awesome review. Although, I have to disagree with your opinion on it not being a cohesive story piece like &#39;good kid, m.A.A.d city&#39;... I kind of felt like, if anything, this is the continuation of that. To me, it sounds like he&#39;s now telling the story of a kid that finally made it out of the hood by getting a record deal, and is now sharing an experience that instead of being exciting has left him feeling jaded. <br><br>Great album either way! 
To pimp a butterfly is one if the worst hip hop albums of all time. Let&#39;s make a album crying about how blacks have been treated then say we struggled when in reality nobody alive has truly struggled . just your great grandparents. Everyone who pulls the race card is a pussy
nice one... when u going to review dj koze mr.dropper?
TO PIMP A BUTTERFLY IS BETTER THAN GOOD KID , MAAD CITY . YOU AINT GOTTA LIE AND ALRIGHT ARE MY FAVORITES
Does anyone know what happened to that song &#39;untitled&#39; that Kendrick did at the Colbert report?
&quot;While this record does have a few bones to pick&quot;<br><br>I see what you did there, Mandingo.
Anyone get a book of human language vibe from this album?
Meh--I wasnt impressed. By the time he sampled Boom Clap Bachelors--after Logic and another cat, I wasnt impressed.
MUH WHITE GUILT
You remind me of Hot 97&#39;s Peter Rosenburg lol
your one listen reviews are killing hip hop
nvm how much a dollar cost is actually fukn so sick
Love this guy
The message is great just not feeling kendrick
N
Can you please give wale a chance and review the album about nothing 
Elite/Legend Tier - Eminem, Jay Z, Kanye<br>Legacy Tier - T.I.P, Luda¬†<br>First Tier - Drake, Kendrick, Cole<br>Second Tier - Wale, Meek, Sean¬†<br>Third Tier - Asap, Gambino(?)<br>Flash in the Pan - Migos, Shmurda, the Chief Kiefs etc.
You really like Kendrick Lamar don&#39;t you? I realized that.
I bet we&#39;ll all be rocking to TPAB in 10 years.
coming back to old reviews is so hard now knowing cal is gone :/
I thought that the album had too many words. It was clean though.
I sort of get the point kendrick is trying to get, but i wasnt really feeling the sound of the album. Besides mortal man, the rest of the album was meh
Why don&#39;t you just marry him
I don&#39;t get the hype over this album. 10/10? Really?<br><br>I sat down and listened to this album with high hopes. Kendrick was a different breed of rapper from what I&#39;d seen. Not your typical stereotype of a rapper but rather an artist with an interesting message about the place he lived in. In Section 80 he captivated me with several stories and messages about people he grew up with. In Mad City he showed me Compton through his eyes and his friends.. however with this album I didn&#39;t even want to reach the end unlike with the past two which had me loving nearly every moment.<br><br>I found my self disliking the overly used soul/funk/Jazzy sound the beats were composed with. It made me... uncomfortable and this isn&#39;t to say I don&#39;t like this style of music. GhostFace&#39;s new album with BBNG (Sour soul) was one of the best instrumentals of 2015 and I am a fan of old soul music as well. His lyrics (kendicks) seem to be reaching to be &quot;new&quot; and &quot;out of the box&quot;, as if he&#39;s trying too hard to break away from what other artists in hip hop are doing.. and that&#39;s not a bad thing but it&#39;s as if he&#39;s pushing the envelope to the extreme. I found my self disliking almost every moment and I didn&#39;t find much of it pleasing. There&#39;s not to say that there aren&#39;t some songs I found decent but this isn&#39;t in my opinion Kendick&#39;s best work.. not even close. Although I see some of you idolizing this as if it&#39;s some type of masterpiece.. and who knows it might but in my eyes this is one of his worst art to date.<br><br>I would like to state I do take note that he&#39;s putting his heart, soul and mind into this music. He&#39;s pushing several messages and I found many songs to be interesting. I was never a fan of his voice but his style and over all lyrics made me see past this. However once again I didn&#39;t find the sampling, instrumentals or even most of his rapping to be interesting. At the song &quot;U&quot; I found my self questioning &quot;What the fuck is this?&quot;.. after a deeper look it&#39;s clear there&#39;s a lot of heart and emotion in the song but it wasn&#39;t at all pleasing to my ears. The fact this got a 10 some what baffles me but then again my opinion isn&#39;t everyone else&#39;s. I&#39;m just confused on how people can view this as &quot;The best album of all time&quot; or even up in the top 10. It&#39;s an interesting piece of work but I honestly think you&#39;re all riding this bandwagon and praising him up on some pedestal of &quot;Greatness&quot; when honestly he&#39;s not as good as you make him out to be.¬†<br>(For all of you that will instantly claim I&#39;m simply a fan of trendy music.. I would like to say I&#39;m a fan of MF doom&#39;s work, Madlib (other stone throw records individuals) and many other rappers and artists out there. I just don&#39;t see what ever else does in this album).
Overrated
To pimp a butterfly id say is a 8.5/10 for me love the chills I got from some most of the  songs but  not always in the mood to hear it. My opinion might change over time 
While I enjoyed this album, and sonically and creatively I think Kendrick is far ahead of most of his peers, I can&#39;t help but feel like he&#39;s is riding an easy trend thematically. After all, it was just two LPs ago that Kendrick touted, &quot;Fuck your ethnicity!&quot;. ¬†Now, given the fever pitch of racial tension recently, the overall theme of this LP just seems a little &quot;on the nose&quot; for Kendrick. ¬†This album almost dares members of any race to appose it&#39;s message. ¬†It&#39;s a softball. 7/10
slates the new modest mouse album but praises this garbage, this guys a joke...
Right on!!!‚úä
Most disappointing album of the year for me. Completely disheartening. Honestly hate the sound on this album 
I&#39;m really not all that familiar with hip hop in general; most of what I&#39;ve heard just doesn&#39;t really do it for me, even though the genre/scene itself has always fascinated me. I guess Kendrick Lamar is the artist I&#39;ve been searching for all this time cause this album is fucking phenomenal. It just sounds real. It has something to say. Not to mention it&#39;s an expertly crafted album musically as well. In a way it kinda makes a lot of other rap I&#39;ve heard seem silly or gimmicky in comparison.<br>Now, I&#39;m sure Kendrick isn&#39;t the only hip hop artist of that kind out there so can anyone point me to similar stuff? I&#39;d love to hear more of what&#39;s out there!
it&#39;s an album by Kendrick, that already speaks for itself.
GREAT REVIEW
Kendrick has a good message in his music, as someone who considers their self to be &quot;conscious&quot; it&#39;s not hard to pull out certain messages in his music. Although I really can&#39;t find myself appreciating this album like so many others. I honestly think J Cole and Drake put out better albums. I understand people like a good message in their music but don&#39;t forget that music is based off sound first and foremost, Kendrick&#39;s voice has always threw me off, I like funk vibes but definitely not too much, not a big fan of skits and poetry(in my music), and for this type of music; I&#39;m sorry but I need at least one banger to blast in a car or sound system I need something with a nice BEAT and I just didn&#39;t get it. My opinion I love creativity and expression but still couldn&#39;t get into the album. My opinion if you truly do love this album then check some other genre&#39;s your love for music is most likely a lot broader then you think.<br>6.5/10
You should give Talk Talk&#39;s Spirit of Eden a review.
Review Aenima!!!
&quot;This record has a few BONES TO PICK&quot; Well played...
Stellar album, stellar review
THIS MEME AINT FREEeeee
I knew it!!! I fuckin knew it!!! I knew fantano was gonna give it a 10 waaaaay before the review. Great taste in music tony
My fav....How much a dollar cost.¬†<br>Deep vibe.
I totally agree!!¬†<br>Very daring and right on target. A backwards soul/rap album. Love it!!
Great lyrics, great content, but the beat was lackluster for my taste.¬†
Album is good, the thing is Kendrick didnt make the best hiphop album of the decade.<br>This album has 2 or 3 hip hop songs at most, the album cant be classified as hip hop.<br>He is a hip hop ARTIST though.<br>He did make one of the best conceptual albums of the decade though. Not sure what genre it can be placed in though
I&#39;m still waiting for the day a needle drop video gets a million views
you rock Anthony
you just gave it a 10/10 so people would tell their dumbass friends to watch this video
It has been 2 weeks or so I heard the album, and personally I think the song he put as a Least fav Track &quot;I guess you ain&#39;t gotta lie&quot; is THE best masterpiece he made throughout the whole album. But at least he made it 10/10 best album, with his best interview.
i loved the album, cant even compare this to anything else hes really created his own lane with this.
he&#39;s not this rappers who just gonna like spit statistics at you like &quot;OH THIS MANY PEOPLE DIED, FEEL SOMETHING!&quot;... great phrase.. you just put his gift in words xD
What about a review of the new Hollywood Undead album? 
600k!!!!!!
This album is definitely great. Takes a certain ear to enjoy this, my only problem is that people are so quick to call things a masterpiece or classic. 
I understand black people went and go through a lot, just like other people also do. Kendrick is extremely talented and one of the greatest of all time, a genius. But man, i see some black people being racist, saying this album is for black people, thats messed up, i didnt know there was such a thing, sometimes racism comes from within people&#39;s ownselves, i just dont really like the album yet, it may grow on me later on. 
HYPEEEEEEEEEEEEE¬†
LANDFILL!¬†<br>sorry
I totally agree. One of the best albums I have ever heard.
K Dot is a lyrical spiritual miracle individual.
Kendrick was going to name the album To Pimp A Caterpillar which is a mnemonic device for Tupac look at it closely ...<br>MIND BLOWN
Excellent, prescient review. Good looks on calling out GKMC for Kendrick&#39;s way of settling/compromising for mainstream. He just said in a Hot 97 interview that&#39;s exactly how he felt about the project, and that TPAB is him fully diving in to his potential.
A pile of sack riders 
HOLY SHIT.... first time I love an album and Anthony likes it
This guy is on Crack. This album is artsy but not an enjoyable listen. Its some great background heroin music. Kendricks message is dope. But this is fucking trash
Agreed. Agreed. Agreed.
funny, since the day this album released, i changed my sight on the world for the better..
Kendrick is already better than pac
haha ive seen ur avi on worldstar Comments!!.When he does that high pitch voice it seems to me hes biting off from Quasimoto since he&#39;s also an LA artist .what do you think
Oh, Mr. Fantano. I still have the message that I sent (and you responded to!), my respect for you is astronomical. Please keep doing what you do, you&#39;re one of my go-to&#39;s when I want to find some music as art. 
I wish all that people that watched this review would buy the actual album. Support the good kid
Finally a review in which I don&#39;t disagree with you.¬†
I&#39;m not gonna buy the album until this review of Anthony&#39;s hits 1,000,000 views.
good kid maad city still my fav of his but i enjoyed this album heaps
Imo, GKMC was one of the best Hip-Hop albums i&#39;ve ever listened to. Kinda worried i&#39;m not gonna like this new one as much; not only because my expectations are so high of Kendrick as a rapper, but because you gave this one a 10 and GKMC a 9, and that&#39;s just blowing my mind right now.
Wale the album about nothing
What I wanted: King Kendrick Lamar<br>What I got: Weak ass features and more dick-talking than any shitty Lil Wayne album<br>Where the fuck is this anywhere near S80 or GKMC?I cried.
This album is the truth. From beginning to end.
I thought it was his worst. It just sounds terrible 
Eminem&#39;s &quot;XV&quot; was a disappointment. Lupe Fiasco&#39;s &quot;Tetsuo &amp; Youth&quot; was a disappointment. Kendrick Lamar&#39;s &quot;To Pimp a Butterfly&quot; was a gift from God. I&#39;m so glad that, out of my three favorite rappers of all time, at least one of them released a quality album. It might be time to replace Eminem and Lupe with someone else like Childish Gambino and J.Cole.
I always get lost within your vast vocabulary...you should write down some bars brah.
So I am some what of a fan of Kendrick . But I foreal can&#39;t enjoy his album. Like I love the grove and everything about the message. I literally can&#39;t even pay attention to listening to it. I mean don&#39;t get me wrong it&#39;s a well put together album and I can see the work Kendrick put in it. I enjoyed Forest Hill drive just a bit more. I think it b/c I listen to j cole first and learned about him more than I did with Kendrick. So, I think I just need to be more in touch with Kendrick more to understand the grove, hook and sound better.  
I loved this album but I&#39;m still mad at ¬†the disrespect he showed for big Sean&#39;s album on the ! SO review both great albums
Review adult jazz-gist is, didn&#39;t just come out but still needs a review
I listened to this album and is SHIT
Great review, intelligent and insightful. Well done! Judging by the commentary below, I&#39;m not sure I can say the same for your viewers though.
madd city was much better lol
Sonically this album is pure genius definitely better than Kendrick&#39;s TPAB im not comparing the messages behind the two albums i am simply saying that the songs on Wale&#39;s album are a lot easier to listen to and enjoy than Kendrick&#39;s which in my opinion is purely made for the message although tbf the production was very very detailed in the fact you had to pay a lot of attention to the songs or you would miss some references or not understand the concept at all. For me the top 5 albums of the year so far:<br><br>1. J Cole (Forest Hill Drive) - Combination of good messages, comedic twist and easy to listen to songs makes it a basically flawless album covering all bases<br>2. Wale (The Album about nothing) - This spot was between Kendrick and wale but this album about nothing was definitely about something which is musical genius although each song did sound very similar on first listen (apart from summer league) once you listen to the album over again you just get immersed in each track and i love the way he used Seinfeld as the prelude to each song i believe wale wanted to let his music talk instead of being angry about being underrated.¬†<br>3. Kendrick Lamar (To pimp a butterfly) - What can i say artistically on the spot her from Kendrick although it is not every bodies cup of tea especially in this generation of turn up music but the messages on the album were impactful and hopefully will help move forward the culture. I commend kendrick for not sugar coating this album and its message with aloof beats but one thing i do want to say is this album is definitely not for the simple minded there are a lot of gems in this project (p.s. still prefer GKMC). ¬† ¬†¬†<br>4. Big Sean (Dark Sky Paradise) - This project was not as good as the other three however it definitely had some gems love the song research ft Ariana grande and the track produced by Kanye one man can change the world. This was by far Big Sean&#39;s best album he keeps getting better project after project.<br>5. Drake - (If your reading this its too late) - i wont bash this project too much because i struggle to even class it as an album this was clearly not drakes best work im sure he didn&#39;t pit much effort into this but considering that it wasn&#39;t too bad i liked some of the songs on this but its definitely his worst project so far. ¬†<br><br>Honourable mentions: Logic (Under Pressure), Action Bronson (Mr Wonderful), Joey Bada$$ (B4.DA.$$), Chris Brown&amp;Tyga (Fan Of A Fan the Album) and Kid Ink (Full Speed)¬†
Hang on, I gotta go get a beer for this!
For him to sound so extremely corny like the corniest most dry white guy not having flavor nor rhythm of any kind, this sure was a great review.¬† Just goes to show you, people make the world go round.¬† Dont think you can find a much better take on the album.¬† Bravo...its art and a masterpiece though still a bit explicit in this overly needlessly vulgar age.
Why didn&#39;t you mention &quot;How much a dollar cost&quot;? Or did I miss that? 
Goddamn...He REVIEWED this album. Lol.
how many times do you listen to an album before you review it?¬†
I first listened to the album and instantly hated it. After re-listening to it again I realized how wrong I was about it. You have to come at it with an open mind. Overall great album.
RTJ2 and TPAB are definitely the best hip hop albums of this decade so far. See kanye fans, MBDTF does not have shit on these albums
how are there not more comments about that GOAT cal moment
Fantastic album. Took me like several listens but I get it.
3rd verse on &quot;these walls&quot; is about the guy who killed his friend in &quot;sing about me&quot; on GKMC. I guess this is pay back
I&#39;m loving this album¬†
You should review Akala&#39;s new album
BooBoo!!!
I love hip hop I do I grew up on nas and tribe called quest but this album sucks 
I agree totally!!! Love the way YOU REVIEW EVERY ASPECT. Thank you
A damn great review!!!thank you for pointing out the things that I got out of the album! You now got a new fan of your reviews and your channel!! Stay up my man and thanks again!
he never reviewed another eternity I&#39;m so confused
Fantastic REVIEW!!!! I really enjoyed this, you have a great screen presence. You are extremely passionate and intelligent as well!
Without Flying Lotus, this album would be pedestrian at best<br>Edit:.. and thundercat
At the moment it seems VERY overhyped.While there are a couple fantastic tracks the pure hip hop/kendrick Lamar mix doesn&#39;t sound right.(At least to me)
wtf you diddnt even go after the &quot; for sale &quot; track in depth . Its about Kendrick being led in temptatition to sell his soul to Lucy ( Lucifer) . Lucy explains to Kendrick that she will give him all the earthly things that he desires. Then later ask if he will sign the contract. The contract is a known figure to represent the closing deal on your soul.¬†
U didn&#39;t do j cole album 
DESERVED this album blew me into the heavens
I can&#39;t help but to wonder what he has in store for the future
This album is just through and through amazing. totally worth noting as another piece of hiphop history.
Checkout my new music video!!! And subscribe to raystarkstv
#1 album , #2- forrest hill¬†
People saying that this is the best hip hop album of all time? Come on now... 
When shit hit the fan is you still a fan?
Why do Cal and Anthony look so similar?
Loved the review. Even if you forgot to name Lalah Hathaway as one of the guest appearance.
a te... &lt;ahem&gt; a ten? A TEN?! A TEEEEEEEEEEEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Thought this dude was Antony Davis rf
This album is brilliant. 
Dude...you&#39;re hilarious!
This dude is so corny and his face is so punchable.
Ohh please. Nas already did an album like this! &amp; Nas did it better. 
I have only gave the album one listen.¬† I really feel like hype and promotion also matter a lot when you speak of benchmarks in music.¬† Like Lupe Fiasco&#39;s Tetsuo &amp; Youth is a very experimental album.¬† Its very refreshing, lyrical, and is a very progressive kind of album that I think fans of the old 90s hip hop could still appreciate.¬† Personally I think these are the 2 best albums I have heard in a while, and I think I might like Lupe&#39;s a little more.
N....E....G..U..S
This movie is an innovative masterpiece that will definitely solidify Kendrick&#39;s place in the rap game, but this album is definitely getting more hype than it should. First off 50% of the people that listen to this album can&#39;t understand the true message in each song and the overall album, but those that don&#39;t understand just act like they understand that way they won&#39;t look like complete idiots. It&#39;s not just white people, it&#39;s also black people as well. You need to have good critical thinking skills, because you have to first keep up with Kendrick&#39;s semi-fast rapping and weird tone while breaking down and analyzing his lyrics. Now lets move to the 50% that can actually understand his album. Half the people that actually can understand his album actually don&#39;t think it&#39;s as good as they say because the individuals know if they don&#39;t claim it as good as every other person that rates it a 9 or 10 out of 10, people will think they can&#39;t truly appreciate music and will think they like contemporary rap instead of what they call &quot;true hip-hop.&quot; Some of the whites of the other remaining half feel as if they can&#39;t say they don&#39;t like the album because the individuals will look &quot;racist,&quot; because this album is just like New York Times said, &quot;At its best, it‚Äôs a howling work of black protest art on par with Amiri Baraka‚Äôs incendiary play &#39;Dutchman,&#39; or David Hammons‚Äôs moving decapitated hoodie &#39;In the Hood.&#39;&quot; Too many hypebeasts make this album hard to enjoy, but the Kendrick dick riders are even worse because it&#39;s either you think the album is good or you have a horrible taste in music. It&#39;s good to have a opinion about this album, but people really need to keep an open-mind while asseverating their opinions. Overall I do not like this album, but I feel as if it is an innovative unorthodox masterpiece. I can&#39;t adapt to the jazz influence beats, really not my cup of tea, not to mention I can&#39;t just casually listen to his album as a whole. I can jam to songs like King Kunta and alright, but for the most part not really. Everyone has their own opinion and I have come to accept that. It&#39;s all good. Too lazy to proof read so feel free to correct any grammar mistakes or spelling mistakes.¬†
Your reviews suck ass you overgrown cailou 
Kendrick is a hot raper, but you have to agree that you are a true fan :)
I like the album. I feel he was trying too hard to get a rolling stones cover with this one.
Sup bruh nice review, and on hood politics it&#39;s about him coming home and cruising in his hood remembering all the hood ways but knowing how childish those ways were that&#39;s why he made his voice kinda child like, like when he was a teen nd only wanted to rise in rank in a gang nd willing to do any thing even if that means killing another black man 
if you look up &quot;kendrick lamar&quot; on youtube this is like the 5th video that pops up
J. Cole should listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1156">19:16</a> when he&#39;s thinking about making his next album
This was ok. Not better than overly dedicated. Kendrick is ok. Not more lyrical than J. Cole
Is this his first 10?
After this review I like you again Anthony. Congratulations. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=720">12:00</a> Funniest part in the review.
Check out my beats I&#39;m broke as fuck
Kendrick Lamar killed the game. It&#39;s going to be extremly difficult to make a better rap album than this.
10!!!
I will begin by admitting that TPAB is a decidedly good album. However, I think most critic&#39;s claims for it being this incredibly innovative endeavour is largely due to Kendrick&#39;s immense popularity. Shabazz Palaces, to take but one recent example, are similarly &#39;innovative&#39; in their blending of jazz, funk, psychedelic soul and so forth. The primary difference is that Shabazz Palaces simply don&#39;t share the same level of public recognition that Kendrick enjoys. In my opinion, TPAB most closely resembles an album almost 17 years old now, namely Outkast&#39;s third full length release Aquemini (which, coincidentally, earned a rare 5 mics by a then still respectable Source magazine). Not to take anything away from Kendrick&#39;s achievement on this record, which is a prodigious one, I am just concerned that when &#39;mainstream&#39; artists do something outside of the mould, critics have a tendency to manifest amnesia and blinkered vision. Mr Fantano, though, is rarely if ever one of these, and his review of TPAB is well considered and justifiably adulatory.
Dr Dre the chronic in the background you smoke weed lol
Do you smoke weed? Cause I feel like people who love music like weed lol
i was kind of underwhelmed by this album. i liked his other one way more. oh well. i&#39;ll get use to it.¬†
gkmc&gt;section 80&gt;to pimp a butterfly&gt;overly dedicated
I think this album is trash, not because I like mainstream shit, but because I liked his k-dot west coast shit, I first heard him on the blackwallstreet mixtape and listened since then. I played the entire CD many times and I still can&#39;t like any of the songs. even section 80 was way better than this album im not feeling this soulful deep meaning rap hes doing
Are you gonna review Blur&#39;s The Magic Whip?
Yo for all the Kendrick fans if you stay in a fucked up neighborhood or fucked up city I just want you to listen to mortal man ending when he&#39;s reading the poem just go outside if you stay n newyork or a city like that just go on top of the building listening to the poem n look down on yo neighborhood Kendrick inspires n lets you know you have the power to change your neighborhood for the better must rappers know days talk about their neighborhoods but what are they really doing for there hood Kendrick is a powerful rapper n super inspirational PEACE 
Honestly I have a hard time saying anything is a 10 lol I even tried to nitpick on illmatic but easy ass 10 on this. The message, the delivery, the overall them and the way it all ties together is just flawless. Beautiful piece of work KDot
brick factory 3 more lyrical
I made a lil 25 sec freestyle I want opinions if I should start working on a full song or keep practicing ? Soundcloud.com/818818818 .. MAZEME
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMMMMGGGGGGGGGGG!!!!!!!!!! the best hip hop album in a while!!!! KENDRICK IS THE BEST OUT NOW!!!
I love the album. I haven&#39;t heard anything like this in a long time. For the ones that do say this album is trash well, some don&#39;t understand what art is like when it&#39;s put together. It&#39;s more than just a beat and a verse. This album was made to be heard. Something like a teaching for the one that&#39;s been threw it. But I look at it this was way. People just use to the &quot;Mixtape&quot; sound, with nothing but club bangers and shit put together.
This album&#39;s cool, socially aware, unique. ¬†But everytime I try to listen to it, i just go back to GKMC. ¬†This album&#39;s just not that listenable and it&#39;s annoying how much of it isn&#39;t actually music but just talking. It was really cool for a listen or two but I&#39;m already done with it. ¬†A classic album has to be something that people want to keep listening to over and over, and I just don&#39;t think this has that. ¬†
Tetsuo and Youth&gt; To Pimp A Butterfly
i previewed this album on iTunes and only like a few. Pretty much alright is my fave, I wanted to fully understand this album instead of pushing it to the side. This album actually ties together perfectly, I think more people should be open to TPAB even if its a different sound, it is more creative and shows a whole nother side of K
The kids who dislike this album are the idiots who have never listened to some classics such as nas, wu tang etc and hop on the b.i.g and pac were great bandwagon to fit in, when in reality they&#39;re listening to chief keef and gucci mane. 
Joey bada$$ and Kendrick Lamar has started this year on the right foot 
You gave this a 10/10 but fucking Knock Madness a 3/10...<br>Knock Madness and Raw both knock out To Pimp A Butterfly easily.<br>Quite obvious you&#39;re biased as to your music reviews, sad to see. /:
Why is everybody sleeping on How much a dollar cost probably my favorite song on the whole album
this nigga listened to the album one time and was like &quot;Its the best of the decade!!!&quot; stop jumping into conclusions and just let it sit for a while. shit.
For me, Section.80 is a 10, GKMC is a 8 and TPAB is a 9.
This entire LP is entry level poop.¬†
Most interesting/hopeful comment in this review IMHO is the suggestion that Kendrick (and or this album) could represent the turning of the page/final chapter of the many interactions of the bling era. One can only hope. Biggi, though perhaps unintentionally, ¬†is in part responsible for launching that godforsaken era. King Kendrick.
Agreed 
Bro good job, you did your homework on this one!
Cal chuchesta should do his own review.
<b>A 10! IT HAPPENED AAAAGHHHH</b> But seriously, when I get this album I&#39;ll jizz continuously for the full duration and get a TPAB printed pillow and sleep softly at night knowing that the sounds of it are gently swirling through my head as Kendrick visit me in my dreams.
Great review!
Perfect analysis. But you didn&#39;t mention the track &#39;home&#39; Kendrick means Africa not Compton 
I&#39;ve been wondering if anything would have been missed if &quot;i&quot; was just the single version with that cool a cappella verse played in the back end of it. Would that have messed with the message or vibe of what the album version had somehow? Maybe I should go back and listen to that single version, but I didn&#39;t really see all that much difference between them, even if the album version had a &quot;live&quot; feel to it.<br><br>-Great review, and a great album; I think it stands toe-to-toe with m.A.A.d city personally.
Top 5 Favourite tracks are <br>1.how much does a dollar cost <br>2.blacker the berry. <br>3.These walls <br>4.complexion <br>5.i<br>Although they&#39;re all great tracks with positive message. Thanks to Kendrick 
i&#39;m not saying this album is bad... like... i know its a good record. But i&#39;m just not quite into it... i believe it&#39;ll take some time for the record to grow on me. hell! it took me 2 years to enjoy Kendrick&#39;s M.A.A.D City. (don&#39;t ask me why because i know it was a crazy album)
Its like every song Kendrick has ever made is his life, and we get to see through his eyes and other people&#39;s. He keeps referencing old tracks, unreleased ones. It&#39;s amazing 
Goddamn you are an annoying hack
Thanks for the review!!!
I gotta give this album an 8.. <br>CONCEPT is genius and tying in the conversation at the end was great<br>LYRICALLY he&#39;s on point.<br>PRODUCTION is good however collectively it&#39;s not as dynamic in range and comes off a little lacking.  Though, when you make an album an artist tries to get it all in the same sonic &quot;ballpark&quot; for the setting of their story I was thinking about what makes an album a classic? I don&#39;t think he needs a &quot;banger&quot; but I just can&#39;t remember any classic albums that didn&#39;t have a perfect blend of singles and concept carriers.<br>To really appreciate this album you have to take your time and digest it... Good shit but 1 or 2 track transitions shy of a classic.
I completely disagree. <br>Maad city= 10/10 TPBF= 5/10 
The single &quot;i&quot; is not modern at all, it&#39;s a complete beat from That Lady by the Isley Brothers which came out in the 70&#39;s. lol
96 on Metacritic.üî• <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23kendrickislegendary">#KendrickIsLegendary</a>
AGREE AGREE AGREE! Great review, so well put.
First listen I didn&#39;t look too deep into the whole  album and after multiple listens I must say kendrick has proved that rap can be taken as a serious music genre 
ooowit ooowit!
Like They Gave Me Ready To Die! I&#39;ll Give Them To Pimp A Butterfly (&amp; Pinata)!
It was ok. The message was overbearing in my opinion. The music side was lacking 
Cole and Kendrick actually rap about shit that matter. Drake raps about bitches he make glances at when he&#39;s out in public, money, Toronto and impressing Wayne. Both those albums, especially this album right here nigga, this album right HERE nigga, shits on that Too Late mixtape and everything else except that Tetsuo &amp; Youth Album, B4DA$$ and I Don&#39;t Go Outside. 100/10. 
This album is truly genius. 
REVIEW THE NEW EARL ALBUM!!!
Top ten best rap albums of all time. 
TO PIMP A BUTTERFLY = A MASTERPIECE
i think the album sucks nothin in it is catchy the beats are crap and i dont remember a single verse from the whole thing. very disjointed in this album¬†
do you listen to mac miller the way you do kendrick?
Kendrick has to many bandwagon fans he&#39;s garbage  u can&#39;t tell me this is better in the decade than my twisted beautiful dark fantasy???for the decade
YEEAH!
YEEAH!
These beats are wack as fuck. 
I agree with the score but saying it&#39;s the best album in the last decade is kinda pushing it, I&#39;d say it&#39;s the 2nd or 3rd best album behind The Cool and Be and I will say that it&#39;s the greatest album in the last 5 years. Other than that Kendrick is slowly going up on the top 10 of all time list, if his next 2 albums are on the same level as Section 80, GKMC and TPAB then there&#39;s no doubt that he&#39;s one of the greatest.
I just want to know if you are usually under any form of influence when you listen to music. I appreciate how you explain layered structure unlike other yt reviewers.much love from Kenya.
This album is better lyrically and sonically, My Dark Twisted Fantasy had sometimes shit lyrics, decent instrumentals on some tracks but thats it and I think Anthony did very well reviewing that album.
 This guy&#39;s a fuckin nerd
Ever so often, the people select someone to be the best. Kendrick was just in the right place at the right time. Dont hate though. Tupac wasnt the greatest &quot;rapper&quot;, nor was jay z, nor was lil wayne, and nor is kendrick. The only person that could make thta list that coul be argued as the greatest rapper might be Eminem. But what Im trying to say is we chose them. Us. Because of who they are andhow much we like THEM. not how good of a rapper they are. Notice that people like Ghostface, Lupe, Jay Electronica, Doom, are nowhere to be found on the list. We didnt choose them. We like that kendrick is from compton and has all the right co signs and is pretty cool and down to earth person who rps about things we can relate to (who happens to be ok at rapping). Kendrick isnt the first person to make an album that sounds like this. However he did happen to make that song a while back calling everyone out. Building anticipation for this project. He made this album at the right time. The album is really good.¬†10/10? No. He didnt rap good enough.
LAYERED ONION
It&#39;s understandably if this album isn&#39;t your cup of tie, most mainstream arent ready for Kendrick lyrics and style either ways.¬†
I love that you made that comparison to Saul Williams. I felt that through a lot of this album.
meaning of the songs mean nothing to me if it sounds like shit.
This dude gave logic and j. Coles album 6&#39;s.... 
Love this CD!!! 10 Million thumbs up Kendrick!
this album is indeed a 10, yet for me it does not surpass my beautiful dark twisted fantasy. in my opinion still the greatest hip hop album of the last 10 years
lol such bs. he gave this a 10/10 but gave Neon Icon a 5... Ok...
Good review man 
Good rate 
Thank you for the thorough review Anthony!
He gave this a 10.... well I&#39;m done with this guy. We never have the same interests in music hahaha I&#39;ve listened to the album and by institutionalized, it had me hooked until the other part wasn&#39;t much. Lyric wise, it was good that he put thought in it, but it&#39;s really not enough to say it was &quot;the best of the decade.&quot; Compared to what comes on the radio sure, maybe that&#39;s what makes it look so good. 
Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaamn! You REALLY liked this shit, huh? Haha!
Great review!!10 nice this album is legendary!!
What&#39;s the point behind the random video cuts/distortions?
&quot;next level human being&quot;
I LITERALLY AGREE WITH 100% YOU SAID IN THIS REVIEW. I think this was your best review
You made me want to give the album another chance thank man
I like the fact You gave him (spoilers, stop reading if it&#39;s not too late) a 10.
Do John Robinson &amp; Chief - We the Prolific
I love it when me and Anthony agree 100% on something. This is one of those moments. To Pimp A Butterfly is a perfect package, nothing should be added and nothing should be removed. This is exactly what I wanted as a follow-up to Good Kid, Maad City. Two thumbs up.
i love the way Needle ¬†drop descirbes this album
I think this album is more catchy than GKMC.
my roomates and I listened to this entire album last night blazed i just sat back in my arm chair and visualized every track it was awesome!
Great review. I love the honesty in every album you review 
To pimp my butterfly was for black people. Period.
Just say he is the jesus of the rap game
I honestly think this album is the best hip-hop album of the 2010s. The instrumentals have such a funky and smooth vibe similar to J Dilla&#39;s or Madlib&#39;s. His stories and wordplay never fail to enlighten me :)
I hope dot works with Janelle Monae at some point.¬†
Kendrick blows (for the most part)! Stands by his revolutionary good instrumentals--not great.
YESSSSSSSS! 10!!
God damnit. I&#39;m lost in thought. 
Am I just that naive? Doesn&#39;t this album just perpetuate stereotypes? It seems like Kendrick attempted to present this as satire, but he failed. I&#39;m not trying to be a dick.  I really tried to like this.  Please explain.
I just don&#39;t get it.  I&#39;ve tired.  I have truly attempted to take an objective approach to this &quot;album&quot; and I don&#39;t understand. I would like to think that I listen to an incredibly diverse amount of genres, music that spans decades. I love experimental hip-hop, but this album SUCKS MY ASS. PLEASE,  SOMEONE EXPLAIN WHAT IS HAPPENING?!
This &gt; all that fake shit
First experience with this album was previewing it on itunes and honestly I was underwhelmed at first. The next day my internet went out so I decided to go out and purchase the album to give it a second chance. After listening to it in its entirety I can say with confidence this is one of the greatest hip hop albums I&#39;ve ever heard. In a day and age where releasing singles is most important to artists, its refreshing to hear an album with such a cohesive, overarching narrative while still being immensely enjoyable to listen to. I&#39;ts too bad so many young hip hop fans won&#39;t be able to appreciate this type of project.
Not to be a mad hater but im not feeling this album, comparing it to  &quot;good kid maad city&quot; and &quot;section.80&quot; i believe he could of done better 
My girlfriend thought I was going insane, thinking it was pac!
Most cohesive album of the 2000s
Next step Kendrick be on some Jimi Hendrix type shit¬†
The producer list on this album alone &gt;¬†<br><br>Next review suggestion - Courtney Barnett - Sometimes I Sit and Think, And Sometimes I Just Sit
Drop it.... drop every name you can come up with (lol)<br><br>NeedleDrop = = commentororhea....<br><br>Cuff you .... check out Kendrick on TIDAL...<br><br><br><br>i Love u.....<br><br>¬†¬†
I feel like everything he did on the album was amazing with the whole tupac and poem thing but the music aspects of it. 
Where&#39;s Mac Miller ?
Good kid mad city isn&#39;t going anywhere (...hence, it&#39;s called a record). Why would he produce the same record twice? Too many artists produce media to be consumed (i.e. drake, young thug, etc). Kendrick is creating art; it&#39;s his life&#39;s work. I know it&#39;s something people aren&#39;t used to, but it&#39;s the same reason why artists like MJ&#39;s music will live forever.
Your body is much fatter than your head belies
I don&#39;t know man, I&#39;ve felt every way possible about this album. For some reason there is only like 4 or 5 songs I really come back to. I just haven&#39;t fallen in love with a Kendrick album since Section.80 and it kind of sucks. It&#39;s nothing wrong with his messages or lyricism or anything like that. I guess the instrumentals and production just don&#39;t always do it for me. These Walls, Alright, How Much A dollar Cost, and Hood Politics are the only songs that truly caught me and I don&#39;t know why. But its only been 6-7 days I likely need to listen to it again. - Posted on March 26th<br><br><br>EDIT:<br>After repeated listens I like this album A Lot more. None of those songs I named are even close to my favorite song now. You ain&#39;t gotta lie is my favorite and I love mortal man too. I just needed to be in the right mood to fully enjoy this album which I wasn&#39;t when it was originally released.
I Didn&#39;t Really Like This Album At All Is That Wierd?
I listened to the album, wasn&#39;t really impressed all too much. I&#39;m more of a wordplay/bars kind of guy though and this didn&#39;t really seem to give me that. The whole album, to me, was pretty much all conscious raps with him speaking about the world.
For some reason, When I listen to this album I imagine a funkier, hip-hop version of a Birdman-like movie¬†where the tracks work as one long shot flowing into one another, I can&#39;t remember the last time I heard an album that flowed together so well.
Not feeling this album
Fantano laid his pimp down in this review. Bravo!
I loved this album. I haven&#39;t heard anything as impactful, interesting, and unique in a long time. It gave my goosebumps!
the ending was hilarious lls...come on come on
Subscription earned. 
The album was great in my opinion. It&#39;s very different with it&#39;s neo-soul vibe, but at the same time, the album was too overhyped. I would&#39;ve loved to see more Kdot. The only song he went Kdot in was the Blacker the Berry, and that was released way before the album.
Hi Anthony, Are you going to review any of the upcoming Grime albums when they are released? e.g. Skepta&#39;s and JME&#39;s. Great review btw :)
10!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! yes Kendrick Lamar killed it
&quot;Kendrick doesn&#39;t skimp on the music... If the music under your message is garbage, the music is garbage&quot;.<br><br>Well said, sir. Well said.
I agree 10
what a load of bullshit..
great great great album, love this
REVIEW THE NEW EARL PLEASE
Million dollar question: Does Lupe Fiasco or Kendrick Lamar deserve Rap album of the year so far?
10/10 are you serious this album was trash lol
&quot;To Pimp A Butterfly&quot; is a modern rap masterpiece. Rap and Hip Hop originally came into to the scene to tell a story, of not just the MC but of the MC&#39;s people and How To Pimp A Butterfly does that. Most albums are just individual singles, but like his previous album GKMC, Kendrick Lamar masterfully tells a story in his album. He doesn&#39;t really have individual songs that you can just hear on shuffle and go off on rather he has a body of work that must be played from the beginning to the end to really get it&#39;s value and that is my definition of a masterpiece. You&#39;ve seen this type of work on albums like Illmatic, Kendrick Lamar just produce the album of the year and years from now we will call it a classic.
IT&#39;S A 10
2pacs alive.
Overly dedicated : 8 <br>Section 80 : 9.1<br>GKMC : 9.6 <br>To pimp a butterfly : 9.8
&quot;whatever you do, just make sure you make something we can step to&quot;
I loved this album, it was fucking fantastic, but I have to agree that if any other artist would have made this record, you wouldn&#39;t have given it a 10/10.
can u pls review earl?<br>thanks.
Please, Review &quot;I Don&#39;t Like Shit, I Don&#39;t Go Outside&quot; By: Earl Sweatshirt
I think it&#39;s safe to say Kendrick is at 2Pacs and Biggies level after this release 
I cant handle how amazing this album is. I tried coming up with something original to say about this album, but its just...¬† soooo good
Amricans have sad taste in music if you say Kendricks shit doesnt at least make you think about shit then your just a sleeper cell waiting to be controlled like cattle. 
Unless you live in a relatively big city, you probably live in a ghost town. I mean, it&#39;s a very dense and populated ghost town. It&#39;s just that the people I find are either shopping or doing something only THEY want to do. That&#39;s Freedom, right? Why is our existence reliant on a screening process of self-value? As a result, you spend money to make money...and continue to exercise your status in all its simplicity. Culture&#39;s clash and all the good intentions they uniquely offer just seem to wash away in a flood of misunderstanding.¬† ¬† ¬†
I didn&#39;t like this album, but I&#39;ve never been a Kendrick fan. His music just sounds sloppy and noisy to me. His arrangement sounds all over the place. Musically the album just doesn&#39;t sound good to me. I think he&#39;s improved his flow since his last album but he still has a problem with just writing &#39;words&#39; not &#39;songs&#39;. I did find elements to like in just about all of the songs though. But overall, I&#39;m not a fan of Kendrick&#39;s lyrical style or diction. His flow is too messy and his lyrics aren&#39;t as deep as people act like that are. If you compare him to someone like Lupe Fiasco you can see what I mean, Lupe&#39;s cleaner flow, better song arrangement and deeper more versatile/complex lyrics are much more impressive than Kendricks. Similarly I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of J Cole&#39;s new album compared to his last 2, but it&#39;s undeniably more cohesive and sonically the songs just sound better more musical. While Kendrick has more words than Cole I don&#39;t necessarily think he&#39;s saying any more and Cole is smoother and his actual rhymes are smarter just in the way he puts his words together.
Bro take your &quot;The Chronic&quot; record off the shelf you don&#39;t need it to establish credibility to prove your point! Good commentary
This sounded like a roots album
It wasn&#39;t clicking at first, but I just got to Institutionalized. From there, the vibe started to kick in. Yeah, you just gotta soak it in...
Do a review on Tut&#39;s &quot;Preacher&#39;s son&quot;
the fuck was that at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=753">12:33</a>
I like that Kendrick was adventurous enough to create something truly unique and original. Everyone hating on this album only does so because it&#39;s not what they expected or are used to. Because it doesn&#39;t sound like what&#39;s trending right now. I.E. Drake &amp; big Sean. I&#39;ve been listening to this album on repeat like 10 times in a row and it only gets better. 
Review Earl Sweatshirt!
NAh yung thug the truth
I have that shirt. I hate it
If u don&#39;t like this album, u have bad music taste 
I don&#39;t hear &quot;Hey Ya&quot; on &quot;i&quot;, more like &quot;Wheelz Of Steel&quot; from ATLiens
YAAS
Kenthony Lamartano
It really bothers me how someone can take an album  whether they like it or not and make a negative statement about it and make it a racial thing about how a hood isn&#39;t hard anymore etc. I hate how this person thinks this is ok and any way shape or form. I don&#39;t understand why u must fight and argue and do things as such as expect things in the world to be any different then they already are but we can allow bigotry to stand and exist. Even from black ppl. It&#39;s an ugly trait to have sadly 
Kdots da best.........
¬†&quot;While this record has a few bones to pick...&quot; King Kunta
fuck all of these comments. And the groups of u ridiculously comparing this project to pop oriented shit like drake and jcole (not 2 diss them),but you guys sound strung out ob some fuckin type of dope. <br><br>all you seem to miss the perspective, kendrick has established himself successfully to this point in his career where the whole world kno, he&#39;s not fuckin lupe or nas kweli etc. u geek types cant wrap your mind around this, kdot is a compton, ca rap artist, first and last. the biggest intention us to hit his audience hard as fuck with his projects. <br><br>my eval of this album, i was hit hard as fuck after one listen. It was and remains very wierd, compelling may be the more political word. It was a rough in a p i sitive way kind of album, like fantano said it was like i can visualize throughout the entire tape what he is feeling or referring to. Its far from a political album so please kill that fuckin noise. that impact is a very good &amp; powerful, which gives this alot of replay value, which is good from a intellectual pov,<br><br>This album is not some appeal fest, its not designed to appeal to some music business oriented type of s. So fuck all your reviews an comments \ comparisons etc .. bullshit. K.dot has built the clout successfully to be the most dominant and capable rap artist you can turn to for anything. He already proven that and there nothing much left to prove there. Now its his duty to remain doing things that keep him powerful and respected, but not only that keep himself and the entire music \ rap audience interested in his projects. <br><br>Now im intrigued to listen for a number of replays of this project as well as im also intrigued about the future moves of k.dot tde shit. As for this album being a 10 of 10 , thats a broad one. And I say this was a facetious rating given by fantano, to make the point that he literally could not  find anything wrong with this album. It grips you, it doesnt sell you bs other rap is notorious for doing. A kind of perfectly imperfect thing may be what fantano is implying by his rating. But i could be wrong, that is irrelevant, take from this information what you wish.  
Do the new earl sweatshirt album
That laugh tho lol great review¬†
I love your videos. Also, I can see Digable Planets, Blow Out Comb peeking at us from your shelf, and that makes me happy.
Where&#39;s that earl review 
It&#39;s funny, every single thing that Kendrick talks about on this album, Kanye has already talked about at one point either in a full song or a couple lines, but Kanye has already said them. Too bad no one gives Kanye the recognition that he deserves.
I&#39;ve had a full week to listen to this album, and now I can honestly say it&#39;s the most incredible album I&#39;ve ever heard. Every single song is deep, introspective, and meaningful. There&#39;s not a single bad track on here. I can&#39;t even begin to wrap my head around what Kendrick is doing right now. He&#39;s on top of the rap world.
The fact this album has a concept makes it GREAT
Guys just face it. Kendrick is the king of hip hop. It&#39;s not arguable anymore.
In your review for &quot;i&quot; you pretty much didn&#39;t like anything about the song. Barely had anything positive to say. The review for that song alone came off as 6/10, but barely a day after the album leaks its given a 10/10? Seems like this album was gonna get a 10 no matter what. I&#39;ll have to give the album a few more spins before I make a full judgement. Four or five listens in,,,not really feeling it.
I just need Frank Ocean to drop his new album and i&#39;ll likely be set for the year . ¬†Good Kid and Channel Orange were all I listened to in 2013
This review reminds me of the jazz critics in the 1950-60s trying to explain John Coltrane.  Hip hop is the jazz of today - maybe!  Ya<br>Great review!
NUT HUGGER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
WoW. Well I haven&#39;t yet listened to the new Kendrick lamar album,  but I definitely will now, because I don&#39;t watch all ur reviews,  but I have watched many and I have never seen u give a 10. But I wanna request that u reviewe the Ces Cru album &quot;Codename Egostripper&quot; which dropped last year but its not that old so if u don&#39;t mind. But if not I wanna ask for a review on the new Earl Sweatshirt album &quot; I don&#39;t like shit  I don&#39;t go outside&quot; thanks Anthony
I think this album is a tad overrated
Liked the album. Wish there was atleast one banger on it tho.
yall be on kendrick dick heavy smh
Salute to theneedledrop¬†I respect this guy for giving a good listen and try to understands the artist&#39;s work and what they&#39;re trying to say. I mean yea this what he does for a living lol but a lot of people like to just say stupid shit like &quot;Kendrick is wack!&quot;....but never heard a single track from him. smh.
quite insightful nearly made me tear<br>you&#39;re awesome bro keeping doing you hehehehe
I have respect for kendrick lamar but THE ONLY tracks i really enjoy listening to is the blacker the berry and king kunta.
theneedledrop¬†When I actually listen to this album the way you&#39;ve convinced me I should, it better blow my mind.¬†
Kendrick&#39;s album was truly a masterpiece (imo at least) To Pimp a Butterfly easily exceeds any project this year so far and Kendrick isn&#39;t even my 1st favorite rapper. It&#39;s just that Hip Hop fans are generally unfamiliar with cats like Thundercat, Flying Lotus, Terrance Martin, Knxwledge and it&#39;s unconventional to be rappin over jazzy, having funk elements, and used emphasizing on spoken word in this &quot;Turn Up&quot; era so people tend to shit on the production efforts cause sadly Hip Hop fans are too accustomed to two sounds &quot;Real Hip Hop&quot; backpacker super lyrical miracle spiritual individual or &quot;Turnt Up&quot; lean sippin thot lovin shit. Time to create a shift and get outta of this prism, like Steez said in Killuminati &quot;It&#39;s a shift I know ya feel it man&quot; and that&#39;s what cats like Kendrick Lamar is doing.
It was aight, I&#39;d give it 6 out of 10.¬†
Great....I mean great review....everybody please watch his video on his favorite MF doom songs....needle drop doesn&#39;t disappoint...sometimes pretentious ...but always thoughtful well rounded reviews...I valued his opinions on his music....please keep posting your reviews Ant!!!!
&quot;requiring attention &quot; good point i never thought of that...that&#39;s why retards don&#39;t like it
You need more shirts
I will always like J.Cole way more than Kendrick he is way more genuine and real.
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=712">11:52</a>&quot;He&#39;s not delivering some kind of re-blogged, 140 character, bumper sticker philosophy.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m feeling a...&quot;<br>&quot;Caeemeen, caeemeen....&quot;<br>Lol this part had me rolling!!!<br>
Its alright but imo 2014 fhd got it cuz ¬†
I don&#39;t like shit I don&#39;t go outside: an album by Earl Sweatshirt üëç
I also disagree with it being like anything before 2010. We&#39;ve NEVER seen this before. Word play yes, but as a whole, no. Kdot is in another lane by himself. 
I enjoyed it for it&#39;s creativeness but nothing else 
&quot;the track [i] actually ended up winning Kendrick Lamar a few Grammy&#39;s, proving it&#39;s pop appeal.&quot; holy shit shots fired :O
What most you guys liked about it is the reason why I didn&#39;t like it so much. To me it lacked what makes hip hop enjoyable and that&#39;s a groove. It really really made me feel like I was watching a film. For majority of the time My head didn&#39;t knod and my feet nor hands tapped. Just like watching a movie romantic drama. The movie has your attention but isn&#39;t making your head knod or feet tap unless the have a movie seen. Hip hop or any music genre has never been about just lyrics. As a fan of slick rick, ice cube and nas, just to name a few, they gave you a story over a catchy, dope or groovy beat. He had a few but..... 
Coffee Anthony I love Coffee. U like Coffee Anthony?
Great breakdown bro.¬† Just subscribed to your videos.¬† Keep it up!¬† Loved Kendrick&#39;s album.
This album is the change I&#39;ve been waiting for in hip hop I&#39;ve been tired of niggas giving these dumb hollow messages with stupid catchy crap lines. This is real music you can hear it in the words and in the instruments that Lamar uses and the brilliant re introduction to funk music and what I find to be old school rock beats like at the end with the discussion with tupac üëåüëåüëåüëå my album of the year 
Anthony. The Bling Chapter will never be over. Just look at the comments.
10
Kendrick topped Kanye. This album is 10x more original than Yeezus. Viewing this album through the lens of rap music, it is clearly a 10 -- everything aligns: time period, lyrics, beats, etc. Musically, I&#39;d give it a 9 w/ the potential to move to 10 if it remains timeless (I&#39;m sure it will).
The Mount Rushmore of Hip-Hop albums: Illmatic, Aquemini, MBDTF, To Pimp a Butterfly
I&#39;m going on every video saying this...To Pimp A Butterfly is the Aquemini of our generation. People, if you haven&#39;t heard Aquemini, you need to listen to it. I feel it&#39;s effect on music is really underrated by the general public. Masterpiece. People who have heard it, I&#39;m sure you can hear the similarities between the two albums.¬†
Ok guys, we all know &quot;u&quot; is the best song on the entire album.
I&#39;ve tried some hip hop and rap based on your recommendations... I just think I&#39;m never really going to be into those styles of music. Oh well to each their own
My ONLY gripe with the album is that the &quot;Untitled&quot; song from the Colbert Report show didn&#39;t make it the cut. At least release a studio version
Dat wah bass on Wesley&#39;s Theory doe.... Thundercat does it again!¬†
Great review Anthony! You are definitely worth your salt bro.
King Kunta is catchy as fuck
&quot; So, get off that...&quot; LOL
We&#39;ll said 
This album made me quit rapping. I was embarrassed. All rappers should be embarrassed. Set the bar higher or fuck off.
He got 2 classic albums under his belt. Wait till 10 years and y&#39;all niggas gonna be sayin&#39; how he fell off and how he&#39;s whack. Just like those hipsters who call Eminem and Jay z wack.
2014 Forrest Hills Drive or To Pimp A Butterfly¬†? FUCK IT TO PIMP A BUTTERFLY AT 2014 FORREST HILLS DRIVE!!!!!
What is that thing Anthony does with his name in the beginning of a lot of his videos? I never understood it.
Really hard to sit through this... it sounds like some kind Outkast knockoff to be completely honest.. in my personal opinion Kendrick is highly overrated! And that&#39;s from a neutral point of view. 
4 AM. How do you last that long, Anthony :D ?
I swear to god I was Cal at the end of the video.
These people who do reviews think for you cuz you can&#39;t think for yourself. If you like it, you like it. If you don&#39;t, then you don&#39;t. Simple as that. I thought this album was cool but use your brain and feelings to make your own decision. Cool video
The best album since My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, this shit is insane.
Great fucking album, I was super blown away
If you think this albums better than good kid maad city, you need to re-listen to gkmd, or see a dr to get your taste in hip-hop inspected 
Anthony u have to do Earl sweatshirts new album! Also action Bronson&#39;s maybe if u have time.
AWESOME! I could totally see you with a Patreon account! People love you! They would probably show you if you asked them to! &lt;3
Fuck yeah a ten that&#39;s what&#39;s up! 
Dont wanna sound negative but quite frankly this is the shittiest album by kendrick lamar and i didnt expecr it to be this bad, ive listened to the entire album 5 times and i dont like the whole jazzy hipster type shit he pulls on some of his songs,  i only liked about 3 songs and im pretty dissapointed. 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=655">10:55</a> KING KUNTA REFERENCE
I find it weird to call Kendrick &quot;King Kendrick&quot; because I don&#39;t find that he wants to be king.  I feel he wants to change people or at least give them a new point of view.  It&#39;s not King it&#39;s Priest.  A man that listens to your woes and gives you something to think about.  Not forceful, but there when you need him.  A MESSENGER not a ruler.
POME
Do earl sweatshirts new album please!
Dude please review Mt upcomin √°lbum please Ik u would like it 
I&#39;ve Only Heard &quot;i&quot; The Single, But &amp; I&#39;ma Buy The Album Based On Your Review! &amp; Here, We, Go!
why did he not make a huge deal out of giving a 10? i don&#39;t think ive ever seen him give a 10
I love how Kendrick&#39;s albums  makes a story and they all are parts of a puzzle and each song really makes a lot of sense after you listen to them in order 
Black people please remember how much whites hate you
Sorry I just recently rediscovered your channel I noticed this was rated 10/10 when I used to watch all your videos you never gave an album a 10/10 so I was just wondering what was the first album you have a 10/10
Yo, this is going to be the BEST album interview for this album period. This im sure of. Love the way you review, got a new fan bruh.¬†
Section 80: 8.9/10<br>GKMC: 10/10<br>Too pimp a butterfly 10/10
you look like a bumblebee but you&#39;re right
You gonna do a review on Earls new album orrrr?
overrated
Amazing review! 
What bout &quot;Overly Dedicated&quot; that was one of his albums 
Please review the new Lupe Fiasco album i know it&#39;s been out for a while
wasn&#39;t feeling it. GKMC i listened to it at least a dozen or so times back to back, this one, i barely got through the first playthrough and haven&#39;t listened to it in days..
do earl&#39;s new album
It&#39;s a great album...different from g.o.o.d kid MAAD city
review I Don&#39;t Like S**t, I Don&#39;t Go Outside: An Album by Earl Sweatshirt
Best hip-hop record I&#39;ve heard this year
This Dick Ain&#39;t Freeeeeeeeeee!!!üòÇ
a ten? what? did it finally happen?
you didn&#39;t ¬†talk about the best track on the album! How much a dollar cost
Its whatever
honestly the album didnt do it for me. I considered and maybe still consider kendrick to be my favorite hip hop artist. i understand the lyrics are deep and he was trying to present a message with these soul tones but at the end of the day i need to have those lyrics playing in my head over and over again to make me want to listen to the tracks again and it just didnt happen. It was raunchy and kinda made me want to put some ear plugs in listening to songs like king kunta. I pre ordered the album and honestly i was disappointed
This is a very unique album it deserves 10/10
this rate is publicity stunt
Pretty accurate review. I&#39;ve only listened to it twice but it&#39;s definitely better than his last album.¬†
This albums message and production is a good as hell gave me a ear orgasim especially Wesleys Theory. I still like GKMC more than this album doe. This album is gonna go up their as a top 10 next to Illmatic, MMLP, College Dropout, and MBDTF.¬†
thank you for understanding this albums beauty
pls do a review on earl&#39;s new album
interesting review.
I&#39;m about to drop a bombshell here it goes.....  <br>The reason 90% of the ppl who don&#39;t like the album, dislike it because king k dot doesn&#39;t talk about weed and so when they go on instagram they don&#39;t have a pimp a butterfly weed quote to put next to they&#39;re blunt picture because that&#39;s what my generation does they go on instagram than post weed pics all day with gay quotes.
Lol am I the only one that wonders what this dudes iPod library look like?? Like damn, needle drop is the single most knowledgable person on the subject of Music of all genres that I&#39;ve ever hear of! Good for you man, we can defiantly tell what your passion is. Much Respect!
Kendrick king 
Not trying to be a dickrider or anything but on Under Pressure by Logic, he merely mentions that Logic basically explains his childhood up to his rise to fame, but when Kendrick does it on Good Kid Mad City he goes insane about it. Not taking anything away from this album because it is amazing, but its kind of funny that most people that see Logic as an average rapper also see Kendrick as a God.
I wonder, is this like your most viewed video ever?
you tend to think kendrick is so creative with his projects... bino has thrown in screenplays, poems, 2 sided tapes and straight up nailed the idea of a &quot;theme&quot; with 2011 camp. i loved the kendrick album... im not getting the hype on how game changing creative he is with his hidden poems lol
Review The New Earl Sweatshirt- IDLSIDGO
i love this album! kendrick has really come a long way! he hasnt had a poor project so far all the way from overly dedicated to to pimp a butterfly, ive loved watching/hearing his progression &amp; growth
I think the album is bad and the only reason people like it is because he&#39;s just talking about politics, everyone who likes the album only says so because of the content and doesn&#39;t say anything about the actual sound.
Hell tuh the muaffuccn yeah woooow...the gaul of kendrick this kid aint scared of shit...God&#39;s. Gift of. Interpretation..
&quot;If the music under your message is bad, your music is bad&quot;¬†<br>Well sad, thats why this album ¬†is a 0/10
Wow, thank you for this review- I <b>really</b> want to listen to this album now.
Lmao you said you didn&#39;t like MBDTF and rated it a 6 because you didn&#39;t care about Kanye&#39;s story. But you dickride Kendrick&#39;s stories. Smh then you rate this a 10/10? This shit is going to be forgotten in 2 months. 
You better review Mr. Wonderful before Friday Anthony. 
This album is no where near a 10. At best this album is a 6.5.   
Your vocabulary is so on point! üëèüëèüëèüëè
Kendrick Lamar did his thing
I&#39;m so basic :D.
it finally happened guys a 10¬†
People hate on Kendrick just to hate, but it&#39;s hard when there is so little to hate.
D&#39;angelo 9 and kendrick 10?<br>I don&#39;t get it....black messiah it&#39;s perfect
do a review on earl sweatshirts new album
I think this album is borderline alright and thats just because the blacker the berry was on it (which I think is a dope track). Other than that, I didn&#39;t feel the album at all. Alright and These Walls are both decent, but the others I didn&#39;t like. The beat is half the track and if I don&#39;t like the beat I can&#39;t even rate the track as alright as it would be pretty much unlistenable. He shouldn&#39;t have put so many neo soul, funky beats on the album and I think he ruined it by doing that.
To Pimp A Butterfly<br>2PAB<br>2PAC---&gt;2PAB<br>C---&gt;B<br>Caterpillar--&gt;ButterflyÔªø
His last album was better but this album was like a movement like a jazz theme 
I now this album been out for a while but can you please review the new Lupe Fiasco album 
Kendrick&gt;Every other rapper...right now.
He&#39;s so on-point with this review!!!
A lot of people from my high school hate this album. They don&#39;t care about the message, it makes me sad. 
Dre day in the corner......
Great review.  I haven&#39;t been this taken aback by or gotten something new out of each listen of a hip-hop album in a very long time. Kendrick just delivered a dissertation that pushes the field of hip-hop forward. I think this album will turn out to be the hip-hop equivalent of what &quot;On Computable Numbers&quot; by Alan Turing was to computer science and mathematics. Like Turing&#39;s approach to mathematics, Kendricks approach to hip-hop builds upon, but is distinctly different than, his peers and contemporaries. Like Turing&#39;s paper, it was not immediately accepted by everyone, and its full influence was not understood or imagined when it was released. Most rappers these days with the preoccupation with whips and clothes are playing with Lego sets portraying fake constructed realities; Kendrick is designing rocket ships and taking us to new places and allowing us the perspective to think about important issues from a different and nuanced perspective.
have you ever thought about doing album interpretation videos along with your album review videos? i like hearing about how you interpret music as well as what you think about it
You should review Mod Sun&#39;s album Look Up
The song &quot;u&quot; is dope
The greatest album of the decade
Review Action Bronson&#39;s &quot;Mr. Wonderful&quot; and Earl Sweatshirts &quot;I don&#39;t like shit, I don&#39;t go outside&quot;
It&#39;s definitely a concept album, and will be enjoyed best if the whole album is listened to from beginning to end. It&#39;s not an album where you can just choose and pick tracks.
I think Anthony wept after this album.
Thank you Anthony
A fucking 10?
YES.
anyone who doesnt like the sound of this album should really venture out in music and grow some taste<br><br>anyone who doesnt get or like the message of the album should quit being retarded and educate theirselves
I suggest listening to this album at least twice. The second time is a lot better.<br>Great album :D
As much as i loved GKMC i have come to realise the best art always takes time to digest and appreciate, i didnt fall for TPAB at first but the lyrical content is genius plus the album is really sinking in now, for all yall that are quick to judge , let it spin a few more times and pay more attention.¬†
favorite instrumental: how much a dollar cost<br>favorite meaning: mortal man (first half)
check out the committee for south african solidarity if you go to berkeley, CA
section.80: novel<br>good kid, m.A.A.d city: film<br>to pimp a butterfly: play? (with backing jazz orchestra?)
This album  is a disappointment and I&#39;m a huge fan of Kendrick like wtf. Anything  to win a Grammy right?
why dont you like dizzy?
i hate you
&quot;And to those people I say, &#39;Go listen to an album before 2010&#39;&quot;<br><br>I&#39;m surprised that there isn&#39;t some long comment ripping Fantano apart here with the argument that they&#39;ve listened to all the albums before 2010 and still didn&#39;t like this album. Myself, I thoroughly enjoyed this album and haven&#39;t stopped listening to it.
Album was disappointing
man Needle is really huggin Kendrick&#39;s nutz on this review. A ten!!! come on now. His &#39;hip hop&#39; flow is like Nelly, he kinda moans and sings his way thru verses let alone thru choruses. Just because Kendrick would appear more skilled than Lil Wayne or Drake doesn&#39;t make him the real deal. He is totally in the commercial rap soft production world. Hip hop now¬†has numerous artists that are staying tru to the culture with producers Statik, Apollo Brown, Madlib and Alchemist. Sorry, but Kendrick is watering down the culture and his sing song style over easy beats ain&#39;t hip hop. sooooo played out
Anthony Fantano, the Internets business nuthugger.
WOW! A 10
I love this album but damn everyone in these comments acting like they genius ass poet niggas just cause they like this album. not everyone&#39;s gonna like the album, don&#39;t act like you&#39;re some kind of fucking messiah just cause you understand the meaning of it.<br><br>
this album is getting great ratings from white reviewers because of white guilt.¬† this shit sucks.
For once I actually have no arguments with one of your reviews! But you left off one of of the best songs on the album period, How Much a Dollar Cost! The story telling in that song was truly amazing.¬†
I agree. 10 is an appropriate score for this masterpiece. I LOVE &quot;Alright&quot;. The poems and how they tie the album together is marvelous. I can see how someone might not be able to digest the complexity of this album though. As for me - this is the best album I heard in a long time. I&#39;d put this up against any so called hip hop classic album. 
EVERYBODY BETTER FUCKING REMEMBER. THIS IS ABOUT BRINGING BACK BLACK SOUL CULTURE. BEFORE 808&#39;s AND GANGSTA RAP, THERE WERE REAL INSTRUMENTS WITH REAL SOUL. THAT, IS ORIGINAL HIP HOP.¬†<br>GANGSTA RAP<br>CAME SECONDDDDDDDDDDDD.¬†<br>EVERYBODY PLEASE REMEMBER THAT. WE OUT HERE IN THIS MUSIC FOR MORE THAN THE MUSIC, ITS ALWAYS BEEN DEEPER THAN THAT.
oh how beautiful.
I&#39;ve been telling everyone who &quot;hated it&quot; that they need to just open their ears and quit thinking that all rap is, is fucking hype music. This album was fucking beautiful. B-E-A-UTIFUL. The music was so illustrious and the overall message was the best thing that I&#39;ve heard in rap since forever! Quit being ignorant and treat the music like it should be: As a fine piece of art! This is the only review of Anthony&#39;s of which I agree with 100%
If Kanye can experiment, so can Kendrick. 10/10 well deserve 
Is this the new school &quot;Nation Of Millions&quot;?
I don&#39;t understand why people even have an opinion on this album. It&#39;s just masterpiece. Period. You can&#39;t have an opinion on this. You lose. 
I love you
Thank you for that really in depth review! Good points, good perspective. There are a lot of thing I did not noticed. Booyah!
Best Hip Hop album of the decade in my opinion. 
dead at &quot;bam&quot;
I was very surprised that he gave it a ten. Is this your first ten? Cause I haven&#39;t seen every review.
Snoop said in his show he wishes he wrote Slick Rick&#39;s Children story that&#39;s pretty funny.
I&#39;ve gave it several listens so far and don&#39;t get the vibes like GKMC and that&#39;s the greatest album!
For all the Kanye West or MBDTF........Killah Priest - The Psychic World of Walter Reed &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; MBDTF......Come at me Trolls !!!!   
Wow good reveiw !!!!!
Kendrick Lamar was interviewed before the release of &quot;To Pimp a Butterfly&quot; about his single &quot;i&quot;, he was asked how he feels about others thinking oddly about the single for sounding so different. He says that referencing off his older work doesn&#39;t allow for creativity. He says that creativity may only be appreciated with an open mind. Nothing should be expected from this album, he says. It&#39;s a waste of time listening to this album if there are expectations.
Couldn&#39;t have explained it any better 
Cmon you really have this a 6
I don&#39;t get all of the hate for this review. Fantano is seriously dedicated to what he does, on Instagram he posted 10+ pages of writing he prepared for this review. To say that he is pandering to get more fans or jumping on the bandwagon is just stupid.
Kendrick shitted on j cole, or  well every rapper really except joey badass 
so...get off that. hilarious
Review mr. Wonderful 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT EARLS NEW ALBUM??????
i dont like shit i dont go outside review it pleaseeeeee theneedledrop
I did a fucking backflip when i heard the Killer Mike line.
Are you going to do a review on Earls new album? It&#39;s awesome
Who&#39;s Lucy?
So far after a listen through this feels like listening through and then you shoot your cousin by The Roots, in the way that you dont get a large quantity of lyrics on every track and get more music. To me i see thus as musicians ft kendrick. Does he make the music/? Or does he just rap?
I had to listen to this album 4 times consecutively to really understand its message. And I&#39;ve only done that with a few albums (My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, Illmatic, The Chronic, The Low End Theory, All Eyez on Me and Tetsuo &amp; Youth) <br><br>You don&#39;t really have to do that with any Drake(obviously) or J.Cole album. Ands that&#39;s what makes him better than them. He has a complex message that requires you to think. Don&#39;t get me wrong I love Drake, Kanye, J.Cole, old Jay Z etc. But kendrick right now is on a whole other level. <br><br><br>Also people really need to listen to Lupe, not as mainstream as them, but his lyricism and metaphors are some of the best of all time. He might be the best lyricist of all time.

THIS needs to be a 10 and @ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1319">21:59</a>-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1325">22:05</a> my exact reaction to him saying it gets a 10
This is the first Anthony Fantano 10/10 that I as well believe is a 10/10.¬† The Money Store and To Be Kind are¬†amazing albums but not true 10/10s, not for me at least.
I give Cal Chuchesta&#39;s dance at the end a light 10. 
LMAO &quot;its really a mind fuck moment&quot; Because 1 liner ever!
...But Tetsuo and Youth is still the Album of the Year
Am I the only one who really disliked this album sonically? To me the up-beat jazz/funk influence just sounds... not right for him. Like, I love the lyrics and development of Kendrick as a person but... It just sounds like WATER DOWN funk to me, am I the only one?
Yeezus def didn&#39;t change the game even though it was a good album it was Kanye&#39;s worst album....College Dropout ten million times better....the ppl that hate kendrick album like to lick the white man pink dick gay as boys 
For all of the shit I give you, we at least agree that Kendrick is awesome.
Damn Fantano you&#39;re droppin&#39; tens faster than pitchfork.
Death Grips roolz 
I&#39;m just going to say ... If you didn&#39;t like this album... Put on your hoods because you&#39;re a racist your not fooling anybody!
Did anyone else hear a lot of Robert Glasper&#39;s &#39;Black Radio&#39; on this album? Especially Institutionalized and How Much a Dollar Cost 
People , people , people.....music is SUBJECTIVE.  Im seeing people say the album is trash, amazing,  terrible,  GOAT, overrated. .........its all opinion.  But what I will say it I personally really enjoyed it. I would&#39;ve liked to see kendrick to dish out more serious verses like his last one in mortal man but I liked the funk and jazz tone if the album and to me it was a great listen and had good replay value. What I dont like is that people who are fans of the album are getting called d*ckriders.  Why? Because they enjoy yhe music? Thats stupid. To me....its an 8.5 to a 9/10. Great album by Kendrick Lamar. 
My soul was cleansed when I first listen to this album. Now, I feel enlightened every time I listen to the album.¬†<br>It&#39;s the best album of the year. This year had its runner ups. But King Kunta came through to take the crown once again.¬†
i bought this album, dope dope dope this album had the same feel as the black messiah by D angelo.¬†
Very well observed and carefully explained with details review. I love it :) I gave the album a quick listen before work few days ago, wasn&#39;t impressed because it was just a a quick spin, but now since this is the firs review EVER Anthony gave a 10 , I&#39;m gonna take a better listen :) I&#39;m no easily influenced by other people opinions, but in this case I think it&#39;s a plus !
Great review, could you please review The Day Is My Enemy by The Prodigy when it&#39;s released on the 27th?. I&#39;ve just heard the leaked album and it&#39;s amazing
Alright is my favourite song on it 
This album is probably my favorite and the best album Kendrick has made. People give it so much hate because it&#39;s not the hardcore rap that they&#39;re use to hearing in songs like, control, backseat freestyle, maad city. The tracks in tpab have a lot of influence from his Chicago background, for example, Real has that Chicago dance music vibe and it&#39;s more relaxed, yet it still tells an excellent point. That&#39;s what people can&#39;t appreciate out of this album, the more laid back sounds combined with deeper lyrics. It&#39;s the influence from jazz and funk that really makes the lyrics and this entire album shine.
Spot on with the review...¬†
daaaaaamn he really threw out the 10 tho O.o
It&#39;s good lyrically, but the instrumental make my ears bleed on all but 3 songs. I wouldn&#39;t give this a 10/10. I wouldn&#39;t even give this a 6/10.
What are the other two album he gives 10&#39;s on?
This is more of a soul album I fuck wit his old Compton shit
Earl Sweatshirt review plz
Great Review, you really hit all the points/thoughts I felt on the album as well.
10???? What the hell....
This album is trash yo yall gotta get off kendricks dick he literally make a album saying no words just sounds and his fans will call it the greatest hip hop is dead 
Review I don&#39;t like shit, I don&#39;t go outside
I love the album, it goes much deeper then most artists today are even capable of going. The message of the album is huge and the way he put together each track was fantastic. The only thing is that there aren&#39;t many tracks you can listen to by themself, to really enjoy each song you have to listen from beginning to end. Other then that A+!
the album is great yada yada yada, yeah I agree, i really do. but it has NO replay value, with the exception of like 3 or 4 songs.¬†
Eh this albums aight, couple of good instrumentals tho. 7/10 for me but come on anthony 10/10? come on son lol lets come home.
This guy looks fucking confused
it flopped good kid was a one off people,
review I dont like shit i dont go out side
This album was so goofy yo... too jazzy for me, my paw paw digs it tho.
I don&#39;t like shit, I don&#39;t go outside <br>Earl Sweatshirt<br>
Although I don&#39;t think it&#39;s better then GKMC, I think it was still very solid.  I feel like this album is meant to be listened through all at once as if it we&#39;re a movie instead of a couple of tracks here and there.
yes finally
Section 80-slim shady lp<br>Good kid maad city-marshall mathers lp<br>To pimp a butterfly-the eminem show<br>?
Anyone wanna suggest the best songs off the album? (Besides i and blacker the berry).
This album is one that is very polarizing. You either love it or hate it. That&#39;s what happens when you bring out pure art. I truly believe Kendrick poured out his emotions into this album and did not care less about what the majority&#39;s opinion will be. Kendrick paints a picture in such a way that makes it seem like you&#39;re there with him experiencing his dark, desolate moments and at the same time realizing that there is hope. Beautiful album! 
this album is a game changer
YOU GAVE A HIP HOP ALBUM A 10!!! OH HAPPY DAYS!
this is probably your best review!
ALBUM OF THE YEAR!!!
Still waiting on the jmsn album review... Smh
Some people are to close minded for this album. I give this album a 9 from lack of raw hits like GKMC. Also it is less accessible. To me its a masterpiece but I can see where its not for everyone.
This gets a lot better after like 5 listens. I liked it the first time, but i like it a lot more now that I understand each song.
pimp to the butterfly?
It&#39;s 4 AM.. It&#39;s 4 AM... Hail Mary Mallon..??
Brilliant review theneedledrop üëèüëè
This is the greatest Hip-Hop record since &quot;good kid, m.A.A.d city&quot; people.üòä‚úå
any chance you could review Earl Sweatshirts newest release. Definately a step foward past the previous OF releases
Excellent review. 
To pimp a butterfly reminds me of Lupes Testou &amp; Youth. Anyone else feels the same? I know Lupe&#39;s intention is to aim that album at every minority race and Kendrick to mostly black people.

Plz review earl&#39;s new album
Great album. And a great passionate review on an album worthy of one. Good shit.
Kendrick Lamar is the most wack ass rap ever, including biggie and tupac. They all fucking suck
there you go guys, the 10 you&#39;ve all been waiting for ¬†!! ¬†:)
Damn! He got 3 albums in a row that just are all ridiculously well crafted.¬†
will you be reviewing i don&#39;t like shit i don&#39;t go outside?
Good work. Not all cute and candy. Something to actually listen to and appreciate.
I think this is the 1st album review I&#39;ve seen, he didn&#39;t have something bad to say. Wow. Great review. Such a beautiful album.
Kendricks best album and the best album of the year, probably with no contest. This album is important and brilliantly painted. The beauty in the thematic construct tying every track together can not be overstated. If you don&#39;t like this album then you don&#39;t &quot;get&quot; this album and if you hate on Kendrick for moving forward, then you don&#39;t &quot;get&quot; culture--especially that of the 21st century. 11/10.¬†
What exactly qualifies this man to be a critic of rap?
is this fantano&#39;s first 10/10?
i didnt rly think that Kendrick was talking about himself in You Ain&#39;t Gotta Lie I just thought he was talking about someone trying to be down not being himself period. Who is he trying to impress during the chorus part then? I don&#39;t think he would have anything to prove to the homies back at Compton....
review gucci mane new mixtraps breakfest lunch and dinner each are different mixtapes
Reading this video&#39;s comment section gave everyone within a 100km radius of me terminal cancer.¬†
Since Lamar and Marina and the Diamonds&#39; album were released the same day, maybe you could review FROOT?
Outkast Lamar¬†
Listening to &quot;These Walls&quot;, smh at people who complain about the instrumentals.
YESSSSSSSSS THE BLACK MAN PREVAILS WITH A 10
Kendrick Lamar did his thing on this album. Kendrick Lamar brought back the 90&#39;s rap with the Wu Tang style of and Nas flow on this album having boldness not being afraid to speak out against problems.
Section 80 = the perfect essay regarding children growing up in the 80s era.<br>Good Kidd Maad City = the perfect cinematic album<br>To Pimp A Butterfly = the perfect African American novel (reminiscent of Toni Morrison)
I laughed so hard when he gave his ratings. Hilarious. 
lol didnt say no no no on this.
To summarize this video, To Pimp A Butterfly is a masterpiece.
To kill a mockingbird!
A sea of idiots commenting. This album is the most important thing musically AT LEAST for people today. I&#39;ve been a fan of this music thing for years. And I&#39;m gonna agree with the others who said this is the greatest rap album of all time. Before the &#39;hip hop heads&#39; start bashing. Know that I&#39;m well versed in this shit and if u dare name predictable rap albums u THINK fit that top spot.. Know that I&#39;ve thought long and hard about it too. And WITHOUT bias im giving it to this album. It is the most musically, lyrically, emotionally, and spiritually balanced rap album ever made. Period. Kendricks got it and it&#39;s only gonna get better I know it. 
Great in depth review
YAAAAAAAAAAASSSS BISH YAAAAAAAAAAASSSS!!!!!!!!! <br>THE RATING!!!!!!!!!! 
10 NO WAY HOLY FUCK IT HAPPENED
This album has been co-signed, and praised in the last few days by even underground rappers like Killer Mike, Chuck D, Talib Kweli, Murs, Atmosphere, Questlove, Cunninglyguist, Pharoahe Monch, Brother Ali, Common, Phonte, Blu, and Pete Rock.<br><br>You know it&#39;s THAT good!!!
Loved the album, but I am a big FlyLo, Terrace Martin, and Thundercat fan. The sound was great. 
The more i listen to it the more i like it, im starting to songs i was kinda iffy about i think ders only 2 songs i think are decent the rest are classics in my mind
You aint gotta lie is a dope ass song how can you not like it?!?!?!
Flying lotus&#39; YOU&#39;RE DEAD! VS. TPAB annd.... GO!
Anyone who says hip hop is dead is straight ignorant!! The artists we have nowadays are some of the most talented of all hip-hop time... we have kendrick, tech n9ne, hopsin, flatbush zombies etc. hip hop is amazing
Haven&#39;t been patient enough to listen tbh...I&#39;ll probably come around to it, as usual.
Great review.. I was hoping you would briefly explain who you think the character Lucy is in this album? 
YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO LOVE THIS ALBUM THIS IS WHAT MUSIC IS REALLY MISSING
finally a reviewer with a high rap iq.... thank you
<b>sigh</b> all these Peter Rosenberg type fans who think the album is heaven sent.
Great review 
great deconstruction of the album.¬†

OOHHH MY FUCKING GOD A 10
Anthony... ¬†I&#39;m a huge fan of your reviews, I don&#39;t think I&#39;m ready to hear your verdict and interpretation yet. ¬†I think you are able to do an amazing job breaking down the message of an album and a song to a tee, but I think I need to rock with this album a bit more and gather my own thoughts before I hop on this review. ¬†I can&#39;t wait to finish watching this one, but I gotta finish dissecting and loving the hell out of this album first.¬†<br><br>I feel like your review would be like reading the strategy guide of a video game, I need to experience the challenge first :)
Just listened to the album track to track and it was dope. So good!!!! K Dot KILLED IT
awful, just awful, I heard the first track and it said &quot;every nigga is a star&quot; not uh theres niggas out here not gettin they money. and i was like wtf shut da fuck up harriet tubman for free. damn dan dat boo boo song man wtf we call our bitches shawty kendrick a shitlock having fuckboy. i listen to g unit
Why did you never review Circa Survive Descensus? It was relatively big.
The thing that bothers me about Kendrick Lamar is his flow. Don&#39;t get me wrong I think it is great and unique but after four songs it gets tiring. Especially in this album, he never pauses , it is as if his sentences have no full stops. It just drags on and on and on , to the point that I can&#39;t stand anymore.
A needle drop 10!
You&#39;re one of the only music reviewers/critics who actually gives his real opinion, and it&#39;s a pretty damn good opinion
To Pimpthony A Butterflythano
That Tupac guys career about to take off thanks to Kendrick!!!
Anyone that put together people like Snoop Dogg, Pharrell, George Clinton, FlyLo, Thundercat and Knx in a project deserves my respect. One of the best Hip Hop Albums ever in my opinion. This shit has not even one &quot;safe-hip-hop-trap-type-beat&quot;, Kendrick and his crew took it to a whole different direction that everyone else was going to. And him being a &quot;mainstream&quot; artist, it&#39;s a quite commendable move!
i forget what song it is in GKMC but at the end of one his mom talks about how the best way to give back is to your city and that is what he does with this album
Bro you looked the EXACT same in 2011. Usually people especially Youtubers change at least a little bit in 4 years.
Yo you know Jenny death is out right XD
man, i just want to smack the shit out of people who say the production on this album is trash. as soon as the album begins you get hit with a beautiful track laid out by flylo. pretty much every beat fit his flow perfectly. then again, i listen to a lot of nujabes, dj okawari, fat jon, common, and stuff so jazz/hiphop has always been my thing.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1185">19:45</a> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1313">21:53</a> is really great to watch. People articulating their passion so clearly and enthusiastically is special.
D
So you give Under Pressure a 6 but this trash a 10? You don&#39;t know music bro lol. I love Kendrick but this album was garbage 
I found the album annoying. He used weird voices the entire album and did his sort of scream rapping style for the bulk of it. Greatly dissapointed. The message was fine (while annoying because it&#39;s beating a dead horse). Just wasn&#39;t fun for me to listen to.
Kendrick lamar is in my English 101 textbook in the poetry section¬†
Definitely Kendrick&#39;s best album 
lmfao when did this come out?<br>kendrick lamar sucks so i havent heard from him since i realized he sucked
Will there ever be a day when we can watch/read one man&#39;s review of an album, which voices his opinion, and have an intelligible conversation about it? I mean, without all the &quot;dickrider&quot;, &quot;GTFOH&quot;, &quot;you don&#39;t know shit about hip-hop&quot; flying around?<br><br>For the record, I&#39;m on about my fifth listen now and the album gets better and better. After the first listen I wondered to myself how much repeat playability this had for me and how much I could really relate to it. Not anymore. This shit is real and I have tons more admiration for Kendrick for dropping something that&#39;s so much more than just music.<br><br>When shit hits the fan I&#39;ll most definitely still be a fan!<br><br>theneedledrop Great review, Anthony! I enjoy them all, regardless of whether I agree or not.
anthony can you do a album review of the god complex by GoldLink¬†
Not even a huge fan or rap or hip hop but goddamn, gotta give it to this guy. That was <b><i>good</i></b>
This is easily the best album I&#39;ve heard so far this year, and this is coming from someone who isn&#39;t a very big rap fan.
The best hip hop album around. TPABF is the word, now spread it.
This review was just as good as this album was. thumbs up! You expressed everything I was thinking when I was listening to the album Thank you
Simply an amazing album from start to finish. However I definitely don&#39;t think it has the replayability that GKMC had. but that may just be me. 
<b>Claps</b>
jus listen to kendrick whole album i LISTENED not just heard it.... shit got me thinking hard asl &quot; u &quot; got me sitting right here speechless its definitely different but the MESSAGE is so crazy i actually used rap genius while listening he&#39;s definitely not a rapper mortal man shows he doesnt give af not 1 fuck about being a rapper he wants to be a messenger so with that being sad this album got me feeling ashamed of how i been living my life ! but at the same time im not perfect so idk¬†
Tetsuo &amp; Youth or To Pink a Butterfly will win rap album of the year at the Grammys. But I feel like you&#39;re a huge hypocrite for saying this album is dense and you need a &quot;want&quot; to listen to this, but with T&amp;Y, you were like nahhh‚Ä¶ Come on bruh.
Waiting for your review on Mr. Wonderful, Action Bronson.¬†
psssst! review the new Earl Sweatshirt song &quot;Grief&quot;!

Agree completely with this review
u cant compare gkmc and tpab , they r both unique so stfu
Lol omg hilarious &quot;Kendrick is bitching about being black in America &quot; best line 
My friends be hating on it cause of the instrumentals, thats the only problem i would see with the √°lbum, not everyone is going to like it because of that
Only credible review on YouTube. thank you.
I enjoyed your review. Please review Cyhi the Prynce - Black History Project 2 next.
Can someone explain &quot;Momma&quot; to me. Is it about Africa as his motherland or Compton?
Found most of maad city unlistenable. This was a big improvement.
Its funny cuz i wss sick of Kendrick Lamar&#39;s GKMC album and i  but then he makes this<br>
thats it im switchin sides<br><br>Kdot&gt;Jcole
I do
Review earl sweatshirt&#39;s new single &quot;grief&quot; 
An insult to &quot;To Be Kind&quot;
It&#39;s gonna take me a couple months to understand this album. 
Hood Politics is more about whatever Kendrick learned from the world doesn&#39;t really matter when he gets back home. On the first he&#39;s rapping from his home perspective saying &quot;I don&#39;t give a fuck about Politics &amp; Rap my nigga&quot;. During the rest off the song Kendrick plays on what really matters to homies in Compton......Dope breakdown of the album tho homie
Totally a 10 and you said everything I&#39;ve thought about this record and more. Killer review Anthony!
Oh god, im too scared to see this review. 
kendrick the ONLY rapper he reviews correctly
Kendrick Lamar is the best rapper alive
I haven&#39;t heard anyone address the fact that on &quot;These walls&quot;, Kendrick is talking about having sex with this woman, who turns out to be the baby&#39;s mother of the man who killed his friend he had previously talked about on &quot;sing about me&quot;.<br><br>his lyrics on these walls, &quot;killed my homeboy and God spared your life&quot;... i&#39;m just surprised no one has mentioned that.
Most overrated album of the year

END THE WHITE RACE! END THE WHITE RACE!&quot;
Niggas be sayin, Drake&#39;s more dope than Kendrick etc. Nigga, the song Mortal Man was better than any Drake album! 
To Pimp A Butterfly should have just been a BOOK just like NAS&#39;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23illmatic">#Illmatic</a>, It is Great. The way each track is linked to the next track up until the end &quot;Mortal man&quot;, Wonderful. Lyrics are so deep, you have to listen twice or go back to the previous track, it&#39;s like flipping a page. After listening to the whole album you have to start over again. Most of the beats are not catchy, they are like 1940&#39;s jazz during world war 2. (Honestly boring to me) , &quot;Hood Politics&quot; and &quot;How much a dollar cost&quot; i enjoyed very much. But overall the album brings no FUN at all, Lyrics point out Issues and more Issues and are way too preachy, Just not for me. He went &quot;old school mode&quot; but way way way too much. i mean come on it&#39;s 2015 man. at least make it sound like RAP. THIIIIIIS DICK AIN&#39;T FREEEE ! lol Irritating as Fuck. high note screams ! Irritating Horror film piano sounds, You have to lower the volume.
Finally we&#39;re all on the same page!
I feel like Kendrick Lamar album is help making people Look at rap more critical. Its a piece of art. Now the industry is finally seeing and respecting art as the culture and the artist grow.<br><br>But we always had the artist and art like wit Outkast Aquemini but the industry just wasnt giving rap the same respect back then as it is now in regards to critical critiquing of artist and their music compared to other genres
When I liked gkmc and said it&#39;s slightly edgier than section 80 I was called a kendrick dick rider<br>When I said to pimp a butterfly is more socially aware than both albums but different in almost every way I was called a dick rider<br><br>I guess as long as I have an opinion I&#39;ll be a dick rider
fav song: king kunta. anyone else?:P
If you guys had to choose one track as your favorite, which would you choose?<br>&quot;Alright&quot; for me without at doubt.
Lester gta 5
No this isn&#39;t full of bangers and radio hits. Most likely the fans who hopped on during GKMC won&#39;t like this initially, if at all. But he went back to Section .80 with the instrumentals and turned it to a whole other level, with a discussion to make hella people uncomfortable. It&#39;s a hard pill to swallow for a lot of people, but I think K. Dot came out swinging the only way he knew how, blunt and direct. This album is going to be talked about for generations to come.
theneedledrop  I trust you&#39;re point of views and opinions on music more than anyone else. If you could tell me what you think are the top 5 best albums of all time that would be awesome. Any genre.
It&#39;s 4 AM. I&#39;m goin&#39; to bed.
Perfect album, perfect time, perfect review. 10/10
I would laughed if you said a strong 7 then you could&#39;ve said JK 10 chill!!!! 
hey so I&#39;m wondering what other albums would you give a ten?<br>is there a list maybe? id love to find more albums similar to the type of work kendrick put in on his latest album cause nowadayz its hard to find.¬†
i remember u wuz conflicted, misusin ur influenz...
ANYBODY WANT THE ALBUM SENT TO THEM FREE MSG ME!!!
This album is trash. Forest hill drive was much better and it&#39;s not even close.
YES!! TEN!!
YEAHHHHH BUDDDDAYYYYYYYYYYYYY
thanks jamtony whamablammo
is this the first album anthony ever rated 10/10?
i feel like needle drop is always going to give artists he likes much higher rating than artists he doesnt like ....this is a good example¬†
This album is good, but I still think gkmc is better
If you listen to &quot;U&quot; with headphones you notice the middle of track the sound sways from side to side. It kinda of gives you the vibe of suicide. With the spanish lady trying to get into the hotel room.
Maybe Kendrick is trying to change the world, in a good way. He has been my favorite artist for a while now , I didn&#39;t like his style at first and then I really listened to his smart lyrics. <br>But maybe he really might changing the world , I mean think about it the title of the album &quot;to pimp a butterfly&quot; it&#39;s impossible. To change the world , impossible. You can&#39;t &quot;pimp&quot; or make a butterfly look in a seance , manly or big , because nothing can really change that , same as changing the world. <br><br>That&#39;s been lingering around my mind.   
I cant even find a single song on youtube.....anyone got a link for me?
I love the second verse on wesleys theory &quot;Uncle Sam&quot;

He sampled an interview, for fuck&#39;s sake. It&#39;s not a mindfuck moment.
you sound like dj akademiks with them side comments *sip tea
Those of who say this album is trash most likely aren&#39;t listening deep enough and are not expanding your  thinking. If you are addicted to catchy radio mainstream hooks and shallow lyrics with absolutely no conceptual energy put into a record, for the purpose of hitting the top 40, then this record will go right over your heads and most likely will be appreciated by your kids or grandkids one day. In every family line there will always be one or two deep thinkers who are music lovers. 
Let the quick listeners bitch and moan, but down the road I guarantee that the majority of¬†people will appreciate this shit¬†and use it as a blueprint for their own projects. Outkast didn&#39;t become one of the greatest duos to ever do it by sticking to a simplistic sound and an over used message. Like¬†3 Stacks¬†and Big Boi, Kendrick pushed the envelope and put something out something artistically brilliant with a dope message on top. Listeners really need to broaden their fields of interest and try seeing shit from another viewpoint
Transcendent, moving, brilliant, and unforgettable. Kendrick Lamar has become the HiiiPower of Hip-Hop.¬†
Madd city is such a tough record to follow 
I honestly thoughr this album was awful..
I saw a comment down below that said &quot;so what if this album has a message ITS BORING.&quot;<br><br>These are the exact people who are keeping the &quot;bling&quot; era alive. The message makes it all the more exciting! Yeah the beat changes and the poetic interludes and the interesting instrumentals and the amazing lyricism etc. hold the album together, but knowing the reason an artist did something and knowing that each phrase holds it&#39;s own meaning just makes every metaphor all the more exciting.<br><br>So what if Kendrick Lamar doesn&#39;t make a song with a cliche trap beat, there&#39;s a time and place for that and it for sure isn&#39;t here.
This album was...something on another level of rap intelligence, but, I give this album a hard 7/10.
It related to mexicans to

I feel like this is Kendrick&#39;s best album so far. He is a real dude
this will be the best album it&#39;s year just like good kid Maad city 
I actually enjoyed this more than GKMC
you missed out on a loe when it comes to &quot;You ain&#39;t gotta Lie&quot; theneedledrop¬†
Is that a green screen on the part where the cd covers pop up? 
Wtf! ¬†&quot;i&quot; is NOT &quot;pop&quot;!!!!!!! ¬† Shows how much this geek knows about &quot;black&quot; music and history...
Rap stands for rythm and poetry, and that&#39;s what To Pimp a Butterfly is. I thought it was an awesome peek into Kendrick. He spares no honesty with himself or anyone about his struggles and temptations that have accompanied his fame and wealth. While Satan is trying to tie him in a bow tie in his tribulations, he knows that if he&#39;s got God, he&#39;ll be alright. On racial issues he shows an objective and unbiased view, and isn&#39;t afraid to point out hipocracy on either side (especially himself) of seemingly all topics. He&#39;s a self aware rapper, and those are more rare than they should be. I do not think it should be compared to GKMC. I see Good Kid M.A.A.D City as his testimony as a Christian, whereas this album describes his trials, regrets, and world views, packaging the themes in an overlying poem and funky/jazzy groove. Who wants an artist to make the same music over and over? I don&#39;t. Rap was really starting to all sound the same, and not really sounding like rythm and poetry in most cases. Great album, and a breath of fresh air in my opinion.
On everything, this album could really be a short film. Hell I&#39;ll pitch in to fund this. 
I really couldn&#39;t comprehend the idea of Kendrick outdoing GKMC, and I was anxious to hear what this album would be about, but my goodness, he has truly, truly outdone himself. TPAB is just stellar. Gripping, daring, sincere. It&#39;s definitely not meant for bumping casually in the car or for those lacking intellectual capacity or patience. The lyrics must be digested thoroughly. The music itself is so wonderfully crafted and suited to the lyrics. Right now it&#39;s a potent album perfectly timed given the current events. I feel that in a decade or so, Kendrick will be recognized for having trailblazed a new path for making albums with purpose and intellect.
IT GOT A 10!!!!!!¬†
Am I the only one who thinks Obama should listen to this. 
IMHO This is EASILY one of the best albums of all time. The only question is over time will it be number 1. Theres so much awareness, its so artistic, and the Bars at times are so devastating that they leave your face looking like you just saw a¬† runaway train hit a cement truck full of elephant shlt. We gon be Alright.
Lmao &quot;he&#39;s gonna review it&quot; xD 
hey Anthony can you please review mello music group persona album
&quot;U&quot; IS THE GREATEST HIP HOP SONG I EVER HEARD I SWEAR TO GOD
You should have a podcast
 Please RE-review My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy üò• PLEASE ANTHONY, at least listen to it again.
Nobody should flip out at others for saying they didn&#39;t like the album or it was &quot;trash&quot; because that is just their opinion...we all have different tastes in music..some prefer catchier beats while others prefer lyrics. Some people prefer an album that tells a story as a whole while others want club hits...the youtube comments section for this video is basically meant for us to discuss our opinions on the LP..whether good or bad it doesnt matter no one should take it personally...if anything kendrick should be the most offended not his fans...i did enjoy this album a lot because i am the type of music fan who enjoys substance, lyrics, storytelling, and melodic old school beats...for the ones who thought this album sucked then word great for you but im just happy i enjoyed it¬†
shit was not a 10
IMO I can&#39;t see Kendrick topping this album. It clearly blows GKMC and moves Section.80 to the 2nd spot out of his 3 albums.
This album is straight fire, classic af. love it.
At first I wasn&#39;t feeling it, but now after a few more listens, its starting to grow on me
SUPERB REVIEW ANTHONY!!! I don&#39;t always see eye to eye with you, but when it counts I always share &amp; value your opinion. Go on... you are making a big contribution to todays HIPHOP culture &amp; media!
&quot;I didn&#39;t like &quot;Maad City...&quot; BUT This might be genre breaking and a generation defining Album. After the 1st listen I kind of felt like I felt after listening to the &quot;Low End Theory&quot; by the TRIBE... I will cop it twice, one sealed for the collectors in 30years. THIS MIGHT BE THE PET SOUNDS Album of the New Generation... Deep &amp; Soulful... ONLY LOVE FOR KENDRICK!&quot;
Album of the year in my opinion
Waiting to hear if he gave this a 10 was my favorite part of this review !! 
J E N N Y D E A T H W H E N
Review Maxo Kream&#39;s mixtape &quot;Maxo 187&quot; please.
Forest Hill drive over this average album
Took me three listens to settle in and realize how awesome the album is. <br><br>First listen: Eryka Badu strikes agan.<br><br>2nd listen: Ilike a few tracks but not the weird ones. <br><br>3rd, 4th... : Classic. Every track is unique and the album  on the whole is an awesome experience. I can both bump it in me cah and zone out to it while gaming. 
This is one of the best, well-spoken album reviews I&#39;ve listed to. Thank you. 
Section 80 was definitely a mixtape
uh tupac not alive excuse me???
This album gives me good vibes I simply love it! A breath a fresh air from rapping about cars, money, women, etc. More like embracing black african roots  5/5
I give it an 8 I understand and comprehend the record but I also want a song I could throw on my car&#39;s stereo and ride around with without having to focus all of my attention on the lyrics in order to enjoy(not saying the beats suck...just saying though, just a little modernization wouldn&#39;t hurt).
This is album created for the black youth, mortal man proves it.
its 4 am...
Section.80 &gt; TPAB
Incredibly intricate review yet still quite easy to follow along. Spot on stuff. Well done.
Didnt enjoy the album, i was looking for 1 or two catchy songs , but not one did i find good. Just my opinion
can&#39;t trust it when everybody gives it a perfect score, mostly these white critics
I like this album but I like maad city better. Also not as many hardcore/violent songs as I would like
You can&#39;t review an album in 3 days!
Usually I disagree with some of your other reviews Anthony, but I totally agree with everything you say about this album. Kendrick is hot shit and never disappoints :D
Look FHD is nothing compared to TPAB okay. Nothing. They&#39;re not even in the same category
So many people will lose the meaning of the album due to the way Kendrick cleverly &amp; creatively masks his message behind metaphor, simile,  and multiple character switch. When you think he&#39;s talking about a female, listen again. When you think he&#39;s talking politics, listen again. Definitely not made for the shallow mind. BIG UPS KING KENDRICK! 
&gt;gives album 10/10<br>&gt;doesnt say forever<br>terrible review BLANDanthony BLANDtano
So far I have test up and youth on repeat and now this, I hope carter vi will be comparable...who am I kidding.
Ôøºüî•üî•üî•
&quot;It&#39;s not that Kendricks being basic, it&#39;s because you&#39;re being basic.&quot; <b>points at camera</b> you don&#39;t know how happy that part made me. Some people are so unfair to artists like kendrick because they just listen to a song and that&#39;s it. They don&#39;t look into or digest what he&#39;s actually saying. 
&#39;These Walls&#39; reminds me so much of &#39;Off the Wall&#39; era Michael Jackson. Awesome stuff!
If you don&#39;t like this album, you&#39;re still a child who only wants to bop your head to beats instead of listening to the lyrics and the message they send 
Section 80: Best Rap album of the year.<br>GKMC: One of the Best Rap albums of all time. <br>TPAB: One of the best albums of all time. 
Excellent excellent review man! I was waiting for this Lol when this album came out I was like &quot;can&#39;t wait for the needle drop&quot; aside from that...I need to understand why you gave big Sean&#39;s album a &quot;NO&quot; lmao I was laughing at the review but I just don&#39;t understand.. His album was way better than his last. What&#39;s the problem?
For you so called &quot;hip hop heads&quot; who thinks this album is trash because of the beats, funk jazz blues and rock are the building blocks for hip hop/rap as a genre. Just because there is not a catchy line or overused trap beat doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s overrated trash it takes balls to do a project like this on 2015. Music is a art form for every individual appreciate this album as an art for society, not an art for your individual self
 If you didn&#39;t like this album because you expected a GKMC 2, you have a very incorrect perception of Kendrick. Kendrick is not that type of artist at all. I don&#39;t think he would ever do that. He intends to progress and discover new musical outlets. This album is an example of that 
&gt;Highest rating possible from numerous reviewers<br>Pro-tip: Nobody is going to listen to your uninformed, biased opinion you comment on a youtube video when a number of reliable reviewers give this album a 10/10, 5/5, or classic rating in a well written review.
How is this a 10/10? Album was shit, not even the best put out this year. Preachers $on is about 20x better.
Great review
That ending dance killed me XD
I&#39;m so happy to see people agree that this is one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time. A true soon-to-be classic.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=287">4:47</a> Angry at those papers
I&#39;m gonna need a fruit smoothie for this one.
This album is beautiful, I love the messages, the introspection, the social AND self-awareness as well as the cohesive beauty of the instrumentals and lyrics (including the poem). This is a masterpiece of rap music, not just for Kendrick, but for rap in general. I do like how ambitious he was with this album, he mixed genres with the old school funk, jazz, definitely some 90&#39;s rap as well as contemporary poetry and spoken word. The artistic fragrance I&#39;d say that this album gives off, to the very album TITLE, is astounding, breathtaking, inspiring and satisfying. It&#39;s been a good 3 year wait.
In the meantime RIP Sandman NEGUS!
Awesome review. I was already going to get this album but now I have made it a priority. 
This album is a Hip-Hop Funkadelic MASTERPIECE. Can&#39;t compare this album to ANYthing. Kendrick just raised the bar on rap music for eternity!!!
Man damn...just when I was drenched in Eat Pray Thug....then comes Kendrick...fuck. Damn rappers..good job Kendrick...great review Fantano!!!
Hahahahah the ones that dislike this need to make young thug there favorite rapper cuz hip hop is not for u. And thats fine. But if your black and dont understand the messeges then i feel bad for u.... Just realize that your simple minded and the house of hip hop has no chair for u. Best hip hop culture album in 30 years. Sorry if its harsh but so is your ignorance towards somthing i love
I&#39;m saying this again - i wasnt feelin it at first but den dat joint just grew on me madd fast. i been listenin to dat joint like everyday. its crazy. I was listening to it on spotify, but i couldn&#39;t help myself but to buy the whole album in iTunes. Dat joint is like jazz, funk, or classical music and hip hop put 2gether. the kind of music U can just let play the whole day. Mature rap music- I got the whole album on repeat it got me snapping my fingers all day.
Drake - If You Are Reading This it&#39;s Too Late : 8/10<br><br>Lupe Fiasco - Tetsuo &amp; Youth : 7/10<br><br>Joey Bada$$ - B4.DA.$$ - 8/10<br><br>Kendrick Lamar - To Pimp a Butterfly - 10/10<br><br><br><br>Amazing start in Hip-Hop this year with these albums. And Anthony&#39;s reviews have been pretty spot on these albums for the most part. We might be heaed back into that Golden Age in hip-hop again, let&#39;s hope so.
i was immediately taken by this album.¬† from the first notes i knew we had something big.¬†¬† thanks for the thoughtful review.
There are so many experimental rap albums out that are better than this. I think people think this is so good because they don&#39;t know better (I know Fantano knows better). They only support it because it&#39;s a mainstream artist. I gave it a couple listens all the way through and it frustrates me more than anything. There is way too much weird instrumentation going on. Just when you think the vocals will drop in the track will go on for another 3 minutes of instrumentation. I guess that&#39;s cool if you are a big fan off all the genres used but if you prefer rap then no. I know he has good messages on most of the songs but it could of still been a monumental hip hop album with a great message and had an impact. If anything this album scares away a lot of rap fans so they never hear the message.¬†
Did anyone listen to Institutionalized and hear Slick Rick Behind Barz.
this guy should just run the rap genius page and do all the annotations¬†
BOOBOO
How tf is he a rap critic! Gtf
One of your best reviews, brah.. Awesome album! Thanks.
Can somebody please explain to me what this album cover is trying to display. Because all that I see is violence towards the US. But I domt want to accuse the cover of having a violent core meaning, because maybe it means something deeper. Please help me lol
Upon first listen to the new album, I say this shit is overrated.¬† I will give it another two or three listens before I draw my final conclusion.¬† Lyrically, what is he saying that hasn&#39;t been said already in the realm of Afrocentrism?¬† It all sounds like more of the same shit I&#39;m hearing every time I turn on race baiting CNN.¬† And his flows don&#39;t really flow, and his voice has already become annoying.¬† The track where he&#39;s supposedly crying/breaking down as he raps is just atrocious and cringe-worthy.¬† There are a couple decent tracks on here.¬† There are also some decent beats, and overall the production is nice, but nothing has really resonated with me thus far.¬† This seems like another one of those albums people rave about because everyone else is raving about it -- I just don&#39;t see why.¬† The Freddie Gibbs and Madlib album from last year is a billion times better than this.
Every rapper now sucks ass and dot know how to rap  Kendrick lamar is the only reasonable and listenable homie in the game <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23tde">#TDE</a> for life .
for the people hating on this album they only wanted to listen for the beats. Thats whats wrong with the hip hop of today they dont care about lyrics they cares about the beat. 
Wow a 10?? thats awsome 
This nigga favorite hip hop album the chronic ? He has it right there all the damn time he stupid . 
I still don&#39;t get why people keep comparing to pimp a butterfly to G.K.M.C, when kendrick  stressed over and over months ago that it would be nothing like it.....<br><br>Seems like the people that are disappointed have no one to blame but their selves for being disappointed or let down<br><br>Its like going outside dressed in summer  clothes. then it snows and you get mad at the season for being in winter instead of summer because you like summer better, even tho the weather man said it would snow all week
Where could i find this album?

Overrated album...
FINNLAALLLYY A TENNN!!! GKMC DIDNT EVN GET A TEN 
good job anthony always love ur reviews
the 10!!!! omg, this album is so beautiful¬†
Dope
This album is very afrocentric, it touches on racial pride,Africa,Zulus and nelson Mandela,self hate. Its meant for a specific audience. To be a white person and jell with this is rare or at least to understand the message of anger and love. This album is meant for the black youth.
ALBUM OF THE DECADE.
you aint got to lie grew on me..now its one of my favs on the album. overall yeah he killed it with this joint!
You&#39;re odeeeee corny 
Cracking up at how excited he is in this
Ant did it... LET ME TAKE A MOMENT TO BASK IN THE 10<br>Cal is awesome btdubz
Foreal tho...this album is real R.A.P (Rhythm And Poetry). ¬†
I never was really a Kendrick fan. I knew he was great and had bars, but i wasn&#39;t a big fan of gkmc, idk it just didn&#39;t grab me. But i&#39;ve been keeping my ear open for him. This album tho is fucking amazing. I have been listening to it non-stop all the way through for the past 4 days. It is not only a hip-hop classic but a musical and artistic classic. I feel like im watching a movie when I listen to it. I&#39;m now a Kendrick fan. 100/10
Yo there is no way that this album deserves a ten. I&#39;m sorry but I am a fan of all types of music and not just the songs with &quot;trap influenced&quot; beats and to say this album is a perfect ten is laughable. I&#39;d give it an 8 at most. The only reason people are saying its a masterpiece is because of the &quot; message &quot; , like this is the first album to have one....and to say best RAP album of all time, please stop with that bull shit. Ya&#39;ll hyping this shit up way too much. This album will be forgotten by May, mark my words...
Yo to pimp a butterfly feels like a fuckin ride bro 
Man, u need to have a chat with that Steven guy!<br><br>Thx for this great review! 
I&#39;m a HUGE kanye fan, but yes, this is definitely better than anything he or Eminem has ever put out. ¬†
No matter how bad you think this album is, you have to respect the lyrical and experimental ambition. I don&#39;t think very many rappers would dare to put out a project this bold. This album completely blew me away. That&#39;s just my honest opinion.
I think of this album as an audio-movie, if you will; for this era in hip hop. Reason being is that it is a well delivered album with an incredible ending but it is not worth of constant or individual-song replay. It&#39;s something, that I think, you&#39;d have to listen to as a whole each time; hence the term audio-movie. Either way i loved this review and all your others. Kdot once again set the bar for how albums can be put together. Hopefully we DO see this from several artists in upcoming years. 
I wonder will J. Cole ever get a 10..?
I&#39;m surprised more people are,t talking about the song &quot;Complexion&quot;. Even pass &quot;Rapsody&quot; brilliant verse the song&#39;s content is wonderful. The girl he&#39;s talking to was mixed because her mother was raped by their slave owner. The metaphor of blacks in america being seen as a woman that is half black and half white and their dad being a rapist slave owner. It&#39;s incredible. ¬†
Great Album, however (the hater in me) not 100% original. its like he studied Andre his whole life and stole his melodies. If you accuse Logic of sounding like Kendrick, why does Kendrick get away scott free? Like i said Its still an incredible album and kendrick is probably my favorite rapper next to 3 stacks. But just solely because of the mimicking, i give this a 9 instead of 10. oh and TPAB is better than GKMC by far.
jenny...+pimp...or vice versa.Must be that the needle is getting moist.
Testsuo and Youth&gt; TPAB¬†<br><br>For me, T&amp;Y is album of the year, perhaps album of the decade. But that&#39;s just my opinion
i thought it was great for story telling and a big social statement, but as a rap album i think everyone can agree that this was weak. ¬†Nowhere on the album does he straight up rap. i expected him to drop bars and really show more of his lyrical ability and i thought that was lacking on this album. ¬†I like lupe&#39;s better. ¬†He had a great social message and still made great songs on that album while dropping bars.
I ¬†DONT KNOW HOW TO FEEL ABOUT THIS ALBUM
RAP ALBUM OF THE YEAR.<br>NAW FUCK THAT,<br><b>ALBUM OF THE YEAR.</b>
10/10 classic
Great reviewüëç I agree with every thing but I believe that from a scale from 1-10 the album deserves a 20, it&#39;s so good that it&#39;s off the charts üëå
Just listen to &quot;How Much A Dollar Cost,&quot; the you&#39;ll realize how amazing this album is.  
thank you!<br>i knew you would give this a ten<br>its on point!¬†
JENNY DEATH TIME ANTHONY
I KNEW IT I KNEW THUNDERCAT WAS ON THIS, when are you going to review Since I Left You by The Avalanches?
I&#39;ve been listening and listening analyzing the songs and honestly... This album is amazing
I love his old shit, but honestly, I wasted 15 Damn dollars on this &quot;garbage&quot; I&#39;m sorry if you love the album, but his album is honestly one of the worst albums I&#39;ve EVER heard...
I usually keep my opinions to myself, but this album came very highly recommended to me by various friends and celebrities, so I thought I&#39;d give my two cents.<br><br>Honestly, I was bored all the way through the album, I&#39;d often find myself just losing interest half way through every song, apart from one song, &#39;i&#39;. If you like this album then great, listen to it all you want and I&#39;m glad you enjoy it, but personally I just don&#39;t get the hype and I was very disappointed.¬†
In my opinion, one of the best messages to come from this album is that Kendrick admits that he doesn&#39;t have all the answers. ¬†Instead, he understands that there are always going to be more questions, more issues, but it doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t try to solve the ones we have now.
&quot;Its not because Kendrick&#39;s being basic, its because YOU&#39;RE being basic&quot; LMAOOO  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23facts">#FACTS</a> ¬†
Didn&#39;t expect this album to be like this. But I must say I am pleasantly surprised and this is just sending hip hop in the right direction in my opinion. Good switch up to follow GKMC with and great substance within the album. I agree with the 10/10 100 percent. Chalk one up for Kendrick and chalk one up for hip hop. 
Review Marina&#39;s FROOT pls
Very great review anthony. This album was actually better than what I thought it would be. Really fantastic production wise, conceptually, lyrically and the social commentary was brilliantly delivered. To pimp a butterfly is a work of art and I&#39;m gonna be dissecting it for a long time. Now as I said before when it comes to straight up ripping the mic and spitting there are a few better than Kendrick In my eyes but for overall mc Kendrick is the king. Well done Kendrick 
Who is lucy tho?
If only fantano didn&#39;t hate on yeezy...he&#39;d be the man
On¬†these walls k-dot is fucking the chick of the guy that shot Dave on GKMC...
earl track?
Got some good feelins on where rap music is going - thanks Kendrick for giving me hope
As much as this is a rap/hiphop album. ¬†The people who like it have to be fans of MUSIC not just RAP. ¬†Everything that has been said negative about this album is due to it not going down the same boring stereotypical gangsta rap pathway that almost every project takes. ¬†Even GKMC was gangsta rap themed. ¬†This album reminds me of a more dramatic, focused section.80. ¬†Kendrick isn&#39;t just telling stories he&#39;s speaking on real life issues in todays world. ¬†This is a piece of art, not just a collection of singles. ¬†Kendrick is super popular right now. ¬†The fact that he isn&#39;t just trying to make music that will please the masses just to cash in while he can is amazing to me. ¬†If you listen to other artists outside this genre and are not close minded when it comes to different forms of music, I fail to see how you could dislike this album or find it &quot;boring&quot;
 This album was so West Coast! You could here the SugaFree and Tupacar flows in King Kuta. You could also here the DJ Quick influence as well. Also George Clinton. This album was its own sound within HIP HOP how Doggystyle was<br><br>Institutionalized was more of a Snoop Tribute something like the sound on No Limit Top Dogg.<br><br>Even Though Fantano is not a fan of the Game. He did the drunk rapping on Documentary and Doctors Advocate spilling his heart out. Give Game some credit Fantano.<br><br>This was just a heavy album overall. it you can really put yourself in the mind frame of Kendrick on this album you feel the pain and mental struggle and triumph.<br>It&#39;s the psyche of living in a white mans world but having respect and pride in yourself.<br><br>I know Jay-Z made the Black Album but Kendrick made &quot;The REAL BLACK ALBUM&quot;. From the relationship with America, to the raw spoken word of your parents &quot;wash yo ass&quot;. I don&#39;t think my white friends parents give advice in that manner. This album felt like carpet floor with a huge TV on the floor and a bible on the laying around. This album was soo real.<br><br>I think Kendrick broke a lot of mental chains on this album. Especially the break down of the Negus. Similar to what Pac was doing. <br><br>Last note On &quot;For Free&quot; that voice is from a Martin Episode where he is telling his  friends how he met Gina. He was all Pimp and Goldie like. I watch a lot of Martin too.<br><br>I&#39;m so glad to see this a 10 and the overwhelming appreciation.<br><br>Kendrick is Fam in my book. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23tde">#TDE</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23tpab">#TPAB</a><br><br>
where can i listen to this album
This album wasnt better than GKMC
Good review. You can really tell that Kendrick completely feels obligated to take advantage of his fame and stature to try and make a difference in the world, and to teach people.¬†
Great review, dude
JENNY DETH WEN
Anthony, I think your glasses are too big...
Makes a lot of sense. Stars off sort of expository, talking about the state of the black man in America. Transitions into really sad shit. The black man starts to think &quot;is it my fault? yeah, it&#39;s my fault. this is hopeless. everything is gonna be shit forever.&quot; with &quot;u&quot;, and then he realizes that things are gonna be &quot;alright&quot; in the end, and he starts looking for ways to fix his situation. He looks to advice he gets from his family on &quot;Momma&quot;. He looks to blame everyone else and gets super cynical and blames the system on &quot;Hood Politics&quot;. He looks at economic realities of his own situation and how they contribute to his depression on &quot;How Much A Dollar Cost&quot;. He begins to realize that, really, it&#39;s not about the fight of the black man but of all men and that he needs to realize that before he can make himself happy again. Then he gets to &quot;The Blacker The Berry&quot; where he looks at everyone else in the room and tells them what he&#39;s realized, super fucking mad at them all for having believed what he used to believe because of all the violence and death it&#39;s caused. Then he finally realizes the only way for him to truly be happy is to find it within himself on &quot;i&quot;.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=621">10:21</a> when you bust and she keeps sucking
you hit every big point and tiny details ,best review so far you my dude get a 10.5
A perfect ten? one of the greatest albums of all time?! HOW??? I love the album too man but damn... Personally I&#39;ve always wanted these artistes to up their lyrical content which is why I listen to ppl like Kendrick but some of the songs weren&#39;t that pleasing sonically and quite average...¬†<br>I approached this album knowing I wouldn&#39;t get the traditional hip-hop &quot;sound&quot; that we&#39;re conditioned to, hell I even listened to Yeezus repeatedly with an open mind when it dropped so I can say I&#39;m open to experimentalism and giving things a chance but to say its a masterpiece and a perfect score...nah<br>it is better than 2014FHD tho, surely lol

I held my thoughts until I put out my review today but I agree with you one everything Anthony. Kendrick made something special with this album. We don&#39;t get many artists like him so we better appreciate it while we can!
Production: 9/10¬†<br><br>Flows: 7/10 (His voice was all over the place, and felt outta place given the serious tone of the topics.)<br><br>Hooks/Choruses: 4/10 (There was no standout melodies on this album whatsoever. Especially when compared to the brilliance on MBDTF)<br><br>Lyrical Content: 9/10<br><br>Replay Value: 6/10<br><br>Track Consistency: 8/10 (The latter half of the album is far more consistent in quality than the filler filled first half)<br><br><br>I would give this album an 8/10 at best. Let&#39;s be real. This album is filled with great subject matter but last I checked a shitload of underground rappers have equal content, or better, yet no one seems to care unless an overhyped mainstream rapper like Kendrick does it. For example, I bet If Immortal Technique releases his new album this year an album like that would only get a 8/10 even though Immortal Tech is always known to touch on a wide range of social issues (much wider and in-depth than what Kendrick brought here), people are drooling over this only because it&#39;s Kendrick. THIS SHIT DOES NOT DESERVE A 10/10.
you&#39;re a horrible person
Review Emile Haynie We Fall Please.
Nah it&#39;s garbage
deff channeling outkast
anyone knows what the poem at the end of the album about the catipiler was called
Great review thanks.. if i had not heard any of his songs you would make me want to hear them

Wait, &quot;Anthony hates hiphop&quot;, right?¬†
TPTB 11/10
Without looking at the score yet I&#39;m going to guess Medium to strong 6/10.
Best 5 Rappers of the New Generation (Rappers in their 20&#39;s so J Cole don&#39;t count) <br><br>1. Kendrick Lamar (Come on he&#39;s released 2 classics in a row) <br><br>2. Drake (He will be remembered as the most popular artists of this decade, and his music is pretty good in my opinion) <br><br>3. Chance The Rapper (Still needs to prove himself some more, but Acid Rap is arguably the best mixtape of this decade so far) <br><br>4. Logic (Crazy ass flow, lyrical beast, he could be top 3 easily if he was more original, and if his album was better, album wasn&#39;t bad at all, but I expected more originality) <br><br>5. Joey Badass (He&#39;s a spitter, he makes 90&#39;s rap sound new. Great debut album from him. He&#39;s just 20, it&#39;s just a matter of time before he&#39;s top 2 of this generation) <br><br><br><br>
good album period it gave me that 90s outkast slum village j dilla vibe  this album is not for everyone if your not open minded to social awareness aka reality rap so the moral of the story is go listen to your lil cliche ass trap house music  lol  flex this flex that ,niggas sound like females with that pocket watching rap bs smdh
So thoughtful. Great review.
finally he makes a good, time felt review.
It&#39;s not &quot;dick riding&quot;, it&#39;s people recognizing and appreciating a legendary album. The only reason y&#39;all are hating is because people are uncomfortable talking about race and certain people don&#39;t want the black community to be uplifted
The people that don&#39;t or have not enjoyed this album are probably the same people that don&#39;t like stakonia, yeezus, acid rap, electric circus.. albums that don&#39;t fit the mold and push boundaries. But thats what music is all about, PUSHING CREATIVE BOUNDARIES. This will be raved about for years to come for its creativity, lyrics and message. and it should be
The only thing I fear about this album are those ignorant hip hop heads that feel like they&#39;re above other listeners just because they &quot;get&quot; the album faster than them. I&#39;m not gonna lie, some of Kendrick&#39;s fans annoy me (and I&#39;m a HUGE fan) because they diss other people that listen to artists like Lil Wayne, Drake, Kanye, Tyga or any other mainstream rapper. It&#39;s okay to feel good and feel smart for liking Kendrick and acknowledging his lyrical talents and abilities, but just because you get what he says doesn&#39;t make you any better than those who don&#39;t get it or like it. It makes us fans look like pretentious hipsters when a lot of us are just normal hip hop fans that like all kinds of different raps. Kendrick is a very smart and very innovative artists because he takes his time and with each album goes even more in depth with the lyrics, productions and concepts and does deserve the title as a modern day Pac (though Pac is the only Pac no one will ever replace him) due to his dedication to say a message in each project. Just, those who want to tear others down if they disagree with this album being classic, remember Kendrick will quite possibly become a rap legend within the next few years regardless what others think and everyone is not going to like him or his music and won&#39;t readily say it&#39;s classic.
I fucking called that 10
Dog did you just delete my comment about Kendrick using Lupes style of flow in some  His songs? The album is just ok I wouldn&#39;t give it a 10
Finally real music! No trap! hoes! money! type of bs thats been played over the years! This cat is using REAL MUSIC! Real bars! coming from a real musician! theneedledrop¬†you said it best when you can take thunder cats and clinton and blaze something finally different!!! Kendrick is bringing old school taking us back to ¬†j dilla times! I haven&#39;t bought a rap album since outkast love below.
Now review Jenny Death!!
Anthony Fantano just called you bitches basic +<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=732">12:12</a>
Kendrick is one of my favorite rappers and although this wasn&#39;t a bad album, it is nowhere near as good as GKMC. I like the fact that he had the balls to experiment despite the risk of alienating his audience but at the end of the day the beats lyrics and message in GKMC was way better as a whole and song by song. but again not a bad album just wouldn&#39;t give it a 10 if it were me
To pimp a butterfly and¬† 2014 Forest hills drive are the best albums of 2014/15
I especially love the message and the fact that Kendrick personified evil as Lucifer aka Lucy. At it&#39;s core, it&#39;s album about social responsibility, guilt and even loyalty to God. I agree with *****¬† that it&#39;s easier to listen to from beginning to end and it&#39;s been difficult for me to cut on just one track or add it to a playlist. It&#39;s an amazing piece of art and I really hope it gets everyone else with upcoming albums to really step up their game, Kanye West, Drake, Wale I&#39;m looking at you. Can King Kendrick be beat?
Love this album, love Kendrick Lamar, been waiting on this album since the day after GKMC. KENDRICK LAMAR DID NOT LET ME DOWN WITH THIS ALBUM. However, is nobody going to talk about how full of black power this album is? Am i the only one who feels Kendrick was being specific about his race, and only his race, throughout the album?
i dont like the fact that there isnt one black hippie member on this album, i hope it doesnt mean anything between them.
Here is how Butch &amp; Quinn felt about it.¬†<a href="https://soundcloud.com/allie-lyke/butch-quinn-on-to-pimp-a?in=allie-lyke/sets/butch-quinn">https://soundcloud.com/allie-lyke/butch-quinn-on-to-pimp-a?in=allie-lyke/sets/butch-quinn</a>
I honestly think this deserves a straight 11, but 10/10 was a good call.
This definitely deserved a 10 and so does your Review Bro üëèüëèüëè I give you a üîü
Liberally Cucktano
HAH! IT HAPPENED! IT FINALLY HAPPENED! ANTHONY HAS BESTOWED A 10 UPON A WORTHY ALBUM! IT&#39;S A MIRACLE!¬† HALLELUJAH !
Complete respect omg
hey so why do you hate hip hop?
Kendrick outdid his last album that is considered a classic!<br><br><br>What do u call something better than a classic???
He gave a 10... Holy shit
Needle drop Thank you for reviewing!!!!! This album is better than Good Kid Maad City .......10/10 K. Dot came thru like Lupe and gave another Classic!!! üòÅ‚ú®üòÑ
Well done review and beautifully articulated.
Illmatic , My beautiful dark twisted fantasy and GKMC are the only 3 albums that can be placed as the greatest album of all time 
This album is great only album that has even a chance to being as great is Kanye&#39;s ... Maybe...<br>But GKMC is probably the Greatest album of ALL time , only other album that can take that place is My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy . One of those two are the greatest album of all time 
Guys he actually has a favorite artist that is current. Why can&#39;t he like everything Kendrick puts out? In his defense all of Kendrick&#39;s music is actually pretty good so....
people who dislike this album either:<br>A) never or barely listened to kendrick lamar pre-GKMC (section 80, Overly Dedicated, Kendrick Lamar EP)<br>B) only like GKMC for the radio singles (bitch dont kill my vibe, poetic justice, swimming pools)<br>C) have no appreciation for music genre outside of rap or edm<br>D) dont appreciate or recognize the value of originality and soulfulness in music<br>E) all of the above

Did somebody else notice the matana roberts influence on For Free? - Interlude ¬†??????
Kendrick outdid his last album that a wide majority consider a classic!<br><br><br>What do u call something better than a classic?
Ain&#39;t gonna lie. When I first heard this album I was unsure about it. Especially since it&#39;s so different from Mad City. But by the second listen I was hooked. If any of you are put off at first, give it a second listen. I guarantee it&#39;ll change your mind. 
The fact that there is a debate on whether this album is great or not puts shade on TPAB. GKMC was never debated on. Fact of the matter is it was good, but not all that:
In the era of hypebeast and people who started listening to hip hop in 2010 this is the greatest hip hop album ever madeüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ..........fantastic album still though.
You didn&#39;t talk about &quot;how much a dollar cost&quot;? I personally think that&#39;s the best song on the album, if it&#39;s not produced by dre it&#39;s definitely influenced by him, the song is one that every working person can relate to when you see a homeless person asking for money, there are so many messages in that song to every person on how much money means to them and to Kendrick personally and also I think it has to do with Kendrick potentially selling out and not making music he wants to just for more money, it&#39;s just such a thought provoking song it gave me chills.
Does anyone think &quot;for sale&quot; seems like Dmx&#39;s &quot;Damien&quot;. I say that because Dmx is one of if not Kendrick&#39;s favorite artist 
Totally agree, great review. Amazing art. Historically, this will be up there with Nas-Illmatic, Fugees-The Score, Wu-Tang-36 Chambers, Biggy, Dre...
Momma, Hood Politics, &amp; How Much A Dollar Costs took me to a place in westcoast hip hop nostalgia. This is Kendrick&#39;s Illmatic record here.¬†
You finally reviewed it! Nice! 
This album is a fucking classic. Because growing up as a kid, my dad would go to bars and perform jazz songs. I liked rap the most and grew up listening to jazz and the combination of these 2 genre in this album &quot;To Pimp A Butterfly&quot; is fucking amazing.
Great review 
Respect Fanto. I was concerned you&#39;d underrate the album because it has so much going on.<br><br>I agree, 10/10.
I would like to be able to get into Kendrick&#39;s music,  but I just can&#39;t &amp; I like all the aspects it carries just not when he does it. I give his new album a try.
Yes. Hell fucking yes. 
2014 Forest hills Drive is definitely better than this G funk record.  The music on TPAB is definitely non-enjoyable 
No possible way you rated this album that high. A 6.5  or 7 at best, The music was not that enjoyable I liked the message but that&#39;s pointless when the music is extremely cringeworthy. If J.cole or Drake would&#39;ve released this same exact record they would&#39;ve been crucified. You seem to be more fascinated on k.dots career rather than his album.  This was by far kendricks worst project I can&#39;t say this is better than any of his other work.
To Pimp A Butterfly is rap AOTY. Boost baby boost.
Joey Badass and Kendrick Lamar dropped the best albums no doubt pure hip hop at its finest...and very good rating I&#39;d say 10/10 myself 
i personally couldnt get into this album.... and im not trolling
NOT JUST THE BEST KENDRICK LAMAR &quot;TO PIMP A BUTTERFLY&quot; REVIEW... BUT POSSIBLY THE BEST DAMN ALBUM REVIEW EVER!  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23kudos">#KUDOS</a>
Great review!
Œ£Ôºà„Éª‚ñ°„ÉªÔºõÔºâWAAA a 10/10?! Haven&#39;t seen one of these in years... 
Only thing its missing is a straight bars track like rigormortis and backseat freestyle. But its a great album.
Kendrick killed it. 
How can you even compare this to dark twisted fantasy? This album will be forgotten after a year. Too much hype and dick riding is going on here, I am not saying this album is shit, but surely it is overrated. Its been 5 years since Dark twisted fantasy and 20 since Liquid Swords, and niggas is and will be bumpin this shit bruh bruh. Cant see a classic album right here bruh, if you aks me, youknowhatimsayin.
theneedledrop I understand there is context and that it is a different version, but I don&#39;t see how you can go from not liking i at all when it dropped as a single to thinking it is a perfect song. Great review otherwise
Great review! I like how i, Blacker the berry and King Kunta (earlier singles) really stand out inside the context of the album. I&#39;m still listening to it, trying to pick up the different layers. The ending with Tupac is great, really makes you think. Good kid MAAD city was great and a lot of fun, if you are thrown off at first just give this one another chance/listen, this is another side of him and a brave different record. Shit don&#39;t change unless you wipe your ass.
I knew you&#39;d rate this shit high
Okay so I&#39;m not the only one who got literally mind fucked when Kendrick Lamar was having the converstaion with 2pac. And but that caterpillar poem though. Lord this album left me speechless
OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
I honestly think that G.K.M.C was better... I think that sonically, it sounded much better than this album, hence I never got really really into it. But I respect Fantano&#39;s opinion, so I will listen to it in full lenght a couple more times.
You have to be insane to compare this to 2014 Forest Hills.... Completely different and waaayy better... This is true art. Kendrick is pure genius
Hit the nail right on the. Listening to the album I kinda felt like it had all the Peices of the great albums that have come out in the past 15 yrs it was like College dropout kanye some lupe, common some eminem, outkast just all rolled into one great project
Kendranthony Lamtano, I fricking love you! 
This album is a force. He set himself apart with this one.
THIS DICK AINT FREEEEE
The album was very relaxing and smooth album and if you listen closely he is speaking something deep and dark as well. songs like, these walls, u, institutionalized, how much a dollar cost, complexion and king kunta. In my opinion it topped gkmc
jesus christ... you aint gonna lie was the first track i heard and it was fantastic! this album, by deduction, may actually be worthy of dat 10. can&#39;t wait to hear the rest of this!
This is easily the best explanation of this album that I&#39;ve seen. You break it down easy enough for someone to understand the concepts. Thanks! 
Not a 10 maybe a 8 the instrumentals were very diverse and jazzy but Kendrick voice choices aren&#39;t always on point and the lyrics are less compelling than gkmc but still a great album with a huge message that needs to be heard wishing the rap community and inner city neighborhoods 
¬†I know that you don&#39;t really do Reggae releases, but I think that I would throw something at you that you don&#39;t normally do. I really think that Protoje&#39;s Ancient Future is worth reviewing.
Not fucking Tetsuo and Youth 
Totally agree with almost watching the story that unfolds as you listen. Its almost like The Wall in a way. 
It&#39;s a great album, but where is that &quot;alive&quot; song? I was really looking forward to it!
FINALLY a review of yours  I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH!  Superb job sir.
I&#39;m feeling a light to strong 10 on your review.
Review Revolutionary Vol.2 by Immortal Technique 
This album to me is a work of art. It&#39;s different from his last two albums in that it&#39;s very dark, and it&#39;s Kendrick&#39;s most honest album he&#39;s ever cooked up. Yes, it&#39;s not GKMC, and even Kendrick knows that because of that particular reason he&#39;ll lose some fans; or other fans won&#39;t even feel this album, but that just goes to show how far Kendrick is willing to go to evolve as an artist. It only took me two listens to dig this album, and for other people it might take them a few more listens. But overall, great concept album.
People only hate this because its different, and that they&#39;re afraid that this might change hip hop. All hail KING Kendrick Lamar.
The instrumentation is stellar. This album is fucking nice man.¬†
I&#39;m a [] fan, but this album [] in comparison to []<br>¬†If you disagree, go fuck yourself.
An album worth buying. Just blew my mind the first time I listened to it.
He says there isn&#39;t a trendy instrumental on this album.¬†&quot;Alright&quot; is as close as you&#39;re gonna get to &quot;trendy&quot;.<br><br>Honestly, this isn&#39;t just one of the best Hip Hop albums of the decade. This is one of the best Hip-Hop albums of all time. Dare I say one of the best albums period? All I can say is thank goodness for Kendrick Lamar. I think he&#39;s starting to slowly wake these cats up.
Yo son tell us what you think about grief earls lo-fi song
King Kunta was so hyped up I was disappointed 
Wow.... You gave this a Ten :O <br>This is my first time seeing you give a Ten.<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23kingkendrick">#KingKendrick</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23tenoutoften">#TenOutOfTen</a>
The jazzy funk beats reflect the time period in black culture that are similar to the issues that kendrick addresses on the album. The king kunta song was definitely a play off of James Browns Say it loud Im black and I&#39;m proud.
This album is amazing and Kendrick&#39;s creativity is just mind blowing. This is another masterpiece by Kendrick Lamar
can&#39;t believe you gave it a 9 butterthony flytano do u not know what real hip hop is???
I personally love the album. I also realize that it might be a lot to digest for most listeners. It takes a deeper appreciation for music to fully take in. The composition of each song is riddled with intricacies, from key changes to tempo changes, the multiple flows, down to the inflection in Kendrick&#39;s voice as he progresses through his message. There is a lot worth dedicating serious attention to on this record. I fear this record might fall on deff ears, those who define a &quot;good song&quot; by how accessible it is are simply missing out
I guess I should check this out. 
Kendrick is good friends with and idolizes Andre 3000.. Andre 3000 also helped produce and co write some of Good Kid Mad City, so where does Kendrick go from here? I could honestly see him going for a mystical alien type out of this world shit for his next album just like Outkast did,, I always said Suga Free was the outkast of the west, but kendrick could easily take that lane for the next decade
This is the album i was hoping Kendrick would make after section 80. If you thought m.A.A.d city was his best song...FOH.
I felt the same way about this album... I also liked how it was all connected and it truly felt like the album was like one big song that kendrick was expressing his point of views on different topics.
Loved this, keep it up
Kendrick Lamar Reminds me of 2pac...<br>Meaning: when 2pac dropped his albums he always rise the Bar... 2pac didnt sound like NOBODY when he was out... He was so strong of an MC that you were FORCED to STEP UP as an MC or not sale any records...<br><br>2pac album drop: they DOMINATED...<br><br>ME AGAINST THE WORLD: DOMINATED<br><br>ALL EYES ON ME: DOMINATED<br><br>KILLUMINATI: DOMINATED<br><br>2PAC: didnt sound like NOBODY...<br><br>That why KENDRICK remind me of 2PAC...<br><br>TPaB is DOMINANT... GET WITH IT OR GET LOST.... This album is SICK...<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23these">#THESE</a> WALLS
 Yea. I did that.
Wooow truth
Blowing my mind right now... I haven&#39;t followed Kendrick since like June 2014. Knew his album was coming out sometime so I search if you&#39;ve reviewed it yet... &quot;Video released 1 day ago&quot; :D SOO PRO!! Right on point Anthony. Thanks for the review.
kendrick funkworth dropping another classic. thank you honestly.¬†
Hey Anthony, your 10/10 review is mentioned in the wikipedia article for this album!<br>: P~~~~ o-8
It&#39;s not the album being basic, it&#39;s you being basic. Bitch
Anybody else feel like they were trippin when listening to this? 
I loved the album...just got through listening¬†<br>to the rest of it...It is in the lead for Album of the¬†<br>year as far i&#39;m concerned...surpassing Lupe Fiasco&#39;s<br>Tetsuo &amp; Youth album. (It&#39;s that good)¬†<br>Kendrick lived up to the hype and some.
Pimpthony Butterflytano
I have a serious question guys. Not trying to over hype Kendrick Lamar too much, so keep that mind. In rap has there been any artist to drop instant classics back to back? Nas comes to mind with illmatic and it was written. What you guys think?
I loved this album but I will never understand why he disliked jcoles album so much. To me if you like one you will no doubt like the other as well!
What is everyone&#39;s favorite tracks off of this? I really like, &quot;King Kunta&quot;, &quot;How Much a Dollar Cost&quot;, and &quot;Complexion&quot;. The whole album is just great.
Screw Comparisons and Competition.<br><br>J.Cole had a good album.<br>Lupe Fiasco had a good album.<br>I already know Kendrick Lamar will have a good album.<br><br>Anybody who has the heart and passion to make an album has a good album.<br>The Artists are the masters and teachers of their own craft.<br>Only they can truly explain to you what this is about and what this truly means.<br><br>Just Ask the Artists on their work and they will show and teach you everything.<br><br>The way I see it is this...If you are an artist, be an Artist. Enjoy what you make and don&#39;t knock down the ability in you to do great things. Don&#39;t knock other Artists down either. They are just like you. They want to be creative, be themselves, and make the world happy too. Everybody is Amazing to me. Especially when you want to make your dreams come true. Stop comparing an artist to another artist. Stop searching for flaws and start searching for love and appreciation in an Artist. Stop hearing and start listening to an Artist. You will obviously learn something from every artist you see on stage or listen to on your Ipods. This is coming from a place of love. Just love yourself and be great. :D &lt;3
GREAT REVIEW
You&#39;re damn good at your job, couldn&#39;t be more on point on this one. Spreading intelligent music education across the world. Big ups to you Anthony.
Better than Run The Jewels 2? OK... Each to their own...
I think it&#39;s important to realize that had another rapper attempted such a conceptual album such as this, he (she) would not have had the funds to engineer the sounds and utilize all of the different people who put forth into this album. Yeah, another rapper could convey the same messages as as kendrick, but it would not have gotten the recognition because kendrick, as he has already grown to fame, has more resources to work with. More money to invest. That&#39;s what makes this album so perfect, because kendrick used all of his pieces that he was given to mold near-perfection.¬†<br><br>A lottttt of people will be gettin&#39; paid for this album.¬†<br><br>And no, anyone else who would have made this album would not have gotten a rating of 10/10- or a 6/10, for that matter. It would&#39;ve been more on a Section 80 level, which Fantano gave a LIGHT 8. Conservative, but rewarding.¬†
I&#39;m usually not too fond of hip hop, but this album is a whole different story. Epic
If this is a masterpiece then so is Canibus first album. 
A1
THAT&#39;S CAUSE 2PAC IS STILL ALIVE
After one play through, I thought this album was just ok. ¬†I like GKMC better. ¬†For the record, I played Tetsuo &amp; Youth once and thought it was album of the year (doubt it&#39;ll happen).
Bones to pick... I see what you did there!
He just gave a detailed and layered review of the album that lasted almost thirty minutes and people are still asking how can you give a complex review without listening to the album for two weeks straight.¬†<br><br>Lyric interpretation and finding out whether or not like an album isn&#39;t as hard as you guys would make it seem.
theneedledrop¬†You have redeemed yourself with this review. Well done
Complexion is so gooooooooddddd
Did any non rap fans went and listened to this album?
Before this Kendrick Lamar album, I haven&#39;t felt such a strong connection to a rap album since Kanye West&#39;s Late Registration. Truly dope and To Pimp A Butterfly deserved the 10.
AW SHIT! 10 OUTTA 10! 10 OUTTA 10!
just dropping some knowledge to mr. fantano for the love of hip hop- but the word &#39;emcee&#39; is not gender specific, so using &#39;female emcee&#39; as opposed to &#39;femcee&#39; is more appropriate! cheers
THE FIRST 10
100% agree
Despite Anthony&#39;s chastisement, I felt Kendrick&#39;s worldview was simplistic on this album. ¬†It didn&#39;t stop me from enjoying it or the review.
I think GKMC is the best kedrick album
I have yet to give this album a listen, but I decided to watch the review to get a feel before I gave TPAB a listen. After watching his (pretty good) review, I went to the comment section to see what people think. Look, Kendrick is an extraordinary artist, but that doesn&#39;t mean Drake, Lil Wayne, or any of the other &quot;mainstream&quot; artists aren&#39;t. They each have their pros and cons. They each have their own style and personality. 
J Cole album I thought was the album of the year (even though 2014) then Drake&#39;s dropped I thought &quot;man this is hard as fuck&quot; but To Pimp a Butterfly is timeless, real, complex, funky, lyrical and most importantly socially-aware. It will be his&quot;Late Registration&quot; or his &quot;Illmatic&quot; or even his &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot; 10/10 and overall album of the year.. So far..
In the song these walls in the last verse i believe he is having sex with the girlfriend of the man who shot his friend at the end of swimming pools in gkmc. The man got caught later on that night. 
Jazz hop. Kendrick evolved into a jazz rapper. I seen it coming with that Section 80 album. This album is a classic. Kendrick didn&#39;t go pop.¬†
An album with only 4 good songs get a 10/10? seinfeldimout.gif
ILLMATIC will forever be the best rap album hands down
this album makes me wanna be a better young black male
THAT ENDING!!!!!!!!!!!!! you&#39;re a visionary with the reviews. a deep thank you for what you do anthony. it&#39;s like a phd dissertation each time you break down an album. genius.
a 10! am i dreaming? lol, it is such a dope album though. i had to listen to it a couple times to appreciate it more
No
People that hated this album expected another GKMC üòÇüòÇüòÇ
only song i hate is alright..i think pharrell forced himself on that album. just doesn&#39;t sync with the whole album
You are amazing 
the girl he is talking about¬† in these walls is a girl&#39;s who boyfriend killed his friend in sing about me
Yep spot on! Its a 10 all the way, i actually prefer it to good kid mad city by a fraction simply because he had no care for &quot;hit tracks&quot;. The production was 10/10  and there isn&#39;t one track i think to skip, im still undecided on my fav track. Momma, Hood Politics, Mortal Man, Alright, totally agree on the track I the live version sounds 3 times better and i appreciate it more listening to the album but i always knew that would of been the case when i first listened to the track as his albums are always cohesive and full of depth. Amazing best rapper since Nas and Pac period! 

Overrated!<br><br>More like a 9<br><br>U is a terrible song
listening to Jenny Death while reading the comments...
KENDRICK THINKS WHITE PEOPLE SUCK!
To the people who liked the album, I&#39;m glad, I also loved this album, I enjoyed it just as much as Mr. Fantano<br><br>To the people who didn&#39;t like the album, or the review, I&#39;m sorry for your displeasure<br><br>To the Kendrick stans, stop attacking people, it&#39;s fucking retarded<br><br>Enjoy the music, enjoy the videos, be civil or fuck off
Kendrick sounds like j cole
I have not yet connected with this album. My history with Kendrick has required time for his albums to set in. I don&#39;t really know if I like this album. I mean there was some cringe worthy lyrics boo boo. I disagree there is many better socially conscious rap albums.<br>Dead Prez: Lets Get Free<br>The Coup: Kill my Landlord<br>Immortal Technique: Revolutionary Vol 1 &amp; 2<br>If you are interested in social conscious rap albums.¬†
WOW 10. Very Rare well deserving a masterpiece!
&quot;Best rap album of the decade...&quot;<br><br><b>cosigns</b>
If you didn&#39;t like this album sad to say your still a caterpillar in a cocoon. 
Classic review for Pearl Jam&#39;s Vs./Vitalogy or Nirvana&#39;s Nevermind?
this album was just funny. ¬†I couldnt take this shit seriously
the Crip is the Caterpillar<br>the Blood is the Butterfly<br><br>2 Pimp A Butterfly = 2PAB<br><br>It could&#39;ve been: 2 Pimp A Caterpillar = 2PAC<br><br>But k. dot used to be more affiliated with the bloods and you know they dont spell with the C,<br>So it is 2PAB
Yeezy Season was approaching. Then this happened.
Okay, I&#39;m a huge Kendrick fan. By far my favorite rapper. And I loved the album. But... I can&#39;t be the only one who thought it was a little boring in some parts? These Walls, Complexion, You Ain&#39;t Gotta Lie, Mortal Man, Wesley&#39;s Theory, King Kunta, Blacker the Berry, and Alright are all amazing songs though.¬†
the first half of this album is impossible to listen too for me.¬†
It&#39;s all a matter of perspective. Some may like the album more than others. If you&#39;re gonna argue about wether or not this album is good at least have a credible opinion. Or just shutup &amp; try to appreciate good music. 
are you afraid of running out of clean water?
anyone know of a to pimp a butterfly vinyl release?
at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=654">10:54</a> did anyone else yell &quot;I gotta bone to pick&quot; like Kendrick says on king kunta?
Section .80 got an 8/10<br>good kid m.A.A.d city got a 9/10<br>To Pimp a Butterfly got a 10/10<br>The next time Kendrick releases a new album, Anthony will become Kendrick.<br>
May To Pimp a Butterfly do onto shitty rap music what Nevermind did to onto shitty rock music.¬†
are you afraid of running out of clean water?
The fact the uploaded before release=view whores nobody cares lol
I agree it&#39;s not the best album but I understand the message. NO MORE MAINSTREAM MUSIC üëå
fuck these new school trap rappers. kendrick lamar is a pussy. I want more of the oldschool type shit like back when ludacris, nelly, chingy, big tymers and the ying yang twins dropping new shit every week.
Is this the first album he ever rated a 10/10?
Yes! A 10!
Wait, I thought the song &quot;Alive&quot; was going to be on this album. You know, the song that was in the Beats commercial with Dr. Dre? The Pyrex, or whatever? It&#39;s a cool song so where is it?
Great review to a great album! Thank you!¬†
Yes...down to earth. ¬†I&#39;m glad our research of down to earth music has resulted in needledrop believing we are in fact, from earth. ¬†Kendrick makes glorious music but to me his lyrics sound like <a href="http://upworthy.com">upworthy.com</a>
YEAH 10 !¬†
The second i saw how long this review was i knew it was amazing.
Fuck yeah! i&#39;m glad anthony liked this album, its probably my favorite rap album to date.
B4.DA.$$ &gt;&gt; TPaB 
been listening since the kendrick lamar ep. glad that he is top dawg in the game right now
hood politics is the best song on there the samples the flow the lyrics spont on overall its a masterpiece diffrent to anything i&#39;ve heard, great job though B4DA$$ is another good one give that a listen too people
If you are a Real Hip Hop fan you enjoy this Album is a Piece of Art. If you are a Casual Fan, or just enjoy beats, this is not for YOU! 
That sounds like a 360 type contract.
Finally. FUCKING FINALLY.
Btw ant, if u let rolling stone hire u, they will take away that special &quot;it&quot; factor u currently possess. Just my opinion though. 
I&#39;ve never seen u give a 10 b4, therefore I&#39;m gonna have to cop this. Btw Anthony coolasfucktano i really enjoy ur reviews,  even if I don&#39;t necessarily agree. Good bye, forever. 
Five seconds in and I already feel this thing is gonna get atleast a strong 9.
To Pimp A Butterfly is not for everyone, that&#39;s why I love it. 
It&#39;s hard to listen to anything else after this album. Thanks Kendrick, for single handedly making all of my other favorite rappers trash.
Is it strange that I sort of got a chill when I saw the 10/10 in the description?
I just find it slightly ironic how critics (not even Anthony tbh just some critics in general) praise this album for its complexity while down playing the complexity of Tetsuo &amp; Youth.
RUNNING THROUGH THE SIX WITH MY WOES!! Fuck y&#39;all hipster niggas. maad city was better. the only good songs are hood politics and institutionalized¬†
TRACK REVIEW GRIEF BY EARL SWEATSHIRT. 
Everyone&#39;s so quick to shout &quot;fanboyism&quot; whenever this man gives a positive score. Give Kendrick the props he deserves. Clearly a lot of hard work went into this fantastic album. No need to hate.
6/10 honestly gkmc was a classic and I won&#39;t be listening to this lp more than a couple weeks from now just my opinion like the message and he&#39;s trying to be original but tpab is ok imo
Beautiful masterpiece is an understatement. Again, STOP POSTING REVIEWS 2 DAYS AFTER HEARING THE MUSIC. ALBUMS ARE MEANT TO BE HEARD THROUGH A PERIOD OF TIME YOU CANT POSSIBLE REVIEW A WHOLE ALBUM IN A DAY OR TWO.  
Thanks Dadtano! Got to go pick up my daughter from school. Tell you what I thought after.
The people that don&#39;t like the &#39;music&#39; on this album first need to listen to:¬†<br>1. Parliament-Funkadelic: EVERYTHING from the 70s<br>2. Zapp and Roger most of their hits<br>3. Sly and the Family Stone: Fresh and There&#39;s a Riot going on<br>4. Miles Davis: Bitches Brew<br>5. Coltrane: Blue Train<br>6. Thelonious monk: Solo Monk<br>7. All of Dr. Dre&#39;s productions especially the 90s g funk era<br>8. All of Tupac&#39;s albums<br>And be up to date on the political tumult that&#39;s going on in the African American community right now and has been going on for a long time.¬†<br>Only then you can understand this album and criticize it seriously. It&#39;s futile otherwise because you simply haven&#39;t opened your musical ear enough to understand where Kendrick&#39;s coming from.¬†
I like how this guy criticizes Lupe for preaching, but Kendrick has an album where the whole thing is preaching to his black people, and he gets a 10 and he&#39;s god. LOL¬†
Stop comparing artists
Am i the only one who hated this album
Should have talked about Complexion a little more. One of the strongest tracks. 
you know how singers put an acoustic version of thier album ¬†with the same songs just ¬†on acoustic. i think it will be so crazy if kendrick ¬†put the same album &amp; lyrics on trap and drill beats. is that to much to ask for? it could be just a social experiment or something some one should do that ! it;ll be sicker
Kendrick is something else... something else
2park :)
you spoke everything I thought while listening to the album front to back. this album is beautiful and people who don&#39;t love and appreciate music simply won&#39;t understand it.¬†<br><br>you did this album justice with the review, for some reason I thought deep down you&#39;d give this a 10. ¬†AND THE KILLER MIKE LINE!! This record is the truth.¬†
Cal&#39;s excitement at the rating was my exact reaction.
Before this came out i thought &quot;Kendrick&#39;s new album is going to fail, there is no way he can make something better than gkmc&quot; then when i heard the album I was confused. I was thinking how genius is this guy where does his musical abilities end. It was an amazing album and i will never doubt Kendrick again!
Your day of salvation finally came, Fantano: Jenny Death is already on the internet
I know I said this after GKMC but honestly where can he go from this? It doesn&#39;t get more creative and lyrical than this... If he does any better than this I think my head will explode
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=620">10:20</a>
I like this album but I like J.Cole album better
¬†this is a¬†strong* 7/ llight*8¬† there is no reasoning with internet sheep hiphop &quot;fans&quot; <b>COUGHstansCOUGH</b>
I&#39;m white so I have to wait for Godspeed and Sufjan to come out at the very end of the month before I can be excited about March&#39;s releases.<br><br><br> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justwhiteboithings">#justwhiteboithings</a>  :(
AMAZING ALBUM!!!!!!!.......besides the lack of melody and versatility in instrumentals and because of this it becomes boring over some time ..8/10
The reason I think this album is a milestone in hip hop is because ANYONE who appreciates good music, no matter what genre they&#39;re into, can dig it. Sonically one of the best albums of all time. If you didn&#39;t get it the first time, take a second listen trust me it&#39;s that good.
I disagree with the score due to Kendricks weird new inflections and the lack of catchy hooks. Nevertheless the quality of this album is remarkable. Kendrick versatility in content and delivery is remarkable but I really miss the &quot;good kid&quot; production even if it posses&#39;s the negative connotation of being &quot;more accessible&quot;. I loved your analysis of this album tho. Nice work Tanthony Mantano.
HEY HEY GUYS I HAVE A NEW THING TO CONTRIBUTE<br>&quot;DICKRIDERS&quot;<br>THIS WORD SIGNIFIES INSIGHT AND ANALYSIS THANK YOU FOR LISTENING
I thought this album got too absurd. I think they went overboard with the production and forgot about taking the listener on a musical journey rather than a lyrical one. This album was made for the critics to ponder as they look through old dusty funk records connecting the dots. Something about Kendricks earlier material had more to bite on and I connected more with it. This album seemed overworked. I don&#39;t think I will even give it more than 4 listens.

You hit the nail on that review. This is another classic album in my eyes and kendrick hasn&#39;t let me down yet.
Great video and review 
Completely agree with you.
This review was phenomenal. It&#39;s amazing how almost everything you noticed were things my friend and I were talking about. Even from what you were saying about Good Kidd maad city. It&#39;s a breathe of fresh air hearing things like this from like minds. I&#39;m definitely gonna subscribe. 
I delve into rap every now and them - it&#39;s not a genre I&#39;m passionate about but it is one I respect. Just finished listening through this for the first time and holy shit man... this was soooo good.
Play freebird
Is this the first 10 he&#39;s given
This album was great! Not every artist you like is going to stay with the current sound, this is pushing his music to a different realm. Some you you are allergic to progression. The beats don&#39;t have to sound &quot;mainstream&quot; give the man his proper respect to experiment.
Before I listen too this album I had no idea how much of a change in sound I needed to hear in hip hop cause real talk I was getting really bored with the rap scene but this album goes beyond hip hop musically its like a soulful PSA told in a story
Your dead vs. TPAB... AND GO!
Been listening to this all week. I loved the previous album but To Pimp a Butterfly is one of the most dissapointing albums this year. Sure there are moments where the material stands aside his previous album, and Kendrick is a brilliant storyteller. But half of the album is all experimentation little substance. Some of the tracks lack any hooks and really doesnt have anything substantial to latch onto.
Splendid review Anthony! And of course fantastic album by Kendrick, loved at first listen... The &quot;poem&quot; you talk about that reveals  itself during the tracklist is one of the most original and pleasuring methods of storytelling I ever listened on a record
I really like the lyrics on King Kunta, but oh my God, the production makes me want to square up. 
HOW DARE YOU SKIP OVER FOR SALE? LIKE THAT.<br>may be the most important message in the album<br>LUCY really is everywhere trying to destroy us.
What the fuck happened to the editing at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=752">12:32</a> hahaha
Being raised in South Central, Los Angeles for the majority of my life puts me at an advantage when I listen to this album. I can truly understand Lamar&#39;s frustrations and aspirations in this album. He is the most important rapper right now. He speaks to our community like nobody else has since 2pac and Biggie. Listening to TPAB makes me proud to come from South Central because it proves that the hood matters.¬†
To pimp a butterfly isn&#39;t a classic... it&#39;s a MASTERPIECE!! 
Jenny Death leaked. You already knew that tho.
Somewhere out there macklemore is masturbating with this album in the background.
Ima beak it down for y&#39;all. First of all I&#39;m not a Kendrick Stan nor a bandwagon from GKMC. This album is a good solid album! Not a masterpiece, not amazing, but also not trash or a let down. It&#39;s concept/message is amazing, but the production isn&#39;t up to pat with that, not saying it&#39;s bad just at times cluttered and repetitive. In my honest opinion he didn&#39;t even drop the best album this year, Tetsuo and Youth is AOTY, and if you haven&#39;t checked it out, you definitely should.
Kendrick Lamar destroyed the rap game with this album.
I love this album but Jenny Death..... iss... Amazing...
I DON‚ÄôT LIKE SHIT
I love this guy and how he talks about music and albums.
I must say that I completely agree with you on this. Such an amazing album! Also, great review.¬†
They said negative opinions sound more intelligent than positive ones but you&#39;re praising this album and it&#39;s probably one of the most well-composed opinions I&#39;ve ever seen. Holy shit. How does Anthony the Mantano do it?
Wesley&#39;s theory ,King kunta , these walls, institutionalized  , u , alright ,i,  and the blacker the berry  where the standout songs for me in the album <br> <br><br> it was nothing I expected , didn&#39;t really think it was that amazing at first but then the last song.... Mortal man blew my mind on how the whole album adds up  with the interview with tupac and that poem at the end about the caterpillar pimping into a butterfly which sums up  the feelings  in every song  in the album in that one poem ! Like holy crap !  This guy is a master story teller 
For once I agree with every single word Anthony said. It&#39;s a shame people would hear one song of this album and call it trash. The album is a masterpiece
a well deserved 10. great album. great album review. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23topimpabutterfly">#topimpabutterfly</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23kingkendrick">#kingkendrick</a>
This album is shit,<br>Kendrick is shit 
how many albums has Anthony given a 10 to now?
This album floors me every time. I can&#39;t believe Kendrick pulled this off when so many other people thought it couldn&#39;t get better than GKMC but goddammit he did it. 
do blur&#39;s new single now
Damn, God forbid Anthony be a Kendrick Lamar fan and give all his albums a good review. I guess that&#39;s what they calling bias now
How do you like this album but not 2014 forest hills drive I don&#39;t understand 
people who say this album is trash really can&#39;t stand the fact that this isn&#39;t commercial friendly.not saying they don&#39;t have taste in music but their taste has been minimized to radio hits and bangers.and this album is beyond that,and saying it&#39;s trash because there&#39;s a message with actual substance is simply immature and lame
No Vaseline..................N.W.A<br>Real Compton City G&#39;s..................Dre&amp;Snoop<br>Hit&#39;em Up.......................Notorious Big&amp;Diddy<br>Mac Stabba................Mac Mall<br>Ether.............................................Jay-Z<br><br><br>   HOOD POLITICS............EVERYONE!!!!!<br>                 <br>                                                                  <br>                                                                      <br>
Anthony normally avoids the hyperbole pretty well could it be that since his review is coming up on the day that this album came out is that why he&#39;s calling it the album of the decade?
THANK YOU!!!!
Let&#39;s be honest, this album was trash..
I can&#39;t believe that one guy gave this ¬†a D+¬†
<b>GET READY FOR ANOTHER 10 FANTANO BECAUSE JENNY DEATH JUST LEAKED</b>
i don&#39;t understand with the whole &quot;FUCK DRAKE KENDRICK IS REAL MUSIC&quot; sentiment. I like Drake a lot and also like Kendrick a lot. They&#39;re completely different and nearly impossible to compare.
Yo that track &quot;Hood Politics&quot; is so bad, 2 Chainz wouldn&#39;t even guest on it.
In my Opinion, If you&#39;re sure you want to hear this album you should have a open mind, a really open mind.<br>You need to look at the album as a whole and should interpret it like a book or movie!<br>I expected &quot;To Pimp A Butterfly&quot; with a slight different context. As a whole I give to the album 7/10. The lyrics are great, but the beats in most of all songs are not that good.<br>Although, gave me the impression of nostalgic and self portraited.<br>Expected a different type of song featured George Clinton with more G-Funk.¬†Still liked it.<br>I think the album should&#39;ve had more activistic/revolutionary songs like The Blacker the Berry. More beats like Wesley&#39;s Theory, Complexion, King Kunta and The Blacker The Berry, as well.¬†Didn&#39;t liked specially the style variants in some songs.<br>When Kendrick emerged, I thought he would be an &quot;activist&quot; with much more impact and a game changer, but I was completely mistaken. He will might introduce his own style but will not change the hip-hop genre and &quot;save&quot; us against today&#39;s bullshit.<br>Top Songs - Wesley&#39;s Theory, The Blacker The Berry, King Kunta, Complexion and i.
Review the Blue scholars
Review the Blue scholars¬†
His flow on King Kunta sounds Cal Chuchesta inpsired. Glad to see him respecting such powerful influences
From Chance the Rapper and the SoX group using trumpets to Kendrick TPAB album and the use of sax, I&#39;m really loving the brass influences of the current music scene
* LET&#39;S FACE IT: 3 quarters of all you people overly praising this album are Kendrick Lamar dick riders by proxy. Now, I love K-Dot. I love hip-hop (past, present, and future), but IF I wanted to listen to a funk/jazz/experimental album I would listen to one performed by a renowned funk/jazz/experimental musician; not from a rapper. Kendrick is a rapper. I appreciate experimentalism and deep themes and voice and originality and art for art&#39;s sake n&#39; all that, BUT, I wanted a strictly, hard-hitting, orthodox RAP album and a TRUE follow-up to the masterpiece that was G.K.M.C. To Pimp A Butterfly is brilliant (in) spots but is mostly just &#39;ight. Stop dick riding/ Stop lying. I am disappointed, but nice try. Peace!
Only a 30/40 + year old black person or even Kendrick fans fuck with this shit, those who say it&#39;s shit are those who think Young Thug and Lil Wayne are good, they are fucking ignorant and if they say that to you, tell them to re-listen and to digest the lyrics, if they don&#39;t leave them to dwell in their ignorance!
I&#39;ve seen this guy all over YouTube. Never seen any of his videos. I was hatin at first, but Kendrick brought me here. He&#39;s actually not bad. Keep doing your thing NeedleDrop
Kendrick thinks white people suck!
I seriously can&#39;t understand how people don&#39;t at least like or appreciate this album. I stopped listening to rap for years because it all got so similar, but this. This is some unique shit.¬†
Call King Kendrick a bird because he just shitted on everyone&#39;s musicüê¶üí©
Is this on its way to becoming the first +1M view video for Beenthony Trilltano?

The Allegory of the Cave
The progression from Good Kid to Pimp reminds me of Ice-T&#39;s progression from O.G. Original Gangster to Home Invasion. O.G. is a long, conceptual album that mostly addresses then current issues and Ice-T&#39;s experiences in the same neighborhoods, while Home Invasion is a much more all over the place album with more aggressive beats and varied lyrics and unconnected songs that are tied together by Ice-T&#39;s emotions about being dropped from Warner at the height of his success and his determination to keep going forward.<br><br>Also, the lyrical storytelling in Midnight off of O.G. by Ice-T is very similar to the storytelling in The Art of Peer Pressure by Lamar, and the similarity of the driving sequences in particular makes me curious as to whether Kendrick could have perhaps been influenced (consciously or not) by the Ice-T track.
WILL YOU PLEASE DO MARK BATTLES HES COMING UP HES LIKE KENDRICK I THINK HE WILL BE A STAR SOON!!! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE
This is album is kind of like a sister album to d&#39;angelo black messiah
Theneedledrop u da shit. Hahah. For real, I really enjoy your reviews I feel you have enough intellect to perceive albums in the manner I do. I&#39;m so glad we got reviewers like you.

Wow! Almost 200,000 views in 24 hours. This is definitely gonna be Fantano&#39;s first million view video! Congrats!
This album is not 10/10<br>Hear me out <br>The lyrics in the album are quality like 10/10 kendrick goes really deep and doesn&#39;t rap about any bullshit which most rappers these days do. But rap isn&#39;t just about lyrics <br>The beats in this album are awful <br>If a track has the best lyrics but sounds awful in general then overall it isn&#39;t a good track cos you won&#39;t want to listen to it 
How can Kendrick be racist if Taylor Swift is his best friend? lol Haven&#39;t had a chance to listen to this in full, but its like he&#39;s &quot;reaching back into the past&quot; to help teach us something, get in touch with his roots and attract the older generation. ¬†
So TPaB finished on my ipod and it went straight into Good Kid Maad City, it was weird but it felt so seemless.
Where can I buy Dr. Dre&#39;s &quot;The chronic&quot; ?
So u hate Big Sean Album but loves Kendrick New Album  clearly the world is coming to the end 
for the love of hip hop listen to the album more than once
Whitethony Guiltano
I think this album is a masterpiece and it&#39;s crafted incredibly well, but it only works for me if I treat it like a book or movie. I gotta start from the beginning and go all the way through. For example, &quot;u&quot; literally feels like a scene out of a movie, so it&#39;s weird when it randomly comes on shuffle. There are only a couple of songs I can listen to on their own and really enjoy, but mostly it feels better as a whole. Does anyone else feel this way?
finally!!! awesome review
Kendrick made me rethink politics, racism, music, and society and I never think that stuff entirely through till I heard this album. 
Hey Anthony where can I buy that shirt?
Finally some one gets it. Great album!
I rarely agree with Anthony but this review is dead on and I could not agree more with every word he said!
Wowww
Anthony, what&#39;s the title of that Boris Gardiner song again?
Ainthony Freetano
Okay record, but I would listen to Jedi Mind Tricks, AOTP, Necro and Ill Bill any day over this.
Finally i see a 10 rating on one of your videos....now i must check this out
I don&#39;t know if it was intentional or a coincidence that Dr. Dre&#39;s &quot;The Chronic&quot; album on the right side while reviewing Kendrick&#39;s... Mmmm
Kendrick is a special artist......he might be my fav rapper over Jay Z and Nas.......
Album of the decade period.
Album of the year. Not rap album of the year...ALBUM of the year. Too early to say really but so far looks promising.
7-8/10 for me. The concept is sincere and elaborate and consistently woven. However, I do like some of the instrumentals but i find some of them pretentious in the sense they appear out of place, the bass on Wesley&#39;s theory is all over the place. I cannot enjoy the instrumental when it sounds like two antithetical tracks overlapping that clash. I feel the same for a few other tracks, the instrumentals do not seem coherent or well-matched. I do respect this album, but I think Good Kid is the most entertaining album even if the concept is more densely integrated on this album.¬†
Being a fan of Flying Lotus, and Thundercat I loved this album on the first spin 
&#39;i&#39; is the best song on the album btw.
Decent album. Some average as fuck songs, some pretty great songs. But apparently one of the best albums of all time. Apparently. Apparently.
I can&#39;t help but think some songs would have been much better if an actual SINGER was on those funky, jazzy, neo-soul beats instead of Kendrick rapping on it. It&#39;s the main problem for me. It ruins some of the songs despite the quality of Kendrick&#39;s lyrical content. The beats aren&#39;t bad at all, it&#39;s just that Kendrick&#39;s rap doesn&#39;t fit with it at all in my opinion. Somes tracks are fucking good though but the Blacker the Berry is the best track imo because Kendrick actually sounds good with this kind of beat. But huge risk taking ¬†with this album cause it sounds like no other hip-hop albums, you got to give him credit for that.
Next level music on this album. first time i listened i was kinda put off. this album is like nothing i have ever heard before. its barely hip hop. its just kendrick lamar. this is the kind of album music fans wait for all the time. something different from everything else they&#39;ve heard before. crazy.
Dude, review The Warm Up and Friday Night Lights by J. Cole. 
What are your favs from the album? Mines are u, for free?, and how much does a dollar cost
you do nirvana albums?
This album is album of the century 
Amazing! I have been waiting to hear something like this for a long time. It&#39;s a 70s funk record, jazzy Herbie Hancock Head Hunters. Drum patterns sound reminiscent of the great J Dilla. Dr Dre strings dropping in and out. It takes itself a little too serious at times but considering its &quot;musicality&quot; and &quot;message&quot; it&#39;s a serious piece of art montage.
I listened to this album in full yesterday just before is was heading out to a photoshoot and i was awestruck. Honestly, the sky seemed bluer and the sun just seemed that bit brighter. That evening we had an absolutely beautiful pink/ purple/ orange sunset and with the songs of this album reverberating in my head it made for a wonderfully blissful experience.<br><br>I&#39;ve been on this earth nearly 22 years and i can&#39;t recall an album that had this kind of effect on me. It&#39;s simple wonderful...
I&#39;ve never liked Kendrick but decided to listen to this on a whim and thoroughly enjoyed it, particularly the soul and funk samples.¬†
Great review! And I&#39;m not just saying that because I&#39;m biased in favour of the album. I actually think you did a great job evaluating the positives and the negatives (which I was too biased to even acknowledge, so thanks for breaking me out of my deluded state) to come to your conclusion.
Kendrick is starting off as flawlessly as Nas did, if not more
Lol how funny would it have been if anthony made this vid just saying &quot;yes yes yes yes&quot;
I&#39;ve been following for some years off another account, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen you this enthusiastic. Great review<br>¬†
Like if u got goosebumps when u first heard Tupac on Mortal Man.
I almost feel like To Pimp A Butterfly forces a retroactive review of D&#39;Angelo&#39;s Black Messiah, as it feels like they&#39;re coming out of the same wonderful sonic cosmos. I don&#39;t use the ten-point scale myself, but I dropped in to hear your ten-point review. Sadly, now I don&#39;t have time! Looking forward to listening.
Good job fandango
TEN OUT OF TEN?!?!?!?!
shit 22 munuts
Could you do a review on Skepta&#39;s album/mixtape Blacklisted? I&#39;d like to hear your opinion on it
2pab shud have been called 2pac... 2 pimp a caterpillar 
 Whhhhaaaattttt finally I see him give a 10
i almost cried at the second part of u that shit was beautiful¬†
&quot;Muh racial injustice&quot;<br>YEEZUS is better
Pls review the new CHON ):
To me Hood Politics is closure for Kendrick on what his foundation represents and what lessons he has been able to take from the hood in order to move in the industry and form larger opinions on politics and the actions/priorities of others.  It seems like at the same time he&#39;s aware that these views are harsh but realizes these views have helped propel him to where he is today
I feel like this album is going to be treated like OutKast&#39;s Aquemini. An ambitious album that experimented with the artist&#39;s style while still maintaining the integrity and the appeal of the artist. And GKMC is going to be treated like OutKast&#39;s ATLiens. An album that maintains what the artist builds and further builds and improves upon it, with long time fans coming in for what they expected from the artist and newcomers not feeling left out.¬†<br><br>I&#39;m not saying one is better than the other, I&#39;m just saying. I won&#39;t be surprised to see in the future, fans are heavily split between two of the best albums the artist had made.
(Kendrick Lamar is the only hip hop artist/rapper that is talking about real life problems and racism/discrimination/self-esteem and his transformation as a person/artist and how he is able to keep the music alive and pure.) vs modern Kanye west or jay z or drake where all they do is flex and play who has the bigger dick. This album is the shit and I hope it changes people&#39;s perspective cause this generation needs it they&#39;ve been washed out of character.
Review liturgy- the art work and father- who&#39;s gonna get fucked first? 
track review grief by earl sweatshirt!
This album is beyond amazing.
Why are people so butt hurt over what fantano gives albums? It&#39;s his fucking opinion. Don&#39;t watch his reviews and then complain that he doesn&#39;t think the same way you do. Y&#39;all sound like elementary school babies. Grow the f*** up.
Thanx fanfano!! Very informative man! One of ur best reviews yet!
Can i ask you to stop doing subliminal to anchor the users attention please, i just find it quit disturbing as people come hear to hear a quality opinion.¬†
As soon as everyone realizes there opinion is not fact then we can all move on
Anthony said &quot;it&#39;s four AM, I&#39;m going to bed&quot; three times. A triangle as three sides. Anthony is illuminati confirm BUT WAIT IT DOSNT STOP THERE!! HE GAVE THE ALBUM A 10 AND HE RAERLY DOSE THIS! WHY DID HE GIVE IT A 10?! TO FOOL YOU IN TO LISTENING TO THE ALBUM WHICH THE ILLUMINATI IS BEHIND!!! ILLUMINATI!!!!!!! <br><br><br><br>In all seriousness this album really did break some walls for me 
 Anthony I think you&#39;re spot on with your thoughts I agree with you 100 percent I recently saw the record spins review of this album and I have to say I&#39;m pretty disappointed and stevens close mindedness to this album I have talked to him before about his preference in rap maybe we&#39;re just looking for two different things in a genre we both love
loving these longer reviews
&quot; I would like to thank my nigga Lil B for ghostwriting part of the album, he has been a great influence&quot;- Kendrick Lamar (2015)
Imagine he went no no no no no for 22 minutes 
Sufjan Stevens :)
First I was like, a 10? What? Then I gave it a couple more listens... Thank god I did that.
So far this year is ¬†fantastic for hip hop. I hope this keeps up!
Hey Mr. Fantano, I can&#39;t help but think this is the peak of a new Soulquarian generation. Just look at the personnel on Common&#39;s Electric Circus and that of Butterfly and the similarities are undeniable. So many talented musicians on both things - I take my hat off for Pharrell en Bilal for still being around. Shit, even sonically this is reminiscent of Phrenology and Electric Circus.¬†
i knew it!!! i knew this album will get 10/10.¬†
Up next is Kendrick&#39;s collab album with J. Cole!
Big sean is as good as kendrick
strong late 80&#39;s Prince-Flavour in this one. Black Album, Sign o the times.... Absolutely epic. Congenial review.
ALL ABORD THE HYPE TRAIN!!
the needle drop could be peter Rosenberg from hot 97 son look at him !!! supa good review bruh !!! 
This is a great album. I love how it&#39;s stirring up all this commotion and debating. But overall people should stop focusing on sale numbers and more on the message given to us through TPAB.
I feel sorry for you if you didn&#39;t enjoy this album. You&#39;re honestly missing out my friend. All I can say is that the more you listen to this album, the more you enjoy it every time. And the funny thing is that I&#39;m not even into Funk, Jazz or even a hardcore Kendrick fan but truth be told when I hear something good and this is beyond genius!
This is my favorite album of the past 5 years.. And I am not even into hip hop like that lol normally into black metal/emo/hardcore etc
this album is trash.¬† anthony seems to go on and on trying to justify this album and its 10 rating.¬† a 22 minute review? really.
It&#39;s not as good at recovery 
I also think he&#39;s trying to copy 2pac with these statements he&#39;s making at the concerts was that even real the last bit ??? Sounds like it was recorded in a studio...<br><br>I think he&#39;s gotta say a lot more on his records before he can start mouthing off. <br><br>U got a album to get some shit off your chest and on king kunta he don&#39;t get going to the last verse .<br><br>Only 1 verse on wesleys theory üòí
If this album was amazing / classic / masterpiece I would love every song. <br><br>I don&#39;t love every song. Maybe 2 or 3 tracks i can say that.<br><br>There&#39;s a lot of awesome music on this album. <br><br>And it&#39;s a good addition to kendricks catalogue. <br><br>But rating it 10/10 or calling it classic is a step too far. <br><br>King kunta could of been better maybe if that baseline was all the way through instead of saying a line then waiting then another. It has amazing potential.<br><br>And having a skit as the 2nd track ? Didn&#39;t really get that ... Maybe as a intro or something but not the 2nd<br><br>The track with the crying wears thin. Heard it done before replay value is zilch <br><br>These walls is classic Kendrick tho  <br><br><br><br>
Standing ovation for Anthony. This album is revolutionary, a game changer. The bar has been raised. Best hip hop album of the decade for sure. Scholarly. JENNY DEATH SOON
Great review, well done Fantano!
Like if u came back just to check the views :v 
J Coles album ... People who like beats will like j Coles album but in terms of hip-hop he really talks a load of bollocks... Think being broke was better ... Wtf is he talking about ???<br><br>Then half the tracks he sings on ... Then having the crown and smashing it on the floor ...<br><br>I rate j Cole but replay value for fhd is short. <br><br>He doesn&#39;t say anything noteworthy 
Least favorite track u ain&#39;t gotta lie ? That&#39;s 1 of the best the soulful beat and the way he comes in at the end with that dope verse . <br><br>Your crazy 
Now imagine if J. Cole made this exact same album he would of given it a 6
6 better lyricist than over rated Kendrick.<br><br>Young Thug:<br>&quot;MY DIAMONDS, THEY SAY PIKACHU...they say pikachu...I&#39;m a boss I walk through the club and just peek at you&quot;<br><br>Lil Wayn:<br>&quot;Yes, I do it big, call me little astronomical, Weezy F.

I m clad to hear he took inspiration from our Country (South African) because were similiar inspired by he south african tour.Good Hiphop!
FANTANO FOR PRESIDENT!
This album is just not good
Good album but definitely not better then 2014 FHD
To drop a needle, well done sir
10!! Yes!!! 
To Pimp A Butterfly draws the line between people who enjoy the real roots of hip hop and &#39;bling&#39; hip hop. Thank you K Dot.
Man I&#39;m so glad kendrick chose the artistic path rather than selling out and just trying to make club singles or some shit.... this is a cohesive piece of art... The kind of album best when listened to front to back.  Mainstream hip hop has been missing this for a long time.  
You&#39;re left handed.
10/10<br>Being a big 90&#39;s hip-hop fan, this album was astonishing and uncompromising, something 2pac would&#39;ve been very proud of. 2pac being his idol--just like J. Cole--it really tells you the way they view life and their values.  <br><br>My favorite track at the moment is &quot;Institutionalized&quot; 
Y&#39;all know this is just my opinion, right?¬†
this guy cant review for shit. i agree with everyone saying that this album rocks but when this guy talks about it i just wanna throw up. im here because he rated my favorite artist&#39;s album pretty fucken low, and obviously i can say that that album is better than kendricks.
I&#39;d still slightly put GKMC over this album. I see where this was so brilliant in manys minds but I&#39;m more of a storytelling type of guy and GKMC really told an exquisite story. This album was definitely great but it could&#39;ve used a bit more hardcore rap imo. Overall, 9.2 for me on this. 9.8 on GKMC. 
great album, but I think good kid maad city is still better musically and lyrically.¬†<br><br>people are giving this album a higher score because they&#39;re all on the hype train.
Felt the exact same way. Good job Funkthany Hiptano
Like this new album, this review deserves another listen 
Fantano didn&#39;t want to give this album a lower rating because he was scared
You do realize the title of the album &quot;to Pimp a Butterfly&quot; is talking specifically about how white America is enslaving black America all over again right? The pimp, being white America and the butterfly, being black America. And the reason every single song on here is gospel, jazzy and Funkish  is because of these few points:<br><br>1. The black man created rock n roll which led to jazz, blues, swing and more. Kendrick is playing homage to these original styles/genres of music and is putting an emphasis on it because it falls in line with &quot;black people are trying to keep their sense of freedom.&quot;<br><br>2. Kendrick is from Compton, grew up listening to Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and Outkast. Even Biggie and Tupac. All of these artist are Southern California (except for biggie and Outkast of course). So the funky vibe is all California!<br><br>People who are saying he&#39;s being experimental and that this Kendrick is different are all wrong. This is the Kendrick that has been with us all along, but because of white America wanting to create the &quot;thug&quot; type of hip-hop music, he hasn&#39;t been able to share this side of himself until now.<br><br>This album is an instant classic and a masterpiece, and will surpass both Section.80 and GKMC in all shapes and forms of philosophical, emotional and real ness. KING KENDRICK HAS DELIVERED US A BLESSING WITH TO PIMP A BUTTERFLY!
Great review man, I&#39;ve learned I can trust your opinions and analyses, watching this after I&#39;ve listened and dissected the album. There&#39;s just something very interesting about the album that makes it better the more you go back and listen again. Yet the negative to that is the people who skim through once expecting a GKMC sequel and don&#39;t fully endure in this as a separate entity. I love this album I can&#39;t even say which I like more because like any great works they both offer so many good things it&#39;s hard to pick one. Anyway, great review for a great album
Kendrick fans are pathetic af. Even worse than Kanye&#39;s. 
Great review, Ant. (fam call you Ant?) I WOULD love a transcripted version of it...
I agree cal
If you&#39;re feeling so lonely and unsuccesful that you want people to reply to your comments, talk to you, or give a thumbs up, just ask for it straight up ok? I&#39;ll be happy to give you a thumbs up. There&#39;s no need to go to high traffic links and diss the artists and figures actually making real change to bait people into it.
I would love to see Anthony talk about some unpopular opinions he has.
So does anyone else see this as a grittier Tetsuo and Youth or just me? Same subject matter and jazzy beats
Will Jenny&#39;s Death get a 10/10? ¬†Find out on the next Dragon Ball Z.
too many kendrick dick riders...¬†
Whatsthony Yamstano
and i find it funny that YG is more of a hardcore gangster from blood gang los angeles and he managed to move out the hood outgrow all that negative shit and channel it into party music and love songs. Kendrick doesn&#39;t even gang bang but yet he dwells in the darkness. Good kid was better, yg is more of a positive role model from the hood, kendrick is just stuck on racism 
Yooooo this almost made me cry I knew you would give kendrick a 10 one of his albums thank youuuuu Anthony :&#39;)
everyone has a right to state their opinion in the comments but no need to shit all over his
The album isnt trash it just isnt party or radio worthy, this is an angry album, something to make u feel anger. It kinda sounds like earl sweatshirt, jazzy beats, nothing crispy or modern, no electro sounds, im more of a party guy, whats the point in being angry all the time?
aye but it wasnt a STRONG 10 though a nigga still can break a record
Wow this nigga finally gave something a 10
Give credit where its due. The needle drop has done this
I was going to wait until I get this cd in the mail from Amazon to listen to it, but I don&#39;t know if I will be able to! I have not heard one bad thing about this so far.
I love j.cole music but this album shitted all over his 
Anthony just called a bunch of y&#39;all basic though lmaoo
I hated i but its a lot better in album format. I&#39;ve been kind of resenting Kendrick a little bit which is pretty irrational because it&#39;s mainly because of dickriders. But I must say this is one of the best albums I&#39;ve ever heard. And this is coming from someone who didn&#39;t &quot;love&quot; GKMC.
Serious question. Has Kendrick reached Eminem on the top 5 list? How about biggie? I personally think he passed Pac.
&gt;While this album does have a few bones to pick<br><br>god damnit
Kendrick&#39;s next album will be a collaboration with 2PAC.¬†
blah blah blah blah blah 10/10
I&#39;m just going to call this now, and it&#39;s almost hard for me to say it knowing we have some new Kanye soon, but I&#39;m saying this is going to be my AOTY. ¬†Kendrick fucking KILLED IT. ¬†Everything from the instrumentation, the lyrics, the voice changes, and especially the MESSAGE, are perfect. ¬†I can&#39;t believe how many of my friends aren&#39;t feeling it.  I was so excited for new Kanye, but after listening and processing To Pimp A Butterfly, I won&#39;t be able to take anything Kanye says seriously.
is this the first 10 hes given? 
woah... if you want shit to change you better whipe your ass.. ¬† that may be going up on my wall
Wow not a single thing said about the song &quot;How much a dollar cost.&quot;¬†I&#39;m surprised, the¬†storytelling was incredible not to mention my jaw nearly dropped at the end! lol
Cal flopping around those invisible titties with excitement.¬†
man you dont even have the OG Chronic album gtfo
Damn man I&#39;ve been waiting  on this review  for almost 3 years...it was worth the wait. &quot;there are only so many Kendrick lamars &quot; lol. 10/10 for me as well...enjoying  this album to the fullest. 
Great review, btw your &quot;Professional Rating Source&quot; was just taken down on the Wikipedia page of this album‚Ä¶saw it there earlier today
After hearing this album, I immediately went and deleted &quot;If You Are Reading This it&#39;s Too Late&quot; from my music collection.
10/10 Damn. str8.
the more Kendrick blows up the more haters gonna hate on him.
I barely got through this album the first time I listened to it, but after the second time I was hooked. It&#39;s deserves a 10.
I loved GKMC and thought it was on the best hip hop albums written in ages! But this one idk...maybe i needa give it more listens tbh I dont know if iv changed but I preferred Drake and Lupes latest albums a lot more. Not sure if I really like the whole jazzy flylo feel to it. I respect Kendrick though in that it seems like he really wanted to make his own sound for it, but idk not my cup of tea. Also I dont really feel the whole black empowerment lyrics of this album I can&#39;t relate so yeah... ¬†
This is one the most thought-provoking, artistic, risk taking, albums Ive ever heard from the genre. The only other hip hop artist that I feel could make something like this and actually pull it off this well would be Andre 3000 and we all know he&#39;s over rapping. Kendrick Lamar was already way ahead of his time when he first dropped Overly Dedicated. This album has just cemented his name in the history of music(not just hip hop). The fact that this album is polarizing only proves how dumbed down our society is(especially amongst the so-called hip-hop heads). This is our generations &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot;; a masterpiece in every sense of the word. Many people lack the depth and will to fully take in an album this complex; this is no surprise considering how most millennials seemingly have the attention span of a house fly. I don&#39;t want to sound like I&#39;m talking down to people but it&#39;s just the truth. I saw someone below say that Drake&#39;s album was better because he has all these singles on the Billboard 100. &quot;Im in Love with the Coco&quot; was on the Billboard 100 if I&#39;m not mistaken so what does that even mean??? Radio doesn&#39;t want this kind of music on the air. It&#39;s too powerful; it FORCES you to think and they don&#39;t want you to do that. This album was so necessary for American culture right now considering how distracted everyone seems to be from the things that are really important. As much praise as it has been receiving I still feel as if it&#39;s flying under the radar. This was just so necessary; a real artist not compromising their art for the sake of a dollar and standing tall for his people on top of that even when many don&#39;t want to hear or appreciate what he has to say(they need to hear it the most). So appreciative for this. Who cares about &quot;rap album of the year&quot; this needs to win &quot;album of the year&quot;. I highly doubt anything from the hip hop genre will even come close to matching this over the next calendar year and there are some highly anticipated projects in the works. Tupac&#39;s back.
Kingthony Kuntano
Who is Lucy?
OH helllllll yea. Anthony Fantano just gave out a 10/10. If I&#39;m correct, this is only his 3rd 10/10 ever.
lol dudes knocking on the album arent familiar with anything other than that stale shit that lasts for a couple months. this joint will be timeless¬†
Review the earl track
It is time to have a honest conversation about Kendrick having the potential to be the greatest ever. Dude has dropped back to back classics in my opinion. This album felt so insanely relevant to me, it felt culturally significant. GKMC was amazing and he some how topped it. Unbelievable.¬†
Bro. Bro. Broooohh, you gave this a 10? Yes it&#39;s an amazing album, one of the best albums we&#39;ll get this year. I&#39;m fine with this score, but you gave Lupe a 7? Wtf man? IN MY OPINION lupes was better than kendrick s, but even if you disagree with me on that, According to this review you shoulda given a light-solid 9
Stop touching your jaw, what the hell is wrong with your hands? Can you not muster up self control and keep them in place?
I could seriously listen to Kendrick Lamar EP, Overly Dedicated, Section 80, GKMC &amp; TPAB anytime anyday. Truly talented artist.
It sucks that from the lack of music appreciation and general music knowledge of all genres...people conditioned to like the mainstream radio material won&#39;t be able to fully appreciate Kendrick Lamar&#39;s album. It really does take more time and effort to dissect the messages in this piece and a music background to marvel at the instrumentals used to compliment the lyrics.¬†
There is a fine line between Hip Hop and Rap. TPAB definitely draws this line, the lyrics on here were beautiful, this was REAL Rap. The first time I heard this album I was expecting something like GKMC, on the first listen of TPAB I was disappointed, but as soon as I gave it another listen I was astounded, this is an album that will grow on you. Props to Kendrick.
&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 Anthony
let me put it this way, this is real rap music. everything you hear on the radio compared to this is garbage. this isnt an album meant to be &quot;fire&quot;. this is an album meant to send a message to society. the lyricism from this guy is just unreal. in my head and from my personal opinion, he is the most complex and wholesome rapper of all time. hes taking his fame and using it to change the world. few rappers have ever done that
You know shit&#39;s serious when he does not say that pimpthony swagtano name changing shit
The brother Whoarei appears on this album, congrats man. Well deserved.¬†
The only way you could hate one could hate on this album is out of pure ignorance of one...the fundamental idea of rap and hip hop...and two...the history of music and what truly takes skill to produce. I feel like the people who are responding negatively to this album listen to the trash that is played at the club or a party all night. That type of music has its time and place, but when there is true musical value and genuine effort and talent in a record...recognize it people. If you don&#39;t get anything else from this comment...answer me this...out of the rappers you know about this very day (including the &quot;flavor of the week&quot; rappers that come out of the wood work every couple weeks with one mindless hit and then fade away) which rappers are actually making a difference in humanity with their music? And who will be talked about years from now as the forward thinking musical genius? Take some time to understand what the man says and what he is trying to do. Its beautiful once you turn on your brain.¬†
lets not act like he didn&#39;t skip past the fact that &quot;for sale&quot; is about him selling his soul to &quot;lucy&quot;(lucifer)
good 10/10 ill watch¬†
ayyy lamar
This album is bigger than racism, gang violence, self-doubt, political point of views, etc. The amount of diversity he presents throughout the album is utterly captivating. Although there are a lot of songs where he spits, sonically, this album is way above any other rap album I&#39;ve listened to in the last five years, AT LEAST. I would go out on a limb and say it&#39;s one of the greatest albums in the last ten to fifteen years. He&#39;s taken it to an entirely different level, by having all these themes coalesce into one massive theme, at the end. It&#39;s not a concept album, but it certainly feels like one, once the listener hits the end. <br><br>While I&#39;ve listened to only twice all the way through, there is SO much to take from this entire piece. It&#39;s like a piece of literature, and I&#39;m eagerly awaiting some personal interviews where he discusses more of the tracks on the album. I think where I began to think it was historical was his suicidal, self-hatred panic attack on &quot;u.&quot; Never have I seen such humility in any artist, all while giving off one of the most incredible studio performances I think I&#39;ve ever heard. I believe he actually broke down on the second half of the track, and if he didn&#39;t, I applaud his theatrics applied to the music. <br><br>While I understand that many people will probably dismiss this because it is oozing with religious reference, and some political points, it&#39;s quite a brave album for any artist to put out. All I ask of anyone who didn&#39;t get it the first time around is to sit down, isolate yourself, grab a beer or a blunt, whatever you need to stick yourself like concrete, and just LISTEN. You may or may not agree with his words, and wisdom, but I found it incredibly respectable for someone pretty deep into their career, to keep pumping out timeless, thought provoking pieces. While I think Drake&#39;s release was quite good as well, and anticipate many other albums this year (Frank Ocean, Earl, Astronautalis, Kanye, Chance, any upcoming artists, etc.), I do not think any other album will make me think as critically as this album has.  <br><br>I am incredibly excited to hear about a tour promoting this album, and hopefully have Flying Lotus, Thundercat, Pharrell and some of the others on board with him to present this album in all of it&#39;s glory. These guys have done a fantastic job with the landscape of sound on here, and I cannot imagine what Kendrick will be up to next, as it seems like he&#39;s accomplished more than one artist can achieve. <br><br>A lot of artists have it all, and yet they still speak on the mundane themes of fame, sex, and money. I&#39;m glad to see a prominent figure in the industry aspire to inspire a new generation of thinkers. Hopefully more people around him, take suit, and explore broader concepts as well. Very well done review, Fantano! Thank you for your insight. 
i thought the album was good it just wasnt the album i wanted. i didn&#39;t much care for the beats and some of the flows i didnt care for either. im also i white kid from the suburbs so a lot of the subject matter i could not relate to at all, not that i didnt understand what he was saying it just doesnt directly apply to me. i know that the album is good, the message and concept and everything i just wanted to hear different beats you know? I just couldnt get into it even with the brilliant concept and lyrics.
mbdtf &gt;&gt;&gt; to pimp a dragonfly
I knew this albums was something special as soon as I got halfway through &quot;For Free?&quot;. Kudos to Kendrick.
<b>OH SHIT</b> [Danny Brown Voice] <i>&quot;the white nigga with the glasses&quot;</i> gave Kendrick a 10! this is obviously his album of the year then!
This review was Boo Boo! .. Naw I&#39;m playing, well said. This album sounds like a masterpiece. An arguable classic.¬†
Holy Shit Anthony, this has to be the best review i&#39;ve ever heard from you. You hit every single point I was thinking and more. Just when I thought you missed something, you say it. Good Shit man!
In my opinion I can see why this is going to be the bench mark like the needle drop mentions but can also see why many hip hop/ rap heads don&#39;t like it. This album really points out a lot of what Kendrick beliefs are and what he sees around him. It&#39;s more of an album of where he expresses himself in a more political and theoretical way which makes this album a classic because there&#39;s not many rappers who make albums like these which makes it stand out more than most rap albums. On the other hand it does lack that hip hop/ rap feeling. There&#39;s not too many tracks on here that make it feel like a rap album and I feel that&#39;s where it loses taste. If he could&#39;ve made this album more like the song blacker the berry, I, Wesley theory, or even u it would be a better album. But because this album stands out because of its uniqueness and lyricism this album will stand out more thank Forest hills, under pressure, drakes IFYRT etc. 
I was looking forward to this Fantano! Long live KING KENDRICK! Just watching him grow is emotional and he really is showing the world real music I wish his whole fucking album would be played on the radio. I listen to everything don&#39;t get me wrong from chief keef and migos to kendrick Lamar j.cole and Logic.... Kendrick&#39;s been my favorite for awhile and slowly but surely the world will realize it&#39;s time to give credit where it&#39;s due. Sorry Big Sean, Drake and whoever else&#39;s album comes out kendrick killed this years competition album wise.. Let&#39;s get some features and crazy lyrics now!
Dude! l love you. amazing review.
Kendrick continues to provide great hip hop, nothing but respect. 
Took me like 4 listens to fall in love with it. This is now one of my favorite hip-hop records of all time. I&#39;m still determining wether I like it more than GKMC, but it&#39;s up there
I know this is a hip hop review but you should review more classic albums! Like old Beatle albums or Nirvana albums or maybe some of your favorite youth bands the possibilities are endlessly entertaining! 
I will be expecting earls next
finally a hip hop/rap album that you give a perfect 10/10 üôåüôå
album cover is perfect for crouchthony slavtano
Great review I also noticed that u used the word &quot;prominent&quot; about 3 times lol 
This needs to win every grammar... even past grammar.
This guy doesn&#39;t get and understand alot of great albums, but he does get this one and we appreciate it. Good review.
I think the idea with the poem getting repeated over and over but carrying on a little more each time is very heavily symbolic of the black civil rights movement in and of itself. It constantly has to restate itself to get further and make progress.
You should do interviews Fantano. I feel like you would ask questions fans would want to hear. Kendrick is a legend in the making I think he certified it with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23tpab">#TPAB</a>. Might not get classic anytime play because of it&#39;s vibe is relevant at the exact moment. It is how this generation&#39;s soul feels at the moment. Witness artistry while you have it cause when shit hit the fan... 
It&#39;s good, ain&#39;t going to lie didn&#39;t like the production at first but it grew on me 
I don&#39;t necessarily think that GKMC was better than TPAB and vice versa. I think they&#39;re both AMAZING albums and they are equal counterparts to each other.¬†
It&#39;s funny because on your &quot;The changing color of hip-hop&quot; video I commented and talked about how current black femcees (besides nicki) don&#39;t really get the credit they deserve and I specifically brought up Rapsody and how she doesn&#39;t get enough shine. And now she&#39;s on Kendrick&#39;s album and she did her thing. Lol dope. Kendrick out here answering prayers and shit (cries in happy black girl) lmfao.
I was expecting a review of nothing but YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES.¬†
It broke the ten mic rule!!! 
Anthony, you are the only album reviewer i care to hear. bravo man 10/10
Is this the first album he&#39;s given a 10?
FINALLY A 10!!! DOESN&#39;T SURPRISE ME THAT IT IS FOR A KENDRICK ALBUM.
So I wonder what&#39;s gonna be the best album of the year...
Crazy because You Ain&#39;t Gotta Lie is one of my favorites on this album lol.... Good review though
Its about that track u so deep 
It&#39;s 4am right now that shit creeped me out lol
Must stay away from the description box until the end of the video...<br><br><br>................. ..It&#39;s so hard.
Ooooo shit. We got a 10!! 
I feel you dude. At my first listen I thought this album made me feel like watching a movie, whereas &#39;good kid&#39; was more like reading a book.
Honestly, the only thing I didn&#39;t like about the album was the similar track progression to his previous works, especially GKMC. Both albums have this progressive buildup to a violent boom bap track (maad city and blacker the berry) then Kendrick steps back and has an enlightened perspective (real and i). The album is completely original otherwise and even that criticism may not be enough to detract the high rating this album deserves.
I can&#39;t wait to sit down and take in this album. Speaking of awesome rappers, do you plan on reviewing the new Earl Sweatshirt record?
Young Thug- To pimp a butterfly
Is he going to review Earl Sweatshirts new album coming out?
where can i hear it
You have really nice skin.
People definitely need to listen to this album with an open mind. It&#39;s not going to sound like what you think hip-hop should sound like today. It&#39;s definitely expressive and progressive while keeping in touch with the past. If you come into this album with your opinion on what hip-hop should sound like, then your going to be disappointed for sure. This album rocks in my opinion. Great instrumentals, heart-felt lyrics, and awesome features makes this album a 10 in my books.
YEEEAAH
As soon as the album dropped I was waiting for your review for this. You did not disappoint. I completely agree. How Kendrick covers soooooo many topics at once with his metaphors and allegories consistently‚Ä¶ i don&#39;t even‚Ä¶ we are dealing with a real lyrical genius here. Moderen Day Pac for sure. This album requires an open mind and multiple listens. Been a fan of Dot since before OD. Most all his music and lyrics are deep, reaaal deep. But this album‚Ä¶ I just don&#39;t even know how pulled this project together. His sonic composition decisions were genius. To show where hip-hop takes roots from genres like Funk, Soul, R&amp;B, Jazz, Blues, Spokenword poetry etc. Even how he raps like James Brown a little in King Kunta to show the influence old Soul and Funk had. He shows black history, excellence, pride, confidence, and on top of that covers multiple topics like social issues in America, Spiritual struggle and growth, getting past and growing up from the hood, fighting with depression and suicide, self love and esteem. Bandwagon Rap/Hip-Hop listeners won&#39;t truly understand or appreciate this album.¬†
Does anyone else feel like this album wouldn&#39;t have existed without FlyLo&#39;s last record? (PS I think this record is dope, and it will inevitably get flak because K is in the popular realm now, but fuck off is it actually difficult or challenging or experimental, there&#39;s nothing edgy about it, it&#39;s just good music with a wide source of influences (it&#39;s not fucking mathy or death metal, or abstract jazz, or full of 15min long post rock epics), and it&#39;s sad to see all the pop-rap-trap fans slating it because they&#39;ve been conditioned to like shiny hooks, melodramatic trap beats, and lyrics only about getting crunk, fucking bitches and getting money. BOORRRRINGGG. Music fans shouldn&#39;t be disheartened by the haters, if it&#39;s rubbing idiots the wrong way it&#39;s assurance that it&#39;s great.) Commenting on utub is lame lol i&#39;m drunk.
10/10. Nice.. very nice. S/o to Pac 1x though! 
Yo ¬†didnt like the album. Most people don&#39;t recognize how trash the lyrics are
I think needle drop needs to thank Terrence Martin for helping K. dot put this album together as far as instrumentation is concerned. T. Martin is instrumental Genius most notable for his beautiful sax skills.
To everyone hating on this album it&#39;s a tough listen the first time but the more you listen to it the better it becomes an u realize what he&#39;s saying an his crazy lyricism with his message, I feel like everyone wanted a GKMC sounded sequel they want it to sound commercial not creative, let him do something different if he keeps using the same sound his music gets boring, the beats are dope af an the lyrics are amazing when u listen to it more, remember when illmatic came out people didn&#39;t like it either but now it&#39;s considered the greatest hip hop album of all time the more you listen to this album the better it gets 
Way better than MBDTF, MMLP, ILLMATIC, COLLEGE DROPOUT, RUN THE JEWELS, 2014 FOREST HILLS DRIVE, TETSUO &amp; YOUTH, AND DAMN.
Earl sweatshirt- grief review? Btw good review 
Kendrick Lamar&#39;s verses on Alright are the most awesome thing I&#39;ve heard since... I don&#39;t even know. Great review. Best album of 2015.
With this album Kendrick cemented himself as the best of his generation of rappers/artist. He is on his own lane now it is incredible how great his album is. Every critic is praising it and only those that don&#39;t know shit about  music think otherwise. It is normal for people to not like it if it is not of their taste but to think its bad is incredibly simple minded. This is a great review Anthony and I honestly think this is better than gkmc.
Yo... and what about your take on &quot;How much a dollar cost&quot; 
Do I understand you in the right way: are you saying the &#39;i&#39; track on the album is a real live version?
Everyone saying this album is trash and Drake and Joey have better albums need to listen to albums like The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill and The Low End Theory cause ya&#39;ll are really just missing the point. Yes, I love Kanye, I love J. Cole, I love some Drake, fuck I even like Ferg, but this album is the essence of what hip hop was always meant to be. Poetry in motion. Trying to make it seem like this review was about dickriding and feeling proud to like something about the African-American struggle is the most childish thing ever. Listen to the music not the hype or the name.¬†
TO: ALL THE IGNORANT FUCKS THAT DON&#39;T KNOW SHIT ABOUT REAL HIP HOP AND REAL MUSIC!<br>¬†¬†<br>I don&#39;t give opinions about music! This is for real music listeners!<br>Another ignorant kid with no intelligence! You are a dumb fuck that doesn&#39;t no shit about real hip hop/rap!<br>I&#39;m a music critic/music expert at Rolling Stone Magazine in 15 different music genres (mainstream and underground) and I also teach different levels of music classes at a prestigious university out here in the west coast. YEEZUS is no where near this album production and lyrically! This is the 100% definition of a vintage, old-school production-style and lyrical album straight from the golden age of Hip Hop/Rap (1984-1999)! ALL MUSIC CRITICS/MUSIC EXPERTS HAVE GIVEN THIS ALBUM A PERFECT RATING!<br>You will not find ANY music critics/music expert that doesn&#39;t know this is a new millennium music classic! There isn&#39;t another mainstream artist in any genre that is putting out the type of dark, deep socially, politically, philosophical and personally conscious music right now! (I can say without a doubt that J. Cole, Joey Bada$$ and Lupe Fiasco albums that recently came out are near this level but don&#39;t reach this benchmark Kendrick has layed for every other mainstream and underground MC right now!) Anthony Fantano and I, know more about music than all of you put together! It&#39;s called music science and how to analyze music with objectivity, intelligence and using the standards and protocols that each music genre and sub-genre has and this album is a NEW CLASSIC without a doubt!! Whoever says otherwise doesn&#39;t know shit about what real music is suppose to represent and convey! If music doesn&#39;t make you think at a higher level, then it isn&#39;t real music! That is one of the many rules established many decades ago by musicians, music critics, music experts, music professors and persons that truly understand the definitions and fundamentals of music!! Come sign up for my modern music history classes and the history of hip hop music and I&#39;ll school your sorry ass in what music is suppose to be like and sound like! STUPID LITTLE BOYS! Get some knowledge then you can come and get a conversation withe me!
A 10?!?!? ...Perfection is a lofty standard that takes time to recognize... Are you sure that you&#39;re not jumping the gun on this one?  Hmm, my opinion remains a bit perplexed. I  gotta give this a months listen before I crown it King. Until then it&#39;s refreshingly different, and frustratingly different; I&#39;m torn üòê
what the fuck is a &#39;FEM-C&#39;, fantano? u got a lot of respect, don&#39;t trash it.
People gonna hate this album because there&#39;s nothing to get fucked up to.
Buy it.
i feel like people whos calling this &quot;trash&quot; dont like experimental jazz funk &amp; hiphop. the production is slightly coming from left field but that doesnt yield it from being great.i also feel like those people are too stupid or too lazy or just plain dont understand kendrick nor the messages behind his songs. this album will last for generations. this is not trendy, here today gon tomorro hiphop. this album is art in its purest form &amp; i agree 10/10üëç.
The longer the review, the higher the score. 
I swear everytime I see someone hate on this album on twitter I go to their Twitter profile and it always says some Drake quote or some shit..... lmao never fails.
I guess I should probably give this album a listen
theneedledrop¬†Anthony,<br>I have disagreed with some of your reviews in the past.<br>But I definitely respect your objectivity. Your ability to analyze music is really appreciated.<br>10/10 Album, 10/10 Review.
Do Joey&#39;s fucking album again 
I thought it was kind of boring, but I&#39;m willing to listen to it again. Maybe I missed something.
Ha, that mockery of cynical &quot;conscious&quot; people is akin to about every kid in my class. Stupid adolescents, making us look disdainfully ignorant and selfish.....
This album deserves a 9/10
Check out my mixtape
That ending was hilarious!!!! HAHA
Can&#39;t be better than pom pom... can it ?
This is a great album but I still think m.A.A.D City was far superior. The message behind maad city was stronger in my opinion and the beats were phenomenal but this albums message really does stand out which is great for social issues around the country at this moment but the album lacks good flow and good beats, although I do love the jazz feel to it. I&#39;ve been a big fan of Kendricks since Overly Dedicated but people are getting out of hand when they&#39;re saying it&#39;s the &quot;Best rap album of the decade&quot;. I still think MBDTF is the best album of this decade. 
10 MOTHAAA FUCKKAAAASSS¬†<br>I thought the cubs would go to the world series or WW3 would start before I saw Manthony Mantano give a 10.... :)
I love the song¬†&quot;Institutionalized&quot; and Mortal man. I cant even listen to anything except this, The Joey album, and J cole. Everything else seems like complete shit. Except like micj jenkins and bishio nehru. I like migos but this makes you think
TPAB Is beautiful . J cole is the only other person in the game that can even touch Kendrick. But barley, Kendrick is on a diffrent level. Great shit K.dot aka K Lmar aka Kendrick Lamar aka best in the game
jizzing all over this album kek
Review the new single, Grief - Earl Sweatshirt ? off of his upcoming surprise album
Couldn&#39;t agree more! fantastic review. This is why you&#39;re the best reviewer on YouTube. I was the same on first listen, sonically it&#39;s so different to GKMC it was hard to re-adjust. But after 3-4 listen this album shines so bright. production across the board is great, but I particularly love the production on the first 3 tracks. And can I just say that the way he concluded the album on &#39;mortal man&#39; was simply mesmerizing!
Kendrick and Harper Lee should have a filmed interview! That would be sick! (or is it just me...?)
I love all of the songs on this album, but for some reason, the strange fusion of Jazz and Hip Hop on For Free? is kind of incredible. Mortal Man with its Tupac conversation is great as well, with the abrupt ending tying it all together.¬†

You just can&#39;t review an album in less than a week.... Listen to the music!!!!!!! Don&#39;t just play it
this almost makes up for giving such a horrible score to MBDTF
What about &#39;Carpenter Brut - Trilogy&#39;? It&#39;s all of his 3 EPs and it&#39;s really powerful and energetic. I&#39;m in love with his 80&#39;s synthesizer, distorted bass and cheesy melodies. It&#39;s like he said: &#39;Justice beats and 80&#39;s horror movie vibe&#39;. You have to check it out :)¬†
Nice review! And I agree, this is the &quot;turn up!&quot; era. Everything has to have an element of trap on the trendier side of hip hop. I like hype music, but sometimes, especially knowing how hip hop started, it&#39;s important to have an artistic album like this leave the shelves of stores and into the homes of avid rap fans. This is what they need. Matter of fact, it&#39;s so sad that people who were on GKMC (which is when many people had Kendrick&#39;s name in their mouth) gave this album a listen and said that it was trash. Okay. Fine. Their opinion. But it&#39;s almost hypocritical they claimed to be fans and didn&#39;t even make it through half the record. I enjoy Kendrick&#39;s journey developing himself and his music. He started off big headed a little bit early in his career (always been lyrical too) given the fact he was rapping about materialism and the such, before he became more artistic and passionate and political and most rappers start off the opposite. They start off humble then later turn mainstream, the expected possibility when any artist starts music. It&#39;s rare to maintain a humble status surrounded by the likes of the industry but it impresses me Kendrick managed this far. I have been listening to him since S80, but I looked back into his earlier music and he&#39;s truly a genius. It&#39;s sad not too many people know songs like &quot;Today&quot; or &quot;P &amp; P&quot; or even &quot;Rare Breed&quot; just to name a few. But anyways, I&#39;m waiting to see his next move. Album is a masterpiece.¬†
THIS...DICK...AINT...FREE!...I MEAN BABY!<br>xD
TO GIVE AN ALBUM A 10
drake somewhere mad as all hell
I don&#39;t wanna say any of his albums is better than the rest, I can only say which one I liked more. I felt the narrative of GKMC, though still provocative, I felt we had seen versions of on movies like Friday or Boyz in the Hood. Section.80 &amp; this album I feel are the views of Kendrick on a variety of socially relevant topics. I&#39;m not sure which one I liked more, as Section.80 was my go to, but right now I felt the world needed 2PABF more, and thus it will have a greater impact. What 2PABF has that Section.80 doesnt is this moment where we all came together as a hip hop world, eager with anticipation, digested it all immediately, and talked about it with friends or whoever. We only get so many of these moments in Hip Hop. Usually we&#39;re just trying to put people on to some new shit nobody knows about.¬†<br><br>As a hip hop fan, we like to earmark those we think will be that voice in Hip Hop post-Kanye. The lyricist who will make it big, the mainstream artists who gets his audience. Lupe was on the cusp, j. cole, drake, etc. but I feel they all fell just short of grabbing the crown by compromising the music. Kendrick has fulfilled the prophecy. From Overly Dedicated to 2PABF, all of these will be studied in universities across America. Believe that...
Explain very well!!!
All great music doesn&#39;t sound the same. I love this shit. Concept. Its damn near flawless
Man this review was almost as beautiful as the album. GOOD JOB<br>You explained it perfectly.

Boo Boo!!
There&#39;s so much music on this album that I&#39;ve still gotta unpack everything but after one listen I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s pretty damn fantastic, and probably worthy of the coveted 10. Good call. Your other perfect score is justified too in my opinion. Dunno what it is about the album for me, and I know a lot of rap fans who despise it. Sounds like nothing I&#39;ve heard and feels like it&#39;s metal made for people who don&#39;t listen to metal or something (me). Anyway this Kendrick album just leaves me happy, as there&#39;s tons of stuff to dig into here lyrically and musically. EDIT: Referring to The Money Store (didn&#39;t realize you gave To Be Kind a 10 also).
If you don&#39;t like this album, just admit it: You only wanna listen to music that sounds like contemporary hip hop. just say it. Its okay. We&#39;ll only judge you a little bit.
Lol, for all the people who hate this record, I&#39;m curious WHY you hate this record? 
I really like this album... it&#39;s experimental, steeped in the history of jazz and r&amp;b, it&#39;s ecumenical and mixes shit up like Prince, or Kanye (but with more actual intelligence behind the noise than Kanye). There is a strong stream of Afroconsciousness (which is what they called it back in the day) but with a future outlook
FINALLY THE 10/10 KENDRICK DESERVES
Thank you. 
For the song &quot;u&quot; at around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=125">2:05</a> to like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=140">2:20</a> when using headphones does the sound go from headphone to headphone and  sound choppy or is it just me 
Im seeing alot of &quot;there isn&#39;t enough catchy songs&quot; If you want catchy kendrick isn&#39;t for you so stop hating on a perfect &amp; CLASSIC album. Catchy tracks dont make albums classic. Substance does. Every song on this album meant something, He didn&#39;t make the album for people who probably worship the migos and wackass young thug, he made this album because the world needed it. Even if you dont like it it had to be done. 10/10. 
you&#39;re least favorite track is one of my favorite tracks. :(
I think this album as a piece of art, as a statement, as a piece of culture, as a social commentary, and as a part of hip hop/ music history is amazing. The meaning, direction, and message of this album is absolutely phenomenal. It&#39;s meaningful, experimental, powerful, and very well crafted. I&#39;m glad I listened to it. But unfortunately, it is music. And music has to be enjoyable to listen to...and i just don&#39;t like it that much. Maybe after a few more listens I will grow to like it...but right now I can&#39;t say this is an album I see myself listening to years from now.  But looking at it objectively (well, as objectively as you can look at music) I cannot deny its greatness.
Why is this fucktarded bald moron the authority on music? It pisses me off when someone who doesn&#39;t even understand the game from an artists perspective is the go to for reviews on music. His review on Tyler the creator was shit, and so is every other review of his I&#39;ve ever seen
Its hard watching another man thrive it hurts so much. that&#39;s why you sit at home and find ways to hate on him. Ways to steal his moment his shine . So you become the centre of attention. Kendrick thank you for this album its a masterpiece in every sense of the word. I appreciate the boldness and you breaking out of conformity . 10/10 FOR SURE. ¬†¬†
Very good album as a whole conceptually speaking. And I&#39;m happy it came from an artist with such hype, attention, and status on him. Well deserved I might add. <br>I think hip hop really needed this. <br><br>The message behind it is a lot better than the actual individual songs though. Just my opinion. 
The instrumentals on this album are amazing! I hope this cd brings those type of beats back into hip hop! 
couldn&#39;t have said better myself,¬†
FUCK YOUR ETHNICITY
Well put Mr. Fantano, much respect to you.
WHAT THE FUCK!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=727">12:07</a> anthony turns into an orc
thank you fantano, youre the one who put me on to kendrick back in the day
King kendrick lamar , he is such an amazing artist people who dont like the beats than y&#39;all fake as hip hop fans because hip hop started off of jazz and funk those are the roots of hip hop know your fucken history basic as mother fuckers this album is a classic Kendrick is the face of hip hop of our generation and anyone is more than welcome to have an argument id be more than glad to give you reasons why Kendrick is the best rapper / writer / artist of our generation NO ONE can do what he did yeah we have artist that aren&#39;t all about hoes money bitches bragging about their life style but NO ONE and I mean No one could ever do what Kendrick did from this new generation 
People are saying they don&#39;t like TPAB because of the heavy jazz, funk, and soul beats, and influences. However these are the art forms that hip hop was built upon. It is real music.
Imo this album was AMAZING. I knew instantaneously though that those not musically versed in other genres would find it difficult to like.¬†
&quot;Hyperbolic comment about the album with tons of thumbs up&quot;<br>- Everyone
THE TEN HAS BEEN GIVEN
THIS ALBUM IS A MASTERPIECE. After the first listen, i wasn&#39;t a fan but damn was i wrong. Kendrick is an artist, not just a rapper. I really hope people stop looking for beats that &quot;bump&quot; and listen to this album and actually understand it.
GKMC and Section 80 are more enjoyable to listen to (mainly because of the production and catchy hooks), that&#39;s the only reason people think those albums are better, this album is a piece of art not a listening PARTY, this is one of the favorite projects and definitely one of my new favorite projects!
y throw paper? make it rain Anthony
IS NEW ALBUM IS ON WATER.. 100 TO 0 REAL QUICK.
Nice review. I think it&#39;s just crazy how Kendrick didn&#39;t settle with this album..he&#39;s coming off making what many consider a classic/benchmark work in GKMC and he was actually more ambitious on this album. He could&#39;ve just packed it in..gave us some lyrics and some boom bap beats but no. This album is both lyrically denser and sonically more adventurous than¬† GKMC¬† was. Definitely 10 worthy. He uses more flows on this one, more vocal inflections. He sounds like he&#39;s completely mastered his style. Albums not for everyone but it&#39;s almost disrespectful to deny Kendrick&#39;s talent..he deserves his praise.
Also it&#39;s crazy how people can bug out from one man&#39;s opinion....... I think you haters/idiots who know nothing about this album should reevaluate yourselves. 
I&#39;ve never seen Anthony give a 10/10 to any relatively new hip-hop album..... But from the moment I heard this I knew it would pop the cherry. 
Ok question, when he talks about &quot;Lucy&quot; is he talking about the devil?¬†
I actually thought the album was rubbish. But it&#39;s nice to see someone passionate about hip-hop and willing to analyse it, essentially, as a text. Very nice job.
people hatin on this album? BOO BOO!
100k in less than 12 hours? dang
content on this album was on point as usual an i loved the rap jazz vibe its pure throw back g-funk rap, now i can see alot of people not loving this album because there not as many &quot;bangerz&quot; on here but i think kendrick wanted people to not pay attention to porduction but much more of what he sayin kind of what tupac said ina a interview &quot; pay attention to what the artist is saying &quot;
If Kendrick wasn&#39;t as big as he is you would all agree with this score..... This album is literally brilliant but because it&#39;s not GKMC 2 your gonna fault it. Stop being so close minded and listen again!!!!! This man is one of a kind. He is the leader of our generation. He is honest, original, influential, and a whole truck load of other shit I&#39;m not gonna take the time to type. He&#39;s your favorite rappers, favorite rapper. And he only gets better with time. So if you don&#39;t like it cool. Let us real music lovers listen and you go back to young thug. Either way it&#39;s gonna go down as one of the best hip-hop albums EVER just like good kid. Its already critically acclaimed and it hasn&#39;t even been a week yet BITCHES!!!!!!!! HAHA!!!! Hate all you want and watch K.Dot keep winning.... TDE# TPAB# FOREVER!!!!! 
I would say &#39;Alright&#39; sounds pretty Trendy, at least most of it.<br>But honestly that&#39;s it
I love Kendrick as much as the next guy, but Kendrick and Lupe are IMO one of the best in the game right now lyrically...that&#39;s why Lupe should&#39;ve received at least a 8-9 on T&amp;Y. Anthony just doesn&#39;t really like Lupe.
Cool Review !<br><br>Since I am your boss Anthony i am requiring you to review Father - Who&#39;s Gonna Get Fucked First next!<br><br>Do it or else Im having Cal replace u!!!!!!!!!!
Thank you for this.<br><br>Great album. Great review 
Took me a couple listens and play throughs to appreciate this album....its growing on me like a malignant tumor the more I&#39;m exposed to it...ironic¬†
My heart just skipped a beat... a 10, DAYYYUUUUMMMM
It&#39;s quite sad that just because someone is consistently good, people just call them out for being dick riders if they like their stuff. Ever thought that someone is actually very good and IS consistent?
Fuckin Granthony Matano over here giving this a 10 <br><br>bruhhhhh
Do you prefer this album, &quot;To Be Kind&quot; or the &quot;Money Store&quot;?
Wow, 10!!
Yeah. The beats on this makes me uh idk what it is about them but yeah. thats my only gripe.. Its sad. lol. idk how i can get into the beats more..
We need a live version of the entire album
Review really explained some stuff i missed, i was expecting something like GKMC also, first listen i didn&#39;t catch most of the lyrics as i was tryna get use to this jazzy, funk sound but by the 5th listen i started to like it more, still though my fav tracks are king kunta, alright, i, blacker the berry, you aint gotta lie.
Kendrick said it himself &quot;im giving people what they need, not what they want&quot; and he did a damn good job doing so. This album was amazing without a doubt. And for the people complaining about the beats...evaporate. this music is obviously not for u if all u want is okay lyrics with a hot beat, thats what kanye is for
I&#39;ve never been that much into hip hop, but after watching this review I listened to the album and was truly stunned. It is a wonderful and powerful album. Thank you for now expanding my musical horizons, Anthony.¬†
damn a 10? okay!!!
If all the songs were recorded like the blacker the berry I wouldn&#39;t have a problem with the album. To me the lyrics were okay but the instrumentals made the songs feel boring 
the Crip is the Caterpillar<br>the Blood is the Butterfly<br><br>2 Pimp A Butterfly = 2PAB<br><br>It could&#39;ve been: 2 Pimp A Caterpillar = 2PAC<br><br>But k. dot used to be more affiliated with the bloods and you know they dont spell with the C,<br>So it is 2PAB<br><br>Loved the review as well Anthony. I got to say this is probably the best album i&#39;ve ever heard.
Shits whack  would&#39;ve been better if the choruses weren&#39;t so terribly bad especially songs like &quot;I&quot;  and institutionalized
I seen a lot of these comments coming. First off, stop comparing albums. When you do that, you already come in wanting to shxt on it. This album wasn&#39;t meant to be Good Kidd 2 or Section 80: The Sequel.
If this is a 10, 2014 Forest hills drive should be a 2/10
holy shit - the day this album came out my english teacher told me it was an easy 10... freaky
AWWWWW YEAAAA 
hmm. Very fucking clever of Kendrick on this album.
This is the reason JCole can touch Kendrick.
Another great album nonetheless, stop wanting to hear the same old shit over and over again. That&#39;s whats wrong with times today...Jay-Z said it best <b>niggas want my old shit buy my old albums</b>. Don&#39;t go into this album expecting GKMC2    
Thank you! I&#39;m glad to hear your praise Mr. Fantano! I&#39;ve heard and read many cancerous comments about this album like, &quot;there are no bangers!&quot; &quot;Butterfly? That&#39;s gay!&quot; Or the classic, &quot;Kendrick fell off after Overly Dedicated!&quot;. I LOVED this album! I thought it one upped GKMC, which I already thought was a 9.5. If you are still not huge about this album, just sit down, close your eyes, and listen to this beautiful masterpiece. No one is making music this incredible and this diverse (few exceptions). Nevertheless, this album IS perfect. I believe (after listening to the album nonstop since it dropped) this is one of the greatest hip hop albums ever created. Thank you for the review Mr. Fantano.
Even tho that Untitled song isn&#39;t on here(my favorite song from Kendrick this so far)...From all the songs that got released early, i could tell that the tone for this album was going to be totally different from Kendrick&#39;s past work. Not too many songs here at all that you will probably hear in the club or <b>turn up</b> or just something to get you amped for physical shit, none of that. But a more toned down album with a hard and deeper meaning behind it with Kendrick having something to say and wants his voice to be heard. 
Agree with everything. <br>Tried to explain these themes to a few posters not long ago when you spoke on culture. <br>This record and your review is exactly what I was explaining to them. <br><br>It&#39;s only so long folk can live in bliss. Then the truth will hit them like a freight train. <br><br>Maybe you shedding light on it will make them realise and look at how they react to social issues that affect us all. <br><br>This year has started well for hip hop albums. Hopefully these antibiotic albums will flush out the bullshit that has been infecting the newer ears. They don&#39;t know they have ear infection. <br>
HMMMM....<br>To meee i think the beats were a little lacking.. it was a little too jazzy for me personally but lyrically fucking fantastic!. 8/10 for me bro. the beats just get to me plus his trademark voice pitch is weird.
Outstanding review as always.
The Internet: &quot;Review the new Kendrick Lamar album! Review the new Kendrick Lamar album! It&#39;s so good!&quot;<br>Fantano: &quot;Okay, I reviewed it. I loved it! I gave my highest score!&quot;<br>The Internet: &quot;FUCK YOU IGNORANT JACKASS, THIS ALBUMS SUCKS! BOOOOOO!&quot;<br>Seems legit.
GKMC<br>&quot;Only a 9?&quot;<br>&quot;Right on point, great review&quot;<br>&quot;You finally got one right&quot;<br>&quot;This is a 10 atleast&quot;<br><br>TPAB<br>&quot;Kendrick Lamar fanboy&quot;<br>&quot;Biased backpacker&quot;<br>&quot;You only like stuff that is different&quot;<br>&quot;White guilt&quot;<br>&quot;How is this better then MBDTF/Forest Hills Drive?&quot;
If you didn&#39;t like the album, don&#39;t go arguing and shitting on the album like it&#39;s the worst thing you&#39;ve ever heard. But if you do, remember your opinion is in the minority and you will quickly be shut down by everyone else who loves this album. TPAB simply didn&#39;t appeal to you, and that&#39;s fine. Don&#39;t just simply hate on it all because Kendrick took a different sound that you didn&#39;t like. Music is all based on opinion, calm down.
whats so funny of telling tupac the poem? theneedledrop that part throw me off
Anthony gave us a good overall review, but skipped on some of the most important keys to understanding the album as a whole. For example (there are more...), the very last seconds of the album (when Tupac doesn&#39;t answer Kendrick) are crucial in tying up the whole thing.<br><br>This album will need more analysis than most hip-hop albums, because it amounts to more than simply the songs that form it. You can&#39;t add or take out anything from it. It&#39;s one of the most cohesive hip-hop albums ever made, which is why it feels so impressive.¬†<br><br>Also, seeing the reactions to TPAB, a lot of hip-hop lovers are very traditionalist. However, this record is what you might call a &quot;game changer&quot;, so it was precisely its aim.¬†
10 out of 10 review it again
Man thorough interview. Thank You.<br>For Hood Politics I would say that the main theme Kendrick is speaking on is how silly petty politics are.  He gives several examples to relationships he&#39;s seen in the hood and how politics ard handled in America.
Whenever the comments in the video contradict what he sayin , you know it&#39;s a good album 
The shittier the music, the higher the rating from Fagtano.
I&#39;ve heard nothing by this chap before, but this review has me intrigued. I&#39;l give it a listen.
Onion have layer
Is this the first album you&#39;ve ever given a 10 to?! 
King kendrick lamar
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1149">19:09</a> u said it bro. GREAT GREAT REVIEW
I saw that 10/10 coming from a mile away
People who hate on this album are people who wanted another Good kid m.a.a.d city and expected bangers. So people who are just fans of Kendrick&#39;s raps are going to be turned off by the very jazz, funk influenced retro sounding album. Also there are going people turned off by this album by seeming very &quot;pro-black&quot;. Like Fantano said, just enjoy the music. (Also for me personally, this album gets an extra nod of approval for the use of Thundercat throughout this album, if you love the sound of this album I highly recommend listing to his music too.)
I was a bit underwhelmed with the production of this album. I felt he should have worked with more mainstream producers. For instance, boi1da on the blacker the berry. The song was amazing, because of the production. He should have done something like this throughout the album.
I lost my shit when cal was pressuring you to give it a 10 and you gave it a 10 and cal started getting dooooowwwwwnnnnnn
You funny as fuck
people dont tend to shy away from political music because &quot;they&#39;re too good to be told by someone else how the world works&quot;, they shy away from political music because most political music is some of the worst shit out there.
Wtf??? This came out???
This album sucked I could tell from the first two tracks it wasn&#39;t worth my time smh rap is dead.
To those who actually LISTEN to music and let the artist&#39;s work describe itself instead of coming in, forming your opinion early and immediately saying it is &quot;trash&quot; because it instantly doesn&#39;t satisfy you, then this album is really an experience and a great piece of work by Kendrick. But for others who decide to just shut down, and don&#39;t let this expressive and very, what i feel, needed piece of art even have a chance to play out and you deeply take in what you are hearing before having an opinion, then i feel sorry for you. But hey, to each his own. Thorough review Anthony.<br><br>Also this track gets better with every listen if you are willing to listen and invest
I&#39;m just not enjoying the album. 
This album is an odyssey that I normally would&#39;ve embarked on but am totally glad I did based on your glowing recommendation
At first I hated this album. I thought it was complete garbage but then I listened to it a couple of times after my first conclusion and now I absolutely love it. This is an album that will grow on you.
YOU DUN DID IT NOW FANTANO. YOU DUN DID IT NOW.
Finally, our veritable music nerd provides his summation (thus far) on this dense album. Been waiting for this! Kendrick mothafuckin lamar for another straight grammy bitches!
10/10 yooooooooooo
You should review:<br>- Noel Gallagher - Chasing Yesterday (but maybe don&#39;t spend too much time comparing it to Oasis like everybody else does, compare it to his first solo album)<br>- Pearl Jam - Lightning Bolt<br>- Black Rebel Motorcycle Club - Specter At The Feast<br>- Korn - The Paradigm Shift<br>- The Sword - Apocryphon
Is this Anthony&#39;s second 10/10 review? 
Holy fuck a 10/10 i thought it was gonna be a strong 8 to a light 9 but 10 holy fuck Kendrick really does deserves a 10.
booboo!
This album paves the way for a new generation hip hop/art. Very ahead of its time. 
Review Earl-Grief PLEASE!!!
This is a good review, you have a new sub 
YESS 10!!!
WE FINALLY GOT A 10/10 ON AN ALBUM REVIEW!!! üòÑüòÑüòÑ
Kendrick is definitely one of the greatest artist of all time. True to the music and the message. As a musician (drummer), all the instrumentals were truly something to gawk at when matched with this god like lyricism and flow. Truthfully those that don&#39;t like this album were pampered in the mainstream and don&#39;t understand what true artistry/musc is. As for the message, you definitely have to dissect it a few times to tie it all together. All in all however, this was a masterpiece.
All I can see is constant rave and praise for this album, and I just don&#39;t get it. I&#39;ve listened to the album twice, and a few select songs more than that. I get the messages in the songs, but some of the instrumentals are weak along with the hooks. The album itself is enjoyable, but I&#39;m not seeing a 10/10 at all. I still think GKMC is better. Message-wise, sure. Production-wise? I don&#39;t see it. GKMC had better beats, an amazing message and story to it, and great hooks. This album has the amazing message, mostly good beats, and some good hooks. I don&#39;t know. I wish I could see it as a 10 like certain people, I really wish I could. But I can&#39;t bring it to my mind to say it deserves the 10. I don&#39;t know if Anthony is just saying it&#39;s a 10/10 because it is Kendrick and he wanted to prove his point that Kendrick would someday be a legend, or if he&#39;s afraid of pissing off Kendrick fans, I don&#39;t know. I wish I could like it that much.
Album didn&#39;t meet all the hype in my opinion. I really just enjoyed about 3 tracks and that was it.
Hhaa!! Aahh!! = Chance The Rapper 2013.........Hhaa!! Aahh!!= Kendrick Lamar 2015..not a big deal..just saying. 
I was a doubter. I thought there was no way he could raise the bar.<br>To Pimp a Butterfly is a storytelling masterpiece. Some songs don&#39;t stand out as much as &quot;Blacker the Berry&quot;, &quot;Alright&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, and &quot;Wesley&#39;s Theory&quot; in terms of sound, but if you put the album together it&#39;s so perfect.<br>You don&#39;t have to be black to enjoy this album, like many of the naysayers are saying.
Race wise if you listen its pro black but Kendrick stays neutral through out..He says its okay to be black however blacks too have to change their bad ways..And really yo can apply that ideology to any race or gender.¬†
This album is art. Most of the people who listen to music nowadays only want the surface layer of cake. Kendrick gave us all 3 layers. Only niggas that hate on this album are the ones who don&#39;t read and like content without context. This album to me is better than GKMC.<br>10/10 is well deserved
Literally already in my top 3 albums of all time and its quickly making its way to number 1 the more i listen to it. Untouchable. Flawless. Dude is the best hip hop artist in 20 years easily. 
I LOVE this album way more than GKMC.<br><br>It&#39;s like this album is mixed with sounds from James Brown, The Isley Brothers, A Tribe Called Quest, Common, OutKast, DJ Quik, Erykah Badu, and D&#39;Angelo all mixed in one project.<br><br>So beautiful, soulful, funkadelic, jazzy, and afrocentric.<br><br>10/10
I still don&#39;t get why King Kunta is a good song but otherwise you&#39;ve convinced me of a lot with this album, which I already thought was VERY good. I&#39;m thinking a 9.something/10 and that&#39;s after one listen. &quot;Possibly, one of the best hip hop albums of the decade&quot; - 5 years in, if I had to think of one artist who would make the best hip hop album of the decade, I would point to Kendrick; before TPAB there would be some hesitation. Afterwords? Possibly none.
the ending LMFAO!!!!
To be honest I really think that this was a great review of the album, because to fully understand this album you&#39;ll really have to do allot of research to fully understand the content, and before you read my comment please shut off all racism from your mind because this album though it focuses allot on the black culture it does not encourage hatred towards white people or over races. First of all, I really think that this album is complete, you can tell that Kendrick did allot of soul searching and also educated himself on his roots, and to be honest it&#39;s not easy to catch all the references because it&#39;s almost too much, we haven&#39;t learnt half of the information in his lyrics in history class or whatever, and also the truth of his lyrics are almost taunting and painful, because it speaks to us individually and also it speaks to people that have attained a certain level of wealth and or now dealing with all the negativity that comes with success and for other it deals with survivors guilt. I saw on Twitter people saying that you need certain amount of intelligence to understand Kendrick or J cole, at first I was like that&#39;s bullshit but now for the first I do agree, the lyrics have so much depth that you actually have to do some research for yourself, and it causes you to analyze the lyrics because of the content you no longer can listen to the music casually.  For some people they might have an advantage at understanding all the concepts because they&#39;ve been listening to concourse rap from the way back, where they recognize certain messages or situations. Other people might have an advantage because they&#39;ve either lived to see certain situations or experienced them first hand. Then there&#39;s people that are educated on the black history in general, meaning not just in America, not just in Africa but also in the Caribbean or wherever black people culture present, through their knowledge of the history they might be able to depict allot of the information in this album. I&#39;ve followed allot of his interviews from back in 09&#39; to present times and listened to his previous work and honestly everything that he discusses int his album is not new because he&#39;s been focused on the topic for a minute now.
I don&#39;t really get what it is with thinking white people can&#39;t like this album. I don&#39;t relate to the message on a racial level, I relate to the message on a human level.
TRAN! It&#39;s 4AM, i&#39;m going to bed
My favorite critic giving my favorite album a 10. Something good.¬†
well done sir . . . well done.
The Chronic 2015
Get some sleep! Thanks for the amazing review!¬†
I really love this album and the lyrics that Kendrick has put into it. I just have one issue. He talks about his people, social issues, and his race a lot, which is awesome but I can&#39;t seem to make a connection since I haven&#39;t nor have my people have had that horrible treatment/problems with each other. I feel like I&#39;m missing a huge part of the message he&#39;s giving us. I guess I have to walk into his shoes and see th world from his perspective. Nonetheless, I love the the diversity, the creativity, and the fact that he isn&#39;t selling out to this crappy era of music. He&#39;s using his publicity and fame for the good of the world and to spread awareness about the problems with his culture. Also, the beats are phenomenal! And the question that won&#39;t be answered for a while, what is next? 
Im a fan of Kendrick but I dont think this album was a 10, but then again you will have to excuse me, I grew up listening to pac, big, jayz in his prime, nas in his prime, wu tang, bone thugs and the list goes on, throughout all the pop bullshit thats around,artist like  jcole and kendrick give me hope that one day you will need more than a club beat and dance to make it into the game.
Only Kendrick to make me agree with Fanfano
THE BEST ALBUM EXPLANATION HERE¬†<br>All explanations from DGIsAWinner from <a href="http://www.complex.com/music/2015/03/album-review-kendrick-lamar-to-pimp-a-butterfly">http://www.complex.com/music/2015/03/album-review-kendrick-lamar-to-pimp-a-butterfly</a><br>To Pimp A Butterfly is the story of where Kendrick was/is in his life post-GKMC:<br>‚Äî Wesley‚Äôs Theory ‚Äî He doesn‚Äôt want to be another Wesley Snipes (i.e. snatched up by critical acclaim and fame at an early age). Young Wesley was featured in a Spike Lee film when he was still considered an avant garde director and in Michael fucking Jackson‚Äôs first post-Thriller video for Bad directed by Martin Scorese‚Ä¶that‚Äôs pretty famous, pretty fast. Why? What‚Äôs the outcome? The government/America/the powers that be ‚Äî the ‚ÄúUncle Sam‚Äù the woman will get to ‚Äúfuck you up‚Äù referenced later ‚Äî will come bearing down you. Just like they did Wesley‚Ä¶¬†<br><br>‚Äî For Free? ‚Äî ‚Ä¶and guess who the woman talking is portraying during this piece? That‚Äôs right she‚Äôs America/powers that be. Everything she wants are the things Kendrick doesn‚Äôt want to become. Kendrick‚Äôs response? ‚ÄúThis dick ain‚Äôt free‚Äù. He doesn‚Äôt play by the machine‚Äôs rules. And the response from America/powers that be is ‚Äúnigga you ain‚Äôt no King!‚Äù Hence, the next track‚Ä¶<br><br>‚Äî King Kunta ‚Äî This track begins the thread of self-doubt masked in braggadocio contained throughout the entire album until he reaches self-actualization ‚Äî ‚Äúi love myself!‚Äù ‚Äî at the end of the album when he becomes a Negus. Hence the introduction of the poem that tells his state of mind post-GKMC at the end of this song. This track is critical in understanding this album. He‚Äôs becoming to realize he‚Äôs a slave to the powers that be and this is his response as a black man. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs mad‚Ä¶but he ain‚Äôt stressin!‚Äù He‚Äôs accepted his fate. And what happens when you accept your fate to the powers that be? You become‚Ä¶<br><br>‚Äî Institutionalized ‚Äî This song is his justification for why he‚Äôs become ‚Äúinstitutionalized‚Äù ‚Äî i.e. giving into fame/powers that be for the sack of his art ‚Äî and reasons why he will NEVER become institutionalized all the same. Hence Snoop giving the biographical recap of just who Kendrick is. This continues the poem‚Äôs (‚Äúi remember you were conflicted‚Ä¶‚Äù) story. This internal conflict leads to...<br><br>-- These Walls -- it&#39;s Kendrick&#39;s confession that he has in fact &quot;made love&quot; with the powers that be and its a marriage is one of convenience. This leads to his breakdown. The &quot;I can&#39;t believe myself and who I&#39;m becoming&quot; state of mind that leads to...<br><br>-- u -- Kendrick&#39;s self-doubt officially becomes self-loathing. He&#39;s taking himself to the woodshed and doing some real self-reflection. This is probably the most straight-forward message on the album. But, he&#39;s trying to overcome this state of depression and reminds himself that he&#39;s gonna be...<br><br>-- Alright -- the beginning of the &quot;pick himself off the mat&quot; state of mind. But, before he can completely overcome his struggles with doubt, denial and depression, he&#39;s faced with his biggest challenge yet...understanding he is in fact...<br><br>-- For Sale? -- Lucy (or Lucifer) -- is enticing Kendrick more than ever by directly letting him know what material possessions the powers that be can provide for him. There&#39;s a reason this is posed as a question in the title. Kendrick doesn&#39;t know the answer. And to discover the answer, he needs to go home to...<br><br>-- Momma -- Kendrick goes home to be reminded of what&#39;s most important to him and to begin to gain his confidence back. Hence the constant reminder that &quot;i know everything...&quot; throughout the track. Once he realizes he has the answers, he&#39;s ready to take on this burden of fame, etc; however, while he&#39;s home, he realizes that things in his hood still aren&#39;t right. He&#39;s made it, but his hood (Compton) is left behind to deal with the perils that come with poverty, being a black man, etc. His homies thinks he&#39;s changed and start playing...<br><br>-- Hood Politics -- This song begins with what is one of Kendrick&#39;s OGs making fun of what Kendrick has become and they barely recognize who he is now. And with that, Kendrick begins to &quot;fight back&quot; and his defense mechanism is to remind all of these guys who thinks he&#39;s changed that they are &quot;boo boo&quot;. However, what if they are right? And if so, the question is...<br><br>-- How Much A Dollar Cost? -- A deep question, and again, no answer is given. But what&#39;s key is Kendrick&#39;s confidence is beginning to show flashes of its old self. Going back home has Kendrick asking himself the right questions and with the help of the OGs/family/his girl/religion, he has a renewed sense of purpose and pride (black pride to be specific). It&#39;s also important to contextualize the &#39;94 &#39;Pac influence again. &#39;94 &#39;Pac was arguably one of the most known &quot;black&quot; revolutionaries of his time -- Farrakhan was still foremost -- and it&#39;s clear the Kendrick is beginning to sense the same responsibility to his community. And much like &#39;Pac in &#39;94, he has the vision and purpose, but no answer...<br><br>-- Complexion -- This is what I&#39;d imagine is his ode to black pride and will go down as one of Kendrick&#39;s definitive tracks whenever his career is complete. What&#39;s THE most powerful moment of this track is the inclusion of a woman, which is a fantastic as it reinforces the notion of black women being just as important to black community and culture as the homies he&#39;s trying to reach. And now, think about the single cover for the next track (a woman breast feeding...)<br><br>-- The Blacker The Berry -- This phrase is commonly referred to reinforce black pride in black women and their complexion (remember this song?). Again, an exploration of black pride, but also an acknowledgment and act of consciousness. He now knows he&#39;s a hypocrite as much of his views conflict with and even oppose one another. This is again another layer of his renewed responsibility to continue to ask tough questions without providing answers. He hopes to get the answer later (this is why the ending is sooooo important)...<br><br>-- You Ain&#39;t Got To Lie (Momma Said) -- Through going home -- hence the Momma Said in the title) -- he discovers purpose, renewed confidence, pride in his community, pride in his race, etc. and now he&#39;s nearly reached the stage of self-actualization: realizing exactly WHO he is &quot;you ain&#39;t got to lie to kick my nigga&quot; (i.e. be yourself) and most importantly...love yourself.<br><br>-- i -- This is his moment of self-actualization. He&#39;s ready to carry the torch. But again, this comes with a burden. He&#39;s shunning fame/powers that be and doing things his way (there&#39;s a reason this was chosen as the initial single. It was this story carried out in real life...he shunned expectations when this single was released last year). However, with this power comes great responsibility. He&#39;s ready to lead. And as with any man looking to lead his people, he has accepted his fate, and he accepts the fact that he is a...<br><br>-- Mortal Man -- Kendrick has accepted his responsibility, found his purpose and now (as anyone must do when they assume the mantle), he&#39;s seeking guidance. He knows who he is. But he still doesn&#39;t have the answers. And in seeking to get the answers, he presents &#39;Pac with his backstory -- THE SIX-PART POEM -- and hopes to get answers and wisdom...who was the ultimate mortal man in hip-hop? Tupac Shakur.<br><br>No answers are yet given, but this is a story of how they (America/powers that be/your own self-doubt) tried to &quot;pimp&quot; (lose self-identity and self-worth for material gain) a &quot;butterfly&quot; (a beautiful and now powerful black man).
If you didn&#39;t enjoy it the first time, wait a day and then listen to it all over again a second time. I think it might even beat GKMC.
Too many peg this as purely a political album. Kendrick is speaking about his own feelings and problems. Some of those are about race and his perception of compton. It isn&#39;t solely a black power album, even though it includes those elements and some people don&#39;t seem to be getting that.
Goddamn you, You aint gotta lie is one of the BEST songs on here
am I the only person who never had a problem with &quot;i&quot;? first time i listened to that shit i loved it
Wait Antoine likes this more than mooney store?
i fucking love you for giving this a 10 and spitting in all these haters faces, i knew i wasnt the only one who was vibing hard as fuck to this shit
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1320">22:00</a>
I feel like nobody&#39;s mentioning the acapella at end of &#39;i&#39; about &quot;negus&quot;... so sick. 
No record ever deserved a 10 this much. Thanks for recognizing it as such
I was really hoping he&#39;d give this a 7 or something so I could enjoy the comments
Is this his first 10?
This is the best rapper ever. I still bump his first mixape &quot;Youngest Head Nigga In Charge&quot; Only rapper that can come close to K.dot is K.dot himself. LMAO! Thhis album is the BEST ALBUM OF DECADE!!! HANDS DOWN. KING KENDRICK!!
LOL It&#39;s Okay. I can predicts Kendrick&#39;s future.<br><br>People will now say &quot;he&quot; fell off.<br>People will then buy all his shit.<br><br>I actually will be kind of happy when Kendrick dies, because people will appreciate his shit then. Just like a bunch of people did with Biggie, MJ, and Pac.
THIS MANY PEOPLE DIED... FEEL SOMETHING!
Alright (REMIX) Ft. ScHoolboy Q and A$AP Rocky = #1 U.S. Hit
bruh y&#39;all complaining that he never gives out 10s, now he gives his first 10 and you&#39;re all still complaining.
 Earl Sweatshirt- Grief 
I can&#39;t even look at other albums the same after To Pimp A Butterfly
Some day I&#39;m going to tell my grandchildren that I was there the day Anthony Fantano gave an album a 10
i just cant understand this dude...Why are u reviewing albums so quick.. let it grow on you man.. this album didnt do much after the first listen, i was like hmm okay. and now im like Wow hiphop needed this. not only hiphop but the world needed this. But overall dude take ur time with albums, cuz ur reviews are shit, aint gonna lie.
This album is the muthafuckin truth
LIKE IF YOU WANT A REVIEW ON EARLS NEW ALBUM!
Ok it was good but people are over reacting and cadillactica is better imo K.R.I.T 4EVA
This is fantanos AOTY
WAIT ANTHONY FUCKING FANTANO GAVE AN ALBUM 10/10????????<br><br>woah damn milestone achieved
Great album love institutionalize and mortal man is one of his best songs is my opinion.
And T&amp;Y got a 7, I feel like Anthony didn&#39;t give that album the effort he gave this one in dissecting it (because the concept in that album is just as good). I don&#39;t like rating albums, myself but T&amp;Y and TPAB are about even to me on the creativity level and albums of the year, so far.
sition.<br><br>lazythony bastano
Thank you for this review. Honestly made my day. I bought the album almost the second it dropped. Which was awesome cause monday was my birthday and it was like a early birthday gift. I also want to thank you for helping me remember what good music used to mean for me. Following your page for over a year now and I feel back to form. I could say more but not today because..... Idk.... Thank you. Forever. 
I am too far from USA, and in my country you never can&#39;t find a place to buy this kind of music... And if you buy it from internet - whit the shipment it comes triple the price it actually is, but that album i will buy ¬†!
I feel like this album will start something
in my short years of listening to music in general i must say this is the best album I&#39;ve ever heard. I know its not for everyone like Fantano said but this to me was just awe-inspiring.
Fantanos only 10s are hip hop albums? and yet people will still say he hates hip hop when he gives a random hip hop album a score lower than a 7.
Anthony finally comes to his hiphop senses. This record blew me away. 
Kendrick delivered. Classic album. Now we see what Earl does. 
Kendrick has 4 classics already. I honestly like Section.80 more than GKMC (even though they&#39;re both AMAZING. This album was amazing, and actually Overly Dedicated was incredible too. 
I must admit I do not watch every review of yours. However, the amount of work that you put into your occupation is mind blowing (in my opinion at least).<br><br>Thank you for what you do, Mr. Fantano.
TUT - PREACHER&#39;S SON MIXTAPE 
Breath of fresh air. Truly great album from beginning to end, from the instrumentation to the lyrics to the overall message. These types of albums are benchmarks in the music industry and will be looked at by future generations as revolutionary. Jazz, funk, soul are all genres that the African American community originated and I think Kendrick incorporated this with hip-hop beautifully. I feel as the people who didn&#39;t like it didn&#39;t comprehend it or fully grasp Kendrick&#39;s message. I&#39;m sure if he would&#39;ve used more &quot;hip-hop&quot; beats and still have the same message, those people would&#39;ve liked it but Kendrick did this on purpose because he doesn&#39;t want to sound like the rest. Those who are too young now and don&#39;t like this album will look back in the future and understand why this album will go down in music history. 
At first listen, as a Kendrick fan I hated the shit. As I listened more I understood the album and it began to grow on me
Bruh I know you didn&#39;t review this without even mentioning &quot;How Much a Dollar Cost&quot;...
Kendrick is a POET not a rapper fucking haters!!
I understand why whites are butthurt about this album .
good review. I love it, when you are getting into details that much. awesome work here.
OK Fantano... I&#39;ve been ignoring this album. Heard a couple tracks, thought they were trash. But because of your glowing review, I will listen to this in full sometime. And if you&#39;re wrong, this is the &#39;jump the shark&#39; moment for you. I will be back to let you know what I think.
Kendrick Lamar is trying to save society
Cal had me dying at the end. The biggest favor you can do yourself when listening to this album is to not bring your expectations from GKMC and S.80. 
To Pimpthony a Buttertano
You going to review the new kids bop? 
What&#39;s up with all the Lupe stans flaming Anthony in the comments?<br><br>I expected the Drake and Kanye stans to be parked in here with pitchforks... Oh well, we learn something new everyday.
And why are you guys mad he likes an album? I understand if he disliked an album. But you don&#39;t want him to like an album you don&#39;t like? 
Overhyped as usual. And what&#39;s even funnier is there will be at least 15-20 albums that makes Kendrick&#39;s look mediocre at best.¬†
Anthony you&#39;ve made some great points on this LP... kdot&#39;s 2PAB is like a documentary well thought of and appreciated took, it took it back to the roots of hiphop which the new generation don&#39;t seem to understand or refuse to understand<br><br>Not everything is for the club or bangout in your car. This LP was rebellious and revolutionary. 
If a rapper uses &#39;nigga&#39; as a filler i dont listen to them. First time hearing kendrick and he is all over the place and trying to hard to be different. 
22 minutes, fanta? that&#39;s an entire episode of¬†Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt which i stopped binge-watching to watch this so it better be good...
I love kanye west man thanks for the 10
Couldn&#39;t agree more with this review. To Pimp a Butterfly will go down as one as the greats 
:)
He finally gave a rap album a 10..and it deserves it......*CLAP *CLAP
bam.
2011 - Section.80 (8/10)<br>2012 - good kid, m.a.a.d city (9/10)<br>2015 - To Pimp a Butterfly (10/10)<br><br>keeps growing for Anthony.
Brilliant Album. Every listen makes me appreciate it even more. Feeds my soul. The ratings perfect too.<br><br>Alot of Lupe fans angry since their favorite rapper didn&#39;t get a similar rating, but I don&#39;t get why they would think Lupe review should have anything to do with a Kendrick one. <br><br>Get over it. Think of TPAB in isolation.
A 10!<br><br>Fuck yeh!<br><br>Thank you Fanthony HipHoptano!
This album is truly worth a 10. It&#39;s so different but that&#39;s probably why not a a lot will like it. Jazzy soulful Kendrick FTW.
I&#39;m no diehard Kdot fan but I enjoy his lyricism but I wasn&#39;t sold on GKMC being a classic¬†although I did enjoy it.¬†In my opinion¬†I like TPAB a bit more¬†than I¬†liked¬†GKMC¬†but I still feel like it&#39;s not his best &amp; that Kendrick&#39;s best is still¬†yet to come.
Ritvik Miglani has too much time on his hands responding to every comment LMAO!
How r u gonna give this piece of shit a 10, and not give Drakes new shit a 10
i died of laughter at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1315">21:55</a>
I wish you would&#39;ve let this album sink in more before reviewing this. I&#39;m on like my 9th listen and it keeps getting better.
The release of this review was more hyped than the release of the album.
Is it too early to say this is the greatest rap album of all time?
The only reason&#39;s given for not liking this album is because it doesn&#39;t sound mainstream, or isn&#39;t &quot;bumping&quot;, and honestly I think that&#39;s your poor taste in music. Although it&#39;s your opinion, I think people should be more open to different types of music. Because it definitely has catchy and appealing songs. Although I am a huge Kendrick fan so I&#39;m probably biased... This to me, is the best album of my lifetime. Extremely complex, extremely creative, and sounded great. 
well, this sounds awesome honestly
Thank you. For Explaining this album to Me
This album is the truth...going for another listen..Spotify where you at?
THIS DIK AIN&#39;T FRREEEEEEEEEEEEEE
theneedledrop¬†in these walls he is sleeping with the baby mama of the guy who killed his friend pay closer attention to the lyrics
The reason why he gave this album a 10 is because of his opinion you many think differently and that&#39;s the bad thing about criticism don&#39;t rant about your opinion because it is not right just like his  
And not ONE NEGATIVE COMMENT ABOUT IT
best tracks: weasley theory<br>king kunta¬†<br>these walls¬†<br>u<br>alright¬†<br>complexion¬†<br>blacker the berry
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=683">11:23</a>.<br>You just Shreked yourself, Onionthony Layertano.<br>Great review 10/10 would watch again.
IDC if I am a Kendrick Stan cause this just proves why I am
Fuck a Grammy this boy just got a 10! KingKendrick!
Review The Mouse Oufit LP&#39;s!!!!
I don&#39;t think I have ever seen a Needle Drop review lasting as long as 22 minutes. The album must be the shit for people to be discussing the album for this long.
Masterpiece<br>
It&#39;s as if Outkast and The Roots had a baby. And I&#39;m cool with that because those are my two favorite groups!
Since you&#39;ve shown interest in the band LA Dispute, would you ever consider reviewing an album by a band like mewithoutYou, Being as an Ocean, or This Town Needs Guns?
I&#39;d say Good Kid is a 10 and To Pimp a Butterfly is a 9
I&#39;m happy with the score but also a little conflicted at the same time. I personally felt as though Section.80 was a 10/10-deserving album, while To Pimp A Butterfly was more along the lines of a solid 9/10. Oh well, more Kendrick is all that matters! Great review nonetheless!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=475">7:55</a> Jesus Christ, was Anthony about to cry or something? Strange moment.
MY NEW FAVORITE ALBUM OF ALL TIME
Great Review thank you for breaking this down intellectually listeners need to understand the beauty behind this album.
&quot;Lucy&quot; is indeed, &quot;Lucifer&quot;. 
2015 might be one of the most important years for music we&#39;ve had in a long time
My life is now complete...
Lot of yall hate this album but were Kendrick fans for GKMC. When shit hit the fan is you still a fan?
The butterfly and the caterpillar.¬†
&quot;If you don&#39;t like this album you&#39;re on the wrong side of history&quot; - Gobthiny Nutano<br><br>I&#39;m not even strongly associated either way, but fuck man way to sell it
good review naked mole rat.
PLEASE TELL ME, HOW THE FUCK IS THIS ALBUM BETTER THAN MY BEAUTIFUL DARK TWISTED FANTASY????? HOW???
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=535">8:55</a><br>&quot;Alcatraz was purchased by a white man<br>For 5 grand, with intentions to expand<br>More prisons<br>So these correctionals ain&#39;t for rehabilitation<br>They for grossing a bigger business&quot;
Whoa... Anthony actually gave a hip hop album a 10/10.
Lol, so much hate in the comments. Great album, the more I listen to it the more I enjoy it.
I just want to thank you. I was already the only one of my friends loved this album, but hearing you review it so highly not only reassured me that it was excellent, it put a lot of it into perspective concerning the concept. Keep up the good work. 
KING 10/10
I love this album. Some of the people that I know don&#39;t appreciate it the way I do. Some of my friends say it sounds weird and immediately dislike it. Then, I know they had never heard a Kendrick album except for GKMC and maybe songs like ADHD and Ronald reagen era. I realize that most people who don&#39;t like it most likely aren&#39;t raw hip hop fans, but more pop and lil Wayne and drake type rap fans. They say that it isn&#39;t catchy. But I know that this album will be a classic.
Why do people care so much about other peoples opinion.<br>You didnt like it - Great<br>I thoroughly enjoyed it and will continue to do so¬†
In &quot;i&quot;, Kendrick stops the song because there&#39;s fist fight going on in the crowd. That&#39;s why Kendrick says, &quot;not on my watch, take that shit to the streets.&quot;
Alright and King Kunta are soooooooooo goooood.¬†
Hopefully the people who don&#39;t like it now will realize its greatness in the future. I&#39;m not surprised that this album is so polarizing, all great art is.
it makes me laugh so hard that people think this album isn&#39;t good... That really shows the lack of substance in people nowadays... smh
the album was boring to me. and i love kendrick.
You do an actual review of 22 minutes?! On this garbage but not dark sky paradise by big Sean?! Kendrick is ass bruh, everyone needs to stop saying this guy is even halfway decent, Bcuz he ain&#39;t even that.. Drake is the greatest of all time, he surpassed 2pac..never thought it would happen but it did.
Layered onions, eh?
Yo my nigga U finally ain&#39;t even lying my dog. I fucks with you for that. This album a masterpiece. Faxxx
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1235">20:35</a> is exactly why this album is a 10. Kendrick stuck to his guns and came out with a masterpiece. No big-name features or trap-styled beats and because of this, it&#39;s easy to see, at least for me, that Kendrick has turned to a fresh page of hip hop the world has yet to explore.¬†
There is NO WAY this album can live up to my expectations for it now
I think Kendrick just tweeted about you
As long as we got Kendrick trust me when I say WE GON&#39; BE ALRIGHT!
Wow fantano gave a 10. We have finally reached an agreement.
When earl drops his new shit (March 25th) PLEASE REVIEW IT!<br><br>Plz
it&#39;s 4 AM, i&#39;m going to bed..
Did this album feature the drummer from Snarky Puppy?
I&#39;ve actually never been a Kendrick fan. I really didn&#39;t love his first two albums like everyone else seemed to. I just thought he wasn&#39;t for me. But this album shocked me. I loved it start to finish. I&#39;m not just hyping it up - I genuinely was surprised with how much I liked it. I get if people don&#39;t like it - he can be polarizing - but this album is beautifully crafted, produced, and written - there is no denying that. I don&#39;t think Anthony is being generous here - for me, it is by far his best album and one of the best rap albums of the last several years - at least.
Thankthony Godtano 
10/10 FOR FANTANO
Very Good &quot;To Pimp A Butterfly&quot; Analysis<br>The best review. I enjoyed the way you properly understood the concept behind this album. 10/10¬†
Kendrick= This generation&#39;s Tupac¬†
I agree that the message is good in this album, and better than GKMC, but if I had to pick an album to listen to forever. I&#39;d choose GKMC, but it&#39;s very slim. I enjoy both quite a bit
Fucking amazing album. Instant classic. Definitely better than GKMC which is already phenomenal. 
Good luck Kanye your gonna need it
You&#39;ve already given your 10 of the year anthony<br><br>what if TPTB gets a ten too<br><br>what&#39;ll happen then anthony
Kendrick made Do The Right Thing into an album.
This comment section is a fucking warzone....
I loved this album
This album is a 10/10 compared to new school trash for the MOST part, but you are forgetting about those old school albums, they should be compared to the quality of Illmatic, Ready to Die, Lifestylez of the Poor and Dangerous
Every rapper in the world sucks except Kendrick- Anthony
theneedledrop¬†Anthony Do you see influence from albums like Digable Planet&#39;s Blowout Comb? ¬†What do you think about it?
AHH YEAH
This album seems to be in the Jazzy Mick Jenkins arena. Anyone else agree?
lol cuckthony fantano. album was decent 6/10
I guess he was serious about giving that 1O to someone else...
First I heard that don&#39;t brag about their fame and how many cars, money, girls they have. Jus artistic genius ,1000000000/ 10
im not feeling this album
Yeah, I really wasn&#39;t into this. Hood Politics is one of the worst songs I&#39;ve ever heard in my life. I guess hip-hop isn&#39;t for me.
why everyone here so mad that he likes this album? its his opinion and thats it.
I love this album Mr. Fantano, but lets be honest here, is this wasn&#39;t Kendrick&#39;s album, this would have gotten an 8.5, 8, maybe a 9 review from you. Very creative album but Kendrick&#39;s popularity and influence give him the extra star which I don&#39;t think he deserves.
He&#39;s saying why HE thinks it&#39;s a 10. Listen to his opinions. You don&#39;t have to agree.
Review houndmouths new album
Readingtoomuch Intoitano
he interweaves the tupac interview with his questions so beautifully and structured so well. That was my favorite track on the album¬†
I feel this is an evolution for the genre. A forward thinking, instrumentally and lyrically evolving album that, Anthony you said it right, will be bench marked. People will be talking about this for decades. This will also bring a great debate of GKMC and TPAB which are both masterpieces. I&#39;m on TPAB side.
thank you¬†
Damn it Fantano! I was almost all the way there with you. Then you had to go and make the &quot;greatest rap album of the past ten years&quot; comment... Nah Bruh! That title still goes to My dark beautiful twisted fantasy. I know, it&#39;s your opinion. I respect it but I can&#39;t go there with you.
I knew he would give this bullshit a 10. I just knew it. He goes for shock value. This is no way better thank Good Kid Madd City or if You&#39;re Reading This Its Too Late. This album was nowhere near as good as those projects. It was all Jazz and subpar lyrics. He just goes for the opposite of public opinion to make people mad. I&#39;m a HUGE Kendrick fan, but waiting 3 years for a new album and we get this? It was a huge let down. 3/10 max
This ain&#39;t even his final form! 
I was waiting for this one! LOL great review. I just did a review on my channel &amp; agree with a lot of your points. People who will just treat this album as a black vs. white issue are completely missing the point. This record is about become self aware, growth, and spreading your experiences. This is just a universal record from a young Black Man&#39;s point of view. Great job on this!
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaas finally
Every opinion I have heard about this album is just a clusterfuck of stupidity. You have the people who don&#39;t like it because all they wanted was Trappish Production or a GKMC 2 type album and don&#39;t value lyrics at all, and then there&#39;s the Dickriding fans who are calling Kendrick the Greatest of All time or Top 5 Rappers of all time worthy. These sentiments come from pure bull shit. On both sides the lyrics and meaning has just gone over people&#39;s head. People don&#39;t think, or look to compare this album to the Past or today&#39;s society. To me this is Kendrick&#39;s best work. It lacks some originality as a lot of it does feel like its Kendrick trying so hard to be compared to Tupac and be called one of the greatest. I get he has respect for Tupac, who doesn&#39;t really? But its the same issue Anthony had with Logic, he&#39;s too much of a fan and not his own man. I am surprised you said nothing about that Anthony, but not so much since you are a TDE fanboy. Kendrick&#39;s tone felt so much similar to Aquemini by Outkast, and he just took his emotion and heart for the Black community from guys like Tupac. I will say that I am really impressed with this Album. Like I said, it&#39;s Kendrick&#39;s best work. I also feel that it&#39;s the most beautiful album to come out in Months, considering B4.Da.$$ as beautiful as well, but it felt more original.
Lol when Fatano said &quot;THIS DICK AIN&#39;T FREEEEEEE!&quot; I nearly spit orange soda all over my key-board. XD Favorite part of the review.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Never mind just saw cal dance when he gave it a 10 and my head exploded....
Haahaaa! After giving Kendrick mediocre ratings for the past few years, Anthony gives the first 10 I&#39;ve ever seeeen!! Goooooood stuff!
WHAT!?!?!? Another 10 from Anthony?? He&#39;s only give 10s to 2 other albums!!
My god people beg for Anthony to get this review out and then they hate on him when they dont agree with his review, stupid.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=685">11:25</a> &quot;layered onions&quot; Shrek is love Shrek is life 
Kendrick making history with this album and some people don&#39;t even realize it smh
@theneedledrop can you explain the song U to me im trying to understand it deeper but im having difficulty
To any body that disagrees please PLEASE go on rapgenuis to help your futile minds understand the depth of every song on this album. And if your not gonna do that..then do not complain or contribute to anything opposing the true art of this masterpiece. Thank you.
looking ahead, there might be 3 10s ¬†this year, so far <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%232k15bestyearin2010s">#2K15bestyearin2010s</a>
To be honest I think the album has only two or three good songs. The songs weren&#39;t catchy and beats were underwhelming. Frankly I don&#39;t care about what Kendrick raps about. I wanted catchy songs like maad city, swimming pools, money trees and bitch don&#39;t kil my vibe.¬†
Did you not catch up the trap influence on Alright?
OMFG HE GAVE IT A 10!!!!!! The first time I&#39;ve ever seen a perfect score in one of your reviews and it couldn&#39;t be more spot on. (Literally and Theoretically) XD
Also the i on the album seems to be more of a skit
I have to say it should be a 9/10
God this album was amazing, I agree with Anthony wholeheartedly. I was personally glad that we had something different from Overly Dedicated, Section.80, and GKMC in the fact that all of those were lyrical and general &quot;conscious rap&quot; albums. TPAB was so fucking fantastic in my opinion. I loved all of Kendrick&#39;s previous albums, but this was something like i&#39;ve never heard before. Wonderful passion in singing and rapping from Kendrick, great features (as i&#39;m a thundercat stan), and BEAUTIFUL production. The beats are the highlight of this album, with beautiful bouncing tracks like Hood Politics, really smooth and sliding tracks like Institutionalized, and really just hyped up crazy tracks like Alright (which was my favorite song on the album). Kendrick did it again! Thank BasedGod for the existance of TDE in general man.
T&amp;Y was better
The Powers That B track review¬†next?
Make the one with Damogen Furies<br>
Totally agree, perfect album
On point man first video I&#39;ve seen from you. 
Holy shit he gave it a 10/10!!!!
you hit the nail on the &#39;watching a stage show&#39; description!
I&#39;ve always been a Kendrick fan but know he could be my favorite I loved this album he said some relatable shit and had told a great story... Mortal man was great I liked how he brought up men who were all arguably the best and most idolized respected known and hated leaders of all time who people begged for but when they stepped up to the task people wanted them dead n some just left them for dead Moses, JFK, Mandela, Huey Newton, Michael Jackson, MLK, n the 2pac interview was great a way to end the song
DEN AU TA DEN
Really wish Andr√® 3000 was featured on this album. There are quite a few songs by Kendrick that i feel were influenced by Outkast or just 3K&#39;s flow, for example Sherane in GKMC and A Life in the Day of Benjamin Andre sound ridiculously similar. not to mention 3K was also into the black righteous movement in his older music so he would have fit in so well on TPAB!! just my 2c though
A TEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN?????
album is fucking amazing, Kendrick is one of the greatest artists of all time. 2 classic albums in a row is not an easy feat, and section.80 was a great album in itself.
You a off brand ass nigga!!!! Hahah love this album n the beats
kendrick&gt;kanye
honestly, you have a beautiful vocabulary presentation, backed by an intellectual gravitas that illuminates this album review, while simultaneously strongly encouraging individuals to purchase the album for a personal listen, thanks I appreciate your efforts and mental depth you inserted into producing this album review indefinitely. ¬†
It&#39;s sad audiences are afraid of intelligent rappers who can&#39;t stay in one place.
this! dick! ain&#39;t! freeeeee!
Whether you feel this album is stronger or weaker than his 2 previous albums, I think most of us would agree its a fantastic record. To put out 3 great albums in a row is rare in music. In terms of hip-hop how many artists have released 3 or more great albums <b>in a row</b>? In my <b>personal opinion</b> A Tribe Called Quest, Eminem and Outkast have done this; Kendrick therefore sits with some of the best rappers of all time now.
I didn&#39;t like the album but that does not make me and other fake Kendrick fans. He is still an awesome rapper if not the best and will most definitely go down as a legend if he isn&#39;t already there. I&#39;ll just stick to Overly Dedicated and Section 80.  
i also would give it a 10. really great album. well done KDOT.¬†
This is just one of those albums that needs to be digested. I think the word needed to describe it is &quot;challenging&quot;. It challenges us to think critically about society in general, challenges us to interpret/analyze lyrics rather than have opinions fed to us on a platter, and challenges the music industry in general. He&#39;s doing many things that current artists are failing to do: He&#39;s using his mainstream fame to touch on critical issues and is making his audience step back and listen to music inspired by previous legends, which don&#39;t have to be played in the clubs 24/7. This is true &quot;brain food&quot; music. Kendrick has continuously proved himself to be a lyrical and musical genius and I will continue to support him. Can&#39;t wait to get a hard copy.
always appreciate your work. thanks for the great review
I hope Jenny Death is a worthy 10/10 candidate¬†
I think this album is genius. I think Kendrick really put his heart and soul into this project, and it was well worth the wait. People who want to jump on Fantano for his rating need to chill out! Enjoy the music! It&#39;s about the music! If you don&#39;t like the music, find another band, album, genre to listen to. It&#39;s an opinion. If person A can&#39;t give their opinion, then why should person B feel entitled to give their own opinion? Love the music for what it is. Enjoy it! If you don&#39;t like what was said... You don&#39;t have to support it. That&#39;s the beauty of having different tastes/different opinions. IMO it&#39;s 10/10 because Kendrick killed it on the mic, put on amazing features, got great production, and chose great beats. The story was completely emotive. It was beautiful, and cohesive throughout. Plus, he dropped some history on us. Lol This being said... That&#39;s my opinion and I really don&#39;t care if it&#39;s right or wrong. Because it can&#39;t be. Lol That is all! Enjoy the music everyone! Stay legend.
 I&#39;m proud of you Anthony finally a good review 
you know its serious when Anthony uses his real name
These points are very valid
this is music... dont limit it to one genre or one artist... its bigger than that ... its no beats on this album.. its production... its a movie .. take it as an expirience... not a hiphop album dont compare it to older albums or older artists.... this is crazy how alot of these people on here kinda knocks this... but this is ehat an album is suppose to be ... just because this album makes u think and not &quot;turn up&quot; like most of the music thats out ... doesnt make this any less than any classic..
Is the album art a vision of what Kendrick wants? Young black men standing on the White House lawn with a dead white guy, each with a bank roll in their hand? OR is this what Kendrick KNOWS young black men want?¬†<br><br>I think it&#39;s an interesting point, and at the same time, I do think Kendrick is finding it difficult to mediate between going all out &quot;white people suck&quot; and &quot;let&#39;s work towards a civil resolution.&quot; I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if there&#39;s an echo chamber in many circles within the rap industry that preach (superficially) &quot;the white man holding the black man down,&quot; when in reality, these white men gave these black rappers the opportunity and the success they now have.¬†<br><br>I would like to know where Kendrick stands in all this. However, I did enjoy the album, and admire Kendrick having the balls to move out of a conventional island of artistic safety that many rappers enjoy. What do you think?
FUCK YEAHHHHHH TEN OUT OF FUCKING TEN
10/10 OH MY GOODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Tenthany Kentano¬†
I didn&#39;t know Anthony&#39;s opinion on the album would piss you guys off so much  
Ive never listened to Kendrick&#39;s solo stuff,just his Flying Lotus collab on Never catch me. I pretty much saw that Flying Lotus had his hand in the beats on this project,so i decided to not look at any reviews or anything about this album,keeping an open mind. I downloaded it on Rhapsody and listened to it on my commute to school,back and forth. I was blown away the by the theme surrounding the lyrics and the lush jazz,funk and soul beats. In two listens i was enamored,all i could think was how beautiful this album is and that everyone should hear(also how if anthony didnt give this a ten,i would never EVER forgive him) I absolutely agree 110% on your interpretations and opinions on this album. This blew me away and is continously doing so right now. Thank you KINGTHONY KUNTANO
IMO this album stretches outside the boundaries of what we&#39;ve learned to identify as Rap for the last decade, which is why you have fans of the genre who genuinely dislike it. If you are able to take into account, however, all the different aspects(lyrics/production), messages, and genres(R&amp;B,funk,gospel,spokenword,folk) that make up TPAB it&#39;s easy to see how this album is not only a &quot;10/10&quot; but a possible landmark in what we&#39;re going to learn to identify as the genre in the future
I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Cal is incredibly racist tho
i don¬¥t get it‚Ä¶the hole thing‚Ä¶whats the point?<br>kendrik lamas music is so corny and borring‚Ä¶
I appreciate your efforts to avoid using the n word; it shows that you really respect our culture
Best review for the album that I&#39;ve seen yet, keep up the good work.
Good review.
YESSS
Great review. ¬†So happy you took the time to analyze the depth of this release, as i feel a lot of people just went through and skimmed the album. ¬†Going through and checking off what songs they did or did not like. ¬†Then they simply said... well its not as good as GKMC imo, so it gets a D-.<br><br>Great review.
I fucking KNEW he&#39;d give this a ten.<br> <br>Section 80: 9<br>Good Kid: 8.5<br>This: 5
plz don&#39;t use the term femc. people who rap are called mcs regardless of their gender.
I swear if this album gets snubbed from a Grammy........ I&#39;M GOING TO DO SOME HORRIBLE STUFF........<b>HORRIBLE STUFF!!</b> Ôªø
Great album review! You made me appreciate the album even more and open my eyes to some of the points I missed.
So I pretty much have to listen to this now don&#39;t I?<br>Okay, I can do that.
WE HAVE A 10!!!! WROHMN!!!!
is this anthonys first 10/10? I only watch his hip hop reviews and not even all of them only the ones I&#39;m interested in so if someone could let me know if this is his first 10/10 I would really appreciate it!
Agreed. ¬†This album can&#39;t get any better. ¬†Perfect 10!
laughing at all this hate in the comments
Section.80 - 8/10<br>GKMC - 9/10<br>TPAB - 10/10<br><br><br><br><br>Next Kendrick album 11/10 confirmed
that last part was so funny lol.
Glad to know that I was not the only one to get an Eminem vibe from King Kunta. Excellent review Mr. Fantano.
i had to give this album a couple listens to really appreciate it¬†
the instrumentals were incredible on this thing
Where can i buy your shirt
YEEH YEEEH YEEEH YEEEH
ONIONS HAVE LAYERS OGRES HAVE LAYERS
Whens the review dropping?
I don&#39;t really agree with Kendrick topic wise however, musically, this album is amazing 
Review Goldlinks please 
I can only hope that the perfunctory review of Strangers to Ourselves was due to the damn near religious fervor you were experiencing over this album. Wipe your eyes and take another look at the MM record again
Kendrick better get more grammys for this album than kanye has his entire career¬†
WOW.<br><br>Okay firstly, I agree with fantano in his statement that kendrick is a rediculously talented rapper in his ability to connect with one&#39;s soul and make you think, TPAB is definitely a classic peice of art. I love kendrick too. With that said, i still think this review is rediculously overhyped. Lets face it how it is: fantano has slowly become biased in kendrick&#39;s favor. I don&#39;t understand how he can give this album 10/10, and give Cole&#39;s FHD a 6/10 when the two albums share some of the artistic qualities that he claims to love. Most notably, the &quot;wanting to connect to his home roots&quot; that is literally cole&#39;s album theme. Also, lets not confuse an excellently expressed message with excellent music. Listening to this album, i often find these long drought out songs to bore me, even with kendrick&#39;s good messages.. And there are also more enjoyable beats in cole&#39;s album. I only compare these two because they are the most comparable- im not a &quot;J cole dick rider&quot; but I beleive FHD to be better than a 6, if this is a 10. Above all, I definitely think GKMC&gt;TPAB. This album is a solid 7/10.
The up know the album good when the review takes 22 minutes 
theneedledrop nice and detailed review.¬† My only piece of constructive criticism (and apologies if anyone already said this) is that women who rap generally dislike the term &quot;femcee&quot; and consider it to be somewhat sexist.
Tame Impala track review
On top of the stellar production, his stories are so easy to connect to and understand, even if you can&#39;t relate to them personally. I felt like I read a novel after I listened to this album!<br>KENDRICK LAMAR. BEST RAPPER ALIVE.
a 10.....<br>-____-
FROOT PLEASE
2 PIMP A CATERPILLAR (BUTTERFLY) 2PAC
Kendrick got that 2Pac interview idea from Mickey Factz Mickey Mouse mixtape
Amazing album, amazing review. This is definitely a massive contender for album of the year already. 
he&#39;s gonna review it!
lmfao that thumbnail had me cracking up...awaiting greatness!
What I really dug about the social issues in this album is that they didn&#39;t feel exclusive at all in that it didn&#39;t make me feel like the album wasn&#39;t made for me because I&#39;m not black. Unlike, say, Lupe&#39;s Food and Liquor 2, where Lupe, whom I really liked before FnL2, annoyed me with his outlook on race. But the social issues weren&#39;t compromised at all like they were on Watch the Throne did.
Woahhhhh a lot of you guys are dumb as shit
TRAN!...its four a.m. im going to bed.
can you review Froot from Marina and the Diamonds?
Great review.
Doesn&#39;t he usually wait till the actual release date to review something?
Rapsody is 2010 Kendrick.
FOREVER
I&#39;m surprised at all the Kendrick fans who don&#39;t like the album. I was sold on it almost instantly, and I&#39;m only loving it more as time goes on. Very curious to see where he goes next though.
Best rap album of the decade?<br>smh.....
There are some really fucking powerful songs on this album, he did it again, he puts a lot of heart in his music, all hail King Kunta (Kendrick)
Man I used to be a big Kendrick fan, loved all his shit from C4, to Section 80, to GKMC.. But damn this album is so garbage to me. I could care less about the message and I don&#39;t understand how all these non-black people fuck with it so much... I&#39;m not black so it&#39;s not relatable to me, I wish Kendrick never went down that path..<br><br>I actually had to stop the video because it was killing me listen to somebody like you review this album and rave about how lively the beats were when none of them caught my ear whatsoever. And talk about how the message is so good when half the shit Kendrick is talking about is false and contradictory..
why r u baLD DO U HAVE CANCEr
Album of the decade in my books
Honestly if Hip-Hop and rap is just entertainment for you then you won&#39;t like this album. Musically it wasn&#39;t really appealing to my ears either. But if you consider hip-hop as art or poetry. This album deserves a 9 or a 10 for sure. All of the songs are very deep, lyrically clever and dense.¬†
guys, you&#39;re all going to have to fucking chill. it&#39;s just pop music.
This album is the type of stuff that will go down in history. At least I hope it will. It saddens me to see that people are not fully appreciating this masterpiece. I agree with Anthony that everyone needs to sit down and really listen to this LP and then you&#39;ll see where Kendrick is really coming from. That&#39;s what I did and after listening to it numerous times everything clicks together and I came out of it very enlightened. It is definitely challenging but at the same time so rewarding. Kendrick really pours his heart out into this project. This not the kind of stuff you hear everyday and as Anthony said you don&#39;t get many Kendrick Lamars very often. I hope everyone appreciates this album for how amazing it is.
Classic hands down ...

Yessssss you have it a ten I love this record too
WOOHOO!!! 10/10!!!
Definitely biased towards Kendrick. This album is amazing and one of the best of the last decade, but the same argument he used against MBDTF applies here. While MBDTF&#39;s Achilles heel was it&#39;s lyricism, the production was insane. Here although the production is good it&#39;s no Chronic or Late Registration, no matter how good the lyrics were.
Album was solid and it brought something new to HipHop. But it is not a 10. IMO it is a 6 or 7. Production was excellent and Kendrick dropped Bars on a few songs but it&#39;s hard to listen to if you&#39;re not black. And it&#39;s 2015. Not the 80s with the funky, jazz sound. GKMC was way better all around.¬†
Comment section is filled with white internet nerds who get uncomfortable when they hear about someone being proud to be black/of color so they think that theyre being made to feel guilty.
It will be hard for me to dance to this album in the clubs, but I still f-cks w it
Kendrick and death grips have reached legendary fantano territory 
This album made my soul cum.
EVERYONE THAT SAYS THIS ISNT A 10 DOESNT GIVE A SOLID REASON FOR WHY IT SHOULDNT BE. IN A FEW YEARS WHEN YOU HEAR WHAT HE IS SAYING BECAUSE SOMEONE ELSE HAS BROKEN DOWN THE INSTRUMENTALS, SAMPLES, LYRICS, MESSAGE, ETC. FOR YOU, YOU ALL ARE GONNA ACT LIKE YOU LOVED IT SINCE DAY 1. 10/10 RIGHTFULLY DESERVED I REST MY CASE. PURE GENIUS. THANK YOU
You give fantastic reviews. 
Section .80 8/10<br>good kid, mA.A.d city 9/10<br>To Pimp A Butterfly 10/10<br>Kendricks next album..... 11/10?
yeaaaaaa yeaaaa yeaaaa
I am 18 seconds in the video and I can see the enthousiasme of mr needledrop. Good to see
I was one of the people that did not like Good kid mad city. However I love this album. The instrumental on this album are amazing and rapsody came through with a lovely verse on A zulu love. Anthony review the new earl sweatshirt track Grief.
DUDE!!! Tobias Jesson Jr.&#39;s new album Goon please check that ish out! released yesterday
You think a Kendrick rock record coming up next? Lol
I LOVE THIS ALBUM.
Completely agree with this review, my 2nd favourite album of all time, behind the Blade Runner soundtrack by Vangelis.
YOU DONE GOOD ANTHONY. 
dang we even agree on fave and least fave tracks.¬† KENTHONY DRICKTANO WE GOT SO MUCH IN COMMON
anyone love the track &quot;Complexion&quot;?!
Review FROOT!!!!!!! Im begging youu
I think &quot;Hood Politics&quot; is taken from the perspective of a gangster in the hood viewing the rest of the world, and showing the hypocrisy of the rest of the world looking down on people in the hood when they are jut as bad. Hence the lines about the democrats and republicans being another version of the bloods and crips.¬†
yes
Sorry man but you&#39;re totally on the K.Dot hype train, I absolutely love GKMC but To Pimp A Butterfly sounds like absolute garbage to me, definitely not a 10/10.
The Emperor‚ÄºÔ∏è
I felt like listening to Gil Scott-Heron and or watching a Spike Lee joint after I was done listening for the first time
This album is really fucking good, and I say that as someone who only half-liked GKMC and didn&#39;t like Section 80 at all.
I am came for the review Cal stole the show at the start,I also giving it a 10 as well being a hiphop head for 25 years I agree.
YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Awww, you put on your best shirt to review Kendrick&#39;s new album. &lt;3
Flawless Album, flawless review 
Can you do a track review of Earl Sweat&#39;s &quot;Grief&quot;? I love the song, but would like to think what you think. Thanks Kingtony Kuntano!
This album is Hip Hop in its purest essence, its just so nostalgic. You can just jam to this, especially if you like jazz and funk. But past the jazz and funky vibes, if you listen deeper you see that Kendrick has so much lyrical power as a hip hop artist and is easily going down as one of the best. I mean this man is a poet.. He did this album for HIMSELF and HIP HOP. He didn&#39;t do it for easy money and fame or for the masses. Which I hate to say it, has put music today like hip hop and rap in a rut. Everyone is trying to keep up with the next guy. Hip hop has a severe case of &quot;Keeping up with the Joneses&quot;. People like Kendrick Lamar are staying organic no matter how much money or attention they are getting. I&#39;m buying this album simply because I support REAL SHIT. If all of you support real shit, you should buy it to. More people need to support ¬†this kind of stuff. ¬†(Yes i was high typing this comment)¬†<br><br>EDIT: Enjoy this album shit by yourself, some headphones, and a nice blunt (if you smoke of course hehehe). I guarantee you&#39;ll like it if you didn&#39;t at first.
You&#39;re trash.¬†
Cal is a legend in the review game
I completely agree with everything he said.....you didnt touch on how much a dollar cost...that song is probably one of my faves and the story telling in that song is epic.....the end twist is crazy.....but this album definately album of the year candidate already
When you look at how many people produced this album (seriously, it&#39;s a lot) you realize Kendrick was actually the weakest link. Less would have been more if the message/concept was the main concern. To me, the message/concept fights with the production for your attention and comes off quite weird and gimmicky. I feel Kendrick has become too confident with mediocrity at times (though at times he is brilliant) and can just rely on production these days. He is past his prime and overhyped at this point, whereas I take nothing away from his past work. I just can&#39;t dig such a cheesy album. He has enough people who will like whatever he puts out because they identify with him regardless. But good for them and him, hip hop deserves an artist who is popularizing experimentation, even if his album isn&#39;t solid, it will inspire solid work.
His voice fucking sucks. Tried listening to this and had to shut it off about five songs in.
FUCKIN FUCK YEAH
All these people in comments saying this album was bad and people only like it because it&#39;s Kendrick Lamar. This album isn&#39;t something that&#39;s easy to listen to or easy to digest. There are no singles on this album. There isn&#39;t anything on this album that you can casually listen to while your going about your day. This isn&#39;t a GKMC and you guys need to spot acting as if it is. This is a hard hitting record. Don&#39;t you guys think there&#39;s some why most reviews of the album give it such high reviews? Everyone expected another GKMC and when TPAB was given everyone scrunched their noses and said the album was mediocre. Not every hip-hop needs to talk about money and hoes and have a trap beat. The fact that he blended so many different genres into his instrumentation so well only makes this album even better. This isn&#39;t your typical hip-hop album and everyone needs to start treating it as such. 
Wonderful job Anthony. This album is one of the greatest albums I&#39;ve ever listened to in my lifetime. It&#39;s a journey that will leave you mindfucked in the end, wondering how he just pulled that off. I recommend sitting down with headphones and lyrics printed out in front of you to really understand this album. The sad thing is most of the world will call this album mediocre because it lacks party songs and trap beats. But Kendrick has truly blown me away with this one.
this album is something different and that&#39;s why I love it so much. hip hop is starting to all blend together, but not this. 10/10
It&#39;s really a god damn shame dudes are shitting on this album when it can actually teach your ignorant asses something. I can understand the album going over the heads of some, but calling it straight garbage or overrated just isn&#39;t true.
MFW he lists every song as his favorite except for Complexion (my favorite) and You Ain&#39;t Gotta Lie (Top 5 IMO)
You crazy for this one, Fantano.
complexion ain&#39;t one of your fave tracks?? easily the best joint on here
This album was amazing, bettr than gkmc imo. His creativity was at a whole new level. Great review! So many layers and comcepts in this album, after 4 straight listens im just now deciphering it all
did u just say fem c?¬†
Classic album.¬†<br>It seems like Kendrick is making albums chronicling his life. GKMC was his life in the hood, what he saw what he went through. TPAB is &quot;His Life Part 2&quot; He has made it out the hood, but he&#39;s still going through a lot. He has fame, money, and power, but he is still going through a lot in his life. So he goes back home to find &quot;answers&quot; I think that&#39;s just a part of it. He also sees what is going on in the world and how crazy everything is, with all the events taking place just adds to how he is feeling. Its like a sequel movie to GKMC, only he&#39;s out of the hood and in the industry, and just like how he talks about how crazy the hood is in good kid, he now talks about how crazy the industry is. He&#39;s the butterfly being pimped by the industry. That&#39;s how I see it.¬†
Thank you anthony fantano. 
Not ¬†a K.dot fan, but I got to say that this album was fucking great. It certainly deserves album of the decade status and Let&#39;s be real he already got 2015 who u think is gonna drop or dropped a better album than kendrick?
I think we all know For Sale Interlude is about Kendrick&#39;s resistance from selling his soul
A 10 O.O unreal Kingthony Kuntano
He&#39;s saving the world with Funk, Rhyme, and Style <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23kingkendrick">#KingKendrick</a>
Hopefully he reviews &quot;I don&#39;t like shit. I don&#39;t go outside.&quot; when Earl drops it.
Damn thats dope. Fantano doesn&#39;t just give away 10&#39;s
Cuckthony Oldtano
It&#39;s time for the sound of Hip-Hop to grow again.  Chopped samples...southern based trap beats...ok cool.  But can you imagine hearing the same ish in 2020?  Not me.  These tracks were fuller with more creative sounds...this album was just more...MUSICAL.  It was not stereotypical Hip-Hop.  Kendrick and his team took it there.  His lyrics were poetically deep and sometimes humorous.  I&#39;m excited about the potential of Hip-Hop and what other levels it can reach.  It can actually be a music that stands on it&#39;s own without having to pay other publishing companies royalties for every song due to over sampling .  Salute to Kendrick Lamar and The Needledrop.
I never thought I would see the day Anthony would give a 10/10.
yeah, I felt it was a bit lengthy. Good, but too long for me.
 Yessss!!!!!!! Love the review!
Most of the negative comments have to be coming from KTT lmao
The only sad part of this review is that it makes it painfully evident that Fantano will not give Jenny Death a 10. RIP in peace Darth Grapes.
I feel like the majority of the people complaining about Anthony giving a 10 to the album didn&#39;t actually watch the full review.
Just a question, if this weren&#39;t the Kendrick Lamar who made this album, and instead some underground random, do you think it would be getting the same praise? I think not.¬†

Fantastic i agree with you and I don&#39;t think that it is a 10 only for the lyrics , beats ecc but because IT marked the rap/hip hop features of next decades .¬†<br>P.S. could you review Goon by Tobias Jesso Jr.¬†?¬†
Thank you 
BEEN WAITING FOR THIS<br>
Excellent review very detailed. This is musically and lyrically a great album with a theme as well as a message. The fact that Kendrick strayed away from the dominant sounds of today also was a massive thumbs up. 
Or maybe he just like everything about the album?
Definitely a 10/10. Kendrick has truly become an artist. Leaving that rapper title behind. Him and Cole are supposed to work on their joint album now. Can&#39;t wait
NO BANGERS 0/10<br><br>/s.
You KNOW it&#39;s biased when he doesn&#39;t mention ONE thing he doesn&#39;t like about it like he does with every other album. 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1203">20:03</a> <b>cough</b> Stephen Francis <b>cough</b>
I do agree. I believe this is an amazing album but not for the simple minded. I think it will be interesting to see the music videos for some of these tracks 
10/10? Jesus, really?
Some people don&#39;t seem to understand that these reviews are opinions. This review gets a 10/10. IMO
Excellent evaluation, Anthony. I felt the album presented more breadth in its discussion of socioeconomic and internal conflicts that contemporaneously appeal not only to Blacks, but moreso People of Color. The album certainly advocates and elevates Black power, and by all means it is beautiful. I think what&#39;s also cool is though the composition of its work is timeless, it is a suitable stand on today&#39;s injustices. I do applaud Kendrick&#39;s retrospective selection in using jazz and funk to illustrate his musical artwork. This being of course Jazz and Funk--not forgetting the Blues that have pioneered many contemporary genres of music--have its historical significance to the Black community. The album&#39;s political potency and anti orthodoxy renders rap in a whole other respect instead of major label manufacturing and commercialization. By far, excellent rating, I&#39;m sure this album will nontheless be valued as a classic overtime. 
I understand if you don&#39;t like this album, it is different, but why jump down fantanos throat? Like he always says, it&#39;s just his opinion, and he doesn&#39;t hate you for yours
wtf should have been 11/10 come on man. this is bullshit.
Three tens he&#39;s given out since he&#39;s made the channel. Two are hip-hop albums. Fuck yeah.
Personally, I think everyone focuses way too much on past reviews and scores. There is no point comparing, at all, because what the score boils down to is a combination of what the album was trying to achieve and how well it was executed. A 6 might be an unambitious but well-executed album, what (I think, anyway) Anthony is saying by giving this album a 10 is that it is both highly ambitious while being perfectly executed. Not to mention everything is yano, opinion..
Kendrick = G.O.A.T.
Second half of the album is a 7, the first half of the album is garbage... Barely a 3. 
IM SO ANGRY THIS DIDNT GET AN ELEVEN FUCKSAKE FANDINGO IM UNSUBSCRIBFIJGN FUCK YOU
Best hip-hop album of the decade? Nah. It&#39;s great, but not THAT great. It&#39;s not even as good as GKMC. Find me a moment on this album as good as &quot;Sing About Me, I&#39;m Dying of Thirst&quot;. Alternatively, find me a moment on TPAB as bad as &quot;For Free?&quot;.<br><br>I&#39;m loving the album, but it&#39;s not nearly as polished and musically or lyrically varied as GKMC. After five listens, it&#39;s an 8 for me, could possibly grow to a 9. But a 10? I don&#39;t think so. Too many moments that didn&#39;t sit well with me. Too few moments that make albums a 10/10.<br><br>If you disagree, I respect your opinion, just please wait a little bit before you start calling this best of the decade.
No mention of &#39;Lucy&#39; Anthony? For me he/she&#39;s central to a number of stories Kendrick tells on the record. Regardless - great review. Mr William Woods has a tough act to follow.
Is this a real 10? And I&#39;ve seen your what&#39;s a 10 video and have you released any other 10s because I know previous to your 10 video, you have not<br>
People really review music on YouTube? Who gives a fuck if you like it you like it if you don&#39;t you don&#39;t 
We all need to collectively stop paying so much attention to the numerical rating. The man spends 22 minutes meticulously explaining why the album is stupendous, but we&#39;re all hyped to see what score it gets so we can get into the same old tired conversations about &quot;GOATs&quot; and &quot;top #5&#39;s&quot; and &quot;#1 in the game right now&quot;. I think we lose sight of the music because of all the drama that surrounds it. If I had to guess, theneedledrop¬† probably uses a scale because it&#39;s the norm among reputable critics and because it generates a lot of controversy... but at the end of the day, it&#39;s just a number that conveys little meaning in comparison to all the words which describe it.Ôªø
The review I was PATIENTLY waiting for
One of the best albums this year without a doubt. 1) Tetsuo &amp; Youth - 9.5/10 2) TPAB - 9/10 3) IFYTITL - 7.5/10.... Kendrick and Lupe are way ahead of the crowd this year
people saying &quot;well if drake made this..&quot; bruh drake couldnt make this album if his life depended on it smfh
cant believe what im reading in these comments.. if you didnt think this album was ATLEAST an 8 then you gotta listen harder.. or it just wasnt for you. But dont come in here saying its whack or some other shit because i agree with anthony this shit is perfect. and not &quot;just because its kendrick&quot;
I have goosebumps
OHHH SHIIITTT
It&#39;s like Anthony to make me love an album more than I already do
Your the best man! you should review Tribal Seeds album &quot;Representing&quot;
REVIEW CHON - GROW !!!!!
It&#39;s a great fucking record.
Check out the &quot;By Fire&quot; EP by Hiatus Kaiyote!<br>Australian avant-progressive soul/jazz/future magic band <br>The songs have SO MANY IDEAS in em
10!
Any one know where I can get this album on vinyl?
Good luck Kanye for trying to top this masterpiece haha. And great review Anthony !
BILLY WOODS NEW ALBUM BETTER GET A 23/10
aaaand phrases &quot;kendrick&quot; &quot;lamar&quot; &quot;to pimp a butterfly&quot; and &quot;TPAB&quot; are added to my phrase filter list on /mu/.<br>thanks Anthony!
it&#39;s a good album. but not a perfect 10. I think this album becomes more of a shining light amongst a sea of shit no talent warble youtube rappers. But that one song on this album, where he just repeats the same shitting lyric over and over again‚Ä¶ruins it
classic album¬†
Wait but kendrick &quot;isn&#39;t the next socially aware rapper&quot; 
TPAB is a classic.
You&#39;ve got me so fired up to listen to this :-D
genre pushing album. captured the L.A. rap sound for me in a thoughtful and interesting way. rap album of the last 5 years for me.¬†
10 let&#39;s go
A well deserved 10/10. Fantano is not lying. Honestly 
 If I wanted to watch 20 minutes of rim licking I would have watched porn
Wooooooow!!!
No Colbert Report song :(
WE FINALLY GOT A TEN ON OUR HANDS!!! 2015 WE DID IT JENNY DEATH NOW THIS YEAR IS TOO TURNT
Straight Outta Wyoming
I&#39;ve been following all of Kendrick Lamar interviews since GKMC and this album is exactly what I expected.  CLASSIC! HE expressed his state of mind on himself and society today. Positive message.  Those that dislike the album doesn&#39;t understand where he&#39;s coming mentally to appreciate the ART!

Awesome review man. You picked up on a lot of stuff I didnt&#39;t see when I was listening. The poem part was really interesting. I had no idea it would lead in to the next song like that.
WAYT A SECKERND ALL UV ANTHONY&#39;S 10/10 RAVIEWS BEGINS WITH THE LETTR &#39;T&#39; ERMAGERSH ILLUMINATI CONFIRMD.
this review really has got people in their feelings, I mean it&#39;s just a review yall lol....

Great review, this album literally hit the nail on the head. The best thing to come out this year so far (yes clairvoyance). TPAB was what we needed and came out in a perfect time. It was purposeful and personal. It does not fail because it&#39;s honest and it&#39;s considerate. Yes Drake&#39;s mixtape was bullshit, and yes Testuo &amp; Youth should&#39;ve had a better rating, but if you&#39;re REALLY  honest this album gives more than most album&#39;s I&#39;ve heard both musically and lyrically. There&#39;s no doubt in my mind that this is a 10. Sooo all you critics that don&#39;t show love &quot;boo boo&quot;.
HOW DARE YOU not intrude yourself as Kingthony Kuntano!<br>unsubscribed.
He gave this a 10 but T&amp;Y a 7?<br><br><br><br>Lol. I&#39;d do the same. 
The tracks remind me of The low end theory, Which is also an amazing album and one of my favorites
DAMN! theneedledrop a rare 10/10 rating! I completely agree though!
I give this a 1,000,000 out of 10
Great review, I didn&#39;t even notice the poem had a connection to the individual songs, now I&#39;m going to listen to it again. Thank you 
I wouldn&#39;t be mad at him if he re-reviewed Lupe&#39;s album because Kendrick&#39;s album is amazing. Kendrick been my favorite since 2010 and he still is so I&#39;m happy for the 10, but with that being said T&amp;Y is a better album, there isn&#39;t a skippable track on the album, collectively it&#39;s a masterpiece a very rare album. It&#39;s sad the amount of hatred Lupe gets from people that are part of the industry because his album will not be touched this year best album is 17-18 years there is not a better hip hop album. I also think that personality plays a roll in this too. Lupe comes off as a pretentious person (in defense), while Kendrick is more humble/laid back and likable it&#39;s sad but I believe that has a lot to do with some of these reviews as well...Fantano had a hard time criticizing Lupe&#39;s album and I never really saw that from him before and it&#39;s extremely unfair. I love that he gave my dude a 10 though I love this album.
Every song sounds the same
You guys always bitch when he gives an album a low score but when he finally gives a high score you&#39;re still bitching????
This album is great! Nice review. 10/10
Kenny crossed over, been tryna get Anthony to review my music for years!! You can find my albums on iTunes &amp; Datpiff!! &quot;Criminals&quot; ft. 2pac video on YouTube!!! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23forever">#Forever</a>
Thank you! Great review!!! The poem he reads to structure the album was genius. I actual stopped during my first listen at that track and was surprised and excited to her it concluded in such a creative and purposeful way. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23gamechanger">#Gamechanger</a> 
Great Review man!!
First of all, love the review. I think Kendrick gives a voice for issues that are passed on in today&#39;s hip hop culture because they don&#39;t showcase the same blind confident arrogance that many rappers gravitate to. I also love his ability to deliver with a mainstream appeal record without sacrificing what he believes is necessary in a high quality album. I would love to hear your thoughts on one of my favorite artists; Grieves. His last record, Winter and the Wolves, came out a year ago so I&#39;m a little late on requesting but I think it&#39;s a deep hip hop and soul record and would love to hear your thoughts on it
Fucking classic album. Absolute classic. Anthony speaking of the tupac interview you should give a listen to Mickey Factz mixtape &quot;Mickey Mause&quot; from 2013. He did this same process with an interview with Andy Warhol. 
my experience with listening to this album was enjoying Wesley&#39;s Theory for about a minute until Kendrick started screaming at me with 30 different effects on his voice<br><br>15/10 ruined my life
HIP-HOP IS NOT MUSIC... that being said it should/might go under some other art form.¬†
Brilliant review as always, Anthony. This album has been blowing my mind and all the thoughts I had on it seemed  hyperbolic, as the album was not only fantastic, but possibly better than GKMC. I consider that album to be a work of genius, so I thought topping it would be impossible, but Kendrick has achieved to elevate to another artistic level with TPAB. So I&#39;m glad to see the high rating.
Very good review needle drop I was really disappointed with your big Sean video but u got me back with this. This album took me back and left me wanting more which I don&#39;t think gkmc did. He did take a more mainstream approach with the beats and I think that&#39;s why some folks hate or trash this new body of work. But I feel like the same stories are being told just in a different way and using the old 70s g funk type of sound. Both albums are extremely dope and I think there really great for the culture and trying to push issues but not sounding to damn preachy.  Can&#39;t wait to see how this whole album sounds live with the instrumentation and the album is so well but together I have to listen to it from beginning to end. I won&#39;t rate it yet say it&#39;s better then gkmc or give it that classic status yet I won&#39;t even say it&#39;s the best of 2015 yet because of lupes album but I will say man he has given me a lot to digest and digest I must. 
10 OUT OF 10, I THOUGHT THIS DAY WOULD NEVER COME. WE LOVE YOU KENTHONY LAMARTANO
This dude literally made a 20 minute video explaining why he gave it such a good rating but some of yall dumbasses still saying &quot;you just gave it a 10 because it&#39;s kendrick&quot;
please disregard the trolls on the comment section trying to get a rise and just keep enjoying the album if thats how you felt about it. Everyone has different taste in music, some people will hate this and some will love it, but your opinion is all that matters
When I first heard Tupac on Mortal man I flipped shit¬†
People saying this doesn&#39;t deserve a 10 need to stop. I&#39;ve listened through the whole album now about 5 times and it is groundbreaking. Yes, the first listen I thought it was great but I wouldn&#39;t have given it a 10, but each play through it just gets better and better. Keep listening to it and you will realize how truly great this album is.
People legit don&#39;t like the album for the sole reason that he didn&#39;t rap over trap beats -___- and don&#39;t even get me started on drake stans, yall mfs are worse than kanye and eminem Stans at this point. I can&#39;t stand this club/trap era that were in, if you want to listen to that shit go listen to migos, gucci, Drake, tyga, etc...!you don&#39;t eat a taco expecting it to taste like pizza 
I yelled when he gave it a 10
I swear you guys think Anthony&#39;s here to satisfy you. He could give less of a shit to people who post negative comments about him. He reviews for himself and people who actually want to hear what he has to say. And to justify your opinions about how &quot;shitty&quot;this album is just proves how ignorant you really are. With that being said, this album is truly impeccable. 
See, we told you you should review it.
Damn 22 minutes. He must really go into depth on this one
Peep how many times kendricks says &quot;i told em, they told me...dont let them tell you, you should tell them...momma told me, momma said, grandmomma told me. momma told them, you shuld listen to them, you should not listen to them. dont let them listen to you&quot; and then you just pepper in some &quot;CIA&quot; and presidential references and folks accept it as lyrical. certainly not 10/10.
earl track review
He definitely could have went into For Sale? better. That song is about the devil. When he says &quot;Luci&quot; he is talking about Lucifer. I didn&#39;t catch this the first time i heard it and once i connected the dots it blew my mind. Give it a listen and actually think about it. Its crazy.
And it goes 8(Section.80),9(GKMC),10(TPAB).
For once, Anthony we agree on hip-hop.<br><br>This makes up for your negative Yeezus review.
great review
It&#39;s a 10!!!!¬†
hahaha 10? yeah right<br><br>It&#39;s just trendy to like Kendrick at the moment so he gets high reviews.
Real dude talking about real shit. I love you Anthony you give me faith in music analysis. 
Therecordspins be like 0/10 don&#39;t have chief keef in it 
Hey, Anthony, do you plan to review Earl&#39;s new¬†single, or wait until his album drops?
Totally agree you pretty much said my thoughts on the album more intelligently 
The Kendrick Lamar EP: üî•<br>Overly Dedicated: üî•<br>Section 80: üî•<br>GKMC: üî•<br>To Pimp A Butterfly: üî•<br><br>I don&#39;t see what people gain out of hating, Kendrick Lamar says more in 2 songs then some artists say in their whole careers &amp; I&#39;m not even exaggerating. 
Also King Junta was a plain Jane ass song and I&#39;m glad the leak didn&#39;t have blacker the berry 
My only real hang up with this review is you didn&#39;t intro with &quot;Butterfly Pimptano here&quot;
Great review. 
I can respect the lyricism and themes on this album but at the end of the day, I just think it falls short sonically. I feel like this is not the type of album I can just sit back, relax and listen to mindlessly like I can with Kendrick&#39;s other albums, this is the type of album I&#39;ll go back to and listen to a couple of tracks off of when i&#39;m bored. Regardless, it&#39;s not a terrible album, just not great.
You have been forgiven
Thank u someone gets it  and u gave it a ten I totally agree  best album of the year 
This comment section is fucking abhorrent. Kendrick has reached his full potential here and made an album like none other in history.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=733">12:13</a>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23yourebeingbasic">#YoureBeingBasic</a> ¬†

This is the album that I hoped Kendrick would make after I first heard &quot;Ab-Soul&#39;s Outro&quot; on Section.80 so many years ago. ¬†I felt severely underwhelmed throughout most of my first listen but when I got to the end, it all clicked. After many listens, I completely agree, 10/10. It is dense, it is challenging at points, even for a Hip-Hop nerd as myself. Not everyone will like it, and that&#39;s okay, because what Kendrick is saying is worth the hate, at least for those who are really willing to give it a thoughtful listen. Fantastic review, theneedledrop.
I&#39;ve always loved Kendrick&#39;s flow, what he had to say, and instrumentals, but his voice kinda bothered me.<br><br>Not the case with this record. I absolutely love it.
Anybody who hating or don&#39;t like the album fuck your opinion just go praise your favorite artist and since that&#39;s not going to happen you fuck with Kendrick you just want to go against the grain. Mind Elevation K.Dot 
finally a fair deserved 10. i call it an art not a rap album
This for all the mofuckas that said Hip-hop was dead, the second coming is at hand my nigga.
Kendrick has pretty much outdone every single rapper in history and this is what his 3rd album? Pfft he is getting to much needs to be stopped before the rap game gets to fucked up for ever because I can&#39;t see or think of any rapper to take things to this level. 
Great review, definitely an album worthy of a 10. It&#39;s sublimely executed on all fronts.
If this wasn&#39;t 10/10 I would&#39;ve lost some faith in these reviews
So many basic people in the world...
Kendrick Lamar definitely got somthing going on 
TIred of all this &quot;TPAB was nowhere near as good as MBDTF or T&amp;Y&quot;..Apparently the latter two albums did not appeal to Fantano the way that TPAB did.<br><br>Imo TPAB is superior to the both aesthetically, vistually, and lyrically...Spitting bar after bar does not make a track lyrically superior. But spitting dense, layered bars, that make you have to listen twices, thrice, maybe even four times to get the entire message?..that takes talent!! This has been the only album besides The Miseducation of Lauryn hill and Illmatic that makes me want to not listen to just one track, but the entire album from start to finish, time after time....<br><br>I love T&amp;Y, I can dig MBDTF, but TPAB digs into my soul....but this is all my opinon. Some people like Big, some Tupac
Y&#39;all know this is his opinion right? 
Album so good that Anthony went bald again 
theneedledrop¬†bro how many times have you listend to this? Also are you listening to it in headphones? I&#39;m having a very different experience everytime (I can focus on the individual sounds and concepts better through headphones it seems).
Kendrick is  a legend. He&#39;s one of those people you tell your grandkids about.
Its funny how people can&#39;t enjoy this album because they don&#39;t understand the meaning and metaphors of the tracks and blame the album/artist instead of their own stupidity.
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1320">22:00</a>. . Yea Yea Yea Yea Yea Yea Yea Yea. . .
Hopefully kendrick and Cole do that collab album now 
The first time I heard the album, I kind of knew it wasn&#39;t going to be a swimming pool album kendrick even said it.On power 105 he said no swimming pools but I like it definitely not a 10 but atleast a 8 or 9 kendrick is only going to get better, lyrically he is a genius and a master at the craft and when the shit hits the fan if he ever falls off I&#39;ll be there cause you only get 1 lamar every 5 years if the industry is lucky, I&#39;ve been in the industry &amp; k.dot is bringing me back and want to come back so <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23needledrop">#Needledrop</a> your the man thanks again for supporting k.dot4va
One of your better reviews. So kudos to you my friend. Keep it up and I look forward to future reviews. I&#39;ll be using theneedledrop as a reference for years to come.¬†
I formed my own opinion before checking out Antwon&#39;s review, and yeah, this album is an easy 10/10. Haven&#39;t heard anything this good in awhile.
MBDTF spoke about a lot of the same topics that this album did, and had equally great production, and he gave it a 6. Yes, it&#39;s all subjective and we all have different opinions, but this review and the review for Twisted Fantasy show how Anthony&#39;s reviews can be biased based on the artist. We all have biases, but at least admit them if you&#39;re going to base your reviews upon them.¬†
ya&#39;ll are sleeping on Testuo and Youth tho
Damn.. that is not a 10/10 man... NO..... hahaha
I&#39;m feelin&#39; a godly <b>10</b> on this one. TO DROP A NEEDLE! theneedledrop¬†
Fuckthany boitano kills it with another swagged out review. Peep the technique!
22 minutes? Im ready here with my ears and potatoes to eat
the fact that he gave Kendrick a 10 and Kanye a 6 for MBDTF just tells you how revolutionary this album was
Love kendrick&#39;s albums but this was a let down for me I get the social commentary he is rapping it&#39;s just off for me I needed  a slight balance between the funk and the rap yes it was cool I felt like I was listening to a new james brown, Marvin  gayye  like artist but I was waiting  for that song that would put me in a trance. But didn&#39;t get it and that coming from kendrick is what disappointed  me. Overall it&#39;s a good 8/10...opinions
YOOOOO
COFIRMED: Everyone hating on this album is a basic bitch that can&#39;t handle change
Its really sad that the white people can realize the greatness of this album and ignorant blacks cant. You ask for real hip hop and old school music and then when you get it you want to bitch and complain. There&#39;s ¬†nothing wrong with giving this a ten if your simple bitch ass mind cant comprehend then its your fault this is music at is finest fucking out of here with that negative shit because you cant smoke, jam and party to it.
&quot;That backflip tho!&quot;
Review Rebel Heart by Madonna!!!!!
I wish you had paid as much attention to &#39;Tetsuo and Youth&#39;. This is a good album but it&#39;s clear that you are partial to Kendrick - best rap album of the decade?! Come on man... *smh
This album is simply too complicated and deep for people, same people who don&#39;t like this think Big Sean is top of the rap game.
he says alll my fehvrit rehps
Lol people on the comments.. &quot;I rather a real hip-hop album.&quot; Oh man... that&#39;s what&#39;s wrong with folks these days. Kendrick drops a classic album and say they want &quot;real.&quot;
This review is almost as good as the album
holy shit lol
Finally he reviews it lol. I knew the 10 was coming, I seriously was on Rap Genius with everyone else when the album got leaked the next day. I mean, at the end of the album I&#39;m left speechless at how good it was. Doesn&#39;t have the story GKMC had, but maaan did he hit strong on current topics in the today&#39;s world.¬†

Such a great review. When I first listened to this album, I was kind of ignorant in the sense that I was personally attracted to the more catchier songs from Good Kid, M.A.A.D City, such as Backseat Freestyle and Money Trees. So, when I first heard this new album, I wasn&#39;t that much of a fan. It was sort of the whole &quot;how can Kendrick honestly top GKMC?&quot; prejudice. It was just alright to me, since no song really seemed to catch on to me as being that great. Yet, after listening to this review, and understanding what this album is actually trying to accomplish, I&#39;m probably gonna give the album a second listen. Maybe this time, I can appreciate the album more than I did. Once again, great review. 
easily one of the most influential, at least to myself, albums i&#39;ve listened to period.
Is the song he performed on the last episode of colbert report on the album 
He&#39;s gonna retire 
wow u gave government plates a 6 but this a freaking 10??? dude u r off the rails stop reviewing please!!!!!
Perfect review from the internet&#39;s busiest music nerd!
This review was amazing that guy from therecordspins Channel should never do another video ever again you killed this interview you even broke it down in some aspects that I didn&#39;t even think of like with the poetry connecting with the songs amazing review!! You get a 10!
Haters gonna hate! Great review!
Charles Hamilton &gt; Kendrick Lamar 
This album is for creative thinking listeners, Kendrick lamar rue fans, and BLACK PEOPLE WHO NO FUCKING STUPID... like how the fuck are you hearing this album and saying its not good.¬†He just did shit and said things in this album that yall favorite rappers wouldn&#39;t do and say because they too scared to. THIS IS NOT A FUCKING RAP ALBUM FOR DUMB NIGGAS. ITS A MUSICAL STORY FOR PEOPLE WHO LOVE SHIT LIKE THIS. this generation fucked up and stupid as fuck by yall responces
I can see why you gave this a 10 cuz you got good taste in music 
Album is life changing. This could very much well be a musical or Boardway production. He made history with this! 
I came here to see Anthony&#39;s erection for this LP. Album is dope too. 
ANTHONY IS GOD
I hate these album acronyms.
Every Nigga is a star. ..You too Fandango.
Wow, a 10! i think this is a first no?
A 10? FUCK FIRST 10 SINCE DEATH GRIPS BUT HE TOOL THAT ONR BACK SO FIRST 10 
See I understand why people don&#39;t believe it should have gotten a 10 out of 10, hell if anything I would give it an strong 8 (soft 9) out of 10. What seems to be the problem is that a lot of folks are looking for the next GKMC, and this is no GKMC. This was Kendrick taking, what I believed to be, a huge risk. I can&#39;t remember the last time this generation of rappers managed to make an album with a funky, soulful, jazzy feeling that was reminiscent of older music and distanced itself from the said oldies. It just has an old times feel, but not like to the point where he is trying to be a part of that genre rather give it a shout out or pay a little homage. Personally I like how he somewhat strayed from the beaten path of rappers rapping about their drank and their dank. Their money stacks and stacked bitches. He did the same of GKMC but this time felt more soul searching and showing how just becaue you made it doesn&#39;t mean your life should be all about what all these rappers are rappin about. While GKMC was more inspirational of getting out of whatever situation your starting in. All in all, not perfect (8.5/10) since I consider Illmatic 10/10, College Dropout 9.5/10, The Blueprint 9/10. And if you didn&#39;t read the all of the ramblings before now, this is all my opinion. All personal. That&#39;s the beauty of music, if you don&#39;t find one person&#39;s music great, there is guaranteed to be some artist&#39;s work out there that you will.
Grief, by Earl Sweat pls!
THANK YOU! Finally someone who loves this album as much as I do.¬†
Stop being basic people!
Of course he gave it 10! smh
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW!!!!<br>Goodbye &#39;&#39;The Money Store&#39;&#39;. Welcome to &#39;&#39;To Pimp A Butterfly&#39;&#39;.
That was a very thoughtful and thorough review Anthony. ¬†Well done!
I do have to say I did not enjoy this review as mush as your Big Sean &#39;Dark Sky Paradise&#39; review it did have it&#39;s moments here and there, like when you give this album a &quot;10&quot; clearly we didn&#39;t listen to the same album it deserved a 15...¬†Nooo I&#39;m kidding this review was DA BOMB. It wasn&#39;t a 2 or 3 minutes hey I skipped around the CD review, nope <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1337">22:17</a> minutes of a fan talking. Great job I can tell you really felt this album as I do. Oh have you ever giving Dilated Peoples &#39;Directors of Photography&#39; a listen?
Is this his first 10 he has given of an album?¬†
This. Dick. Ain&#39;t. FREEEEE
this cal aint freeee!
I knew there were going to be a whole bunch of GKMC fans hating this album. GKMC was really easy to listen to and had a lot of pop appeal. Basically anything that has jazz is gonna get hate for &#39;not going hard&#39;¬†
Honestly don&#39;t understand how a single person in the comments can argue with Anthony. This album sonically, conceptually, and lyrically IS one of the most powerful and thought provoking albums in years. I can&#39;t disagree with the 10/10 because it honestly is perfect. I loooove MBDTF, and I do disagree with Fantano&#39;s 6/10, but i&#39;m sorry; you CANNOT compare the two... They are completely different and when you sit down and dissect both, as a full-package &quot;To Pimp a Butterfly&quot; blows Kanye&#39;s magnum opus out of the water.<br><br>Not only that but clearly his opinions are not to far off from the general public&#39;s. According to critic reviews and user reviews on Metacritic this is by far his most critically-acclaimed album (so far), and from Section.80-present there has been major growth in Kendrick.¬†
hell yeah! this record is already a fucking classic
I love the second half of the album, from 7 onwards is really top class, but I can&#39;t get with the first few tracks unfortunately, like a vague pastiche of 3 Stacks - not a bad thing at all - but I just don&#39;t feel them; 8.5/10
earls single now
the only problem I had with this album is that I just don&#39;t like jazz music, which unfortunately put me off a few of the songs. I&#39;d still rate this a 9 based on the lyrical skill demonstrated in this album, but GKMC will always be a 10 for me
this record is a 4 at best. kendrick has this idea that he is some sort of visionary and high level thinker, but in reality he is no more intelligent than you and i. 
WHAT
No such thing as a wrong opinion when it comes to music especially when the person already has a broad taste. Its stupid that people can&#39;t realize there are differences in opinion and just because the song doesn&#39;t immediately gratify you means its bad. I have very little to no interest in this album but with that being said you guys are getting way too butthurt on an opinion¬†
Seriously? I haven&#39;t even watched the the video yet. I just saw the rating and was immediately irate. You gave strangers to ourselves a 5 and this a 10? I know it&#39;s just a number but come on. Are you trolling?  
I agree, King Kunta sounds like Eminem&#39;s I&#39;m Shady&#39;&#39;
I still don&#39;t understand why people get so caught up on Anthony&#39;s OPINION. It&#39;s an OPINION, no you don&#39;t have to agree with it BUT people get so mad at him for stating his OPINION I just don&#39;t get it lmao.  
In 20 years Fantano will re-review this for classic week
Not a 10. Come on man 
People should really stop writing off the people that aren&#39;t in love with this album as different insulting stereotypes. &quot;Listen to an album before 2010.&quot;, shit was funny, but untrue in probably most cases. &quot;People that don&#39;t like the album are racist.&quot; No. &quot;They don&#39;t get the messages.&quot; Not likely.<br><br>Maybe some people like music in their albums. This is the same thing with the Uncharted video game series. One side says it&#39;s the best series of all time, and the other side says &quot;I like video games in my playstayion, not movies&quot;. There is so much &#39;interlude&#39; and a lot more cringeworthy moments than I&#39;m sure a lot of people are willing to forgive Kendrick for. This also has the same problem as any genre bending album: if you don&#39;t like the genres being bent you won&#39;t like the album. Concepts and message alone aren&#39;t gonna make people like albums, and people have different opinions. Not everyone that isn&#39;t in love with this album is a 15 year old Tyga-loving &quot;hype fan&quot;.<br><br>With all of this said, I hear this album is a grower. I&#39;ve only listened twice and I like a bunch of tracks, but as a whole it&#39;s not my favorite Kendrick project. I admit I&#39;m not really very invested in funk music, but I definitely love Jazz and Jazz-influenced hip-hop.
anTeny fanTeno
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=687">11:27</a> for people who think 6/10 or compare it to MDBTF
This Album is perfectly put together get over it and stfu
damn, this review is as long as an episode of seinfeld, good job famtano
Twin shadow eclipse
I liked it, still prefer section 80...tpab was a little long tho.¬†
Jesus fuck these comments are cringy.
Antny throwing out dem tenz <br>He be sittin on a Benz<br>Love the cal chucesta he is the best friend<br>
!!!!!!!!!
Yeh! Yeh! Yeh!
Great review!! U get it, I knew u would, Ur smart! Smart people kno this is a classic. 10!!!
Great review 
I&#39;d give a 8/10 or an 9/10 after 1 listen I definitely need to digest it more but I prefer GKMC over TPAB rn 
All these comments saying Fantano doesn&#39;t know how to review hip hop. Just wait til all the other reviews come in and they are all 9s and 10s. 
OH MY GOD IT&#39;S THE RARE 10 OUT OF 10 and I completely agree it&#39;s a masterpiece 
Anthony...don&#39;t listen to the haters. I appreciate your reviews and opinions on everything you review, I couldn&#39;t care less what you rate them because I still enjoy what I enjoy whether or not you think it&#39;s good or bad. You&#39;re knowledge of music is beyond these basic ass bitches. Stay gold pony boy. Stay gold.
Honestly for the people not feeling this album should try listening to it in a place they can not be disturbed preferably in a dark room and just absorb the lyrics. This album was a great experience 
A 10? <br>Naaaa,<br>Section 80 &gt; good kid &gt; TPABF. I will even go a step further and say Drakes new album &gt; TPABF. This album although having certain interesting tracks it felt too experimental and lacking flames, it felt like a Kanye&#39;s Yeezus or a Drake&#39;s NWTS. I need that flame from Kendrick and track #2  &quot;For free?&quot; Leave that to a Big Sean or Travis Scott lol. Come on Kendrick. To me this was a 7/10 
It&#39;s 4 AM, I&#39;m goin&#39; to bed.
Good review, Anthony. You pretty much hit on all the major points I wanted to, and we agree on the significance of the record and the final score -- (though I tend to rate on a 5 scale.) Thanks for getting this review out -- I love this album too.
It took a while for¬†good kid, m.A.A.d city to grow on me, but I connected with this new album immediately after my second listen. Although the album spends a great deal of time contemplating social and personal issues connected to race, Kendrick&#39;s idea of working through some of those issues by describing himself overcoming a deep depression is extremely engaging. By going that route, I think this album will resonate with people who may not struggle with racism in their day to day lives, but have struggled with finding self-confidence in spite of having certain attributes they may have and despise having. Also, the overarching positive message coupled with the jazz influences is reminding me of A Tribe Called Quest. However, I think Kendrick has found a way to make that coupling more epic and inspire deeper conversations relating to all these topics.
Im sorry but this album to me was a 6 at best. <br><br>I just feel like kendrick lost his &quot;home-grown&quot; style and got way too preachy and borderline pretentious on this album.
I have to admit, it took me this long to come around to Kendrick Lamar. The first couple times I tried to listen to good kid m.A.A.d city a couple years ago I stopped listening after the first few tracks and said &quot;Meh, don&#39;t really care.&quot; I eventually forced myself to listen to the whole thing a few times and came to the conclusion &quot;This is pretty good, but I&#39;m nowhere near loving it as much as everyone else.&quot; Today I think it&#39;s a pretty great album. This, on he other hand, was love at first listen. I was hugely impressed by the incredibly lavish production and Kendrick&#39;s message. It was a compelling listen, and as weird as this is, I think I applauded as soon as it was over. The only fly in the ointment for me is Kendrick&#39;s voice which still kinda irritates me (except on &quot;The Backer the Berry&quot; where he sounds like a total hardcore rap badass.) As of right now I&#39;m giving this album a decent 9, but with time and more listens this might work its way up to a 10. Bravo!
Kendrick should&#39;ve called it white guilt
Are Loopy Fiasco and Kanye stans upset?
Thanks Bananthony Smoothtowno!¬†
To those of you saying &quot;OMG ANTHONY  THIS A 10 AND MBDTF A 6 AND T&amp;Y A 7&quot;. You have to realize that Anthony is one of those music reviewers with a set criteria that he judges on rather than judging it based on how it made him feel. Did MBDTF have a lot of flaws? Yes, it did. But in my eyes, the beauty outshined the flaws, which is who I believed it was a 10.<br>In Anthony&#39;s eyes, the fact that it had flaws was a heavy influence on his rating. That&#39;s just the way that Anthony rates albums. <br>The people at Pitchfork however, don&#39;t really review any music like that. They have a very different way of rating. That is why a list of top albums by Anthony will be totally different than a list by Pitchfork.
Boo Boo!!!! The first time I heard it I thought :&quot;Shit, this album&#39;s a 10/10&quot;.
It seems i see more people that dislike the album than like<br><br>Glad to see this rating and knows that someone else can appreciate this<br>
i can&#39;t believe anthony hasn&#39;t reviewed the new kidz bop album yet
I honestly didn&#39;t like it. Maybe a 5
this album almost perfectly captures the current social revolution that&#39;s happening all over the world, while at the same time being personal and reflective of himself and his place in society. The reason why he says it&#39;s so good is because no one at this point in time is doing the same on such a huge scale. I recon 10 years from now, this album will serve as a reminder of the struggles of all oppressed cultures across the world. I think it&#39;s great, an album full of love
He said exactly everything I wanted him to say about this. It&#39;s a 10 because it&#39;s an achievement. 
How could this be anywhere near a ten when there&#39;s tracks like Hood Politics, For free?, and Alright. 
Holy shit Anthony 
Before I even watch this video, I know he can&#39;t do the album justice because there&#39;s no way he&#39;s fully grasped everything that the album has to offer in a matter of 24 hours. Even if he gives it a 10/10, this video is more of a &quot;first impressions&quot; video than a review. At least for me personally, it takes me a couple of days before I can really gauge whether I like an album or not. I guess he had to feed the hype with this early review.¬†
I made my own critic about the album:<br><br>The most anticipated album of 2015 is a challenge for the listener. At the end of the album there is a risk: the listener, expecting bangers, hyped about hearing something in the way of that classic called Good Kid m.A.A.d City, can find the album boring, monotonous. The listener, if is a stan for good music more than just a rap fan, will appreciate what will sure be the best rap project of 2015. Why? Perfectly produced, with feats of talented jazz, soul, funk and hip-hop artists that do their best in every song (as it did Quentin Tarantino with Travolta in Pulp Fiction, Kendrick manages here to resurrect artists far from what one day were, like Snoop Dogg). There is so much soul on this. The story-telling hability of Kendrick throughout the album remain intact and the lyrics are deeper than ever. He has given something fresh and unexpected. Is there something wrong or deceiving? Well, the only argument somebody could use against TPAB is the fact it wasn&#39;t what he/she was looking for. This is not a catchy album but a classy album for open-minded listeners. And if none of all these things convince you, just think about this: which other modern rapper could have made this album? The crazy flow in &quot;For Free?&quot;, the last two verses in &quot;The Blacker The Berry&quot;, the N-E-G-U-S monologue in &quot;i&quot;... hearing Pac&#39;s voice at the end of the last song gave me goosebumps.<br><br>9/10
Engaging review and a wholly excellent album.
I&#39;m personally not a big fan of Kendrick Lamar... I thought his style of rapping was heavily influenced by eminem and I just don&#39;t like the heavily themed dramatic bars... Plus I didn&#39;t see anything special that separated him from any other conscious rapper but I was very surprised when I listened this new LP. I think he made some bold and daring moves with the instrumentals and even the topics he brought up. I think music like this is what it means to be an artist... Taking risks and being innovative. I think everyone should listen to this album with an open mind. 
The only other hip hop artist/ group I can think of that both maintain critical acclaim and mainstream success is Outkast. I might have missed some others.  But I right now I can&#39;t think of any other hip hop artists that have become really successful mainstream appeal  whilst gaining and maintaining the respect of the hip hop world the way Outkast has done and what Kendrick Lamar is doing.   Kanye has lost respect but has a solid grasp on the mainstream   Jay Z gained mainstream success but his latest album was a disappointment  
Greatest album of this generation 
YESSSSSS hahaha I totally agree with Anthony on this one
GUILTY OF BEING WHITE
mind = blown. cal represents the comment section.
Eh, I&#39;d give it at least an 8/10
downloading this as I&#39;m typing this comment :D good review once again by the way! ^_^
plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz if you love dope music check me out nd ill sub you. i appreciate and thank you
What the fuck is your problem with &quot;You ain&#39;t gotta lie&quot;? That&#39;s one of my favorite songs off the album. Sorry I&#39;m trying my hand at this trolling thing. Great review, wouldn&#39;t bother responding to this cesspit in the comments. Except me. You can respond to me :)
He gave a 22 minute explanation on the album and people still don&#39;t &quot;understand how it&#39;s a 10&quot;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1200">20:00</a> good that&#39;s fine with me. gucci mane is ova there
Forget what&#39;s better between GKMC or TPAB, cause I can&#39;t choose just yet. Not only has the album not been out long enough but they&#39;re on 2 completely different platforms. No artist, I repeat NO artist has put out an album similar to the same theme as this, yes artist like J Cole makes conscious tracks like this BUT Kendrick did an ENTIRE album of conscious tracks, instead of &quot;Rollin in the 6 with my word&quot; or bs like &quot;I&#39;m in love with the coco&quot;. Listen to it at least 5 times all the way through. This man is a living legend and it sucks that its going to take Kendrick physically dying to understand the art of his music, sorta like how waaaay more people appreciated PAC and Biggie after their death
You should review Chon - Grow next, dood
TENOUTTATEN!<br>I love Kendrick&#39;s progression from album to album. The instrumentation is authentic and progressive rather than cold and electronic. It&#39;s like a natural evolution which I respect. Kendrick&#39;s rise from Compton to where he&#39;s now is admirable.¬†
Yes/Yes
Good album, but it is ruined by that horrible and frankly quite racist album cover.
.
I definitely wouldn&#39;t give this a 10. It&#39;s a great album but the undercurrent of anger relating to racist stereotypes and black on black murder made it hard to form a connection with his emotions, as I don&#39;t have any association with these things. In GKMC, most of the story was based around Kendrick growing up, being a stupid kid making stupid mistakes, peer pressure, falling in love with the wrong girl etc., so I felt a kind of familiarity with it, even if it was based in Compton. I&#39;d give it a 7/10 to be honest, despite me being a massive Kendrick fan. It was a bit disappointing :&#39;(
And that is for any hip hop artist who takes the time to create not just Kendrick Lamar
A 10? Never thought I&#39;d see the day, nice review. Please review Wale&#39;s Album About Nothing when it comes out :)
This album is nothing even close to what I was expecting, but I love it. I wasn&#39;t feeling some of these songs on my first listen (Complexion, Momma, These Walls, and Hood Politics were kinda whack at first) but then after taking the time to listen over and over again, I&#39;ve fallen in love with just about every track on the album. TPAB is nothing like GKMC, which is one of my favorite albums of all time, yet it manages to blow me away even more. The jazzy, psychedelic production, the old samples, the supporting vocals, everything. They all combine to make a really unique sound. Thematically, I&#39;m nowhere even close to fully comprehending this album. It&#39;s insanely deep, and it&#39;s gonna take me at least a few weeks of constant listening to dissect what Kendrick is getting at here.<br>I&#39;d say my top 5 songs on the album are:<br>1. The Blacker the Berry<br>2. King Kunta<br>3. You Ain&#39;t Gotta Lie (I can literally feel his emotion cracking through his voice)<br>4. Complexion<br>5. Wesley&#39;s Theory<br>Honorable Mentions: i, u, These Walls, Mortal Man<br>If I absolutely had to pick my least favorite, I guess I&#39;d go with Alright. The hook is a bit annoying in my opinion, although it&#39;s still a great song.
This album is undoubtedly a 10. From the unconventional song structures to the great beats. This is what wishes to be.
This is not directed to trolls bcuz you guys serve no purpose, at all.<br>A lot of u hip hop fans crack me up. First u guys holler and boohoo bcuz no one is making real &quot;hip hop&quot; music anymore but when an artist releases an¬†album like this, u put it down?<br>It may not be your style but u call it trash? trash compared to what? And if u can give a logical explanation for calling it¬†trash then by all means explain. Say what the fuck you want to about me cuz it aint about me. But give props where they are due.
to all the people including needledrop who gave this album 10/10, i&#39;d like to pose a question. how does an album without a single memorable melody line, get a 10? i&#39;m a person who listens to MUSIC, not just the lyrics. granted, kendrick is lyrically talented, but is that all it takes to make a 10/10 album?<br><br>i listened to the whole album twice and can&#39;t remember a single melody throughout the whole album. i think music should come first, lyrics second, as kurt cobain said, not that i&#39;m a huge nirvana fan, but that statement always struck with me. the beats are boring, there is no melody, yeah the rap is great but where is the music? i guess i&#39;m not a hip hop fan, because the only redeeming track throughout the entire album for me was¬† &#39;i&#39;, and all the hip hop fans say that was the weakest track, when it originally came out, people said it was too pop.<br><br>hip hop fans would give this 10/10 i guess, but for me, a MUSIC FAN, i give this 5/10. because it&#39;s only half full, lyrics are there, but melodies aren&#39;t. how can music be without melody, that&#39;s just poetry.<br><br>i doubt this will see any mainstream success, or any overseas international success. this will only reach hip hop fans, but anyone outside of hip hop will find this album boring because it has no melodies, which is a shame, because in GKMC, he had some melodies.
Review new death grips song
review any A TRIBE CALLED QUEST album
this is the best rap record i have ever heard :D its the perfect kind of rap music i love :D
His next album will get an 11.¬†
Thank you Anthony, this is the review I was waiting for! You broke it down perfectly, I await the day you feature Kendrick on this channel.¬†
If kendrick never made another record or even song ever again he would go down as one of the greatest of all time. Speaks for itself
IM A SUBURBAN 17 YEAR OLD WHITE KID WHO KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT SLAVERY OR CIVIL RIGHTS BUT THIS ALBUM IS MAKING ME FEEL GUILTY CAUSE ITS ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE STUFF I DONT REALLY UNDERSTAND.
I hope Macklemore doesn&#39;t make a album this year, or Kendrick is gonna get robbed for another well deserved Grammy
man reading these comments people need to look up the definitions of &quot;opinion&quot;,and &quot;subjective&quot;
Could it be? I think Topthony Dawgtano responded to arguably the best rap album of the decade with arguably the best rap review of the last decade, so kudos
Nah, 6.5/10
A 10/10 ALREADY?
I&#39;m satisfied with this score.¬†
Called the 10/10
STOP THROWING PAPER LIKE YOU SUM KINDA BALLER SHOT CALLER SON
I liked the album but there were too many weird sound effects added in like the Spanish maid in U or the second half of I. Didn&#39;t think they added anything to the album at all. 
Haven&#39;t listened to this one yet, but on GOOD Kid Mad City I felt he was trying too hard to infuse as much West Coast homage into the album. And He&#39;s so much more complex than that dichotomy he presented. It&#39;s like he made a West Coast album rather than HIS album. I thought Section 80 was much more his. With HIS grieving and his quiet meditation and all that stuff that makes him so compelling and it might not have had enough time to shine in GOOD Kid Mad Ciy
Someone GIF that finger point <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=732">12:12</a>
This is kendricks most complete album it was like watchin a great movie instead of just listening to some good songs.! Instant classic right here
ITSNOT A 10 ITS A STORNG 9
LMFAO A 10/10 WHAT THE FUCK
I don&#39;t think the beauty of the album is the songs. It&#39;s how the songs tie together like he said. I believe that&#39;s why he gave it a 10/10
Anthony we know your not racist, You didn&#39;t have to give this album a 10/10 this album really Isn&#39;t that good. It&#39;s 2015 he didn&#39;t have to go do a Jazz, Soul, and Funk based album I understand 1 to 3 songs but come on the whole album It&#39;s 2015 if he really wanted to speak to people he&#39;d do it with the sound of 2015 and i don&#39;t mean trap beats or space rap or even G.K.M.C. type beats but anything current, I get what he was trying to do I&#39;m a huge Kendrick fan but this album was hard on the ears. I like the idea ff the album but It was mediocre and has a poor execution. He couldn&#39;t flow on many beats, There was barely any melody, the lyrics were okay, The features were meh, Only worthwhile feature was Rapsody. This album was a 6 or Light 7 out of 10. I&#39;m disappointed in this review, You let guilt get in the way hopefully DEHH will have a real review.<br><br>Perfect executions of political hip hop albums in my opinion are<br>N.W.A. 1988 Straight Out Of Compton, Ice Cube 1990 Amerikkas Most Wanted, 2Pac 2Pacalypse, Dilated People 2004 Neighborhood Watch, The Roots 1999 Things Fall Apart, Scarface 2002 The Fix, Lauryn Hill 1998 The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill, Nas 1994 Illmatic,1996 It Was Written, 2001 Stillmatic 2002 God&#39;s Son, Mos Def And Talib Kweli 1998 Blackstar, Kanye West 2004 College Dropout, 2005 Late Registration, Common 2005 Be, 2007 Finding Forever, 2014 Nobody&#39;s Smilling, Lupe Fiasco 2006 Food &amp; Liquor, 2007 The Cool, 2015 Tetsuo &amp; Youth, Killer Mike 2012 R.A.P. Music, Kendrick Lamar 2011 Section 80, Ab-Soul 2012 Control System And many more.<br><br>The reason I call them perfect is because not only did they speak to the people in that period of time they had as much mainstream value as they did underground it didn&#39;t take multiple listens to like those albums once you heard it the first time it hit your right away and you got it. Listening to any of those albums and it takes you right there right in the middle of the action in those years. With T.P.A.B. I don&#39;t feel like 2015 struggle or politics i just don&#39;t Kendrick is a great MC but this tape isn&#39;t 10/10 ¬†A light 7 yes.Ôªø<br><br>I&#39;ve lived in some of the worst places in the U.S. not 10 mins ago somebody was just shot down my block, I&#39;ve dealt with bad cops, bad &quot;BLACK&quot; cops I&#39;ve been threatened made to feel inferior in many instances and when I listen to TPAB i feel as if Kendrick is speaking for another time in history, Even J cole FHD made me feel as if he was speaking for me and my struggles &quot;TODAY&quot; I understand how blatant and disrespectful racism has gotten and I understand it calls for RADICAL music but this project is not the soundtrack to racism, prejudice, disrespect to 2015 I feel TETSUO &amp; YOUTH is more fitting.Ôªø
Hey, Anthony.<br>In the show finale of Parks and Recreation, Tom was having a flash forward to the year 2023 where Kendrick Lamar was looked up to as a Michael Jackson.<br>Do you believe that this is possible?<br><br>Personally, I do. In order for this to happen, one would have to be very popular with the white crowd, and I can see that happening to Kendrick especially with people like Taylor Swift loving him.<br>I go to a mostly black high school, and almost every black person who I talk to about Kendrick, they say that they don&#39;t really care for him or they say they call him racist against black people. Its sad because Kendrick is using is platform in a good way to speak on racial matters.
It all made sense when he said &quot;I hope this record will bring the end of the bling era&quot;, Anthony Fantano gave TPaB a 10 because he hates hip-hop (maybe even black people), he hates to see young black men shining, looking good, flossing. He doesn&#39;t want us to be proud, he hates that brothers like Kanye West are teaching black people that it&#39;s ok shine and enjoy our wealth, I bet he wants us to go back to slavery times, I feel sorry for his black girlfriend, who he probably inflicts ghetto gaggers type fantasies on. Can&#39;t a young nigga get money any more?
You the man theneedledrop¬†
I can see how this is a great album, but it&#39;s just not for me. Waiting on Earl&#39;s to drop :-)
Man I hope I will come to like it as much as you, but in the moment some of these tracks are just not listenable like &quot;u&quot;. I mean the lyrics are great but he is performing this characters so much that it is not enjoyable anymore. And not in a way that some sad songs are because they&#39;re so emotional that you don&#39;t want to listen to them because they make you sad (even though the songs itself are great e.g. Mockingbird, When I&#39;m gone, Stan). But in &quot;u&quot; it seems more like an interlude or skit because he isn&#39;t really rapping. And since he is muche faster than the beat it seems even more that he&#39;s just talking very fast.<br>Some instrumentals just could&#39;ve been better or were just plain underwhelming(e.g. Alright,u&amp;Hood Politics). There were some gems though(e.g. Wesley&#39;s Theory,I, institutionalized). But I feel that some songs, that I actually like, just loose in intensity compared to GKMC. I mean Blacker The Berry is great but compared to m.A.A.d. city it just doesn&#39;t hit you as hard (don&#39;t get me wrong I&#39;m not trying to compare the albums, I just want to get my point across, and I feel this comparison is legit).<br>There were just moments that anoyed me seriously like the &quot;booo booo&quot; in Hood Politics that ruin the otherwise awesome song for me(Awesome Killer Mike shot out). I mean that chorus is a 1000 times worse than the one from &quot;Real&quot;.<br><br>In the end I still like the album but it made me cringe at some points. There were some aspects where just everything is perfect like Wesley&#39;s Theory (Fantastic intro, lyrics, delivery, guest apperances and instrumental), Mortal Man (Great Outro with the interview) and the poem being told bit by bit throughout the album. <br><br>I hope it grows more on me like it did on you, but for me it was like a 8/10.<br><br>Great review, Anthony!!
10/10 legends:<br>1-The Money Store<br>2- To Pimp a Butterfly<br>3- gangnam style (thanx cal)
true music lovers will love this album.. In my opinion Kendrick has the potential to be on that top 5 all time list.....his discography is telling it all!!!!!
daaaaaammmnnnnn, guess I&#39;ll have to get into Kendrick!
Is this his first 10/10 ever?
i isn&#39;t actually live fantano.. jesus.. It&#39;s meant to sound live! Ugh.. it isn&#39;t actually.
For anyone complaining about the review let me remind you: Anthony Fantano literally gave Yeezus a bad review because he claimed that it was copying Death Grips.<br><br>Anthony Fantano is a fucking moron when it comes to rap reviews, don&#39;t take them seriously.<br><br>Doe this is a really sick album. Funky and fresh as fuck.
Calling it now, this album although not as mainstream as Gkmc, this album will go down in history. The thing is GKMC is a very well made album that can be accessible. Tpab on the other hand, musically, lyrically is well balanced. Seriously it&#39;s a masterpiece. First things I come from the hood. I have tried to avoid rap and hip hop for a long time. I do have guilty pleasure listening to trash music. Like Ymcmb, rr, OTG, and etc. The only person I could barely listen to was eminem and even then I think he gets overrated at times. This album really made me feel it. In fact I went back gave GKMC another listen and I appreciate now more than before. Before I disliked GKMC because everyone around treated it like a party drinking album, but they ignores the message and the way kendrick analyzed things. This album on the hand doesn&#39;t beat around the bush and just straight gives it to you. This album might be hard to grasp for some or too boring. If you can grasp it and understand, it&#39;s really worth it&#39;s 9-10 rating, I am a fan of kdot now.
He gets it
You&#39;re pinker than ever when you talk about race. Great review by the way.
once you start doing your own reviews fantanos ratings become a lot easier to understand
Im one of those people that went &quot;yuck&quot; on the instrumentals. As for the lyrics hes still dope.
YES. 10/10. Most important album of this decade.
No 22 minutes of saying Yes? Lol<br>Just kidding. Great review. I love this album. 
This is a 8/10 first two songs on this album sucks to me but the rest is good.
yay!
Check out my &quot;u&quot; Review/reaction :D
Agreed. This album will tug heartstrings that have lay dormant and collected dust for years. BUT YOU HAVE TO LET IT. It takes a certain degree of letting go of preconceived notions and ego constructs in order to really enjoy an album like this.
It&#39;s funny how people mention that Anthony doesn&#39;t know hip-hop but still insist on him making hip-hop reviews. Also this is album is a 6-7 at best an 8.
Yeah... a cool message doesn&#39;t make an album, Kendrick has shitty flow and cadence in this album, the hooks and the instrumentals weren&#39;t great either... I&#39;m trying to listen to an album not a fucking story
also id like to point out rhapsodys verse was dope af im gonna check out her music just because of it
8-8.5/10 for me
A FUCKING MASTERPIECE.
I agree with theneddledrop I give good kid MADD city a 9/10 because of that drake feature which caused me not to but the album 
Please check out earl&#39;s new track grief!  Just dropped yesterday :)  also album unexpectedly dropping March 23 i believe.  I&#39;m sure you know most of this stuff but just letting you know if you didn&#39;t thanks Anthony theneedledrop 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1144">19:04</a> - Good review fantano.
Thats right, when you gave &quot;mad city&quot; 9/10 i thought what if not this should get a 10? Now you are right, this one is slightly better (in my opinion). Strong 10<br>
To all the people saying this album should not be a 10/10 just don&#39;t know music and don&#39;t understand the album. This is arguably the best hip hop album in a decade. If your a hip hop fan and don&#39;t like this album.... Then ur not really a hip hop fan lol. This is art. Plain and simple. 
Best album review ever 
wow so many people complaining ...¬†well it&#39;s my favourite kendrick album ... maybe just because i&#39;m a jazzhead
and the people claiming white guilt some of the dumbest motherfuckers around
YES. YES. GOOD.
Well, I&#39;m buying it
It&#39;s 4 am, I&#39;m going to bed
&quot;This many people died, feeeel something&quot; - Immortal Technique
this album made me so fucking happy.
My first thought when listening to this was &quot;anthony fantano is gonna adore this shit&quot;
Only a 10? KuKluxthony Klantano.
Do people really not see the blatant irony to hating Fantano? You say he doesn&#39;t know anything about hip hop, but then you get mad at his opinion, which would imply that his opinion has some sort of validity. If you think he doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s talking about, then why are you watching a video from him?
I really liked this album, but if this is a 10 j coles forest hills album should be at least a 9
I wasn&#39;t that interested in Kendrick, but seeing Anthony so fired up made me check him out lol
Goodnight, sweet prince.
I 100% agree with you. Even better than Good Kid MAAD city which was already perfect. Amazing album. 
Tarp influence
So many great albums recently: 2014 Forest Hills Drive, B4DA$$, PRhyme and To Pimp A Butterfly which has got to be best album I&#39;ve heard in a decade!! Big up to King Kendrick!! 
He fucking deserved it. 
The albums overall poem structure kind of reminds me of the style of memento,¬†the movie¬†
THE G.O.A.T!! I knew it was a 10 before I clicked it!
Getting tired of hearing &quot;its his opinion man&quot; whenever someone disagrees with Fantano. Doesn&#39;t that just go without saying when you&#39;re discussing music?¬†
High Praisetano am I right!
Nazareth, I&#39;m fucked up<br>Homie you fucked up<br>But if God got us we then gon&#39; be alright<br><br>10/10 best album not only hip hop but best music album this year 
hey theneedledrop¬† do you think YC GNK¬† album¬† influenced this record specifically NEGUS
fuck this shit
HELL YEAH!!!!!!! By the way is this the first 10?
Bread/10! Review it again!
Great review . You have such a good ear for music
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I would like to hear what R.A. the Rugged Man thinks of this album lol. In an interview he pretty much said that Kendrick isn&#39;t close to being the best as a lyricist. Probably because he had only heard good kid, maad city
Yeah, I&#39;m not really feeling this album at all. I guess it&#39;s good in some respects but it&#39;s just not for me.
Wo! Preach!
I have to agree. I can&#39;t find flaws in album. It&#39;s just to dam good
Beautiful review, Anthony.
Anthony was pretty much put in a lose-lose situation. If he didn&#39;t like it, Kendrick&#39;s fans would&#39;ve attacked him and said he didn&#39;t know hip-hop. But since he liked it, people are saying he&#39;s biased and his review isn&#39;t genuine. What do you guys want?!!!
True true true. I agree with you thoroughly man. But you have to factor in how enjoyable this album is to listen to. And unfortunately, it just isn&#39;t. 7/10 
I also agree with everyone else. MBTDF was better than this. This was great but that&#39;s one of the best albums ever.
i think you&#39;re annoying usually but hats off for this review
MBDTF WAS NOT THAT GOOD! All of kendricks albums were better lyrically (I think that&#39;s safe to say), and instrumentally TPAB is top 5 all time, number 1 in last half decade. MBDTF was so over-hyped when it came out. It was a new sound and it was very good, but not as good as his last 3 albums! I&#39;ll give TPAB a 9.5 (tho idk if there&#39;s anything slightly wrong, just WUT I felt) and MBDTF  a 7.5. 
The &quot;y&#39;all know this is just my opinion right&quot; disclaimer has been there for how long now?
God, if you exist, I thank you for letting me live long enough to listen to 3 of Kendrick Lamar albums. Let me witness another golden age of hip-hop and I shall sacrifice my first born.<br>-A late 90s kid.
TEN!!!!!!!
For the first time in history, Anthony rated an album ABOVE what it should have gotten. I&#39;d say it&#39;s an 8...
This album is generally a ten.  People who don&#39;t like it are the ones saying things like &quot;the beats suck&quot; when that&#39;s the best part of the album.  The album is sonically on another level, lyrically, cohesively, intro personally.  Kendrick Lamar did a great job at bring you into his mind state and understanding what he went through and how he felt.  Not to mention these funk samples are literally perfect (There was famous jazz artist tweeting how musically creative jt was).  Blah blah blah this album is a 10 on all levels deserves nothing less.  You don&#39;t like it you proboly wouldn&#39;t like 90&#39;s rap at all which Is hip hop peak.  Kendrick establishing himself as more then an Mc.  Top 5 all time 
Loved the review, but I feel like you missed major thematic checkpoints on the album.<br><br>On Wesley&#39;s Theory, the first verse represents Kendrick as a young rapper. The whole album isn&#39;t a storytelling album like GKMC, but it still shows Kendrick&#39;s growth over time. This track shows how his only intention was to make money, and live luxuriously because at this point in the story he is a caterpillar. He is just looking for ways to survive and pimp/exploit the ways of the butterfly (the hip hop industry) for monetary gain. This mindset follows Kendrick all the way up to U. Up until then he had been living it up like in These Walls. Then in U he finally feels the guilt. This functions more as a catalyst in his metamorphosis from the caterpillar to the butterfly. From then on, he goes back home looking for answers until his grandma tells him to be the change he wants to see in the world. From here you see a more passionate Kendrick, and in Mortal Man, the whole theme comes together as he speaks to 2Pac.<br><br>One thing he spoke with Pac about was maintaining sanity through fame. This is Kendrick&#39;s bane. In past projects he has stating that he is a Gemini, and this has given him a 2-faced personality. On this he battles with Lucy (Lucifer) in order to stay sane, and at the same time he&#39;s struggling to decide whether he is a caterpillar or a butterfly. This juxtaposition is also evident in U vs. I. Self-loathe vs. Self-love. So when you say that Kendrick isn&#39;t contradicting himself, you&#39;re wrong, he is, it&#39;s a part of his battle for sanity as he continues to do numerous 180s.<br><br>TL;DR: DON&#39;T BE LAZY, READ IT!
This album really reminds me of outkasts work
Cal nailed it at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1319">21:59</a>
the only reason he gave this a 10/10 is because that&#39;s the only way his review will get featured on the wikipedia article. Maybe one day your reviews will be relevant to Metacritic, and you&#39;ll be able to vote for Pazz &amp; Jop polls :^)
A 10 really? Wow. This guy just loves Kendrick period he is a fan so I detect some bias in this review it was a great album but not a 10 especially that fake crying drunk song.
If you&#39;re not crazy about this album, it is most likely based around the sound, and it&#39;s really sad your musical ears are limited. With Kendrick I have learned that you HAVE to expected the unexpected or you will be highly disappointed. Regardless of the sound the lyrics, the flow, the subject matter are a 10. Period. Kendrick really tackles the black struggle in this white world as well as the black struggle within the black people BEAUTIFULLY. U is one of the darkest, most honest, self-criticizing songs I have ever heard. It&#39;s Kendricks honesty and understanding of the issues in this album that makes it phenomenal IN ADDITION to a sound that has been forgotten that was once the core of the black people. This album is purely culture. 10/10 is well deserved 
I&#39;m crying. Blatant AOTY. Love you, Antwan Fannypack. 
Didn&#39;t lupe do the same thing 
Me Against the World for Classics Week?
I got up and ran around when I seen that 10/10. Damnnn, I never thought I would see the day.
YEEEEESSSSSS!!!!!<br>Thankful for¬†<br>1. This record!¬†<br>2. Your work. Keep it up.
Please review Harms Way &quot;Rust&quot; please 
subliminal dr. dre in the background...but it&#39;s blurry. NOT GOOD ENOUGH TONY!
This is seriously one of the best albums I&#39;ve heard in years. I feel as though I&#39;m better off for having heard it. 10/10 get it immediately.¬†
Yall seriously need to chill out. It&#39;s his opinion. Deal with it. 
TEN<br>T<br>E<br>N<br>TEEEEEEEEEN
Oh shit!<br><br>I don&#39;t really think it&#39;s a 10 but light to decent 9 for sure, it gets better with every listen. Not sure I&#39;m willing to say it&#39;s better than GKMC.
When Anthony gave this a 10 I was dancing around my room like Cal was. This album is above and beyond anything I&#39;ve heard in hip hop recently
anthony you realize you have started a world war in the comment section? lol¬†
for me its 8/10... i think he said 10/10 just to keep his fans after he gave drake an 8 and people were pissed at the that
People that don&#39;t like this album are swagfag hype beasts forreal
I love the album, great review!
Kendrick did it. Fantano did it. The best review of quite possibly the best album I have ever heard. Good job.
YESSSSSSSSSS you got it right fatano. This album is monumental for hip hop and society as a whole.
This album is fire! One of the best ever, gets better after each listen. People just hating on it cos they cant twerk to it. 
FUCKING HOLY SHIT FUCKING FUCK!!!!!<br>&lt;3 Kenthony Lamando
Excellent review!
Lupe Album should&#39;ve been Atleast a 8/10 üòî
good job
Smashthony Dashtano, this is by far the most entertaining review of 2015, your going to have a hard time topping this one!
Thank you so much, Anthony.<br>Thank you for these videos.
&gt;best rap album of the decade<br><br>what is the money store
Certi.
TRAN-
Damn! 10/10 i gotta give this a listen
FUCK I LOVE HIM 
People who hate this album mad they can&#39;t turn up to it
Thank you I thought you was gonna do another NO thing theneedledrop 
&quot;yeah, yeah it&#39;s genius&quot;<br>Yeah, at the onset i felt underwhelmed. I hadn&#39;t put in the headphones yet. But after I did, the fluidity and cohesive nature of this album make it a very solid piece of work. Usually you get the bravado or the vulnerability, but not often both. Last time I really had to marinate on a piece of work like this was the love below. I had said something was missing that i could put my finger on, but i suppose i was just a victim of the 2 year hype. Kendrick&#39;s not gonna give us club bangers.<br>a real high point - U<br>Slapper -¬† Alright<br>Blew my mind - Mortal Man
Worked hard on this review I can tell 
TPAB probably wont be getting the grammy it deserves because of its subject matter but anyways still fuck the grammys
Shit&#39;s been out 2 days and it&#39;s already a 10/10 masterpiece? You haven&#39;t even processed the damn songs, it&#39;s pure infatuation.
It&#39;s funny the people that &quot;don&#39;t really like&quot; this album are people that listened to it ONCE, you need to realize your 1 listen reviews are what is fucking up hip-hop.
can you do earl - grief track review
didn&#39;t fantano say in the track review for &quot;i&quot; that he wasn&#39;t really feeling that song? So why is that song on his favorite songs list in the description, and why is this album a 10/10?
you must love the t shirt
Shut up everyone! It&#39;s a 10 and I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m so happy because of that.
praise shrek
As a 16 year old white male who grew up all over the world, including spending my teen years thus far in Uganda I can associate with many of the messages on this album. I started listening to hip hop and Kendrick in particular after a friend of mine in Kampala recommended him to me. Having experienced many of the things that Kendrick speaks about across this album, I am extremely excited to see what messages he portrays through his music in the future. Happy listening all.
I wish you&#39;d give Lupe Fiasco&#39;s projects the same amount of energy and attention while listening and processing them.
I wonder if kendrick will watch this video.
THE POWERS THAT B TRACK REVIEW PLEASE FANTANO
<b>gives a 10/10 rating</b><br><b>people complain</b><br><br><b>doesnt give some other LP a 10/10 rating</b><br><b>people complain</b>
The album might be great - but it&#39;s just not my jam. The beats are totally not my thing. It might be an amazing album objectively, though.<br><br>The issues he&#39;s trying to confront are way overdue. The race problem the US has, should be tackled and not by shoving political correctness down people&#39;s throats but by discussing it.
Its funny how the only beat anyone could rap over on the album is Pharrell&#39;s &quot;Alright&quot;
Yo, Anthony, you put a 1 next to the zero by accident...
dont even compare the lyrics on TPAB to MBDTF
YES I KNEW IT THIS ALBUM IS TOTALLY A 10
If you don&#39;t like this album, then you probably just got into hip-hop 
<b>creases review notes</b> and then I looked at the length of the video. classic.
It feels great to hear my own thoughts echoed. I knew from the moment the album finished that it was a game changer-- a landmark in hip hop&#39;s musical journey.
Please review Kendricks new album!!
This dick ain&#39;t free!!!!!
Expecting a Mr Wonderful review Fantano
Kendrick hype, its too much
fuck yah
FINALLLYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
&quot;It&#39;s 4am, I&#39;m going to bed&quot; - That was me, the moment before the clean version of To Pimp A Butterfly suddenly was on iTunes and when the whole surprise drop thing was going on. I later found myself listening to this album smiling in my bed while my family just woke up to get to work, thinking,&quot;this is perfect.&quot;
ANTHONY LOVES HIPHOP
10!
Who is this Kendick Lemon and why does he get the 10?
This album so complex, just packed with creativity, time, and effort. Deserves a 10 as far as I&#39;m concerned
Real good album. Great album actually. At first, after the first listened through, I didn&#39;t really like the album. Didn&#39;t vibe well with me. Didn&#39;t click with me. (and I&#39;m saying that even with the fact that I&#39;m a huge kendrick lamar supporter). The album didn&#39;t sit well with me. But of course, I have to give the album a few more listen throughs. (by the way if you only listened to the album once, don&#39;t bother commenting on it. It takes more than one listed to actually fully comprehend the album). Anyways, after I listened to it for the 4th, 5th time, then it all came together for me. The lyrics, the beats, rhythms. The rap/funk/jazz and lyrics all flow so well together. So much emotion on this album. He speaks on real relevant shit. Shit this is worth listening to. Actual life shit. Unlike the shit that other rappers spit. I&#39;ve known for years that there is no rapper out there that can much up with kendrick lyrically. Not a single one. And if you disagree with that, you&#39;re a real close minded person. Only other rapper that can compare to kendrick lyrically but is still far behind is J Cole. Other than that, nope. Not a single person. For the people who talk shit about this album and say it sucks and blah blah blah, I don&#39;t blame them. I blame the media, the radio. The radio feeds all the trash horrible music to the public and that&#39;s what the people become a custom to. That&#39;s what they learn to like. That&#39;s why when an album like this comes along, they all consider it ass, because they&#39;re used to shit like I&#39;m in love with the coco or shit like caught a body bout a week ago. (I know the actual names of the songs. I&#39;m just using those parts of the song to show how meaningless and stupid the lyrics are) and that&#39;s what the radio plays. The radio plays that because they know that their listeners are close midned, ignorant people who won&#39;t be able to comprehend actual lyrical goodness. Again that&#39;s why I don&#39;t blame the people who don&#39;t like the album. Good review by the way. 
Anyone that went into this album expecting another GKMC, was probably disappointed, I get that. This album was a slap of old school to the face. A damn good slap.
Too many yams; yams/10
Not even top 5 albums this year so far
I would&#39;ve been happy if he spent the entire review saying YES, YES, YES.<br>This is purty cool too though.
People who say he is shit at reviewing hip hop albums...c&#39;mon now. All you guys look at is the grade he gives out of 10. Just because his OPINION doesn&#39;t match yours doesn&#39;t mean he is shit. And FURTHERMORE, atleast Anthony gives very detailed points and reasons for 20 minutes as to why he gave his certain score. None of y&#39;all can back up your own opinions for 2 minutes, so shut the f* up.¬†
Is it me or he actually didn&#39;t say shit about How much a dollar really cost?My favorite song off of this album<br>Anyway 9/10 for me.<br>P.S:This.dick.ain&#39;t.freeeee
Yep.  Good times!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=620">10:20</a> Stewie Griffin
funny how black people hate white people for liking black music...
Everyone complaining about previous review scores should realize he&#39;s probably giving those scores in context to the artist themselves and the type of music they make. Drake&#39;s tape got an 8 because he felt it was more enjoyable than his last project sonically and amongst that sort of lane in hip-hop, he thought it stood out. I highly doubt he thinks that tape is anywhere near comparable to Kendrick&#39;s album.  
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1138">18:58</a> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1145">19:05</a>
He gave this a 10 but Lil B a 0...
How is MBDTF a 6 but TPAB a 10? 
So glad you loved it as well, Anthony!
THIS ALBUM IS A FUCKING MASTERPIECE.  RIGHT ON TIME !!   Love everything about it I was so happy when i heard that So[rt] by Knxwledge come in :&quot;)  10/10 üí£ 
<b>begins slow clap</b> This album is a 10/10 production, lyrics, delivery, the message etc, The man has two classics under him and it&#39;s his first two albums. Right now he&#39;s the best in the game.
I Take back everything Mr.Fantano
DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT THE SAMPLE ON THE SECOND HALF OF &quot;U&quot; IS?
Let&#39;s have a donut. Okay...? Okay. 
I&#39;ll be honest, some shit went over my head. Thanks Fantano. TPAB 3/10 lol.
People saying this album is bad just because they liked good kid maad city, that&#39;s internet logic
You know, it&#39;s kind of interesting if you think of the irony here. Lyrically, it is good but repetitive. The true irony to me here is that he talks with this theme of &quot;Stop acting like a slave.&quot; sort of and it&#39;s funny because he does this the whole way through and almost turns the tables in a way on the &quot;white community&quot; by having every critic or listener eat this up regardless of what they are listening to.
Yes Gawd
Oh my god a 10
whitehony guiltano
I KNEW IT WAS GONNA BE A 10 YES FANTHONY &lt;3
Thought this review would be 22 minutes of Anthony just saying &quot;Yes. Yes, yes yes. Yesyesyesyes, yes, yes. Yes!&quot;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=723">12:03</a> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=730">12:10</a>
My nigga
Fantano Rating:<br><br>Section.80 - 8/10<br>Good Kid, M.A.A.D City - 9/10<br>To Pimp a Butterfly - 10/10<br><br>Why are so many people claiming he&#39;s dick riding?¬†
To bad the cover is racist 
was i the only one wondering who that bitch lucy was
Couldn&#39;t have said it any better! I wasn&#39;t sure what to make of &quot;To Pimp a Butterfly&quot; on first listen, but every listen has made it even better and I&#39;ve been able to grasp more on the concept. It truly is one of the best albums I&#39;ve heard in a while.<br><br>Request(s) for next review(s): AWOLNATION - Run, Lady Lamb the Beekeeper - After¬†
review game strong Anthony :]
ayy but Jenny Death is gonna be better
YAY!!! IT&#39;S A 10!!!
I haven&#39;t felt this way about a purely hip hop album since Stankonia.
10/10 he finally got what he deserved. I love this album fuck all the haters, I thought it was better than good kid mad city but you know what? This is just my opinion you know people on the Internet are not allowed to have those.
fantabulous
lets see what he gives earl album...
I smiled like a bitch when he said 10. I agree 100%.
Agree 100% with the review. One of the greatest albums I&#39;ve heard in a long time.
I just wanted to point out that on these walls not only is he banging some girl whose baby daddy is locked up, he&#39;s banging the girl whose baby daddy killed his friend in the skit after swimming pools that leads into sing about me, hence Kendrick referencing that song at the end of these walls
To Pimp A Butterfly is the greatest Hip Hop album since Good Kid Mad City. T&amp;Y pales in comparison. Thank You Anthony. Ya done good.
I NEED THAT BRAZILIAN WAVY 28 INCH
YES!! YES!!¬† YEAH!!!!!!¬† Ten in my books too!¬† I can‚Äôt remember the last time I was this excited about an album‚Ä¶not wait I can!<br>¬†<br>After taking a few spins of this do yourself a favor and listen to Erykah Badu‚Äôs New Amerykah: 4th World War and SA-RA Creative Partners Nuclear Evolution.¬† Then compare the album credits!¬† Those two albums were two of my favorite from the last decade (also criminally overlooked) and they have a huge influence on this album. ¬†Kendrick has said in interviews that he was a big fan of Badu in past interviews and it shows here.¬† SA-RA is all over this album with Thundercat and Taz Arnold having a bit hand in the production.¬† Check it out‚Ä¶you really won‚Äôt regret it.<br>¬†<br>Love this album!!!
SHIT DON&#39;T CHANGE TIL YOU GET UP AND WASH YO ASS NIGGA
In some ways I looked forward to this review more than the album. That is probably not good though...
Congratulations Anthony. Your second 10.
deserved
this wasn&#39;t better than GKMC. To me at least.
On a side note, I have no idea why people put J. Cole above K-Dot
FINALLY !<br>THUMBS UP IF IT&#39;S BEEN A LONG TIME COMING ! üòÄ
First listened to the album on monday. didnt stop listening for 4 hours straight. fantastic piece of art. well deserved 10
The review was extremely well done. Hands down, excellent.
If you heard drake&#39;s album already, go listen to kendrick&#39;s and go back to drake&#39;s, it&#39;ll sound so different for some reason.
Agreed.
Sleep, sweet child. You deserve it.
Hip-hop is the shittest form of music, theres no talent in it, I just don&#39;t understand what&#39;s good about it. Can someone please explain?
This album is not only for black people, yes that&#39;s the primary focus but it&#39;s for the people. It&#39;s about self-empowerment, love, staying true to yourself etc.¬†It&#39;s a message which resonates with humans, with everybody, so gtfo with your &#39;WHITE GUILT!&#39; and try to expand your mind and really take a plunge into the intricate layers of this album and try to connect with that part of yourself which you might have forgotten about, called your soul.
A 10/10 are you serious?!? This is easily an 11 or 12¬†
BASEDTHONY GODTANO
So he rides kendrick for 22 minutes but couldnt even give an honest review of big sean&#39;s dark sky paridise?  Ok 
We are actually witnessing a legend in his prime. We need to cherish this time. Just like Illmatic the chronic the college dropout this album is hip hop milestone. Maybe the 2 pac conversation on mortal man signifies the passing of the torch to possibly the greatest MC of this Era. Kendrick we thank you and hopefully the message that you are trying to spread in your music does create change in this world. Hey if this album can attract Taylor Swift then I guess nobody is out of reach. Lol 
thank you for making my week, Anthony
Anthony I respect your opinions on Hip Hop. I don&#39;t always see eye to eye with your opinion but I can see the points you make from your point of view. I can&#39;t &quot;not agree&quot; with you on this album. A 10/10 is the right score for this. We are officially listening to a LEGEND, and it is an honor to be able to experience such a great rapper. 
YEA
My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy and To Pimp A Butterfly are going to go down in history just like Ready To Die, Illmatic, and The Chronic. 
Pimpthony buttano
 Make sure u buy this album.support great music 
HE GAVE A TEN STEP DOWN MONEY STORE NEW CHAMPION 
white people shouldn&#39;t review hiphop albums¬†
Over the years I&#39;ve lost my interest in hip hop, it felt diluted. Watered down into money this, gold that. A battle of invisible inflated egos rapping, but not really saying anything. Kendrick almost always seems to pull me back and give me what I crave. Music with purpose, with inflection, that has meaning. More importantly it gives a perspective that I couldn&#39;t imagine on my own. This album guides you on a journey that is vast, and covers deep ideas across a wide variety of musical landscapes.<br><br>This album is best experienced in full. I sat in a small completely pitch black room void of all stimuli and distraction as I do with any good piece of music. The experience lives up to some of the best experiences I&#39;ve ever had with music. 10/10
Just scraped my knee up on the pavement? Boo boo!
Excellent review of an excellent album. Makes me love it even more, hearing you unpack the themes in such an eloquent way. This album&#39;s like a companion piece to D&#39;Angelo&#39;s Black Messiah, only it may have surpassed it. Thanksthony, mantano.
Kendrick Lamar&#39;s dick riders incoming. It&#39;s no way near a 9. And the rating you gave is bullshit. By giving a 10 you mean it&#39;s the best album ever. EVER.
I couldn&#39;t find a single flaw 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1315">21:55</a> Hilarious! I was feeling the same way as Cal
TEN!!!
I&#39;m so glad you gave this a 10/10. I think to successfully enjoy this album you need to sit on it for a while. It wont be pretty on the first hearing because lets face it everyone else who didn&#39;t like the album was expecting a GKMC 2.0 since Kendrick garnered so many fans who are not real hiphop heads but they enjoyed that sort of hard party anthems that GKMC delivered. This album is so much deeper and requires you really listen to it many times before you formulate your opinion because the first opinion for a complex album like this is not gonna be your strongest opinion.¬†
Yes. Just so much yes for this review. This album is so complex and I think you did a great job trying to explain everything going on here.¬†
Damn Anthony, you gave it a 10/10. Wow haha. 
Why does the comment section have to be cancer
WHHAAAAAA IT&#39;S A NEW 10/10 ALBM OH MY GAAAWWWWDD 
Anthony was CLEARLY peer pressured by Cal to give this album a 10.¬†
I knew it
I don&#39;t know why people get guest features on tracks anymore, just get Anthony to imitate them.¬†
This album will separate kendricks actual fans from his hype fans
When are you gonna review Earl&#39;s new single Grief 
Uh...fuck yeah 
all these comments are salty af¬†
theneedledrop¬†Really dude? MBDTF a 6 and this a 10/10? you done fucked up m8
Classic/Classic Kendrick gave us a Fantastic effort And quite frankly I don&#39;t know where he goes from here but where ever he goes I know its gonna have a stellar foundation to look down upon. To pimp a butterfly is a special record the funk/jazz/soul incorporated in this album amazing, the features fit perfectly and Kendrick more vulnerable than he has ever been delivering messages of righteousness, pain, power, and most of all truth within ones self and being afraid to stop air out insecurity which hinder all of us back from being what we want to be. 10/10 for me also Fantastic effort by Kendrick once again The bar has been set to moon and beyond let&#39;s see if other promising MCs can dare themselves face the challenge and seize the opportunity.
YES FANTANOOO!!! hahahaha<br>Quality review<br>&lt;3
Fantastic review.<br>Fantastic album.
Such a joy to watch this review. So much detail put into it. I&#39;m feeling a 10 on this review
A few of great tracks. But overall, I didn&#39;t really like it. It&#39;s not my cup of tea. I think I&#39;m too white. It&#39;s too long. Nearly 80 minutes. That&#39;s nearly as long as Pink Floyds The Wall. And that last track.... I&#39;ve listened to it all four times. Can safely say I won&#39;t go to the end again (unless I fall asleep with my headphones on). I give it 6/10.
Brilliant review for a brilliant album!
Shiet yall wanted the kendrick review then bitch about the score
I love all these ignorant punk ass half brained haters below. like they got anything going on in their lives that even compares to this album. eat a bag o dicks y&#39;all. nuthin but <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23fuckboys">#fuckboys</a>. grow some balls and like something for a change. real men know how to love. your ignorance is blinding you. as for the white guilt comments....blacks sold other blacks into slavery so your just as &quot;guilty&quot;. its time to clean up these fools.
He gave it a ten I can sleep happy now
Pretty much spot on. Even if you dont agree with the 10, you dont watch for the number you watch for what fantano actually SAYS.
nice detailed review! love this album! reminded my of the roots&#39; &quot;undun&quot; in the best way.
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=721">12:01</a>= a lot of the opinions that I&#39;ve seen so far...which is sad to me because the people who think that way are the people who probably need to open their minds up the most. Great review, Anthony. I agree with the rating and I think that this album will go down as a classic. Based on my personal tastes, I prefer it to GKMC. GKMC is great, too, but TPAB pulled my soul out of my body. It Shang Tsung&#39;d me.
First hiphop album ive seen n two yrs of watching these vids to get a fucking 10 !!!!!!!
this is a masterful fucking record. Anthony hit every nail on the head in this review.
People getting real mad that its a 10/10 lmao
Wow, I wasn&#39;t expecting a perfection score....if anything, the first two tracks were throwaways and the u song with the slurred speech verse was unsettling. I think this is Kendrick at the peak, but he can&#39;t do any better than this. He&#39;s reached the pinnacle now, and only 24 and up crowd can truly enjoy this album
Is that 3 10/10&#39;s now? Kendrick, swans and death grips?
this will go down as the most overrated album of all time.. shit is boring ass elevator music. kendrick needs to stop with these alien noices because were not on planet namek. slow ass music that I almost fell asleep too. fuck all that shit
It&#39;s the fucking catalina wine mixer üò≥
You don&#39;t make a 20 minute video for an album just to give it a 9. 
YEEEEAAAAAAHHHH!!!!
I feel like this is a record that I will respect but ultimately won&#39;t play very much.
Best review of ALL-TIME from Anthony Fantano
theretis ya&#39;ll. THERETIS
This Album was putting me to sleep. He&#39;s trying this jazz rap thing and it&#39;s not working most of the time. The blacker the berry was fire though. Good just nothing groundbreaking.
To Pimpthony a Butterflytano
fuck yea, 10 !!!!!!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1203">20:03</a> Shots fired haters
pretty accurate it has a good message
Lovin you is complicatEEEEED
Unsubsidebed
Fantastic album
I told him to give the TPAB a 10/10 and he actually did it! The absolute madman!!!!!
this is the best review you&#39;ve ever done anthony. feeling a strong 10 on this video too.
Great review!<br><br>HEY BATTY DRAKE GOT SHREEEEEEEEEEKT
10THANY 10TANO!!! IF YOU DONT GET WHY THIS ALBUM IS A 10 THEN GO LISTEN HARDER
A great review for such a great album.
God, purists are the worst. They can&#39;t even let &#39;the casual man&#39; enjoy a bit of music from &#39;their genre&#39;, if it&#39;s not exactly the music they like. It&#39;s quite immature, thinking that your taste in music is superior because you&#39;re &#39;hardcore&#39;. Every genre has those purists, but I have to say that never have I ever seen so many as in the online hiphop community. No offense to the community of course.
Fuck that, Kendrick get a pass that most rappers wouldn&#39;t period<br><br>While I agree with all the positive reviews and comments about it it definitely lacked in A WHOLE LOT OF AREAS.<br><br>The thing that sucks is you can&#39;t be mad at Kendrick for it though... After listing to the project you have to actually respect his vision and the fact that he goes so far left but still tell me that doesn&#39;t make an album listen the book or a good or a classic<br><br><br><br>I listen to this album thoroughly at work which I suppose is why people love Kendrick he doesn&#39;t care about night granted it was only one listen I heard every track from front to back don&#39;t get me wrong it is a solid project it&#39;s just not anything I was looking for personally
Y&#39;all are saltier than my girl&#39;s pussy
For all the people saying this album should have gotten a lower rating than he gave, need to kick rocks. It&#39;s his opinion, his review, his perspective on the album. He listens to alot more music than any of u, and for fuck sake this is his JOB. I&#39;m sure he knows more about reviewing albums than some of you pessimists. So, if u don&#39;t like the review, move on. No need to bash one mad because his opinion contradicts yours.
Where does K dot go from here tho, he could think of some crazy ass alien shit that gets an 11/10
üëåüí∏
i also thought that this was more like a visual stage show in my head than a rap album<br><br>a very powerful mechanic. good work Kendrick¬†
These comments are so dumb. Comparing TPAB to MBDF?  Apples and fuckin oranges dude.  And if THATS the album you choose to compare it to, you clearly don&#39;t get Kendrick or Fantano.
Fantanny be honest, did you fall out of your chair after the beat kicked in on Wesley&#39;s Theory?
this album is amazing
If you guys wanted to listen to something simlar to gkmc. something that is mostly rap and has bangers why didn&#39;t u guys buy rtj2???? there is plenty of that shit. people need to stop crying
Hmm, maybe you do get it. Just maybe. Now continue to spread the righteous for ALL.
ppl ride kendricks dick sooooooo hard lol..honestly.... this album was too gimmicky. It had a Positive/deep message, but not enough hard beats and raw spit. I like logics and joey badass album alot better. 7/10 being GENEROUS
Nice review.<br>Can&#39;t believe you managed to learn all of this about the album in such a short amount of time, I&#39;m still struggling lol. Well I guess that&#39;s why i&#39;m sitting here commenting and you&#39;re the one reviewing
i REALLY LOVED YOUR DETAILED REVIEW.....THANK YOU SO MUCH!!
Tf did you guys see him throw that paper at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=288">4:48</a> lol
ITS A 10!!!!! PACK YOUR SHIT FOLKS, LETS GO HOME!
 I KNEW IT I FREAKING KNEW IT!!!
A well fucking deserved 10
&quot;Guyz JCOLEZ album was so much better are you frickin kidding me?????? this gay kendrick album doesn&#39;t even have any bangerz&quot;
I&#39;ve been a fan of K.dot ever since he was on the xxl freshman cover from like 09&#39; and I absolutely adore his music as well with his new sound, but this album was a let Down. Def not a 10/10 but hey its just your opinion right?
WOOOOOOOOOOOOO 10/10 baby!!
Never thought I&#39;d live to see the day where Anthony gave a 10. Thank you, Based Fantano.
I&#39;m still mad you did Sean like that dawg
Now to wait and see if Jenny Death becomes the second 10/10 in less than a month.
This is not even a debate anymore. Kendrick is a top 5 all time and this album just proves it.
longthony reviewtano, the longest music nerd
Good Kidd Maad City is my favorite hip hop album ever. Having said that i ain&#39;t feeling To pimp a butterfly. Maybe because i don&#39;t know what its like to be a young black male and feel all the hate and the oppression. But I think this album will grow on me like Yeezus did.
People who say this album is wack or 6/10, what ever. They just cant dig the album, the theme, message, they just immature little boys, girls, trying to find senseless pathetic bangers. Advice, try to listen to album with brains, heart, throughout whole album. Really try to dig it. If u did not, then do not judge or put your opinion on here, keep bobbing your wack ass head, to wack ass music.
GKMC was mainly about his life in compton and thats basically it... Great project no doubt but TPAB touches of different psychological issues and social issues. this truly is greater at its fundemental intention.
He absolutely deserved it. 10/10. Awesome, Fantano.
Anyone calling this album a flop is nuts this may end up being his biggest album yet I couldn&#39;t be more proud for Kendrick  
A fantastic review of a fantastic album! 
Great fucking review. You summed up what I was thinking perfectly at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1195">19:55</a> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1210">20:10</a>. I can&#39;t believe people are just writing this album of straight away, simply because they just can&#39;t be bothered to look deeper into what is actually being said. I&#39;m sure if there was a Drake feature or J.Cole feature they&#39;d be happy.
I came in my pants when you said that number
OHSHIT
This review is a very strong 9. Not a 10 just because I still can&#39;t get into that wallpaper.
I&#39;m feeling a strong 9 . This album is definitely not as accessible as his previous works but it has so many layers that it rewards listening over and over again. I can see how it can be polarizing though...
I think the conversation with Tupac at the end of the record is really poignant and powerful. It&#39;s no secret that Pac is one of Kendrick&#39;s heroes (see the vid. of K. talking about having a vision of Pac for example). In a way he sees himself continuing Pac&#39;s legacy of social commentary and artistry, as well as feeling a connection to the struggles that Tupac faced while he was alive, hence Kendrick reciting the poem to him all along. Then when he recites the Butterfly poem...the next step of his life and career after the turmoil and struggle, the next step of his growth as a human being, ¬†he looks for guidance and thoughts from Pac only to realize that the ¬†struggles and the world killed Pac. That Tupac is no longer there...didn&#39;t have the opportunity to continue on the journey. powerful stuff.¬†
The album is amazing it has like a Spike Lee film feel to it. Nobody its making music this powerful not even J cole or Drake. This album is on a another level. And when he was talking to Pac i got goose bumps, that shit was eerie.
Anthony... The way that you explained the concepts in his album were beautiful, deep, analytical and just perfect AND NIGGAS STILL HATIN&#39; of the album?<br>the beats might not fit you but respect the fucking art man this shit is pure good intentions and knowledge. you wanted kendrick to spit some real shit so here is some REAL SHIT!<br>or make ur own review.. but you cant top this one,
Turns out White Men CAN Jump!
This is the first album I personally felt as a perfect 10 since MBDTF, and before that Madvillainy. This music is love
i also thought snoop sounds like slick rick on institutionalized
i wish i listened to the album before watching this
I can already foresee your yearly list of the best albums of 2015 is gonna be complete shit. 
Great review Anthony, thanks!
I don&#39;t get how people can simply ignore the lyrical content and call this record trash because they&#39;re (assumingly) put off by the unusual production. Great album.
best review of all time! perfect!
Actually the album starts with &quot;theneedledrop&quot; LOL
Shit, i didn&#39;t realize the end of the songs were part of a larger poem, I have to listen to it again now
all these people pissed fantano didn&#39;t like their favorite shit as much as they did lol
Do a track review on Earl Sweatshirts new single &quot;Grief&quot;
There we go, a 10/10 and it&#39;s surely well deserved.
I was pretty much Cal at the end of this video after what he said just before <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTmHuavOXNg&amp;t=1148">19:08</a>
I was so busy waiting Anthony to review this that I actually forgot to listen the album..
Fantastic decision :)
Those who say its anything under an 8/10, lack soul and appreciation for anything with substance. Go listen to gucci mane. Kendrick could pen an album of number 1 hits for you sheep but he has chosen the people! 
Melechesh - Enki
if you can&#39;t appreciate this album for what it is, then I&#39;m glad. you deserve to have &#39;no new kendrick to appreciate&#39; in your mind. imma just keep bumping this amazing album while some of you are salty and listening to drake.
Damn, I thought it would be released on the 23rd. This day cannot go any better. First I pass my drivers test and now this. I&#39;m buying this shit right now.
Good album kendrick is a genius looking forward to his next projects I love what Kendrick is doing for hip hop 
Damn Kendrick. Damn¬†
This one deserves the 10/10.<br>This is the only album a &quot;New Age&quot; rapper has put out from the West since Dre that I think really pushed the envelope of G-Funk and progressed it into something better. Hood Politics and How Much A Dollar Cost are straight works of art.
I think U, How Much a Dollar cost, King Kunta and Mortal Man are my favourites..<br><br>This album is already a classic 10/10!!
Kendrick Lamar dropped another best rap album of the decade!
Beautiful review Anthony. You did it perfect justice.
Cal should be in howard stern&#39;s wack pack
So much edge in this comment section. ¬†I don&#39;t think I can get out of here without a few flesh wounds.
THIS MAN GAVE A 10/10!!!!
Children&#39;s Story is my jam. You&#39;re pretty cool Slackthony Macktano. You gonna review the new Antwon when it comes out? You owe me.
Great project, great review. Its hilarious to read the itunes reviews of people who only know commercially viable hiphop! Its like kendrick tricked them with past singles then they went ahead and bought this and theyre losing their shit. They are saying its awful. Hilarious
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I think, Decent 8
TENTHONY TENTENO
TPAB and MBDTF are the two benmarks in hip hop this decade... period. J.cole, drake got some catching up to do. What an amazing album.
Thank you Anthony
Fucking awesome review.
Lol what? You ain&#39;t gotta lie was one of the best songs
About the basic, one-sided point of view: I saw a post about someone tweeting about The Blacker The Berry, how Kendrick is focusing too much about black-on-black crime rather than white racism. I felt like he was wrong and didn&#39;t listen to the whole album or the whole song even and you put it in words exactly
Anthony, is there such this as a 10/10 Southern hip-hop album?¬†<br><br>Does it exist?
Man, you really hit the nail on that Eminem influence on &quot;King Kunta&quot;. I felt like I was hearing a Eminem in his prime type of feel first time I heard the track, so definitely Marshall Mathers LP type of feel with the progression in the beat. Solid track, great album.
Wait, did Theneedledrop just put 14 tracks at favorites from a 16 tracks albums? Nice
I say cotdamn. I&#39;m speechless.
Lol finally you did a review, i was waiting for this shit
tupac is still alive
This kendrick lamar album deserved a 10/10!!!
the content of this review is really good, especially the second half.
THANKYOU IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS REVIEW!! &lt;3
I found it a really confrontational and painful listening experience. The struggle he puts himself through, all the forces pulling from him, seems to have put him in a deep depression. He suffers for and from his art and talent. I guess that&#39;s why I feel it is natural it is so jazz-laden. But I am not Black, I am not American, I was not born in the ghetto, nor am I now famous, so I do not have to shape myself and think about who and what I want to be for where I came from or where I want to go - and I found it really hard to connect to the overall content. And the music, to me, although it fits the album, is overall not dynamic and intense enough to really grip me. Especially in terms of transitions... But, yes: it&#39;s a masterpiece, and yes I probably agree that it&#39;s a 10. But probably not one I am going to be listening to a whole lot in its entirety.
this album will be lost on people who only listen to Hip Hop, it challenges these kids to expand their horizons, maybe it will inspire a 12 year old to pick up a Parliament record or a James Brown record. What a stellar album, kudos Kendrick
i was really hoping you wouldn&#39;t spoil the ending, Anthony
Review FROOT by MARINAAAA!!!!!!!
DOES THIS MEAN THE NEXT KENDRICK ALBUM WILL GET AN 11?? S.80 8/10 GKMC 9/10 NOW THIS 10/10
I&#39;m in full agreement. It&#39;s bold, emotional, ambitious, musically and lyrically dense - and most obviously from the reactions to this review - very polarising, which I think is a sign of a lasting album. I can tell I&#39;m going to be listening to this for a long time. <br><br>Right now, I&#39;m feeling a nine, because of some grating moments such as the &#39;we got the funk&#39; outro on king kunta, which just don&#39;t work for me. Also the inflection on Momma gives off an Elmo vibe that I can&#39;t really take seriously. StilI see no reason why i won&#39;t love this years down the line
TPAB = Stankonia¬†
Drake is cool....BUT TAKE THE L KENDRICK WON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
IT&#39;S A TEEEEN
watched the whole thing in 144p - worth it :D
Now let&#39;s see if we can get two 10&#39;s this year with Jenny death coming up 
I don&#39;t like rap, but fuck it, Anthony has sold me on this album.
THANK YOU!!!<br>THIS IS AN INSTANT CLASSIC
2015 GOAT
wow
Kendrick fans are in denial.
YES
you&#39;re no longer boo boo fantano. :)
But you wouldn&#39;t review big Sean&#39;s album. It wasn&#39;t that bad. 
I gave this album 1.5 on Rym. I don&#39;t like jazz.
White guilt: the album
This album is mind blowing 
To Drop A Needle
I get the meaning of the songs and how creative that is but what how repetitive the album was every song is that jazz Kendrick that people either love or hate I&#39;m don&#39;t think its a perfect 10 Tbh I don&#39;t care for the album but I guess the Kendrick fans is going to think its the greatest album every because they love anything he puts out.... Its a shame n 5 yrs he went from extremely underated to the most overated..... At least drake try to mix it up with his rap nd singing fans &amp; j Cole made an album that was great song by song but Kendrick album got no songs that hit beside alright and it really deserve a 10??? 
&gt;Anthony Fantano here
10/10 w/ the whole track list on the favs! u are my guy officially anthony <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23classic">#classic</a>
TPAB juts blew me away on first listen. Kendricks topics, his versatility, the FlyLo/Thundercat-esque music/beats. And even 2Pac is on this album. So what do you want more? Its perfect hybrid of Rap, Hip Hop, Funk , Soul, Blues and Jazz!¬†
The only review I was waiting for
Holy shit this is historical. Finally a 10/10
p4k 10/10 confirmed
This album blew me away. It was insane. I agree
Fatality!  You killed this review homie thanks üôè
This video gets a Strong 10
Thank you !!!
.....a 10???is this a joke?the album was like a solid 7.5
YES FANTANO YOU BIG DOG WE ALL HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
THE ABSOLUTE MADMAN
Okay I&#39;m sorry, this nigga is fucking biased to Kendrick Lamar. Don&#39;t get me wrong. Kendrick is a genius, arguably the best rapper out right now but this album isn&#39;t a 10/10. It&#39;s a solid 8-9/10. I can&#39;t believe you review hip hop albums so fucking poorly. You rated MBDTF a 6/10, T&amp;Y a 7/10, UP a 6/10 and yet drake&#39;s whack fucking mixtape - 8/10. Are you fucking serious? Don&#39;t get me wrong, Kendrick is fucking awesome but honestly T&amp;Y&gt;TPAB and TPAB is amazing. Please do not review hip hop albums. And to people telling me that &#39;it&#39;s his opinion, chill out&#39;, he&#39;s made it his job to review albums, and if he is shit at it that he should stop. If he has made this a full time occupation, he should do it properly. 
HOLY SHIT LOOOOOL
OMG
hey man!I love your reviews even when i disagree with you!i&#39;d love to hear your opinion in Torche&#39;s last album &quot;Restarter&quot;.
I am waiting for the vinyl version
Really didn&#39;t think this is as great as people say it us is. 5 out of 12 tracks were alright but the rest were average. It&#39;s mostly a mixture of hiphop with jazz and funk, I prefer pure hiphop albums imo
The white guilt is real
I love this album, and while the end &quot;interview&quot; with Tupac is cool, I thought splicing up interview clips was a bit disingenuous or maybe exploitative. What do you think?
Fuck. Respect nigga. I also think it&#39;s a masterpiece.
Holy shit.
Fuck, I&#39;m in class right now. I&#39;ll be sure to check this review out once I&#39;m finished here, lol. Looking forward to this one.
I think Kanye and Drake just went¬†back the studio to re do some tracks and verses.
Madeon - Adventure
10! THE HYPE IS REAL
You couldn&#39;t be more right.
YAY!
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS.
Wow, 10/10 sweet. Well deserved Fanthony Pantano
10/10 fuck yeah kenthony 
all the non Kendrick stans are bout to riot in your comments lmao
This album was one of the greatest experiences i&#39;ve ever had in all my years listening to hip hop. A bizzare, funky, jazz influenced trip but at the end so rewarding. This album has everything from originality to great production, real messages and a very mature Kendrick which seems to &#39;&#39;age&#39;&#39; like wine does. You can argue for days which album is better this or GKMC but at least respect an artist going entirely out of his confort zone and delivering such a satisfying result. The game lacks a fresh approach and we should all encourage when rappers take the extra mile and deliver something new.<br><br>I&#39;d give this album a strong 9. Way to go K-Dot.
Not even gonna look at the rating until it&#39;s done 
HOLY SHITTTTTTTTT. And I agree.
Wow was really expecting more of a Light to decent 9 coming from you Fantano but glad you gave it the score you gave it cause this album solidified Kendrick brought something refreshing, vibrant, experimental, unpredictable, dope beats and hard hitting lyrics.
Finally a 10 I loved  this album because he switched up from the style on Good Kid M.A.A.D city
bruh...
dope ass album....introducing Tony.......<a href="https://soundcloud.com/tonyemcee">https://soundcloud.com/tonyemcee</a>
ahhh<br>
No one should question theneedledrop when it comes to Hip Hop anymore.
THIS
this nigga trippin 5/10 at best
10/10 that&#39;s all that matters
jenny death when
That&#39;ll do Fantano, that&#39;ll do.
First. Finally its out
ayy lmao
The promised land.
OMG
WHITE GUILT
LETA GO
I let myself in

Cool.
First bruh.
GAME CHANGER
144p i think ill wait

I love you Anthony.¬†
27rd
